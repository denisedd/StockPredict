{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Caring About Tech News", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byBitsLook at all the sides Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are playing in self-driving. Through Waymo, Alphabet is building its own self-driving tech. But through its venture capital firm, Alphabet is also a huge investor in Uber. And it is also suing Uber. Also, through Waze, its mapping app, Google is running a car-pooling service that could compete with Uber. And now Waymo is partnering with Uber\u2019s biggest competitor.Isn\u2019t this exactly the sort of thing people complain about when they say Google is getting too big and powerful? In every way imaginable, Google is trying to use its huge power to completely dominate the future of driving tech.This is exactly why Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.Since our Federal Trade Commission seems relatively toothless in big tech acquisitions, methinks Facebook is going to face a lot of pain in the E.U. over the next few years. Keep an eye on that.But to be honest with you, the Google stuff reminds me of what I really wanted to talk about this week: I genuinely do not care about any of it.How do you stay passionate about tech news throughout this stuff? I find it difficult to do more than warm up microwave burritos every night for dinner and watch CNN for hours.Self-driving cars are a good example. Everyone in tech seems pretty sure that self-driving cars will change society in big ways, when they come. But when will that happen? Uber, Waymo, Tesla and others are locked in this existential battle for the future of transportation, but the battle is sure to be long, slow and unpredictable.We might have a sense of where self-driving tech is going next year, and a better sense the year after that, and an even better sense in five or 10 years. But at any given moment, a particular development in the industry is going to seem like pretty small ball, especially compared to the car crash of politics news.One thing I\u2019ve found is that chatting with folks in tech can be pretty therapeutic. A lof techies are relentlessly optimistic. Even when the world is falling apart, they can see some better version of the future, and they\u2019re working to build it. We journalists can get pretty cynical about the world, but being around techies does give me some sense, sometimes, that things could get better. Maybe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Announces $1 Billion Fund to Create U.S. Jobs in Manufacturing", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byOn Wednesday, Apple appeared to meet President Trump halfway.While it did not announce a new manufacturing facility with thousands of manufacturing jobs, Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, said it planned to dedicate resources to American job creation with a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the United States. The company said it would announce the first investment from its new fund later this month.In introducing the fund, Apple joined a growing list of companies that have said in recent months that they will add, promote or keep jobs \u2014 many of them related to manufacturing \u2014 in the United States.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.Some critics have suggested the Trump administration is too focused on manufacturing, as opposed to more quickly cultivating service occupations \u2014 in the leisure and hospitality or health care industries, for instance.But for the roughly two-thirds of Americans who lack a four-year college degree, manufacturing remains one of the few sectors that can deliver a middle-class income. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the typical factory worker earns more than $26 an hour, compared with $14 an hour for the average hotel and food services employee.Apple\u2019s focus with its new fund is on a slice of the industry known as advanced manufacturing. That is a catchall term, but typically it involves the production of high-value-added products in sectors like technology, aerospace, automobiles, sustainable energy and medical equipment. In some cases, that means making much smaller batches than mass-production-oriented assembly lines churn out, or using robotics and 3-D printing to create bespoke items.Mr. Cook\u2019s announcement of the new fund came midway through his interview with Jim Cramer of CNBC, when he was asked what he was doing to create jobs. Mr. Cook answered that Apple gave back in job creation and that the company had asked itself, \u201cHow can we get more people to do advanced manufacturing in the United States?\u201dMr. Cook did not address whether the fund was influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and statements on manufacturing.Asked by Mr. Cramer about working with the president, Mr. Cook said there were always issues to agree on and disagree on with any administration in any country. But \u201cyou look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don\u2019t,\u201d he said.Mr. Cook added that Apple would announce initiatives to support its current employees and add to their ranks, and to aid the software developers who make apps for Apple\u2019s phones, watches and computers.An Apple spokesman said he did not have anything to add beyond what Mr. Cook said during the interview.Katie Benner reported from San Francisco and Nelson D.

{"Headline": "Planning a Trip With the Help of Google Home", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byTest RunRoughly six months later, it\u2019s doing things it couldn\u2019t before, like tracking flight prices, giving directions and providing same-day updates on traffic to airports.The first and most important thing to know about Google Home is that while it speaks several human languages, it also has a language of its own.Google recommends starting each interaction with \u201cO.K., Google\u201d (\u201cHey, Google\u201d works as well), which will prompt the speaker into receiving a query properly. It will light up and flash its signals when it\u2019s ready.Patience is also crucial. If at first you don\u2019t succeed, it may not be because of what you\u2019re asking, but because of how you\u2019re asking it. For example:Human: \u201cO.K., Google, when does flight 3459 from Delta Air Lines arrive at La Guardia Airport?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not sure how to help. But my team\u2019s helping me learn.\u201dHuman: \u201cO.K., Google, when does Delta Air Lines flight 3459 arrive at La Guardia Airport?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cDelta 3459 from Pittsburgh to New York City is delayed and arrives in 32 minutes.\u201dI found this stage of my mock journey the most helpful and practical. Whether you need help deciding where to go or when to go there, Google Home has ideas.One of the neater tricks is asking it about what time of year is best to visit a city.Human: \u201cO.K., Google, when is the best time to visit London?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cAccording to Visit London, autumn is a lovely time to visit London, as the weather is mild (11 to 15 degrees Celsius)\u201d \u2014 52 to 59 Fahrenheit \u2014 \u201cand you can enjoy a variety of annual events, from Total Thames Festival to Halloween celebrations. To read more, look for the link in your Google Home App.\u201dOn my iPhone\u2019s Google Home app, there was a link to a visitlondon.com page with more details.Just ask it how much flights are to the city of your choice and give it your dates, and you\u2019ll get the current price and be asked if you want email updates when the price changes.Human: \u201cOK Google, how much are flights to Toronto?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cRound trip flights from New York City to Toronto leaving in two weeks start at $181. Do you have any dates in mind?\u201dHuman: \u201cMay 12th to May 15th.\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cRound trip flights from New York City to Toronto leaving May 12th and coming back on May 15th start at $215. I can keep track of the cheapest flights for those dates. Would you like to receive emails with updates?\u201dHuman: \u201cYes, please.\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cAlright, you\u2019ll receive an email if the price changes.\u201dI did get an email a few days later letting me know that cheapest flight was now $262.While you\u2019re finishing packing, looking for your passport and checking (twice) to make sure the burners are off, you can get a quick update on how long it might take to get to the airport.Human: \u201cOK Google, how long will it take to get to LaGuardia airport?\u201dGoogle: \u201cWith light traffic, it will take 8 minutes to drive to LaGuardia airport.\u201dThis sense of direction is not something Google Home had when it first came out, an example of its evolving capabilities. Before long you will also be able to book a car to the airport via voice, as the company says hands-free calls will be an option in the coming months.But when asking the assistant for directions, you do not yet get the detail you would if you were searching on Google Maps. When I asked Google Home how to get to La Guardia, it gave me only a general idea: \u201cvia 77th Street and Grand Central Parkway.\u201dSimilarly, if you\u2019re trying to get from Point A to Point B once you\u2019re in your destination city, Google Assistant gives you basic information, but it defaults to car directions, so you must specify how you want to get there.Human: \u201cO.K. Google, how do I get from the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto to the CN Tower in Toronto?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cAlright. The best way to get from Hockey Hall of Fame to CN Tower by car is via Front Street W and will take about 6 minutes in heavy traffic.\u201cHuman: \u201cO.K. Google, how do I get from the Hockey Hall of Fame to the CN Tower by public transport?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cFrom Young Street and Front Street West take 121 towards west, 121 departing in 5 minutes.\u201dGoogle will also give you the hours of operation if you ask, but cannot tell you what a ticket costs.At lunchtime, you\u2019re better off asking a local for recommendations or searching Google Maps the old fashioned way (on your smartphone).I asked Google where I could \u201cfind a good sandwich near the CN Tower in Toronto,\u201d and was given three highly-rated restaurants, but Sorella Sausages and Good Bite Restaurant were both roughly five miles away from CN Tower.This technology is still in its early stages, so unless you\u2019re already using Google Home as part of your daily routine, chatting with it is more of a fun thing for travelers to experiment with than a replacement for what you would normally use to help plan a trip. But the foundation is strong and its potential is exciting, and, as Google Home will sometimes tell you when it\u2019s stumped, it\u2019s \u201clearning more every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Takeout Addict Tries Clean Eating", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byMe TimeIt started with a favorite pair of white Rachel Comey jeans. Before the holidays, they buttoned; after the holidays, the top two buttons did not meet. I blame three different b\u00fbches de No\u00ebl.I am also a reluctant cook. I will gladly bake a berry crisp or grill salmon for friends on a Saturday night, but the very idea of boiling quinoa or putting together a halfway decent salad on a weeknight depresses me. I end up turning, like so many city dwellers, to takeout.But green curries and Cuban sandwiches were not going to get me into my clothes again, so I focused on delivery services offering healthy meals. For people like me who are too proud to say they\u2019re dieting and too busy (and hungry) for a juice cleanse, the idea that you can have several meals packed full of leafy greens and healthy fats prepared and delivered to your door in a two-hour window seems like the answer to a problem. Though a really expensive one.Breakfast was steel-cut oats with quince and cranberry. Could I make oatmeal myself? Yes. Do I like it better when someone makes it for me and tops it with various dried and stewed fruit? Yes! The following mornings I had mulberry ginger granola with Brazil nut milk and Mexican chocolate coconut yogurt. I awakened every day like a child on Christmas, so eager to eat something more exciting than toast.I wasn\u2019t as thrilled with the rest of the food. The kale chicken caesar with nutty herb croutons was easy to eat between meetings, but I\u2019ve had better kale salads. The lemongrass ginger chicken soup was well suited for lunch on an overcast day, but not quite enough to keep me full until dinner, which was wild mushroom shepherd\u2019s pie. At lunch on Day 3, I picked at my vegan caldo verde with focaccia (focaccia, for the record, doesn\u2019t translate very well sans gluten), fed the rest to my dog and ate a toaster waffle.I liked the amount of food and the variety of ingredients but was confused by the food philosophy. Everything was surely packed with nutrients, but some items were gluten-free (raw Mexican brownies) while others were not (chocolate zucchini muffins); some meals were vegetarian (mushroom beet and bean burgers over greens with baked sweet potato fries and sriracha aioli), while others contained meat (chicken enchiladas with red pepper sauce and avocado crema). If gluten isn\u2019t the enemy here, then may I at least have had a whole-wheat bun on my veggie burger?And I started to miss hot food. All of the deliveries come cold and can be eaten as is, although items like veggie burgers or shrimp can be plucked off their beds of greens to be heated up.It\u2019s also the company with the most lifestyle bells and whistles. Meals come with Beauty Water that contains rose and silica, a rooibos-based Detox Tea, a guide (\u201cGet excited for greens\u201d) and a stick of palo santo wood to burn. Included in my delivery was information on a new Level II program, which eliminates even more foods (nightshades, grains, nuts) and gives you broths for dinner. Masochists, I have found your new favorite way to detox!I don\u2019t go out of my way to order cold soups, but I gladly drank the honeydew gazpacho after a sweaty boot camp class. And Sakara\u2019s ni\u00e7oise had an \u201cegg\u201d molded from cashew and macadamia nuts that was so adorable I forgave the company for substituting adzuki bean tempeh for tuna.After my meal delivery foray was up, my skin looked dewier, I think. I stopped feeling as if I needed a two-hour nap after lunch. My digestive system was, without being too descriptive, doing a spectacular job.Not that I continued to live in my edenic state of clean living. I was all too excited to welcome cheese, wine and refined sugar back into my life, if in moderation. I never did manage to give up coffee for three days straight, but at least I drank it with almond milk.Having these meals delivered was maybe the first time in my life I didn\u2019t have an ambient concern about whether I was consuming enough vegetables. And eating a bowl of chickpeas and sweet potatoes felt a little like being at a spa, even if I was sitting at my kitchen table staring out at the rain.Meal deliveries may never be a viable way to eat all the time, but they work as a reboot to the system. A slight one, that is: My pants are only one button closer to fitting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At $495, Lonzo Ball\u2019s ZO2 Sneakers Have Tastemakers Saying No Thanks", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byAt the Flight Club sneaker store just south of Union Square on Thursday night, eager customers perused the gleaming shelves, hunting for classic kicks. The big names \u2014 the players whose signature shoes are most highly sought \u2014 are the ones you would expect: Kevin Durant, LeBron James and, even after all these years, Michael Jordan.At the time, the larger world was trying to wrap its head around the ZO2, Lonzo Ball\u2019s first signature shoe, which he had hours earlier announced in a video released to Slam magazine.While the shoe and the Ball family buzzed all over social media on Thursday, the sneaker intelligentsia were lined up in Flight Club\u2019s consignment area. These are the people who camp out on street corners to get first crack at new releases and then sell them to Flight Club for a cut of the subsequent resale. The leading edge of sneaker cool, they help decide which shoes will be on the shelves of Flight Club and stores like it 10 and 25 years from now. And they had reached a verdict on the ZO2: No thanks.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy those,\u201d said T.Q. Jones, who wore Nike Prestos as he waited in the consignment line.Haitham Khan \u2014 who was rocking a Comme des Gar\u00e7ons hoodie, a Supreme bag and blush-colored Common Projects sneakers \u2014 made a bold statement: \u201cI can answer your question: No one\u2019s going to buy them.\u201dThis conclusion matched those of industry experts, who nonetheless marveled \u2014 through laughter \u2014 at what Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising, labeled \u201cthe brazenness, the audacity, the ego\u201d of LaVar Ball, the father.Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at NPD Group, estimated Big Baller Brand would sell 10,000 pairs, which he described as a \u201crounding error\u201d given the 400 million pairs of shoes Nike made last year.\u201cIf you did it in snakeskin and pixie dust, it might cost $500,\u201d Powell added.Sneaker culture is shaped by substance as much as flash. Flight Club, for instance, prominently features sneakers linked to long-retired stars like Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing and Jordan not merely because those shoes are aesthetically pleasing, but because they are connected to incredible basketball talents.As Jones said of Lonzo Ball: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to be a star.\u201dThen, too, there are utilitarian concerns. At least in theory, basketball sneakers are for playing basketball in, and Big Baller Brand was not believed to possess the same kind of technology that makes the established companies\u2019 shoes user-friendly.\u201cI want to know how they perform,\u201d said Karl Leung, who wore Adidas sneakers as he waited in the consignment line. Adidas is known for its Boost foam, he noted, while Nike has its Zoom cushioning.\u201cI\u2019m wondering what\u2019s in the shoe that makes it a basketball performance shoe,\u201d Leung added.Someone who pre-orders ZO2s today would be guaranteed shipping, according to Big Baller Brand, by Nov. 24 \u2014 a hint, Powell suggested, at the six-month lead time typically required to make and transport new shoes.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to make a shoe,\u201d said Powell, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why you don\u2019t see hundreds of new shoe companies.\u201dIn an era in which marketing is conducted over social media and the loudest voice often carries the day regardless of what is being shouted, there is a certain logic to Ball\u2019s strategy of being consistently outrageous. (Big Baller Brand did not reply to a request to comment.)\u201cI\u2019m sure the brands all said, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re interested, we\u2019d like to pay him a couple million bucks,\u2019\u201d said Powell, pointing to the standard going rate for high draft pick rookies.\u201cThe revenue opportunity they\u2019ve had is now over,\u201d Powell added.In the ZO2 release video, which is set to a Drake track and features Lonzo Ball training in his shoes near his hometown, Chino, Calif., the namesake himself spoke in those terms, too, advocating \u201ca movement allowing us to be entrepreneurs, not just endorsers.\u201dThe analogy falls short, though, because Ball is not yet Marbury, much less Curry.It also does not help that Starbury shoes are deliberately inexpensive \u2014 some new ones start at $14.98 \u2014 while the ZO2s are, well, not.\u201cThis shoe,\u201d Dorfman said, \u201cmay be bought by collectors just to say that they had it.\u201dOr not. The Flight Club consignors dismissed even a proposal to shell out for ZO2s now on the off chance that everyone will be wanting them in a decade or so.\u201cI\u2019d rather buy lottery tickets,\u201d Leung said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Uber and Waymo Ended Up Rivals in the Race for Driverless Cars", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported bySo Mr. Kalanick spent much of 2015 raiding Google\u2019s engineering corps. To learn about the technology, he struck up a friendship with Anthony Levandowski, a top autonomous vehicle engineer at \u201cG-co,\u201d Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pet name for Google.The friendship developed into a partnership. Mr. Levandowski left Google last year to form Otto, a self-driving trucking start-up. Uber acquired it months later for nearly $700 million. Mr. Kalanick subsequently appointed Mr. Levandowski to run Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicle research.The implications are set to reverberate far beyond the courtroom. Any setback for Uber will shake up the driverless car industry, which is locked in a bitter race to introduce and commercialize autonomous cars. Silicon Valley tech titans and Detroit automakers are making huge investments \u2014 bets that autonomous vehicle technology will usher in a new age of how people get around. For some companies, especially traditional carmakers, their very survival is at stake.That aggressiveness has spurred an intense rivalry with Waymo. Waymo\u2019s legal pursuit of Uber and Mr. Levandowski is out of corporate character; Google has tended to refrain from suing former employees who move to competitors. Many at Google and Waymo are incensed at Mr. Levandowski and how he may have betrayed them for a rich payday, according to current and former employees.\u201cThis is a race where every single minute seems to count,\u201d said Carl W. Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, who has followed the Waymo-Uber case.Uber and Waymo declined to comment for this article.Uber and Google once considered each other allies. Google\u2019s venture capital arm, now known as GV, spotted Uber\u2019s potential early and invested more than $200 million in the fledgling ride-hailing network in 2013.David Drummond, then Google\u2019s chief legal counsel and an early Uber enthusiast, took a seat on Uber\u2019s board. At one point, Google promoted Uber as a transportation option in the Google Maps app, and Uber drivers relied on Google Maps.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.But the relationship crumbled as the two companies\u2019 paths converged. Google began testing its own car-pooling service inside Waze, a mapping app it owns. Uber eventually moved away from relying solely on Google Maps.Around then, the friendship between Mr. Levandowski and Mr. Kalanick deepened, according to people close to both men. After \u201cjam sessions\u201d between the two \u2014 essentially brainstorming meetings where they would walk and talk over the future of driving \u2014 Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pedometer would clock in with thousands of steps.Both men had little love for Google. Mr. Levandowski had grown impatient with the pace at Google\u2019s self-driving car unit, which was suffering from infighting and had been slow to move forward with some of its plans, according to two people familiar with Mr. Levandowski.Mr. Kalanick, meanwhile, had realized the growing threat from Google. Uber\u2019s reliance on Google Maps was making him nervous, especially after Google started \u201crate-limiting\u201d Uber\u2019s use of the service, asking Uber to pay for access over time.Mr. Kalanick also had a personal ax to grind with Mr. Brin. The night before the 2014 tech conference, Mr. Kalanick received a call from Mr. Drummond, who said Mr. Brin might raise the possibility of Google\u2019s dabbling in the ride-hailing market onstage the next day \u2014 a way to monetize autonomous vehicles \u2014 according to three people familiar with the conversation. Google stopped short of saying it planned to introduce such a service, but Mr. Brin showed Google\u2019s self-driving car.Mr. Kalanick was shocked at what he saw as a potential strike against Uber, according to people with knowledge of the event. He and Mr. Brin were supposed to clear the air at a private dinner that evening, but they spoke only briefly. After Mr. Brin\u2019s presentation, Mr. Kalanick later called Mr. Drummond to vent for what he considered an unexpected ambush from a friend and partner.In February of this year, Waymo sued Uber. Uber had crossed the line, Waymo said in legal documents, with Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up created as a way for Uber to steal trade secrets and copy its designs for lidar \u2014 short for light detection and ranging, a crucial hardware component in an autonomous vehicle.Before Mr. Levandowski left Google, Waymo claimed, he and other Google staff members who would become Otto employees took thousands of files of research, as well as valuable supplier lists, manufacturing details and other technical information. Mr. Levandowski then tried to cover his tracks, according to the complaint, wiping his laptop\u2019s hard drive of its data.The behavior could be traced to December 2015, Waymo said. At the time, Mr. Levandowski searched Google\u2019s network for login details for a document repository for the autonomous vehicle program, whose code name was \u201cChauffeur.\u201d He then installed software that let him download 9.7 gigabytes of data on Google\u2019s driverless car program. A few days later, Mr. Levandowski put a memory card into his laptop for eight hours, according to Waymo.Waymo discovered the deception inadvertently when it was copied on an email from a supplier, with drawings of Uber\u2019s design for its lidar. The designs bore a \u201cstriking resemblance\u201d to Waymo\u2019s designs, the company said.\u201cOtto and Uber have taken Waymo\u2019s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time and expense of independently developing their own technology,\u201d Waymo said in its lawsuit.On Monday, the federal judge in the case said Waymo had shown \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that Mr. Levandowski \u201cdownloaded over 14,000 confidential files before leaving the company.\u201d He ordered Uber to return any files to Waymo. The judge had separately referred the case to the United States attorney\u2019s office, raising the possibility of criminal charges for those involved.The case is headed to trial this year, but Mr. Levandowski is planning a break from the legal action. He and Eric Meyhofer, another Uber self-driving car executive, are discussing a trip to Indiana, according to two people familiar with the plans. There they intend to watch the Indianapolis 500 over Memorial Day weekend.Advertisement"}

In fact, those globalized companies \u2014 I\u2019ll call them International First companies \u2014 have outperformed America First companies by a wide margin.Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, ran the numbers at my request.

The group includes retailers like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Target, railroads like CSX and Norfolk Southern, and regional natural gas and petroleum companies like Southwestern Energy, Range Resources and Pioneer Natural. All of their fortunes are determined mainly by events and policies within the United States.While each stock has its own story, Mr. Hickey said he found a clear pattern in the overall data. From the presidential election on Nov. 8 through this past Tuesday, he said, shares in the International First group gained an average 13.56 percent, compared with only 8.15 percent for the America First shares, for a spread of 5.41 percentage points.Why have the internationally oriented companies outperformed the domestically focused ones? Several factors explain the discrepancy.First, the initial wild enthusiasm in financial markets for Trump policies faded.\u201cThere was a lot of optimism by people in the markets about America First policies right after the election,\u201d Mr. Hickey said, \u201cbut in 2017 in actual terms, that has been completely flipped.\u201dSoon after the election, when the Trump rally in the overall stock market had the most momentum, the America First companies did outperform the International First group. The markets may then have been reacting to Mr. Trump\u2019s publicly stated views, which he summarized in his inaugural address this way: \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our product, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\u201dAmerican companies with little foreign exposure maintained an advantage in the stock market until mid-March, when the tables turned and the International First group pulled ahead.More precisely, measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar peaked in strength on Jan. 3 \u2014 with a 6.53 percent gain since the election \u2014 and then began to plummet. On Thursday, the dollar was still stronger than it had been on Election Day, but by less than 1 percent.Some of that decline may have been simple mean reversion, a tendency of markets to return to an average level after a big move. But there was more to it than that.Domestic problems \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s political struggles, and Congress\u2019s inability to enact major legislation \u2014 may have led the stock market to ignore the Trump agenda. That helps globalized companies.\u201cYou don\u2019t hear much about America First policies these days,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut it\u2019s becoming clear that even if you don\u2019t get thorough tax policy reform done or a big infrastructure stimulus program done, the stock market isn\u2019t falling apart. Instead, the stocks that are leading the market now are not America First plays, they are international plays \u2014 companies geared toward international exposure that benefit from a weaker dollar and better growth overseas.\u201dThen there is the tax question. Despite the political turmoil in Washington, tax cuts and a possible windfall for the International First companies remain on the table. The administration still aims at repatriating at least some of the $2 trillion in stranded overseas corporate cash and ending the taxation of newly minted corporate profits earned abroad. Market analysts are already calculating the potential benefits to companies with substantial foreign earnings and big cash hoards, like Apple.Put all of that together, and you get a recipe for a rally in International First companies. America First may be the administration\u2019s slogan, but for the most part, the stock market has been ignoring it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Networks Offer Taste of TV\u2019s Ad Future. Marketers Are Hungry for More.", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingAmerica\u2019s biggest television networks invited advertisers to New York institutions like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center last week, giving them an early glimpse at their fall lineups and treating them to lavish parties and a parade of stars including Stephen Colbert, Kim Kardashian and Tony Romo, all with the aim of attracting billions of dollars in advertising by the end of the summer.The tradition dates to the 1960s, when viewing habits were entirely different. And while the networks have spent the past few years trying to convince marketers of their digital prowess despite falling ratings and new platforms for watching TV, Silicon Valley seemed to cast an especially long shadow this year.\u201cMost networks are starting to recognize that the standard model of 18 minutes of 30-second spots in a 60-minute show will never grow and is probably not sustainable,\u201d said Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer at the agency OMD. \u201cJust making more compelling shows is not going to solve that problem.\u201cThat goose continues to lay golden eggs; they\u2019re just smaller every year,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cThis is the same challenge the record companies had: How fast do you shift to a new model at the risk of your existing, lucrative one?\u201dTurner Broadcasting, which owns channels like CNN, TBS and TNT, especially impressed advertisers with its presentation. The company emphasized its willingness to experiment with new, longer formats for traditional commercials and said it would continue to reduce the number of ads it runs during shows. It is risky to cut back on ad inventory, especially as ratings decline, but the company contends that doing so creates a better viewer experience and more effective, engaging commercials.Turner also highlighted its new data and audience-targeting collaboration with its rivals Viacom and Fox Networks Group and the number of video-on-demand rentals its properties commanded in the first quarter.\u201cI was really kind of blown away by Turner,\u201d said Lou Paskalis, an executive at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who oversees paid media investments. He said the company\u2019s presentation, as well as some of the new advertising ideas discussed by Fox Networks Group and CBS, addressed the major concern that he and other marketers shared: How do you compete for consumers\u2019 attention, especially as they move to block ads and turn to platforms like Netflix, where running commercials is not an option?\u201cIf the consumer\u2019s in control, you have to figure out how to adapt your consumer experience to the device they\u2019re going to consume your content on,\u201d he said.The Fox group also discussed a new system for measuring the effectiveness of ads on its online properties to help marketers determine which versions to use just hours later on traditional TV.That fits into a broader narrative in the TV industry, in which executives have long complained that as Americans increasingly watch shows on an array of devices, and do so outside the three- or seven-day windows that are now measured, networks are not getting full credit for their total audience figures.Joe Marchese, Fox Networks Group\u2019s new ad sales chief, dismissed Facebook\u2019s claim that it could offer advertisers a \u201cSuper Bowl on mobile every day,\u201d saying that the number of video ad minutes available in Fox\u2019s prime-time broadcasts \u201cdwarf\u201d those on YouTube and Facebook.Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal\u2019s ad sales chief, expressed skepticism that people \u201cliking\u201d an ad or product on Facebook actually led to sales. And Les Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, cited Amazon, Apple and Google as companies that, like the network, were \u201call about mass audience\u201d while noting that all three also paid to advertise with CBS.Still, the new ideas about advertising did not dominate the presentations, in part because the concepts are still evolving but mostly because the traditional way of selling TV ads remains the biggest moneymaker for the networks.\u201cThe statement used to be \u2018digital pennies for TV dollars,\u2019\u201d said Mike Law, executive vice president for video investments at Amplifi, Dentsu Aegis Network\u2019s investment arm. \u201cNow it may be digital nickels for TV dollars, but the vast amount of revenue these networks are generating is coming from TV. In a marketplace we think will be down a little bit in spend volume, networks getting their fair share of revenue is critical to them.\u201dThat may have to change, particularly now that networks have given marketers a taste of new possibilities. Mr. Paskalis of Bank of America, for one, was left wanting more.\u201cThe thing I\u2019d like to see the most, frankly, is even more focus on user experience and opportunities for marketers to join the conversation around the programming than just advertise adjacent to the programming,\u201d Mr. Paskalis said. He offered examples like creating polls in advance for marketers to run related to particular plot developments in scripted shows and allowing brands to sponsor limited commercial interruptions.\u201cHow can marketers do more to add to the experience,\u201d he said, rather \u201cthan just be the tax you have to pay to enjoy the experience?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Google Took Over the Classroom", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Education DisruptedThe tech giant is transforming public education with low-cost laptops and free apps. But schools may be giving Google more than they are getting.Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 The sixth graders at Newton Bateman, a public elementary school here with a classic red brick facade, know the Google drill.In a social-science class last year, the students each grabbed a Google-powered laptop. They opened Google Classroom, an app where teachers make assignments. Then they clicked on Google Docs, a writing program, and began composing essays.Looking up from her laptop, Masuma Khan, then 11 years old, said her essay explored how schooling in ancient Athens differed from her own. \u201cBack then, they had wooden tablets and they had to take all of their notes on it,\u201d she said. \u201cNowadays, we can just do it in Google Docs.\u201dIn the space of just five years, Google has helped upend the sales methods companies use to place their products in classrooms. It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google\u2019s products to other schools. It has directly reached out to educators to test its products \u2014 effectively bypassing senior district officials. And it has outmaneuvered Apple and Microsoft with a powerful combination of low-cost laptops, called Chromebooks, and free classroom apps.Today, more than half the nation\u2019s primary- and secondary-school students \u2014 more than 30 million children \u2014 use Google education apps like Gmail and Docs, the company said. And Chromebooks, Google-powered laptops that initially struggled to find a purpose, are now a powerhouse in America\u2019s schools. Today they account for more than half the mobile devices shipped to schools.In doing so, Google is helping to drive a philosophical change in public education \u2014 prioritizing training children in skills like teamwork and problem-solving while de-emphasizing the teaching of traditional academic knowledge, like math formulas. It puts Google, and the tech economy, at the center of one of the great debates that has raged in American education for more than a century: whether the purpose of public schools is to turn out knowledgeable citizens or skilled workers.The director of Google\u2019s education apps group, Jonathan Rochelle, touched on that idea in a speech at an industry conference last year. Referring to his own children, he said: \u201cI cannot answer for them what they are going to do with the quadratic equation. I don\u2019t know why they are learning it.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t ask Google for the answer if the answer is right there.\u201dSchools may be giving Google more than they are getting: generations of future customers.Google makes $30 per device by selling management services for the millions of Chromebooks that ship to schools. But by habituating students to its offerings at a young age, Google obtains something much more valuable.That doesn\u2019t sit well with some parents. They warn that Google could profit by using personal details from their children\u2019s school email to build more powerful marketing profiles of them as young adults.\u201cMy concern is that they are working on developing a profile of this child that, when they hit maturity, they are able to create a better profile,\u201d said David Barsotti, an information technology project manager in the Chicago area whose daughter uses Google tools in elementary school. \u201cThat is a problem, in my opinion.\u201dMr. Rochelle of Google said that when students transfer their school emails and files to a personal Google account, that account is governed by Google\u2019s privacy policy. \u201cPersonal Gmail accounts may serve ads,\u201d he said, but files in Google Drive are \u201cnever scanned for the purpose of showing ads.\u201dGoogle, a unit of the $652 billion Alphabet, is the latest big contender in a decades-old battle among tech companies to hook students as future customers. \u201cIf you get someone on your operating system early, then you get that loyalty early, and potentially for life,\u201d said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource Consulting, a research company.Google captured these next-generation users so quickly by outpacing its rivals in both educational product development and marketing.In 2013, while other tech firms seemed largely content to sell their existing consumer and business offerings to schools, Mr. Rochelle, a co-developer of Google Docs, set up a team at Google to create apps specifically for schools.10 Photos\u201cTeachers really helped to drive adoption of Google in the classroom, while Apple and Microsoft continued to leverage traditional sales channels,\u201d said Phillip DiBartolo, the chief information officer of Chicago Public Schools.But that also caused problems in Chicago and another district when Google went looking for teachers to try a new app \u2014 effectively bypassing district administrators. In both cases, Google found itself reined in.Mr. Bout said that student data in Google\u2019s core education services (including Gmail, Calendar and Docs) \u201cis only used to provide the services themselves, so students can do things like communicate using email.\u201d These services do not show ads, he said, and \u201cdo not use personal data resulting from use of these services to target ads.\u201dSome parents, school administrators and privacy advocates believe that\u2019s not enough. They say Google should be more forthcoming about the details it collects about students, why it collects them and how it uses them.\u201cIf my daughter came home and logged on to Google Docs on my computer at home, they\u2019ll know it was now coming from this address,\u201d said Mr. Barsotti, the Chicago-area project manager. \u201cIf this is truly for educational purposes, what is their business model and why do they need to collect that?\u201dMr. Casap quickly persuaded university officials to scrap their costly internal email service (an unusual move at the time) and replace it with a free version of the Gmail-and-Docs package that Google had been selling to companies. In one semester, the vast majority of the university\u2019s approximately 65,000 students signed up.And a new Google business was born.This became Google\u2019s education marketing playbook: Woo school officials with easy-to-use, money-saving services. Then enlist schools to market to other schools, holding up early adopters as forward thinkers among their peers.The strategy proved so successful in higher education that Mr. Casap decided to try it with public schools.\u201cThat caused the same kind of cascade,\u201d Mr. Casap said. School districts around the country began contacting him, and he referred them to Mr. Nelson, who related Oregon\u2019s experience with Google\u2019s apps.By then, Google was developing a growth strategy aimed at teachers \u2014 the gatekeepers to the classroom \u2014 who could influence the administrators who make technology decisions. \u201cThe driving force tends to be the pedagogical side,\u201d Mr. Bout, the Google education executive, said. \u201cThat is something we really embraced.\u201dAlthough business practices like encouraging educators to spread the word to their peers have become commonplace among education technology firms, Google has successfully deployed these techniques on a such a large scale that some critics say the company has co-opted public school employees to gain market dominance.\u201cCompanies are exploiting the education space for sales and public good will,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, the president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm. Parents and educators should be questioning Google\u2019s pervasiveness in schools, he added, and examining \u201chow those in the public sector are carrying the message of Google branding and marketing.\u201dMr. Bout of Google disagreed, saying that the company\u2019s outreach to educators was not a marketing exercise. Rather, he said, it was an effort to improve education by helping teachers learn directly from their peers how to most effectively use Google\u2019s tools.\u201cWe help to amplify the stories and voices of educators who have lessons learned,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it can be challenging for educators to find ways to share with each other.\u201dAt Chicago Public Schools, the teacher-centric strategy played out almost perfectly.\u201cWe were bootlegging using Google apps,\u201d Ms. Magiera recalled in a phone interview. \u201cI just knew I needed my kids to collaborate,\u201d she said, touching on one of Google\u2019s own main arguments for its products.Chicago administrators like Lachlan Tidmarsh, then the school district\u2019s chief information officer, visited Ms. Magiera\u2019s classroom to observe. Mr. Tidmarsh said he concluded that if individual teachers were already using Google\u2019s services, the district should officially adopt the platform \u2014 to make sure, for instance, that younger children couldn\u2019t email with strangers.Ms. Magiera\u2019s advocacy came at an ideal moment. Chicago Public Schools was looking to trim the $2 million a year it was spending on Microsoft Exchange and another email service; it had opened bidding for a less expensive program.Quickly, though, a data privacy and security issue emerged, exposing a culture clash between Google\u2019s business practices and a major school district\u2019s values.Instead, Google initially proposed abiding by its own company policies, Mr. Wagner said, and followed up by emailing links to those policies \u2014 terms that the company could change at any time. \u201cOur lawyers were a little bit apoplectic when they were given links to security things,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a link that can change.\u201dMr. Nelson, the former education official in Oregon, reported similar frustrations over student privacy when his state negotiated a contract with Google. \u201cThat\u2019s why it took 16 months,\u201d he said.Mr. Bout of Google said that the tech company had \u201calways taken the compliance needs of our education users seriously.\u201d He added that \u201ceven early versions\u201d of the company\u2019s agreements for its education apps had \u201caddressed\u201d the federal education privacy law.Today, Google\u2019s standard agreements with schools for its education apps include a commitment to comply with that law.Since adopting Google apps, Chicago schools have saved about $1.6 million annually on email and related costs, a district spokesman said.\u201cWe were always enthusiastic to tell the Google story,\u201d Mr. Tidmarsh said. \u201cI would like to think dozens of school districts switched, based on our success.\u201d(Ms. Magiera has since occasionally worked as a paid speaker for education technology organizations that train teachers on Google\u2019s tools.)\u201cYou can see it radiate out from certain geographic hubs, and that is very deliberate,\u201d Mr. Bout said of Google\u2019s growth strategy for education. \u201cWe are taking a very geographic approach because we know it works.\u201dBy then, Google had developed a simplified, low-cost laptop called the Chromebook. It ran on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system and revolved largely around web apps, making it cheaper and often faster to boot up than traditional laptops loaded with locally stored software.But there was one interested audience: public schools. In the fall of 2011, Google invited school administrators to its Chicago office to meet Mr. Casap, hoping to interest them in Chromebooks.Mr. Casap didn\u2019t talk tech specs. Instead, he held the audience spellbound as he described the challenges he had faced as a Latino student growing up on welfare in a tough Manhattan neighborhood.His message: Education is the great equalizer, and technology breaks down barriers between rich and poor students.In the audience, Jason Markey, principal of East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Ill., was converted. Students in his blue-collar district near O\u2019Hare International Airport faced similar struggles. On the spot, Mr. Markey said, he abandoned his previous plans to buy Microsoft Windows laptops for 3,500 high school students. Now he wanted Chromebooks for them instead.\u201cI went up to Jaime immediately after the presentation and said, \u2018Are you guys ready to ship these?\u2019\u201d Mr. Markey said.Then Mr. Markey went back to his district to inform administrators and teachers that he wanted to order an unproven device that most of them had never heard of. \u201cIt was a tough announcement to make,\u201d he conceded.It was an opportune moment for Google to pitch lower-cost laptops to schools. Districts administering new online standardized tests needed laptops for students to take them on. And Google offered a robust way for districts to manage thousands of computers online: They could lock Chromebooks remotely so that students could not search the web during tests, or disable missing ones.Another attraction: The Chromebook\u2019s cloud-storage approach made sharing among students easier. They could gain access to their documents no matter which Chromebook they used.\u201cThat is one of the big reasons we took off in education,\u201d said Rajen Sheth, who oversees Google\u2019s Chromebook business. \u201cIn less than 10 seconds, a student can grab a Chromebook and be off and running.\u201dThe Chromebook\u2019s price and usability fit neatly into Mr. Casap\u2019s argument that, for students, access to technology was an issue of fairness. \u201cI didn\u2019t want us to be vendors in the space,\u201d he said of Google\u2019s education philosophy in an interview last year at the SXSWedu conference in Austin, Tex. \u201cI wanted us to be thought leaders, to have a point of view.\u201dAs he spoke, a group of students trooped past wearing purple superhero capes emblazoned with the logo for Microsoft OneNote, a rival classroom service. Spotting the capes, Mr. Casap said, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d He added dryly, \u201cI love gimmicks.\u201dSome critics, though, contend that the equity argument for technology is itself a gimmick that promotes a self-serving Silicon Valley agenda: playing on educators\u2019 altruism to get schools to buy into laptops and apps.\u201cIt centers learning on technology, not students,\u201d said Mr. Fitzgerald, the learning app analyst. \u201cIt is a very narrow lens on equity that leaves out things like student-teacher ratios.\u201d(Mr. Casap said he would not advise school districts with deficiencies in areas like teaching or student support services to invest first in classroom technology.)Mr. Markey, the East Leyden High School principal, had another equity concern. About 20 percent of his students lacked home internet access, he said. How would they do their homework on a Chromebook, which required a connection?Google was already working on offline capabilities, Mr. Casap said, and ultimately modified its education apps so that students could take their work home on Chromebooks, then upload homework the next day using school Wi-Fi.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever remember when a specific device and platform has taken off so quickly across different kinds of schools,\u201d said David Andrade, a K-12 education strategist at CDW-G, a leading Chromebook dealer.In 2014, Google\u2019s education juggernaut hit a speed bump in Chicago Public Schools. The culture clash illuminated profound differences between Google, a build-it-first-and-tweak-it-later Silicon Valley company, and a large, bureaucratic school district with student-protection rules to uphold.At the time, she was the school system\u2019s director of technology change management. Early on, she said, Google had invited teachers to try an initial version of Classroom, without first contacting the school district\u2019s technology administrators \u2014 effectively making a district policy decision from the outside. Now Google wanted Chicago Public Schools to switch on the app districtwide, she said, before determining whether it complied with local student-protection policies.\u201cYou can\u2019t just hand out product and hope it will work in the classroom,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. \u201cYou have to work with the districts to make sure that you are keeping the kids and the teachers safe.\u201dJim Siegl, technology architect for Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, the nation\u2019s 10th-largest school district, reported a similar experience.He said that Google had directly contacted certain Fairfax teachers who had volunteered to beta-test Classroom, giving them early access to the app. In so doing, he said, the company ignored the Google settings he had selected that were supposed to give his district control over which new Google services to switch on in its schools.Mr. Siegl added that Google did not tell him which, or even how many, Fairfax teachers the company had enlisted to try out the Classroom app. And by the time he was able to shut off the app, Mr. Siegl said, teachers had already set up virtual classrooms on the service and started using it with their students.He said he complained to Google.\u201cBecause of who they are and how sprawling the ecosystem is,\u201d Mr. Siegl said, \u201cthey are held up and need to meet a higher standard than any other vendor schools deal with.\u201dIn an emailed statement, Mr. Bout said of the company\u2019s core education services, \u201cIn all cases, the use of these services is tied to the approval of an administrator who is responsible for overseeing a school\u2019s domain.\u201dClassroom was the brainchild of Mr. Rochelle, who started Google\u2019s education apps group, and Zach Yeskel, a Google product manager and former high school math teacher. They said they envisioned the app as a kind of \u201cmission control\u201d dashboard where teachers could more efficiently manage tasks like assigning and correcting homework, freeing teachers to spend more time with students. To create the app, they collaborated closely with teachers.\u201cThey developed a real momentum with teachers,\u201d said Mr. Fisher of Futuresource Consulting. \u201cGoogle Classroom was key to that.\u201dThat was too fast for Chicago Public Schools.Administrators there wanted to test Classroom first to make sure it complied with district policies and fit their teachers\u2019 needs. So they set up a pilot program, involving about 275 teachers and several thousand students, to run for the entire school year. Every month, Ms. Hahn said, she collected teachers\u2019 feedback and sent it to Google.\u201cWe wanted to help them do it right,\u201d Ms. Hahn said.One immediate problem administrators identified: School board policy required employees to keep records of cyberbullying and other problematic comments. But Classroom initially did not do that. If a student wrote something offensive and a teacher deleted it, there was no archive.\u201cIt took us a long time to get them to do it,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. She added, \u201cUnfortunately, there were things that a district of our size needed that Google did not understand.\u201dGoogle eventually added an archiving feature. The next fall, the Chicago district switched on Classroom. Teachers there later vetted other Google products, effectively becoming a test lab for the company. \u201cWe have said to Google many times, \u2018If it works in Chicago, it will work anywhere,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hahn said.Mr. Bout of Google agreed, saying that Chicago Public Schools often made more stringent demands on Google than other school districts did.\u201cIf you can get it in Chicago, it\u2019s sort of like you have passed a lot of tests,\u201d Mr. Bout said, \u201cand then you can probably get it into any school in the country.\u201dThe relationship has benefited Chicago Public Schools, too.Today, about 15 million primary- and secondary-school students in the United States use Classroom, Google said.Google\u2019s ability to test its products on such a monumental scale has stoked concerns about whether the tech giant is exploiting public-school teachers and students for free labor. \u201cIt\u2019s a private company very creatively using public resources \u2014 in this instance, teachers\u2019 time and expertise \u2014 to build new markets at low cost,\u201d said Patricia Burch, an associate professor of education at the University of Southern California.Mr. Rochelle, the Google executive, said that it was important for the company to have large, diverse sets of educational users giving feedback \u2014 otherwise it might develop products that worked for only a few of them.\u201cOur goal is to build products that help educators and students,\u201d Mr. Rochelle said. \u201cTeachers tell us they appreciate the opportunity to get involved early and help shape our products to meet their needs.\u201dMs. Hahn, who now works for the same health care company as Mr. Tidmarsh, agrees. She said that schools were getting something substantive in return from Google, something they had rarely received from other tech companies: quick product improvements that responded to teachers\u2019 feedback.After the Chicago schools tested Classroom, she said, members of Google\u2019s education team started directly contacting her when they were seeking educators to try out the company\u2019s innovations. \u201cThey no longer just turn stuff on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come to us first.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Apple said it spent $50 billion last year with American suppliers, although it manufactures just one product line, the nearly obsolete Mac Pro, in the United States.Underscoring the political implications of the Apple-Corning deal, Mr. McConnell joined executives from the two companies at the formal announcement at the 65-year-old plant on Friday afternoon.\u201cLike millions of people around the world, the last thing I look at at night and the first thing I look at in the morning is my iPhone,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cUnlike millions of people around the world, I think of Harrodsburg, Ky., and this amazing Gorilla Glass that you guys make here.\u201dMr. McConnell said there was a lot that Congress could do to help Corning and Apple be even more successful.\u201cWe are going to try, through comprehensive tax reform, to make both of these corporations be in a better position to compete with other companies in other countries,\u201d he said.Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said that when Apple\u2019s founder, Steven P. Jobs, showed a prototype of the first iPhone on stage in 2007, it had a hard plastic face. Mr. Jobs complained that it scratched too easily in his pocket and ordered Mr. Williams to replace it with scratch-proof, shatter-resistant glass by the time the phone went on sale six months later. Such glass did not exist except in the lab, but Corning scrambled to get it into production.\u201cIt all happened here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you,\u201d Mr. Williams told the assembled workers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Giving the Behemoths a Leg Up on the Little Guy", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtEvery year, the internet gets a little less fair. The corporations that run it get a little bigger, their power grows more concentrated, and a bit of their idealism gives way to ruthless pragmatism.And if Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, gets his way, the hegemons are likely to grow only larger and more powerful.This column is nominally about network neutrality, the often sleep-inducing debate about the rules that broadband companies like Comcast and AT&T must follow when managing their networks. But really, this is a story about ballooning corporate power.Which brings us to net neutrality. The rule basically prevents broadband providers from offering preferential treatment to some content online \u2014 it blocks Comcast from giving, say, a speed boost to a streaming video company that can afford to pay over one that cannot.The fight over network neutrality is often seen as a battle between telecom companies and internet companies \u2014 between fat-pipe providers like Comcast (which stand to make some money by charging for priority lanes) and digital innovators like Google (which might have to pay up). As a matter of lobbying, the two sides are definitely in opposition: Broadband companies cheered Mr. Pai\u2019s speech, while the Internet Association \u2014 a group that represents dozens of large and small internet companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 opposed it.So the better way to think about the rules isn\u2019t in terms of what these companies do, but rather in terms of size. Does ending network neutrality help the big fish or the little fish? Will scrapping the rules make the internet fairer, more dynamic and more innovative? Will it create a more favorable atmosphere for potential challengers of the Frightful Five?Probably not. In fact, it could entrench their power even further.But today, Mr. Wu sees neutrality rules as having a broader purpose \u2014 protecting innovators not just from broadband companies, but also from the internet giants that now rule the network.Excerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\u201cIn the earliest days we were trying to save companies like YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s as much about trying to save the net from YouTube as it is about saving YouTube.\u201dBut Mr. Wu points out that at least the giants now have to do something to respond to rivals. In the absence of neutrality rules, all they might have to do its buy up access to speedy lanes online, thus easily preventing rivals from ever working well on people\u2019s phones.\u201cSnapchat has grown up in an era of network neutrality, and I think Snapchat owes some of its existence to net neutrality,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t been able to destroy it yet, and they would have had an easier job in a non-net-neutrality world. The question is, will Facebook and Comcast be able to join together and gang up on a future Snapchat?\u201dThe internet giants \u2014 who, remember, are in favor of neutrality rules \u2014 don\u2019t exactly agree that the rules also help keep the internet giants in check. But they do agree that the rules could help start-ups.\u201cInternet companies of all sizes believe that the current F.C.C. net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,\u201d Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said in an email. He added: \u201cSilicon Valley, since its birth, has held to the belief that the best ideas can compete and win in the marketplace. Consumers and the internet ecosystem benefit when start-ups can leapfrog incumbents, and net neutrality is key to preserving this ethos.\u201dMeanwhile, opponents of network neutrality argue just the opposite \u2014 that removing the rules would actually strengthen start-ups.\u201cThe big companies are already getting huge speed advantages because they\u2019ve built out massive online infrastructure,\u201d said Bret Swanson, who studies telecom policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cBut the upstart that doesn\u2019t have the massive infrastructure and doesn\u2019t have tens of billions of dollars to build it, that company could use things like paid priority to enter this competitive market.\u201dIn other words, if broadband companies start taking money to speed up certain content, start-ups could use that offer to make their content just as fast as that of any tech giant.Well, maybe. Mr. Swanson\u2019s theory rests on the assumption that the new rules would not permit unfair practices. If Google, Facebook or some other giant offered a broadband company millions to block a rival\u2019s service, Mr. Swanson said that could trigger antitrust investigations and other negative consequences for the behemoth.\u201cThe basic antitrust and competition laws will still be applicable, and so companies couldn\u2019t just exclude rivals in this way,\u201d he said.I\u2019m less sanguine. American regulators have shown a near total lack of interest in pursuing tech giants \u2014 and most other companies \u2014 on anticompetitive issues. It does not look like that\u2019s going to change under President Trump.The giants seem likely to keep getting bigger. If we give them a chance to buy up every fast lane online, we\u2019ll be removing another check on their untamed power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Engineer Barred From Work on Key Self-Driving Technology, Judge Says", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber, the ride-hailing company, sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts on Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the program.But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading the program, be prohibited from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology for the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper Uber\u2019s development efforts.The decision was in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google\u2019s parent company. The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies, automakers and start-ups.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Over the last few months, Uber and Waymo have traded barbs and legal maneuvers to gain the upper hand. Waymo accused Mr. Levandowski of downloading thousands of its documents and using the findings at Uber. Mr. Levandowski decided to plead the Fifth Amendment in the case, exercising the right against being compelled to incriminate himself.In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said, \u201cWaymo L.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files from Waymo immediately before leaving his employment there.\u201dHe added, \u201cSignificantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession of Waymo\u2019s confidential files.\u201dJudge Alsup also ruled that Waymo significantly \u201coverreached\u201d when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets.\u201cGeneral approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not \u2018secret,\u2019 since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees,\u201d Judge Alsup wrote.He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowski\u2019s hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files to Waymo, including the possibility of terminating Mr. Levandowski\u2019s employment at Uber.Federal court order in Waymo\u2019s case against Uber.\u201cCompetition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions,\u201d Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWe welcome the order to prohibit Uber\u2019s use of stolen documents containing trade secrets developed by Waymo through years of research, and to formally bar Mr. Levandowski from working on the technology.\u201dDespite the judge\u2019s ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.\u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around lidar,\u201d Niki Christoff, an Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement.Judge Alsup\u2019s ruling followed his decision on Thursday to deny Uber\u2019s request to send the case against Waymo to arbitration. The judge set a series of deadlines in the next two months for Uber to produce additional evidence before the case moves to a public trial.Legal specialists who are following the case questioned whether a day in court is the best course of action for Uber.\u201cI think Uber has to seriously consider whether they even want to have that trial, or whether they\u2019ll be able to settle it,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia. \u201cIf you read between the lines, it\u2019s pretty clear the judge hints at some wrongdoing by Uber, and he wants to see more evidence which could come in at the trial.\u201dUber and Waymo are unlikely to appeal the ruling given that the case is continuing, legal specialists said. Neither company may want to risk a worse outcome.Yet current and former Uber employees said Mr. Levandowski remains a dominant force. In last month\u2019s memo, Mr. Levandowski said Eric Meyhofer, a principal at the research facility, would assume leadership of the autonomous vehicle efforts, reporting to Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Levandowski and Mr. Meyhofer are close, and Mr. Levandowski continues to oversee all projects outside of lidar development, said three current and former employees, who insisted that their names not be published, citing fear of retaliation.Uber declined to comment on Mr. Levandowski\u2019s current duties or on internal matters.Advertisement"}

That has often led to claims by tech executives that the region has an anti-American bias, accusations that European policy makers deny.Facebook, experts say, is only the latest in a long line of Silicon Valley companies to face European regulatory anger, though this time, the focus is likely to be on the reams of online data gathered, including information that Facebook collects on both its users and nonusers through third-party websites.While Facebook started in the United States and has expanded aggressively across the developing world, its actions in Europe \u2014 and the response to those acts by local officials \u2014 are likely to have implications on its global operations.The company\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin. Though that is mostly for tax purposes, it gives European data protection and antitrust officials wide scope to monitor and police Facebook activities involving its more than 1.5 billion users outside North America.In the past, for instance, Facebook has been forced to alter its privacy settings for all of its users worldwide after European privacy campaigners brought legal challenges to how the social network collected and used people\u2019s data.The changes come as policy makers worldwide vie for influence over how people use digital services, including potentially putting limits on how companies like Facebook operate so as to exert some control over the internet.\u201cIt was inevitable that there would be this type of struggle,\u201d Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, said in an interview last year. \u201cThe internet is not used to national borders.\u201dAfter Facebook announced last year that it would use WhatsApp data to bolster its wider advertising business, American privacy campaigners filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, putting forward similar arguments to those made against the partnership in Europe.\u201cU.S. antitrust law has failed to keep up with the digital economy and the emergence of monopoly services,\u201d Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said in an email. \u201cThere is far too much \u2018lock in\u2019 with a dominant provider, and far too much consolidation of personal data.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And consumers often have an incentive to switch between competing services, based on convenience and price.Not only are these titans vulnerable to regular existential threats (recall Microsoft\u2019s unbreakable hegemony over PC software that didn\u2019t translate to mobile computing), they are also all converging \u2014 therefore competing \u2014 with one another.It is easy to see how commentators get worked up about Facebook, given it controls several large, overlapping networks including WhatsApp and Instagram. But the claim that it has a monopoly over content providers, is risible. Even if Facebook were the singular acquirer of content, that would make it a monopsonist, not a monopolist. This distinction is critical because a monopsonist \u2014 who is the only buyer for a given set of suppliers \u2014 uses its power to squeeze input prices (like the sole employer in a town, keeping wages low). Whereas a monopolist uses its power to raise consumer prices.Facebook\u2019s importance as a major traffic source for many content sites is self-evident, but publishers still go directly to consumers and use other significant intermediaries \u2014 notably Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The woes of the publishing industry are because of the impact of the internet, not Facebook.Mr. Thompson unconvincingly asserts that Facebook\u2019s power over publishers produces a \u201cdead weight loss\u201d (where monopoly taxation leads to a waste of resources) and that consumers are afflicted by Facebook\u2019s stifling of innovation. But Facebook users are not suffering under the yoke of oppressive masters. On the contrary, they are benefiting from a period of intense competition.The same applies when it comes to entertainment. Netflix isn\u2019t one of the big five, but it enjoyed a brief honeymoon as a monopoly after it crushed Blockbuster. But just a few years later, it faces intense competition around the globe. While the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, may say that \u201csleep\u201d is his company\u2019s major rival, in reality, Amazon and Alphabet \u2014 not to mention Hulu, HBO and myriad local players \u2014 prevent Netflix from running away with the market.For diapers, dog food, videos, music, cloud-computing services, voice technology and so forth \u2014 it faces extreme competition from other tech companies, not to mention traditional retailers. Walmart alone is still four times its size in retail (albeit much smaller online). In video and music, Amazon is an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix and Spotify. And in cloud computing, Amazon faces serious competition from Alphabet and Microsoft and others, which offer similar services, also on a grand scale.It is blindingly obvious that traditional retailers are suffering. But holding Amazon responsible for the decline in brick-and-mortar retail is like blaming Craigslist for the death of print classifieds. The natural gravitational pull of the internet caused those problems, not one company.While almost all of the hand-wringing about tech monopolies is overblown. The player that perhaps warrants the closest scrutiny today is Alphabet, and in particular its Google search engine.Google\u2019s overwhelming dominance of search (it has 90 percent market share in United States search revenue) is particularly critical given search\u2019s centrality to the web\u2019s commercial ecosystem. Google, however, has not been sensitive enough in handling its power \u2014 especially with its history of bringing the fight to smaller, narrowly focused rivals, like Yelp in the local reviews market. Its strategy in certain verticals resembles the old survival maxim: First, eat what the monkey eats, then eat the monkey.However, as consumers continue to migrate to mobile, neutrality matters less. Mobile carriers already use \u201czero rating\u201d (whereby certain services don\u2019t count toward data caps) to advantage their own content (or that of their partners). And unlike in fixed broadband, consumers are afforded some protection by the real choice they have in mobile carriers.Plainly there is no cause to be Pollyannaish. It\u2019s sensible to be wary of acquisitions and potential overreach. And there may be specific cases that cross the line and should be reined in. Over all though, the kind of competition we see among Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft tends to sort things out naturally and brutally.The only surefire winner from this battle is the consumer.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He has an interest (directly or indirectly) in a large number of tech companies \u2014 including several firms to which he refers, and those that both partner with and compete against them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fabulous Apple Cash Machine", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byStrategiesGreat things are expected of the most valuable company on the planet.Apple, which has a world-beating market capitalization of $776 billion, is still meeting those expectations, but barely. And that could cause headaches down the road for investors and for the stock market as a whole.Apple shares, among the most widely held in the world, hit a new record on Friday, yet the company\u2019s sales have been so-so and no new game-changing gadgets other than a revamped iPhone are in sight.In a nutshell, after a stumble in 2016, Apple started to grow again late in the year and continued to do so in the first three months of this one, but not by much. Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier \u2014 a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won\u2019t restore Apple\u2019s old reputation as a paradigmatic \u201cgrowth company.\u201dYet Apple\u2019s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what\u2019s the problem? It is simply that Apple\u2019s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone.A major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers?It may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple\u2019s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I\u2019m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados, though I\u2019m not one of them. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years.\u201cApple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it\u2019s not growing much. It\u2019s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.\u201dOn Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple\u2019s already colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion.In the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other American company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S & P Dow Jones Indices.But there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced on Tuesday that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp.In a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple\u2019s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple\u2019s shares and total value, Apple\u2019s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple\u2019s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise).Furthermore, in the next two years, Mr. Maestri said, the company intends \u201cto return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.\u201dAll of which is to say that if Apple\u2019s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors.The fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Mr. Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company.Apple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know how much we need to invest in the business,\u201d Mr. Maestri said in the conference call. \u201cWe will never underinvest in the business. We\u2019re in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple\u2019s shares, which are now trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because \u201cwe\u2019ve found that Apple\u2019s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.\u201d Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said.Like Mr. Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. \u201cThe company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it\u2019s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive.Mr. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view. Back in February, when Apple shares were still trading at $130, he calculated Apple\u2019s value based on metrics like cash flow and declared that the company was \u201cfully deserving of its market value.\u201d But when the stock price reached $140, he sold his own shares. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great company,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the price.\u201dIt isn\u2019t a crazy price, not if you expect that Apple will remain disciplined and highly profitable and, maybe, even have another growth spurt next year. But unless the old Apple magic returns, the company right now is not a bargain.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

Are we a stark-white, sterile, oddly cheery, computer retail experience?The other day, as I walked out of my family\u2019s Victorian rowhouse in the Bloomingdale neighborhood, I encountered a horde of people standing outside. They were wedged between a huge Dumpster and the 1895 rowhouse next door, where my former neighbor Ms. Maxine used to live, which is now being converted into luxury condos. They were listening to a lecture by a middle-aged blond woman on how to invest.I began discreetly chatting with a member of the crowd, who was standing with his foot planted on my garden retaining wall, when one of the organizers, a smartly dressed black woman, walked up to me.\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are filming. Could you please walk around?\u201dI gave her the nastiest glare I could muster. \u201cI live here,\u201d I spat out.The blond woman paused her presentation and put her a finger to her lips. \u201cShhhhhh,\u201d she said.\u201cShe\u2019s a neighbor,\u201d the black woman said, and cupped a hand over her mouth, adding softly, \u201cangry.\u201d\u201cAngry\u201d is not the right word. More like disoriented. Thrown off balance. Recently, after a meeting downtown, I was walking near the old Washington Post headquarters, where I worked for years. The corner of 15th and L Streets in Northwest, an intersection I once knew well, had been reduced to rubble in preparation for yet another new development. I no longer knew right from left. I had to stop someone to ask for directions.The novelist Marita Golden, my fellow panelist at the Carnegie Library, has a new book, \u201cThe Wide Circumference of Love,\u201d that has found the right metaphor for this disorientation: The mind of one of her characters is being consumed by Alzheimer\u2019s as Washington is undergoing its transformation. When he walks onto the street at the corner of 14th and U and sees new high-rise condos and white people, he can\u2019t tell whether his mind is playing tricks on him.Longtime white residents are also struggling to identify with the place. I have been running with a white friend, Lauryl, for more than a decade in a running club. She teaches high school English. She has had enough of recent changes in Washington, too, though she herself is a transplant from Los Angeles. She\u2019s moving to New Orleans. \u201cWhen I walk outside my house, these people don\u2019t speak,\u201d she says of the newcomers.It\u2019s true. I have given up on trying to introduce pedestrians to my neighborhood\u2019s friendly ways. More than half of them, it seems, are tourists renting Airbnbs.Change, of course, is the most organic thing about cities. Renewal and growth are exciting \u2014 they are why so many of us, my family included, put up with the many indignities and inconveniences of city life, living so close to our fellow humans.But change without respect for the past is pernicious. The stories about the lives here are the most precious resource we have. Those potential investors in front of my house are poorer for never having gotten the chance to meet Ms. Maxine, who grew up in that house, which her father bought with his wages as a Pullman porter. Or the previous owner of my house, Mrs. Alvarez, who raised eight children there, in addition to her rose bushes, which I still care for. Or all the other black women who raised their families, swept the sidewalk immaculate each day and served as the neighborhood watch.One day, we all get replaced by the next shiny thing. The Carnegie Library building will soon offer the latest phones and laptops. But our stories will never be obsolete. That\u2019s what makes a city a place with a beating heart and not just a container for replaceable parts.Natalie Hopkinson, an assistant professor of communication, culture and media studies at Howard University, is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cA Mouth Is Always Muzzled: Six Dissidents, Five Continents and the Art of Resistance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But unusual expectations for the 10th anniversary iPhones, due in September, may have worsened the slowdown.\u201cPeople are waiting to see what\u2019s going on with the new iPhone,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. \u201cApple needs to make sure the next phone has that \u2018wow\u2019 factor.\u201dThat will be particularly important in China, the world\u2019s largest smartphone market, where revenue fell 14 percent in the three months that ended April 1. The continuing poor results there dragged down brisk sales elsewhere, Apple executives said.\u201cWe gained market share in almost every country that we track,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, focused on several bright spots during a call with investors. Services grew 18 percent to $7 billion, and Mr. Cook said that customers were paying for 165 million active subscription services from Apple and third parties.\u201cApple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cOur active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits.\u201dApple is awaiting the outcome of tax policy discussions in Washington. President Trump has proposed a major cut in the corporate tax rate and has suggested he would favor a reduction in taxes for money that American corporations hold abroad.The company had $257 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of April 1, and analysts estimated that about 90 percent of it was stashed overseas.A tax cut would be \u201cvery, very beneficial,\u201d Mr. Maestri said, but Mr. Trump\u2019s plan remains vague and has not yet been introduced as legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for us to speculate at this point in time what might happen,\u201d he said.Apple\u2019s stock, which closed at a high of $147.51 on Tuesday, fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading once its results had been released.Apple raised the amount of money it was willing to commit to stock buybacks by $50 billion, and Mr. Maestri said that it would continue to buy despite the record price. \u201cWe really believe there is a lot of value in our stock,\u201d he said.Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., also raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent to 63 cents a share.Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said investors, too, are awaiting new iPhones. \u201cWhat\u2019s baked in the share price is a massive upgrade cycle,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Going Digital to Rescue Food", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byFixesLike many people in America, I went to Trader Joe\u2019s on a recent Sunday. Unlike other shoppers, though, I parked around the back near the loading dock and hauled away seven trash bags and cartons stuffed with food the store wasn\u2019t going to sell. Seven minutes later, I pulled up at the side entrance of a men\u2019s homeless shelter, rang the bell and watched as two staff members unloaded the food.That was fun.So later in the week, I did it again, this time on foot in New York City, as part of a group that rescued surplus fried chicken and biscuits from a restaurant and delivered it to a nearby emergency family shelter.At the same time, one out of eight American households don\u2019t have enough to eat.Wasted food. Hungry people. How do we get the two to meet?One answer is: Create an app. Just as Airbnb connects producers and consumers of short-stay housing, and eBay connects producers and consumers of, well, everything, new apps can connect stores and restaurants with soup kitchens, pantries and shelters that need their excess food. And apps can also organize volunteers who make the deliveries by car, bike or foot power.Now Feeding America matches donors and recipients with an algorithm. A restaurant can go on Meal Connect to post an offer of, say, eight trays of fried chicken and biscuits. Meal Connect will automatically match that offer with the closest food pantry or soup kitchen that can get it up right away.Diana Aviv, Feeding America\u2019s chief executive, said that Meal Connect makes it possible to rescue prepared food and smaller quantities of food \u2014 and to do so quickly. \u201cThis allows us to provide real hot meals \u2014 virtually at the same time that someone coming off the street and paying for it would get it,\u201d she said.Food rescue in America began in 1981, when Helen verDuin Palit, a soup kitchen manager in New Haven, ordered potato skins at a nearby restaurant. She asked the chef what he did with the insides of the potatoes, and he told her he threw them out. \u201cWe could really use those potatoes,\u201d she said. The next day, the soup kitchen received 30 gallons of cooked potatoes.The next year, Palit founded City Harvest in New York.Today, City Harvest rescues and delivers 55 million pounds of food a year, most of it fresh produce. New York City has 1.4 million people who can\u2019t put food on their table. It\u2019s not clear how many of them eat because of City Harvest, but it\u2019s a lot.Perishable food then goes directly to food pantries, soup kitchens and mobile produce trucks that park in food-insecure neighborhoods. The organization has 22 refrigerated trucks, including two tractor-trailers. Nonperishable foods and excess perishables \u2014 a truckload of apples, for example \u2014 go to the 45,000-square-foot food rescue facility in Queens, where they are divided up.City Harvest is a New York phenomenon. New York is dense \u2014 a City Harvest truck may need to drive only 50 miles in a day, Sposato said. The city has an unusual quantity of fancy food and events featuring food. And in New York, City Harvest can raise the $28 million per year (in addition to $95 million in donated food) necessary to run all this.For what else needs to happen, we can turn to John Oliver. Here\u2019s his story on food waste from 2015.Misfits is run by Robinson Fresh, a giant wholesaler of all kinds of fruit and vegetables. The company buys cosmetically undesirable produce and sells it to retail chains: at the moment, the Midwest-based Hy-Vee and Meijer, and the New England-based Hannaford.Jim Lemke, president of Robinson Fresh, said that while some chains are receptive to Misfits, others worry about how to manage it internally. \u201cThere are questions around how do we segregate this? How do we catalog them and differentiate them? We\u2019re using lots of different experiments to figure out the most efficient way.\u201dAll 242 Hy-Vee stores feature a Misfits bin in the produce section, with playful, colorful signage advertising bags of tasty but funny-looking peppers, squash, cucumbers, oranges, apples, pineapples and other produce, sold at around a 25 percent discount. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised with sales,\u201d said Brett Bremser, Hy-Vee\u2019s executive vice president of perishables. \u201cThe biggest challenge has been educating consumers. They\u2019re used to searching through the aisle to find the perfect orange.\u201dOne advantage for Hy-Vee, he said, is that its stores are in so many Midwestern farming communities. \u201cOur customers understand agriculture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey totally get that this product could have ended up in a landfill.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Frightful Five: They\u2019ve Got Us", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtA few weeks ago, I bought a new television. When the whole process was over, I realized something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction \u2014 figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so \u2014 I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon.It wasn\u2019t just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 percent of my household\u2019s commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What\u2019s more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children.This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there\u2019s a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison.This is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large \u2014 to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche.So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column\u2019s companion quiz.The Big Five tech companies increasingly dominate our lives. Could you ditch them?When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy \u2014 but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialize online using Twitter, Apple\u2019s messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal.Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don\u2019t normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft\u2019s word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I\u2019d hate to lose it.It\u2019s when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It\u2019s here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we\u2019ve come to depend on them.In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can\u2019t fathom living without it. Without the world\u2019s best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes \u2014 email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I\u2019d need after ditching Apple \u2014 I\u2019d be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992).And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life.When the kids were born, it became my household\u2019s Costco \u2014 supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?Which brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks.One evening three days after I\u2019d ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner.If such a future makes you blanch, that\u2019s the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you\u2019re right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behavior \u2014 a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t patronize Amazon.But if it\u2019s not Amazon for you, it\u2019ll be another of the five. Or, more likely, it already is. It\u2019s too late to escape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump: Hazardous to Our Health", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Will Donald Trump\u2019s presidency get rotted out?Steve Jobs might have said so.Back in 1995, when the tech god was between gigs at Apple, when he had learned a thing or three about leadership by being snaked out of his own company by John Sculley, he gave an interview positing that empires could crash and burn if the emphasis was on sales rather than product.\u201cThe companies forget what it means to make great products,\u201d Jobs said. \u201cThe product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies who have no conception of a good product versus a bad product. They have no conception of the craftsmanship that\u2019s required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. And they really have no feeling in their hearts usually about wanting to really help the customers.\u201dIn \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump said that playing to people\u2019s fantasies and promising the greatest product was \u201can innocent form of exaggeration.\u201dBut it\u2019s one thing when you do that for condos and cologne and mattresses and steaks. It\u2019s another for life-or-death health care policy.Trump has twice pushed to pass disgraceful health care bills without even trying to grasp what\u2019s in them \u2014 or more important, what\u2019s not in them. He couldn\u2019t care less that the dog\u2019s breakfast served up by the House on Thursday wounds the struggling Americans he had promised to lift up.It is \u201csomething terrific,\u201d as he vowed, but only for the superrich who are getting a Marie Antoinette wealth transfer at the expense of health care for the poor.The president feted his fake-news \u201cwin\u201d in the Rose Garden, sprinkling flimflam dust to deflect from his ludicrous legislation. Paul Ryan slobbered over Trump\u2019s leadership even as the Senate made plans to shred the House bill and start over.\u201cHey, I\u2019m president,\u201d Trump told his sycophants, or in this case, sickophants. \u201cCan you believe it, right?\u201dNo, I can\u2019t.In a moment of clueless cynicism, hours after the ego festival in the Rose Garden, Trump sat in a tuxedo with the Australian prime minister on the Intrepid and said Australians have better health care than Americans \u2014 harking back to his old statements in support of universal health care.Presidents have to be good salesmen. Barack Obama faltered because he hated selling and simply lectured. He even outsourced the job of selling his re-election bid at the 2012 convention to a former antagonist, Bill Clinton.Hillary was not good at salesmanship either. The new book \u201cShattered: Inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s Doomed Campaign,\u201d reports that at one point, her 2016 team got so flummoxed at her inability to explain why she wanted to be president that they actually considered the slogan \u201cBecause It\u2019s Her Turn.\u201dTrump did care about his product when he built Trump Tower. He obsessed over every detail of a building that was the flashy emblem of New York bursting out of the dark \u201970s and into the booming \u201980s.\u201cBut the success of that went to his head and he never cared again,\u201d his biographer Tim O\u2019Brien told me. \u201cHe\u2019s fundamentally lazy. He free-rides so many processes he doesn\u2019t know anything about. He used to do it in the business world, and now he does it in the political world.\u201cHe\u2019s not a student of anything other than protecting his image. What he cares about is how he\u2019s perceived, not the nuts and bolts of things. He is essentially a performance artist.\u201dWhen Trump talked to John Dickerson for \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last Sunday, he said the big difference between business and politics was that in Washington, \u201cyou really need heart, because you\u2019re talking about a lot of people. Whereas in business, you don\u2019t need so much heart. You want to make a good deal.\u201dBut with health care, Trump wanted to make a deal so badly he was heartless. One Republican senator, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, said that he would not vote for a health care bill that does not pass \u201cthe Jimmy Kimmel test\u201d: \u201cWould the child born with a congenital heart disease be able to get everything he or she would need in that first year of life?\u201dThe House Republicans just wanted Trump off their backs. They had never pulled a real bill together because they thought Hillary would win and they could just snipe at her. The Irish undertaker and his crew were so desperate to prove they had not totally forgotten how to pass anything that they were willing to go with garbage. And Ryan wanted to save the bacon \u2014 or bratwurst \u2014 of his fellow Wisconsin buddy Reince Priebus, blamed by Trump for the first health care defeat. After that debacle, The Times reported, Trump started merging the two names into one mocking \u201cRyan-ce.\u201dBut in delivering this win for Trump, they may well have delivered a way for Democrats to take the president down. The Democrats could win the House back and get their investigative machinery cranking. The Cook Political Report has now downgraded the 2018 re-election chances of 20 House Republicans.Trump cares only about optics, and yet he and Ivanka, his glossy shield on women\u2019s issues, do not seem to realize the bad optics of a viral photo of a crowd of guys applauding themselves for gutting health care protections for women.The Republicans now have a pre-existing condition: They voted for something that will cause them a lot of pain in the future.Advertisement"}

But in tech, your personal data is a ripe resource for businesses to harvest in their own interests.In addition, Uber was involved in some deception of its own: It participated in fingerprinting, a process in which iPhones were tagged with permanent identities that were detectable even after the Uber app was erased from the devices. The practice violated Apple\u2019s terms of service, which could have resulted in Uber\u2019s being banned from the App Store. Uber eventually revised the app to remove the fingerprinting code.For consumers, giving up some data has become part of the trade-off of receiving compelling, personalized services. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be caught by surprise. Here are some tips from privacy experts on protecting yourself from tricky data collection.When you sign up for a new app or web tool, the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service. To avoid a privacy pitfall like the one involving Unroll.me, start perusing the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, opt against using the service.\u201cPeople quickly run into the challenge that there\u2019s so much legalese that it\u2019s up to you to envision how your data may be used,\u201d Ms. Sandvik said. Still, it\u2019s better than reading nothing.For many companies, the path to monetization is anonymized, aggregated user data. That means while your name will not be attached to the information, your age, gender, shopping activities and location will all be rolled up with other users\u2019 data. Altogether, that becomes incredibly valuable information to many retailers looking for market research.So before subscribing to a free app or online tool, take a moment to do a web search for the company\u2019s business model.It\u2019s worthwhile to periodically check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them.On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled \u201cConnected apps & sites.\u201d And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under \u201cSettings and privacy.\u201d Ms. Sandvik recommended pruning apps that you don\u2019t recognize or have not used in the last six months. Once you have narrowed down the list, take a deeper dive on the ones that remain and read up on how they use your personal data. If their data-sharing practices sound offensive, remove the apps.Do this audit at least once a year: The number of connected apps on your online accounts can pile up over time. On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps. After removing many unused or defunct apps, like LivingSocial, Words With Friends and Draw Something, I had 32 left.Deleting your app from your phone or computer often isn\u2019t enough. You\u2019ll remove data from the device itself, but not from the company\u2019s servers.Even after doing that, you will have to reconcile with the idea that the company will probably hold on to the information you have already shared.

The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.In a sign that they had buried the hatchet, Apple and Nokia also announced that they had signed new business agreements: Apple will begin stocking some of Nokia\u2019s digital health products in its stores, and the Finnish company will provide some of its mobile network infrastructure products and services to the American company.\u201cWe are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,\u201d Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement.The legal battle between Apple and Nokia had highlighted the continuing role that the Finnish company \u2014 once the world\u2019s largest seller of mobile phones \u2014 has in the industry, despite its devices having been outmuscled by those of Apple and Samsung.Like Ericsson, another European technology company that owns multiple patents that are widely used in Android and Apple phones, Nokia avidly guards its intellectual property, which has become a mainstay of the company\u2019s annual revenue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With New Echo Speakers, Amazon Lets You Ask Alexa to Phone Mom", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byNow Amazon wants you to do more than talk to Alexa. It also wants you to call friends and family through Echo speakers \u2014 and it is even putting a screen on one of the devices so you can see them while talking to them.On Tuesday, Amazon introduced the latest model in its expanding family of Echo products, the Echo Show, which has a seven-inch touch screen and a video camera that let people place video or voice calls to each other over a Wi-Fi connection. In a move that could have broader impact, Amazon also said it would release a free software update this week that brings voice-calling features to existing Echo devices.The changes, which thrust Amazon into the crowded landscape of internet communications tools like Microsoft\u2019s Skype, Apple\u2019s FaceTime and Google\u2019s Hangouts, underline the company\u2019s ambitions for the Echo. In a way, the new communications functions turn the speaker into something like a traditional landline telephone, which many people have given up in favor of smartphones. Rather than pulling a phone out of their pockets, people will be able to simply command their Echoes to call someone.The goal is to make the Echo, and Alexa, even more of a fixture inside people\u2019s homes \u2014 a system that can help you shop online, control your home\u2019s temperature and, now, converse. And it allows Amazon to once again chart a path ahead of others with how it is using the speaker.\u201cAmazon now has a huge first-mover advantage,\u201d said Werner Goertz, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm.Amazon said it planned to release the Echo Show in late June, with a starting price of about $230 for a single device, or two for $360.According to eMarketer, more than 35 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month this year, more than double the number from last year.Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said its Echo products were part of a category of \u201cambient computing\u201d \u2014 devices that can be controlled in a communal setting, like inside a home or a car, primarily with voice.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be compelled to go and interact with the screen \u2014 you should be able to do it with your voice,\u201d Mr. Limp said in a product briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from traditional computing as we\u2019ve known it for the last three decades.\u201dYet there are obvious limitations to devices that rely entirely on voice interfaces, which the Echo Show is intended to address.The screen on the device adds the ability to stream videos, show lyrics while playing music, and display calendar events and voice-dictated text messages to other Echo users. Displaying movie showtimes and other lists on a screen, as the Echo Show can, is more convenient for users than Alexa reading them.\u201cI think Echo Show fits very well in the kitchen,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies.The catch is that for now, the only people an Echo user can call are other Echo owners, or anyone with an Alexa app on an iPhone or Android device. Mr. Limp said there was no technical limitation that would prevent Amazon from connecting a phone number to an Echo device that would allow them to be reached by people with telephones. But he declined to say whether Amazon intended to offer that capability.Because the Echo can be used only as a speakerphone, it also is not likely to be used for private calls when others are present in a room. Ms. Milanesi said she was skeptical about whether Echo could supplant smartphones for voice calling.\u201cWe\u2019re so used to using our phones,\u201d she said. \u201cFinding a reason to use Alexa for that is harder. They need to give you something more specific and interesting and different than other platforms we\u2019re engaged with.\u201dBrian X.

During the event, many analysts\u2019 questions about the company were dismissed by Mr. Spiegel. None of the executives made a particularly impassioned case for why the business would be a success over the long term.On Thursday, Jim Cramer, the investor and CNBC host, said Mr. Spiegel needed to be \u201chazed\u201d and put through a \u201cgauntlet\u201d by investors because \u201che is so arrogant.\u201dSnap\u2019s earnings showed that \u201cyour house has to be in order before you go public,\u201d Ms. Lynn said. \u201cYour job is to predict what you\u2019ll hit and then do it.\u201dSnap declined to comment.While Snap may make people rethink what it means to be prepared for a public offering and how high investors might value a buzzy company, it will most likely not discourage companies from going public altogether. Generally speaking, newly public companies have done well for investors over the past couple of years, so there is an appetite to buy into more of these start-ups.\u201cThere\u2019s a buildup of potential I.P.O.s,\u201d said Scott Sandell, a venture capitalist at New Enterprise Associates.Many start-ups also do not face the tough situation Snap is in now, in which it is being compared to a Goliath like Facebook, which is aggressively copying some of Snapchat\u2019s features.For many of the tech start-ups that are evaluating going public, Snap\u2019s trajectory offers valuable lessons, said Elad Gil, the founder of the genetic testing start-up Color Genomics. The kind of public market beating that Snap just went through can ultimately help a company become more focused and disciplined, he said.Just look at what happened with Facebook, Mr. Gil added. The social network\u2019s stock, which was priced at $38 for its I.P.O., at one point went as low as $18 a share in its first year as a public company.The investor skepticism helped Facebook concentrate on spreading into new areas, such as mobile advertising, where it has since become a juggernaut. On Thursday, Facebook\u2019s stock closed at $150.04.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Price Amazon Is Content to Keep High: $1,000 a Share", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 On Monday, Amazon.com\u2019s share price briefly crossed the $1,000 mark for the first time in its 20-year history as a publicly traded company.Cracking the arbitrary threshold of a four-digit stock price is a reminder of just how heavy Amazon has become.It is now the fourth most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The top five, Apple, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, have emerged as the dominant forces in technology. Amazon\u2019s shares are up almost 33 percent for the year and up 368 percent over five years.Crossing the $1,000 mark, said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify ETFs, which includes a fund that holds Amazon shares, \u201cspeaks to the triumph of e-commerce and the vision of Jeff Bezos.\u201dThe investor optimism about Amazon is, in many respects, unchanged from when it went public in 1997.Amazon remains a long-term play based on a wager that online shopping will replace a healthy chunk of traditional retail over time. Even with all of Amazon\u2019s staggering growth \u2014 $136 billion in revenue last year, compared with $148 million in 1997 \u2014 e-commerce still represents only around 10 percent of total retail spending in the United States, the company\u2019s most mature market.That leaves Amazon \u2014 which accounted for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the United States last year, according to Slice Intelligence \u2014 with a lot of room to grow. Some analysts say its gains could be especially large in the coming years as more physical retailers close stores and file for bankruptcy.\u201cFor any stock analyst trying to find growth and return on investment in the retail sector today, they\u2019re clearly putting money into Amazon because that\u2019s where they anticipate the growth coming from,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2, a retail research firm.Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. The stock closed at $996.70 on Tuesday, up 0.09 percent.Amazon has also given investors reason to believe it is not content to remain simply an e-commerce giant. Through its Amazon Web Services business, it is now the largest provider of cloud computing services in the world. It stands to benefit for many years as hundreds of billions of dollars in information technology spending shifts from traditional purchases of hardware and software to effectively renting them in the data centers.Because profit margins in cloud computing are wider than those in the retail business, Amazon, which had only a passing familiarity with profits over most of its life, is now consistently in the black.After an embarrassing smartphone venture, Amazon demonstrated that it, too, could stay ahead of important changes in consumer technology with the invention of Echo, a voice-activated speaker powered by an artificially intelligent assistant called Alexa. Although the company says little about sales of the devices, other than that tens of millions have been sold, Alexa appears to be emerging as a significant new technology platform, and Amazon\u2019s strategy is being widely imitated by rivals.One of those rivals, Alphabet, is not too far behind Amazon in chasing the $1,000 a share milestone (the market capitalization of Alphabet, which is far more profitable than Amazon, is still about $200 billion higher than that of the internet retailer).The most powerful technology companies are becoming even more powerful. Of course, that is no guarantee of staying power. Apple and Microsoft, much older than Amazon, each lost its way for a time. And tech pioneers like Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies two years ago, and IBM have struggled to adapt to technology changes.Amazon is known for being ruthlessly competitive on prices for products it sells on its website, but that does not extend to its share price. Last week at the company\u2019s annual investor meeting in Seattle, a woman who said she was a longtime Amazon shareholder beseeched Mr. Bezos to split the company\u2019s stock to help make it more accessible to less wealthy investors.Mr. Bezos said Amazon considered such possibilities from time to time but had no plans for a split.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As C.E.O. Pay Packages Grow, Top Executives Have the President\u2019s Ear", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "The top 200 chief executives, who make more than last year, are holding meetings with President Trump, who is considering rolling back Dodd-Frank regulations.Supported byPerhaps the pay surge reflects the times: Stocks are coming off a strong run. Unemployment is low. The economy is percolating.And President Trump is not only promising to roll back what he calls excessive business regulations but also listening keenly to what corporate America has to say. Since taking office on Jan. 20, the businessman-turned-politician has met with hundreds of executives, including at least 41 of last year\u2019s 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, a New York Times analysis shows.Several executives in the top 10 are in the media or tech industries.Mr. Rutledge, 63, stormed to the front of the pack after closing his company\u2019s mega-merger, a $65 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller competitor.For that, he got a big bump in pay. The year before, his compensation totaled $16.4 million.This combination \u2014 the gains in pay for chief executives, the president\u2019s pledge to deregulate and cut corporate tax rates \u2014 sets the stage for perhaps the most consequential moment for corporate governance since the financial crisis of 2008. Rising executive compensation only widens the gap between top executives and most American workers. Mr. Rutledge, for instance, made about 2,617 times the average American worker\u2019s salary of $37,632, according to figures maintained by the A.F.L.-C.I.O.Discrepancies like that helped fuel the populist frustration that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s election and, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, led to the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul act.Yet the president\u2019s team is considering rolling back a Dodd-Frank rule that, starting next year, would make it much easier for employees at a publicly traded company to compare their own pay to the chief executive\u2019s.In the meantime, pay for top executives is reaching staggering levels. Mr. Rutledge\u2019s compensation swelled to $98 million largely thanks to a stock options award valued at roughly $78 million. The Charter board awarded Mr. Rutledge that grant, which runs through 2020, about a month before completion of its big merger in May 2016.Over all, technology company chief executives are well represented on the list of 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, along with executives from financial services companies and media companies. The best-paid female chief executive is Oracle\u2019s Safra A. Catz, whose total package was valued at $40.9 million, making her the eighth-highest-paid C.E.O. in 2016.Mr. Trump, who sees himself as the nation\u2019s C.E.O., is hardly the first president to savor the company of corporate executives. But he\u2019s made the pageantry of meetings with C.E.O.s at the White House or at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which he has dubbed the southern White House, a priority during his first few months in office. The visits have become an opportunity for the president to trumpet the progress he says his administration is making in creating jobs and reducing regulations.But Mr. Trump may be getting a one-sided perspective on policy recommendations by spending so much time with a large swath of highly paid executives \u2014 at least 307 since Inauguration Day \u2014 whose views on taxes and economic inequality tend to differ from those of average Americans.Unleashing business by reducing regulations was the subtext of Mr. Rutledge\u2019s meeting on March 24 with Mr. Trump.Justin Venech, a Charter spokesman, said Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of a lighter regulatory environment had enabled the company to commit to locating those new jobs in the United States over the next four years, and to spend billions on broadband infrastructure.What is clear from the Equilar study is that many C.E.O.s were doing quite well even before Mr. Trump took office. Average compensation for the 200 highest-paid executives list \u2014 which changes from year to year \u2014 rose about 2 percent, to $19.7 million, from 2015. For the 200 specific individuals on this year\u2019s list, 2016 was especially kind. Those executives saw an average gain of 16 percent over what they received in 2015.On a percentage basis, Ronald D. Croatti at UniFirst, one of the nation\u2019s largest uniform manufacturers and distributors, had the biggest bump in pay last year. Mr. Croatti, 74, died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia, the company said. His pay package in 2016 rose 740 percent, to $17.69 million, according to Equilar.Steven Sintros, chief financial officer for UniFirst, said Mr. Croatti\u2019s large compensation package merely reflected the way companies are required to report the valuation of stock grants.In all, Equilar reports that the median salary for chief executives at all publicly traded companies with annual revenues of at least $1 billion came in at $6.14 million, down slightly from $6.19 million in 2015.Elon Musk, the brash inventor and chief executive of Tesla Inc., clocked in with a $99.7 million pay package in the Bloomberg survey. But Mr. Musk did not appear in the Equilar survey because Equilar valued stock grants, even ones spread out over several years, at the time they were awarded, as the Securities and Exchange Commission requires.The total compensation for Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric slid 33 percent in 2016, to $17.7 million, according to Equilar. His payout under the company\u2019s long-term compensation plan fell by about $6 million, and his annual bonus shrank by $1 million to $4.3 million, according to the company\u2019s proxy. In 2016, G.E. shares rose just 4 percent compared with 12 percent for the S.& P. 500.Mr. Immelt remained on the list, however. Notable extremely wealthy chief executives who did not appear include Tim Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. Both own enormous quantities of their companies\u2019 stock, but their compensation in 2016 was not high enough to qualify.The list also excludes executives who run big divisions but not entire public companies, even when they make more than the corporate boss.Digging deeper, Equilar found that Marc Lore, president and chief executive of Walmart\u2019s online operation, had the biggest payout of all executives at publicly traded companies, earning an eye-popping $243.9 million in total compensation.His total pay was more than 11 times greater than the $21.8 million pay package awarded to C. Douglas McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive.Another big winner was Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google at Alphabet. Mr. Pichai got a compensation package worth just under $200 million. Like Mr. Lore, Mr. Pichai gets a small base salary and most of his compensation is in stock grants. Last year, Alphabet\u2019s board awarded Mr. Pichai stock valued at $198.7 million.By comparison, Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, draws an annual salary of $1 a year. He hardly needs the salary: Forbes estimates the net worth of the co-founder of Google at $45 billion.The Equilar study points up a trend in compensation: Companies are increasingly moving away from cash bonuses and toward stock grants to reward top executives.Many large investors favor them because they give corporate executives an additional incentive to produce results that increase a company\u2019s share prices. Some critics, however, contend that stock grants and stock options can encourage executives to cut costs and take other short-term steps that don\u2019t invest in a company\u2019s long-term prospects.Supporters of stock grants are winning. Over the past five years, the median cash bonus awarded to the 200 best-compensated C.E.O.s declined to just under $3 million, from $3.37 million, according to Equilar. Meanwhile, the median value of stock awarded to those chief executives last year was $9.2 million.\u201cThe issue with cash bonuses is that they have become a given for most executives,\u201d said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer with the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, or Calstrs. \u201cThere are still companies where they award the same bonus year after year, and the stock price doesn\u2019t reflect any value added.\u201dMs. Mastagni said a cash bonus \u201cis not money at risk,\u201d as is a grant of stock.The board at AMC Networks \u2014 which has produced hit television shows like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d \u2014 has decided to phase out the long-term cash award for its chief executive and other top executives. AMC\u2019s compensation committee decided that a stock award \u201cbetter aligns the interests of its senior officers with those of stockholders.\u201dBut in 2016, Joshua W. Sapan, AMC\u2019s chief executive, hit the daily double of sorts. Mr. Sapan got a big cash award of $15.1 million, which will become much smaller in 2018 under the board\u2019s policy. But he also got a big stock award, valued at $13.2 million, consistent with the board\u2019s new directive on corporate pay. In all, Mr. Sapan\u2019s total $30.5 million pay package soared 72 percent over 2015, even as the company\u2019s stock dropped nearly 30 percent last year.No matter how you look at it, the pay gap between corporate executives and most everyone else in America keeps getting bigger.Some 50 years ago, the typical chief executive made just 20 times what an employee did, according to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. By comparison, it calculated that the average C.E.O. today made 347 times the average salary of an American laborer, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: $37,632.Reversing this ever-widening pay gap is a union rallying cry, especially at companies that have been shedding jobs in the United States.Take Mondelez, the global snack company. Outside the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on May 17 in Chicago, union members protested its decision to eliminate 600 jobs at a local factory that makes Oreo cookies, and shift some operations to Mexico.\u201cMondelez is emblematic of everything that is wrong with our economy, which works for C.E.O.s, but not for working Americans,\u201d said Brandon Rees, who works in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s Office of Investment.Irene B. Rosenfeld, the company\u2019s chief executive, received a 2016 pay package valued at $15.8 million, according to Equilar, a decline of 13 percent. Michael Mitchell, a Mondelez spokesman, said the company\u2019s compensation program is \u201cwell aligned with shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\u201dBut Mr. Rees said the company\u2019s failure to hit certain performance targets, and a 13 percent decline in Mondelez revenue last year, accounted for the decline in her compensation, adding that her pay package was still too high. He said she had focused too much on cutting costs and share buybacks, and not enough on investments that would keep jobs in the United States.Amid populist anger over income inequality, the S.E.C. in 2015 required publicly traded corporations to begin providing standard information in 2018 on the disparities between pay for chief executives and rank-and-file workers. That so-called pay-ratio rule would give investors and employees another metric for evaluating C.E.O. pay.The chairman of Business Roundtable is Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase and the 25th-best-compensated chief executive in the Equilar survey. His pay package rose 49 percent last year, to $27.2 million. Mr. Dimon, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s C.E.O. advisory group, visited the White House on Feb. 3 and has praised the president for awakening \u201canimal spirits\u201d in the economy.Alan Johnson, managing director of the pay consulting firm Johnson Associates, said he supports the opposition to the pay-ratio rule because it \u201cis a cooked-up thing to embarrass firms with a lot of part-time workers.\u201d He added that focusing on compensation leads to \u201cpay envy\u201d and does not do anything to address a fundamental problem, which is that average workers need better job training and job assistance programs.But Susan R. Holmberg, a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal public policy group, said that if the pay-ratio rule encourages employees to join unions, it is a good thing for workers, since it could lead to future wage gains.Mr. Trump \u201cran on this populist message,\u201d she said, and it is odd that the administration would be taking another look at the pay-ratio rule, because \"C.E.O. pay is the No. 1 populist issue.\u201dStill, there is some progress on the pay inequality front.This year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Equity Index Fund and the New York State Common Retirement Fund reached an agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company, to include new language on executive and employee compensation in its proxy statement. It says the company is taking a \u201cnon-elitist\u201d approach by awarding stock options to all of its 5,500 employees, not just to executives. The change has helped lead the union and the New York pension system to withdraw a proposed shareholder amendment on the issue of pay.Alexandra Bowie, a Regeneron spokeswoman, said the revised language in the company\u2019s filings did not reflect a change in policy but a \u201cbroader effort to include more detailed and accessible language.\u201dAs for Leonard S. Schleifer, the chief executive of Regeneron, his total compensation for 2016 was $28.2 million, almost 40 percent less than the year before, and nearly matching the 32 percent slide in the company\u2019s share price.Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, said company boards need to be sensitive to issues of income inequality. \u201cI have no problem with someone doing well, who creates value,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I do think a company and a board as they look at compensation need to make sure everyone down the chain is also benefiting from the performance of the company.\u201dBoards need to consider not only how much top executives are getting paid, she said, but also whether rank-and-file workers are being compensated fairly too. The crucial question is this, Ms. Sheehan said: \u201cAre they investing enough in the human capital in the company?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Ronald D. Croatti, the chief executive of UniFirst, who died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia. He was 74, not 73.An article last Sunday about executive compensation misidentified a company that Charter Communications \u2014 whose chief executive, Thomas M. Rutledge made the most last year among chiefs of 200 public companies with annual revenue of at least $1 billion \u2014 took over.

Look at the cars, the rockets, the internet-beaming balloons and gliders, the voice assistants, drones, augmented and virtual reality devices, and every permutation of artificial intelligence you\u2019ve ever encountered in sci-fi. Technology companies aren\u2019t just funding big things \u2014 they are funding the biggest, most world-changing things. They are spending on ideas that, years from now, we may come to see as having altered life for much of the planet.At the same time, the American government\u2019s appetite for funding big things \u2014 for scientific research and out-of-this-world technology and infrastructure programs \u2014 keeps falling, and it may decline further under President Trump.This sets up a looming complication: Technology giants, not the government, are building the artificially intelligent future. And unless the government vastly increases how much it spends on research into such technologies, it is the corporations that will decide how to deploy them.Consider Google. On Wednesday, the internet search company kicked off its annual developer conference near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company showed off several advances to its voice-enabled assistant and its mobile operating system. Among other things, you can now point your phone at an object in the real world \u2014 a flower, a sign in another language, a marquee for a rock concert \u2014 and the phone will give you more information about what you\u2019re looking at (for instance, a button to buy tickets for the concert).The real advances at Google are in that second category. At last year\u2019s show, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, inaugurated what he called a new era for Google. The search company would henceforth be an \u201cA.I.-first\u201d company \u2014 that is, most of its advances would be driven by artificial intelligence techniques.A lot of these plans will fail, but Google isn\u2019t making big, long-term bets out of altruism. The company understands that the A.I.-based projects that succeed could be transformational: They will alter existing industries and create huge new ones, including a stream of new businesses from which Google can profit.Google is not alone in this quest to build a future out of A.I. Its parent company, Alphabet, is spending billions to inject machine intelligence into much of the global economy, from self-driving cars to health care.There are two ways to respond to the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in the intelligent future. On the one hand, you could greet the news with optimism and even gratitude. The technologies that Google and other tech giants are working on will have a huge impact on society. Self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives a year, for instance, while computerized methods for diagnosing and treating disease could improve our health and cut the cost of care.What\u2019s more, experts in the field say that many tech giants are currently approaching A.I. with a kind of academic ethos. For instance, they regularly publish papers on their findings, and \u2014 through their cloud server businesses \u2014 they are allowing third-party companies to access some of their latest A.I. tech.But the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in A.I. might also be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government.\u201cWe created OpenAI partly because industry is investing such vast sums of money into A.I. research that commercial, private entities were on track to create the first powerful A.I. systems, and these entities don\u2019t have a built-in mechanism to ensure that everyone benefits from advances,\u201d Mr. Brockman told me in an email.He went on to note that one reason the internet has been so successful is that it was created through government funding to be open and accessible to everyone. If it had been created by a single company, it might have ended up like the phone network: useful for certain tasks, but not a broad-based engine of economic opportunity.\u201cSimilarly, as powerful A.I. systems come online, the intent and motivations of their creators will be major factors in determining their impact,\u201d Mr. Brockman said. \u201cIf A.I. development is done entirely in for-profit companies, then these systems are likely to be deployed to benefit just one organization and group of people.\u201dWhat\u2019s interesting is that many in the tech industry agree with the need for greater federal funding. OpenAI was created by Elon Musk and other tech luminaries, and it has received funding from Microsoft, Amazon and Y Combinator, the start-up incubator.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America\u2019s greatest advantages,\u201d he wrote.In other words, the tech giants that are building the future would like some help changing the world. We would be wise to chip in \u2014 or let them take over the future for themselves.An earlier version of this article incorrectly included Peter Thiel as among those who helped create OpenAI. While Mr. Thiel was among those who sponsored it, he was not a creator.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber and Waymo Duel at Key Hearing Over Driverless Car Technology", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byOne of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars. The company is involved in a legal dispute over whether it used technology stolen by a top executive who had worked at Google.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the fight over the future of self-driving vehicles, a bare-knuckled brawl between Uber and Waymo is coming to a head.That was clear in a federal courthouse in San Francisco on Wednesday as the two companies clashed at a crucial hearing in a case that could halt the progress of Uber\u2019s autonomous-vehicle research efforts. The hearing was expected to be the final court session before a federal judge decides whether to temporarily shut down Uber\u2019s work on self-driving cars.The thief, Waymo maintains, is Anthony Levandowski, a former top Google engineer whose start-up was acquired by Uber last year to work on self-driving technology. Waymo has accused Mr. Levandowski of illegally downloading 14,000 documents from Google and then applying those stolen secrets at Uber.On Wednesday, lawyers for Waymo argued that Mr. Levandowski had reached an understanding with Uber before he left Google. To keep that agreement secret from Google, the Waymo lawyers said, Mr. Levandowski and Uber needed some cover, so they hatched a plan for Mr. Levandowski to create a self-driving-car start-up named Otto, which Uber would then acquire.\u201cIn fact, there was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Mr. Levandowski had a deal,\u201d Charles Verhoeven, a lawyer for Waymo, said.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cWe\u2019ve interviewed more than 85 Uber employees, and more than 40 attorneys spent more than 6,000 hours reviewing documents, including over weekends,\u201d Arturo Gonzalez, a lawyer for Uber, said. \u201cAfter reviewing more than 300,000 documents, we\u2019ve only found one Google email in the files.\u201dThe case will be decided by Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court, who is expected to issue a ruling within the week. Waymo has asked for a temporary injunction blocking Uber\u2019s self-driving car efforts; such an order would affect hundreds of Uber\u2019s highly skilled engineers.The two companies have been regarded as leaders in driverless technology, a field that has become crowded in recent years as Apple, General Motors, Tesla and dozens of other companies have flooded in. More than 30 companies have applied to test driverless cars in California, which is at the forefront of addressing regulatory issues raised by such vehicles.There has been little love between Uber and Google in the past, with the companies tangling over issues like mapping technology and hiring. Waymo\u2019s lawsuit against Uber is one of the most tangible manifestations of the enmity between the two.Waymo, which was spun off by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, last year, sued Uber in February. Uber has repeatedly denied the accusations and has separately sought to take the matter to arbitration. Mr. Levandowski said last week that he would stop working on Uber\u2019s Lidar system \u2014 a shorthand term for light detection and ranging technology, a key hardware component in the operation of autonomous vehicles \u2014 for the duration of the case.Waymo\u2019s lawyers opened the proceedings on Wednesday by pointing to documents and emails uncovered during the case. The documents include correspondence between Uber executives discussing the acquisition of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up in early 2016 while he was still working for Google, Waymo\u2019s lawyers said.The documents also show Uber agreeing to grant Mr. Levandowski more than 5.3 million company shares, with an estimated value of more than $250 million, in exchange for meeting various technical milestones and project goals should he join Uber.Uber\u2019s lawyers argued there was no proof that the company had used any Waymo trade secrets.Judge Alsup said Wednesday that Waymo\u2019s lawyers had presented strong evidence that Mr. Levandowski had downloaded troves of valuable information from Google before leaving the company and had tried to erase his tracks after doing so. He also said Uber had determined at some point that Mr. Levandowski was \u201cradioactive\u201d and had taken steps to insulate itself from any repercussions he might face.Yet Judge Alsup also indicated that Waymo\u2019s lawyers might not have proved that there was a direct link between Mr. Levandowski\u2019s actions and Uber\u2019s products.\u201cI\u2019ve already given you lots of time for discovery, and you don\u2019t seem to have a smoking gun,\u201d he said to Waymo\u2019s lawyers.Waymo\u2019s lawyers said they believed that there might be additional evidence that Mr. Levandowski had shared the company\u2019s technology with Uber and had used it in Uber designs, but that Uber was withholding that evidence.Waymo\u2019s lawyers also said that Mr. Levandowski could offer similar proof were he willing to cooperate in a deposition. Mr. Levandowski, apparently seeking to avoid criminal charges, has invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.Advertisement"}

The two executives spoke about the arcana of insurance, one of Berkshire\u2019s biggest businesses. They criticized the work of private equity firms that load enormous piles of debt onto companies they acquire. And, responding to individual shareholder queries, they also spoke about their dreams and regrets.\u201cMedical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness,\u201d he said.Yet Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger stood by Wells Fargo and other Berkshire investments, including United Airlines and Coca-Cola. When a protester from Germany delivered a long speech decrying Coke, sugar and capitalism itself, Mr. Buffett said he would continue to drink his favorite beverage, Cherry Coke.In contrast, the billionaire offered little defense of one major holding of Berkshire: IBM.

The tech world moves too fast these days for companies to save products for an annual event; they appear when they\u2019re finished. But the conference must go on anyway.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, began by talking about Google\u2019s impressive reach. Seven of its products \u2014 including Search, YouTube and Maps \u2014 have more than a billion users each. The Android operating system software is on more than two billion devices.Google\u2019s ambition, as Mr. Pichai and the speakers that followed him made clear, is to knit all those devices and services together. Google users \u2014 which means just about everyone, in Google\u2019s vision \u2014 will interact with the company all day long and do it so seamlessly that they barely notice it.\u201cIn an A.I.-first world, we are rethinking all our products,\u201d Mr. Pichai said.Simply pointing a phone at a restaurant would bring up reviews of it. And a search for a small product \u2014 a screwdriver, say \u2014 in a vast hardware store would be enabled by what Google calls Visual Position Service.\u201cGPS gets you to the door, and then V.P.S. can get you the exact item you\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Clay Bavor, Google\u2019s virtual reality team leader. With an audio interface, V.P.S. would be a gift to the vision-impaired.Google Home, introduced at I/O last year, was rushed out to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo. While Google does not release sales figures, analysts say Home lags far behind the Echo, which recently announced new features that Home does not have. Perhaps Google can catch up or perhaps Home will become another Google Buzz, a social network that failed a few years ago.The same caution goes for Google\u2019s efforts in virtual reality. It is developing its first stand-alone headsets, done in partnership with Qualcomm, Lenovo and HTC, which will be released this fall. But Facebook and Samsung already have their own well-publicized V.R. initiatives.At the end of the keynote, Mr. Pichai discussed a new initiative called Google for Jobs that will pull data from partner sites to making job-hunting easier.One major job listing site, Indeed, is not one of Google\u2019s partners. Within a few hours of the keynote, the company fired back. \u201cWe are happy to see that 13 years after Indeed launched, Google has woken up to the fact that searching for jobs is one of the most important searches in anyone\u2019s life,\u201d said Chris Hyams, the president of Indeed, in a statement.That makes another battle joined.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Technology as a Teaching Tool", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:There\u2019s a Silicon Valley saying that when you pay for something, it\u2019s the product. When you get it for free, you\u2019re the product. In these straitened times for districts, it\u2019s really becoming a question of whether you go with Google and Chromebooks and accept what they entail or do without.BRIAN NADEL, PELHAM, N.Y.To the Editor:Sadly, American public education lurches from one fad to another. Remember \u201cschools without walls\u201d or the \u201cnew math\u201d? Chromebooks are simply the latest fad. There is little evidence that computers in classrooms produce student outcomes superior to traditional teaching methods, at least when the latter are implemented properly.Elite private schools have computers, but they are far less central to the educational process. Instead, smaller class sizes and better teachers are emphasized. However, these are a lot more expensive than Chromebooks.SCOTT OCHILTREE, WASHINGTONTo the Editor:The big question everyone should be asking here is: Are we educating our kids to become active citizens or passive, unquestioning consumers? Which society do you want your kids to live in?To the Editor:I am the parent of two elementary-school children. Our school district has Google accounts for all the schoolchildren, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. My children have learned how to use word processing, create spreadsheets, make and give presentations, and use email \u2014 all at a young age in a safe environment. They can log into their accounts from anywhere, do their homework (it even saves their work automatically every few seconds), communicate with their teachers and classmates, and even submit their homework online. All their work is saved and accessible anywhere, anytime. They both have cellphones and can also access their accounts on their phones.To the Editor:Chromebooks might make a teacher\u2019s job easier, but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking they will produce better educated and more responsible citizens, more creative kids or a highly skilled work force. The distractions that Chromebooks present offset many of the advantages. If Google or Apple or Facebook were serious about providing a useful tool for students, the platform would have looked much different. It would have limited access to the web, disallowing all sites but those with strictly educational value. We would never use textbooks jammed with advertisements, inappropriate pictures or games.I know there is no getting this toothpaste back in the tube, but the last thing children need is more screen time. Google has been virtually giving out Chromebooks like lollipops. It knew full well that the temptation to stray from schoolwork into cybertainment would be inevitable, providing Google with infinite data mining and marketing research opportunities.The Chromebook movement at the high school level has also spawned some very creative ways to \u201cshare\u201d homework, classroom assignments and screenshots of tests.RICK BOBRICK, MEDUSA, N.Y.The writer is a junior high school science teacher.To the Editor:Google\u2019s education apps group director, Jonathan Rochelle, questions the value of teaching students the skills of mathematical thinking when students can just \u201cask Google for the answer.\u201d The purpose of education should not be to teach students how to mindlessly search the internet and locate the answer to a question. Whether the class is mathematics, history, literature, science, civics or the arts, a good teacher will encourage students to think critically for themselves, ask their own questions and discover answers.It is hard for this reader to accept that a laptop with a bunch of apps will ever teach students more meaningfully than a skilled and inspiring teacher standing up in front, armed only with chalk, and challenging students to think.DAVID E. COHEN, WYCKOFF, N.J.To the Editor:This article gave copious details about how the tech giant Google won over numerous school districts around the country, and beat out Microsoft, but I wish it had focused more on what the Google tools were, and how they helped students gain knowledge and acquire inspiration.I was appalled by a quote from the director of Google\u2019s education apps group, Jonathan Rochelle, who disparaged rote memorization of equations in a speech at an industry conference last year. Referring to his own children, he said: \u201cI cannot answer for them what they are going to do with the quadratic equation. I don\u2019t know why they are learning it.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t ask Google for the answer if the answer is right there.\u201dDuring my years in junior high school I learned the formula for solving quadratic equations and how it worked, and as an aerospace physicist for more than 40 years, I found I needed it often. By being stored in my memory it was at my immediate disposal.Of course we should use computers as we do libraries to look up information. But certain fundamental rules, laws, processes and shortcuts should be memorized, so they are conveniently available. I also found that depending on computers for solving problems can often result in a \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d situation. If you can\u2019t solve the problem as a rough \u201cback of the envelope\u201d calculation, you\u2019ll never know if your computer got it right.To the Editor:Good for Google. It figured out how to level the playing field across different types of schools and districts to help close the digital divide. And it has helped spawn a new generation of digital citizens who are learning how to use technology in a social, positive manner geared toward learning. Schools can be left scrambling to find ways to give each student full access to a good education. At low cost and with easy-to-use tools, Google has skinned the cat.Yes, Google also has almost unfettered access to a new generation of consumers. That\u2019s a price worth paying given the high returns to students in the form of contemporary, relevant learning.MATT LEVINSON, SEATTLEThe writer is the author of \u201cFrom Fear to Facebook: One School\u2019s Journey.\u201dTo the Editor:The article raises many valid concerns about the infiltration of Google into the lives of our children. The question, however, as to \u201cwhether the purpose of public schools is to turn out knowledgeable citizens or skilled workers\u201d is no longer relevant. They must be one and the same. I hope the public schools can embrace and facilitate this reality.PAUL FIEDLER, NEW HAVENAdvertisement"}

(Much of the site\u2019s content is available free, but an ad-free premium subscription is $6.95 a month.) One title that stands out is \u201cFist of the North Star\u201d (1986), from Toei Animation, a gruelingly violent post-nuclear dystopian tale replete with martial arts and despotism.To its credit, Crunchyroll offers only the subtitled version of the movie. (Even if you\u2019re not a fan, the English-dubbed version is a travesty of the original.) All of the other material I watched on the service was presented the same way. And let it be said that the service knows its core demographic. I logged onto Crunchyroll on my PlayStation 4, and the menu is configured to work best not with that box\u2019s universal remote but with a gaming controller.Advertisement"}
