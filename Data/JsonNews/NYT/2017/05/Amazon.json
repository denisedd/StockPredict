{"Headline": "Political Turmoil Is High, but Wall Street\u2019s Fear Gauge Is Very Low", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byIt has become one of the knottier puzzles on Wall Street.As political risks have increased at home and abroad, complacency among investors has rarely been so widespread.This trend, which began soon after President Trump\u2019s victory in November, culminated on Monday, when the VIX index, known widely as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, dipped briefly below 10 \u2014 the first time it had done so in more than 10 years, in the months before the financial crisis.The VIX measures investor expectations that stock markets will move sharply up or down.On Tuesday, the VIX turned up, to close at about 10.6 \u2014 but still sharply lower than its historical average of roughly 20. At current levels, the VIX reflects a striking sense among investors that the persistent rise in stocks would continue, regardless of election fears in Europe and concerns here that Mr. Trump might not deliver on his ambitious economic agenda.\u201cThe pricing of risk is at near historic lows, and the pricing of the stock market is at near historic highs,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock and derivatives specialist at the investment bank UBS. \u201cAnd all of this at a time when political risk is very elevated \u2014 at home and abroad.\u201dSince the VIX reached a recent peak of 22 in the days before the election in November, it has fallen sharply as equity markets have rallied in the belief that the president\u2019s promises to slash regulations, cut taxes and spend money on infrastructure would buoy the economy.The gauge generally moves in the opposite direction of the stock market. So with the major stock indexes having hit highs, it would make sense that the VIX would reach these unusual lows.But what is less clear is why investors have been so willing to ignore so many outcomes that would send stocks reeling.This means that even as Mr. Trump has difficulties in getting his bills passed, investors are not abandoning the stock market, but are switching out of stocks tied directly to a Trump recovery, for example, banks and industrial companies.The net effect of this rotation is a stock market that goes up and a VIX that goes down.\u201cThere has been this epic disconnect between soft and hard economic data,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cAnd investors are just not willing to sell out of their stocks right now.\u201dRussell Rhoads, the director of education at the VIX\u2019s home, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, calls the high level of faith investors have shown in the president\u2019s promise to reinvigorate the economy the Trump put.Now, Mr. Rhoads says, investors are making a similar wager on Mr. Trump.\u201cWe used to have the Greenspan put, maybe it is the Trump put now,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said, citing a propensity of investors to stay in the market despite political ups and downs. \u201cHe is so business-friendly \u2014 there is a view that whatever happens he will do things that spur economic growth.\u201dUnlike a stock index like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the VIX is not driven by stock prices but by the prices of options to buy or sell the S.&P. For that reason, it is a forward-looking indicator \u2014 30 days to be precise \u2014 that measures how volatile traders think the market will be before the option expires.One reason for the gauge\u2019s recent equanimity, Mr. Rhoads said, is that even when investors purchase options to sell the S.&P. index at a certain level (betting that the market will fall) to insure against a sell-off, they are at the same time keeping their broad exposure to stocks.It is this tricky balancing act that has kept the VIX at these low levels.Mr. Rhoads, a student of financial market history, noted that the index is what is known as \u201ca means reverting vehicle.\u201d This means that even if it stays at these low levels for a while, the index will spike up when the next bout of fear hits the market.\u201cIt\u2019s like a rubber band that stretches and stretches until it pops,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said. \u201cEveryone might be too confident right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airport Melee Follows Latest Dispute Between Airline and Its Pilots", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byPassengers at an airport in Florida protested on Monday night after the cancellation of multiple flights, leading to a confrontation with airline employees and sheriff\u2019s deputies who arrested three travelers while attempting to restore order.According to the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the arrests were made after customers screamed at and threatened Spirit Airline employees, inciting unrest in a crowd of about 500 people at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.Arrest reports assert that those detained were threatening to harm airline employees and challenging them to fights. All three of the people who were arrested were charged with disorderly conduct, inciting a riot and resisting arrest.Video taken at the airport and posted to social media showed a scrum of passengers jostling with sheriff\u2019s deputies.Paul Berry, a spokesman for the airline, said that Spirit was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the violence. He said airline pilots who were engaged in \u201cunlawful labor activity\u201d that was \u201cdesigned to disrupt Spirit operations\u201d were the cause of the cancellations.The airline filed a lawsuit in federal court on Monday against the Air Line Pilots Association, International, which represents Spirit\u2019s pilots, accusing it of coordinating a \u201cpervasive illegal work slowdown\u201d that it said had led to the cancellation of about 300 Spirit flights since the beginning of May and had interfered with the travel plans of over 20,000 passengers.The pilots\u2019 union disputed the airline\u2019s account, calling the lawsuit \u201cunwarranted and counterproductive.\u201dOn Tuesday, however, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order sought by the airline, instructing Spirit pilots and the union to refrain from activities aimed at disrupting normal operations, at least until a hearing scheduled for next Monday.\u201cThe court has spoken and Spirit pilots will fully comply with the order handed down, which is completely in line with our overriding goal: the resumption of normal operations,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cWe call on the company to join forces with A.L.P.A. and the Spirit pilots to do just that.\u201dSenator Bill Nelson of Florida said from the floor of the United States Senate on Tuesday that he had spoken to the leaders of the airline and the union and encouraged them to \u201cget this thing fixed and get it fixed quick.\u201dThe industry has seen periodic labor tension between pilots and carriers since the early part of the decade, as carriers began to recover from years of losses and pilots felt they weren\u2019t sharing in the gains.\u201dPilots are very sensitive to executive compensation,\u201d said Thomas Kochan, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management who follows the airline industry. \u201cThey consider themselves equal to executives in competence, intelligence, leadership, all those dimensions.\u201dPilots at some of the large legacy carriers, like Delta and United, have pressed for and received significant wage increases in recent years.Spirit pilots, who tend to make less than their counterparts at the major carriers, went on strike for several days in 2010, citing low wages after several years of negotiations had failed to produce a contract.More than 200 pilots for the cargo carrier ABX Air, whose customers include DHL and Amazon, briefly went on strike last fall before a federal judge ordered them back to work. The pilots complained of chronic understaffing that was forcing them to work emergency shifts without adequate time off. Pilots at ABX and four other carriers who serve DHL continue to press for higher wages and benefits and better working conditions.The Spirit lawsuit, which was filed in Florida\u2019s southern district, estimated that the airline had lost about $8.5 million in revenue because of its conflict with the association. The airline said that on Sunday alone, it had to cancel 81 flights, representing 17 percent of those it had scheduled that day.The airline and the pilots\u2019 union have been negotiating over specific sections of a collective bargaining agreement since the middle of March, the lawsuit said, but have yet to agree on pilot compensation rates. The association did not respond to an email attempting to confirm that negotiations were in progress.Noam Scheiber and Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Sears, Abercrombie & Fitch and Best Buy each reported encouraging numbers on Thursday. But Tiffany\u2019s quarterly slump, reported a day ago, shows that hopes of a turnaround offer a false bill of goods.Sears, run by the hedge-fund manager Eddie Lampert, reported its first quarterly profit in nearly two years. That wasn\u2019t because of more sales. Its $244 million in net income stemmed mainly from cost cutting and its sale of the toolmaker Craftsman. It still has shelves-loads of problems from public squabbles with its suppliers, an onerous burden of nearly $5 billion in long-term debt and pension liabilities, and a constant shuffle to pay bondholders.Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s more successful brand, Hollister, managed to increase the amount of beach-inspired merchandise it hawks to teenagers, though it couldn\u2019t push up its parent\u2019s overall same-store sales. Still, at least those fell by less than Wall Street analysts expected.A potential sale to the near-identical rival American Eagle Outfitters and the private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management provides a modicum of hope.Of the lot, Best Buy has the most spark. A $15 billion chain, Best Buy is highly exposed to Amazon yet has managed to hold its own by encouraging e-commerce in its stores and offering customers the opportunity to test-run TVs and other gadgets. On Thursday, it announced same-store sales that beat estimates \u2014 and said these would keep growing in the next three months. That electrified shares, shooting them up more than 18 percent, to an 11-year high.The omens of severe challenges to the industry are more numerous, however. Tiffany & Co. enjoyed a bit of an uptick late last year. The activist investor Jana Partners took a stake in February, just after Tiffany\u2019s chief executive stepped down. On Wednesday, though, Tiffany reported having lower sales, partly because of a drop-off in tourists; shares fell 8.5 percent as a result. That followed disappointing results two weeks ago from Macy\u2019s, J.C. Penney, Kohl\u2019s and Nordstrom. The only certainty for retailer investors is more volatility.Advertisement"}

Through Waymo, Alphabet is building its own self-driving tech. But through its venture capital firm, Alphabet is also a huge investor in Uber. And it is also suing Uber. Also, through Waze, its mapping app, Google is running a car-pooling service that could compete with Uber. And now Waymo is partnering with Uber\u2019s biggest competitor.Isn\u2019t this exactly the sort of thing people complain about when they say Google is getting too big and powerful? In every way imaginable, Google is trying to use its huge power to completely dominate the future of driving tech.This is exactly why Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.Since our Federal Trade Commission seems relatively toothless in big tech acquisitions, methinks Facebook is going to face a lot of pain in the E.U. over the next few years. Keep an eye on that.But to be honest with you, the Google stuff reminds me of what I really wanted to talk about this week: I genuinely do not care about any of it.How do you stay passionate about tech news throughout this stuff? I find it difficult to do more than warm up microwave burritos every night for dinner and watch CNN for hours.Self-driving cars are a good example. Everyone in tech seems pretty sure that self-driving cars will change society in big ways, when they come. But when will that happen? Uber, Waymo, Tesla and others are locked in this existential battle for the future of transportation, but the battle is sure to be long, slow and unpredictable.We might have a sense of where self-driving tech is going next year, and a better sense the year after that, and an even better sense in five or 10 years. But at any given moment, a particular development in the industry is going to seem like pretty small ball, especially compared to the car crash of politics news.One thing I\u2019ve found is that chatting with folks in tech can be pretty therapeutic. A lof techies are relentlessly optimistic. Even when the world is falling apart, they can see some better version of the future, and they\u2019re working to build it. We journalists can get pretty cynical about the world, but being around techies does give me some sense, sometimes, that things could get better. Maybe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Amazon\u2019s Bookstore, No Coffee but All the Data You Can Drink", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverA non-virtual, real-life Amazon bookstore opened in Manhattan on Thursday with no obvious signs of corporate guilt at having driven countless independent bookstores to oblivion with the scythe-like power of the company\u2019s e-book discounting.The store opened to a crowd waiting outside, some of them curious about the retro spectacle of a big-box bookstore, as if resurrected from the dead, selling actual books over the counter instead of the internet. All in the name of Amazon, the Colossus that ate the Indies.\u201cWe\u2019re all about discoverability,\u201d said one of the friendly employees offering greetings and guidance. The store\u2019s strategy is to mine Amazon\u2019s massive online archives of reader data to steer the most popular books to shoppers. The circularity of this cr\u00e8me-de-la-cr\u00e8me process provides the sales leverage. The store stocks only 3,000 of the most popular, data-driven titles \u2014 for instance, a history best seller that\u2019s been judged a good read by 2,796 previous readers, who gave it a 4.8 approval rating on a scale of 5. Collectively, the store boasts, its stock has received 1.7 million 5-star reviews from Amazon.com customers.In venturing offline with its seventh brick-and-mortar store nationally, Amazon signals that it is on to something new in its ever expansive business outlook. We all may have thought that product delivery by drone was the next big Amazon thing. But the future turns out to be a typical retail store in the Time Warner Center off Columbus Circle. Another half dozen are due this year, including a second Manhattan store, on 34th Street.The speculation is that dozens more are planned nationally and that Amazon, which already handles nearly half of the nation\u2019s book sales, may eventually expand into selling far more products than the books and Kindle electronics the stores currently offer.The store is tuned for speedy business, with sales via credit or debit cards, no cash. The privileges that come with Amazon Prime are quickly honored. No prices are evident; a customer runs a book under a scanner for Amazon\u2019s shifting price system.Still, the store lacks the little handwritten employee recommendations posted in independent bookstores as humanizing beacons. Amazon compensates at each book pile with a small placard featuring its percentiles of popularity and review notes from blurb-savvy customers (\u201cFar beyond the ordinary\u2026\u201d).Rejecting Amazon\u2019s strategy of stocking mainly data-tracked titles, Mr. Doeblin delights in offering more volumes ranging widely from best selling to barely known. \u201cPeople are willing to pay more for a better experience, for a real choice,\u201d he insists, having survived the challenge of Amazon online and now having to face its arrival as an actual store.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 Is a Blockbuster That Lets Itself Have Fun", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byThe question is not rhetorical, and I\u2019m relieved to report that the answer is no. Once franchise continuity is established \u2014 a mysterious package from Bruce Wayne arrives at the office of Wonder Woman\u2019s alter ego, Diana Prince, who works in the Louvre\u2019s antiquities department \u2014 we are transported back to the heroine\u2019s earlier life, long before she became mixed up with Wayne and Clark Kent. \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d directed by Patty Jenkins from a script by Allan Heinberg, briskly shakes off blockbuster branding imperatives and allows itself to be something relatively rare in the modern superhero cosmos. It feels less like yet another installment in an endless sequence of apocalyptic merchandising opportunities than like \u2026 what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for? A movie. A pretty good one, too.By which I mean that \u201cWonder Woman\u201d tells an interesting, not entirely predictable story (until the climax, which reverts, inevitably and disappointingly, to dreary, overblown action clich\u00e9s). It cleverly combines genre elements into something reasonably fresh, touching and fun. Its earnest insouciance recalls the \u201cSuperman\u201d movies of the \u201970s and \u201980s more than the mock-Wagnerian spectacles of our own day, and like those predigital Man of Steel adventures, it gestures knowingly but reverently back to the jaunty, truth-and-justice spirit of an even older Hollywood tradition.In the course of family arguments about Diana\u2019s destiny, the history of the Amazons is recounted, with emphasis on that tribe\u2019s ambivalent relations with men \u2014 meaning human beings generically and dudes in particular. There are none of the latter on the island, which has been sealed off from history and the rest of the world by a magic membrane. And then one day a screaming comes across the sky, and a World War I vintage fighter plane disgorges Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), a blue-eyed flyboy who is the living embodiment of the phrase \u201cnot all men.\u201dSteve, a spy for the Allies, is wearing a German uniform and is pursued by a flotilla of Teutonic bad guys, who battle the Amazons on the beach. The action hops to London and then to the trenches of Belgium, where the War to End All Wars slogs interminably on. There are fistfights in alleys and more extensive episodes of combat, during which Diana makes use of her aunt\u2019s training, traditional Amazon weapons (notably a glowing piece of rope called the Lasso of Truth) and her own unique abilities. She deflects bullets and mortar shells on a sprint across no-man\u2019s land, tosses an armored truck and demolishes a church steeple.But make no mistake: This is a star vehicle all the way. Ms. Gadot, who like the other Amazons speaks English with an accent (though hers, unlike Ms. Wright\u2019s or Ms. Nielsen\u2019s, may be a result of her Israeli background), has a regal, effortlessly charismatic screen presence. She and Mr. Pine, who has Paul Newman\u2019s seductive blue eyes and a hint of Clark Gable\u2019s raffish charm, give \u201cWonder Woman\u201d a jolt of classic Hollywood fizz. Their banter, long before that kiss, is lively and sexy, and their oil-and-water temperaments emulsify nicely.Ms. Jenkins and Mr. Heinberg have synthesized a plausible modern archetype out of comic-book and movie sources that may have seemed problematic to modern sensibilities. Diana is erudite but unworldly, witty but never ironic, supremely self-confident and utterly mystified by the modern world. Its capacity for cruelty is a perpetual shock to her, even though she herself is a prodigy of violence. Her sacred duty is to bring peace to the world. Accomplishing it requires a lot of killing, but that\u2019s always the superhero paradox.\u201cWonder Woman,\u201d though, resists the reflexive power-worship that drags so many superhero movies \u2014 from the Marvel as well as the DC universes \u2014 into the mire of pseudo-Nietzschean adolescent posturing. Unlike most of her male counterparts, its heroine is not trying to exorcise inner demons or work out messiah issues. She wants to function freely in the world, to help out when needed and to be respected for her abilities. No wonder she encounters so much resistance.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Cannes Film Festival, Celebrating the Old and the New", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byThe 50-plus premieres in the festival, which runs May 17 to 28, include works by Todd Haynes, Sofia Coppola, Michael Haneke, Noah Baumbach and Arnaud Desplechin, as well as special projects by Agn\u00e8s Varda, David Lynch and Abbas Kiarostami, who died in July. There\u2019s also plenty of new talent.\u201cCinema is a way of thinking about the world, of knowing others and of knowing oneself,\u201d Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the head of the festival, said in an interview. \u201cIn 1946, by creating the Cannes Film Festival, it was thought that cinema and culture were important in the reconstruction of the postwar world. We still think that culture, and therefore cinema, still has a say.\u201dMr. Fr\u00e9maux\u2019s strong sense of cinema\u2019s purpose is reflected in the strength of the auteur lineup (as well as the subject matter of several films that touch on topics like immigration). Every edition of Cannes is contingent on which directors have finished films in time for the festival, and Cannes this year benefits from a number of major filmmakers who took their ideas in new directions.Mr. Haynes\u2019s \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d one of the most anticipated titles, follows the journeys of two deaf children, each in a different time period, 1927 and 1977. It\u2019s adapted by Brian Selznick from his book, and in addition to its young leads, Oakes Fegley and Millicent Simmonds, it stars Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams.\u201cWhat\u2019s unique about this film, and one of the reasons I wanted to do it, is it\u2019s another thing I\u2019ve never done before, which was make a film I really wanted kids to be able to see,\u201d Mr. Haynes said. He added that in informal preview screenings, children responded well to the film\u2019s stylistic ambition in rendering the deaf experience.Mr. Haynes has plenty of company this year, including Ms. Coppola, who reinterprets \u201cThe Beguiled,\u201d a Civil War-era story originally starring Clint Eastwood in 1971, now with Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell; Bong Joon-ho, imagining a new kind of monster in \u201cOkja\u201d; Yorgos Lanthimos, likely to ruffle feathers with \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer,\u201d starring Mr. Farrell and Ms. Kidman; the cleareyed documentary veterans Claude Lanzmann and Raymond Depardon; two films by Hong Sang-soo; and Andrey Zvyagintsev, with the grim-sounding family drama \u201cLoveless.\u201dThe stature of the festival is also supported by the presence of Ms. Varda. Her \u201cVisages, Villages\u201d presents the fruits of her cross-country photographic project in France with the artist JR. And the film \u201cRedoubtable,\u201d directed by Michel Hazanavicius (\u201cThe Artist\u201d), portrays Ms. Varda\u2019s contemporary, the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, played by the French actor Louis Garrel, at a turning point in 1967.\u201cIt\u2019s a story of a man who wants to change but doesn\u2019t know how,\u201d Mr. Hazanavicius said. \u201cHe really revolutionizes himself.\u201dThe festival will also have its first full-fledged virtual reality entry in \u201cCarne y Arena,\u201d about the hardships of crossing the Mexican border with the United States, by the director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu.Television, already represented by the major players Netflix and Amazon, is another new wrinkle in this tradition-based festival. David Lynch\u2019s much-anticipated \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d revival will be shown, as will Jane Campion\u2019s and Ariel Kleiman\u2019s \u201cTop of the Lake: China Girl,\u201d with Elisabeth Moss and the ubiquitous Ms. Kidman.The festival\u2019s lineup may give the impression that it is solely focused on famous names, but the 2017 edition embraces the opportunity to track filmmakers tackling new challenges: the New York filmmakers Josh a and Benny Safdie, with the Robert Pattinson robbery picture \u201cGood Time\u201d; Jacques Doillon, with his biographical picture \u201cRodin\u201d; and Robin Campillo, with \u201c120 BPM [Beats Per Minute],\u201d a look at Act Up in the early 1990s. That list also includes filmmakers who stumbled somewhat with recent films, like Fatih Akin and Lynne Ramsay.\u201cThe vocation of Cannes, or all major festivals, is twofold: to honor great auteurs and make beautiful discoveries,\u201d Mr. Fr\u00e9maux said of the mix of filmmakers.The Un Certain Regard section has typically been the platform where such discoveries are made, with selections from around the globe. Mr. Fr\u00e9maux singled out Algeria (Karim Moussaoui\u2019s \u201cUntil the Birds Return\u201d) and Slovakia (Gyorgy Kristof\u2019s \u201cOut\u201d) as two rarely seen countries in the lineup, both with debut films eligible for the Cam\u00e9ra d\u2019Or. Also featured will be the festival veterans Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Mathieu Amalric, Laurent Cantet, Sergio Castellitto, Michel Franco and Valeska Grisebach.The festival is complemented by the vital selections of the Directors\u2019 Fortnight, with additional movies in another parallel program, Critics\u2019 Week. The Fortnight features new films by Claire Denis, Philippe Garrel, Abel Ferrara, Bruno Dumont and Sean Baker. Critics\u2019 Week includes a film by Fellipe Barbosa and a dark comedy-drama by Atsuko Hirayanagi with two executive producers who are not usually mentioned at Cannes: Adam McKay and Will Ferrell.\u201cWhen I hear all the good things, I start doubting things \u2014 it\u2019s too good to be true,\u201d Ms. Hirayanagi said. \u201cI think it\u2019s Japanese of me.\u201dThat trepidation is part of Cannes. It happens when the films have their debuts in front of the festival\u2019s audiences, but it precedes the festival, as filmmakers rush to finish their films in time.Ms. Denis\u2019s \u201cLet the Sunshine In\u201d opens Directors\u2019 Fortnight and stars Juliette Binoche, G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Alex Descas. The director remembered getting the welcome offer to open the Directors\u2019 Fortnight before the film was actually complete.\u201cThe Fortnight offer was sort of waving to us: Let\u2019s meet, let\u2019s be together, let\u2019s come,\u201d Ms. Denis said of the appeal of the deadline. \u201cIt was a possibility to experience happy fright.\u201dThat could also describe the nervous excitement with which Cannes audiences await each film: hoping for greatness, not quite knowing what\u2019s next.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Planning a Trip With the Help of Google Home", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byTest RunRoughly six months later, it\u2019s doing things it couldn\u2019t before, like tracking flight prices, giving directions and providing same-day updates on traffic to airports.The first and most important thing to know about Google Home is that while it speaks several human languages, it also has a language of its own.Google recommends starting each interaction with \u201cO.K., Google\u201d (\u201cHey, Google\u201d works as well), which will prompt the speaker into receiving a query properly. It will light up and flash its signals when it\u2019s ready.Patience is also crucial. If at first you don\u2019t succeed, it may not be because of what you\u2019re asking, but because of how you\u2019re asking it. For example:Human: \u201cO.K., Google, when does flight 3459 from Delta Air Lines arrive at La Guardia Airport?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not sure how to help. But my team\u2019s helping me learn.\u201dHuman: \u201cO.K., Google, when does Delta Air Lines flight 3459 arrive at La Guardia Airport?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cDelta 3459 from Pittsburgh to New York City is delayed and arrives in 32 minutes.\u201dI found this stage of my mock journey the most helpful and practical. Whether you need help deciding where to go or when to go there, Google Home has ideas.One of the neater tricks is asking it about what time of year is best to visit a city.Human: \u201cO.K., Google, when is the best time to visit London?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cAccording to Visit London, autumn is a lovely time to visit London, as the weather is mild (11 to 15 degrees Celsius)\u201d \u2014 52 to 59 Fahrenheit \u2014 \u201cand you can enjoy a variety of annual events, from Total Thames Festival to Halloween celebrations. To read more, look for the link in your Google Home App.\u201dOn my iPhone\u2019s Google Home app, there was a link to a visitlondon.com page with more details.Just ask it how much flights are to the city of your choice and give it your dates, and you\u2019ll get the current price and be asked if you want email updates when the price changes.Human: \u201cOK Google, how much are flights to Toronto?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cRound trip flights from New York City to Toronto leaving in two weeks start at $181. Do you have any dates in mind?\u201dHuman: \u201cMay 12th to May 15th.\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cRound trip flights from New York City to Toronto leaving May 12th and coming back on May 15th start at $215. I can keep track of the cheapest flights for those dates. Would you like to receive emails with updates?\u201dHuman: \u201cYes, please.\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cAlright, you\u2019ll receive an email if the price changes.\u201dI did get an email a few days later letting me know that cheapest flight was now $262.While you\u2019re finishing packing, looking for your passport and checking (twice) to make sure the burners are off, you can get a quick update on how long it might take to get to the airport.Human: \u201cOK Google, how long will it take to get to LaGuardia airport?\u201dGoogle: \u201cWith light traffic, it will take 8 minutes to drive to LaGuardia airport.\u201dThis sense of direction is not something Google Home had when it first came out, an example of its evolving capabilities. Before long you will also be able to book a car to the airport via voice, as the company says hands-free calls will be an option in the coming months.But when asking the assistant for directions, you do not yet get the detail you would if you were searching on Google Maps. When I asked Google Home how to get to La Guardia, it gave me only a general idea: \u201cvia 77th Street and Grand Central Parkway.\u201dSimilarly, if you\u2019re trying to get from Point A to Point B once you\u2019re in your destination city, Google Assistant gives you basic information, but it defaults to car directions, so you must specify how you want to get there.Human: \u201cO.K. Google, how do I get from the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto to the CN Tower in Toronto?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cAlright. The best way to get from Hockey Hall of Fame to CN Tower by car is via Front Street W and will take about 6 minutes in heavy traffic.\u201cHuman: \u201cO.K. Google, how do I get from the Hockey Hall of Fame to the CN Tower by public transport?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cFrom Young Street and Front Street West take 121 towards west, 121 departing in 5 minutes.\u201dGoogle will also give you the hours of operation if you ask, but cannot tell you what a ticket costs.At lunchtime, you\u2019re better off asking a local for recommendations or searching Google Maps the old fashioned way (on your smartphone).I asked Google where I could \u201cfind a good sandwich near the CN Tower in Toronto,\u201d and was given three highly-rated restaurants, but Sorella Sausages and Good Bite Restaurant were both roughly five miles away from CN Tower.This technology is still in its early stages, so unless you\u2019re already using Google Home as part of your daily routine, chatting with it is more of a fun thing for travelers to experiment with than a replacement for what you would normally use to help plan a trip. But the foundation is strong and its potential is exciting, and, as Google Home will sometimes tell you when it\u2019s stumped, it\u2019s \u201clearning more every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Signs a Deal to Stream Regular-Season W.N.B.A. Games", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byA few months ago, W.N.B.A. President Lisa Borders reached out to Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd, who had injured her ankle while playing in China. Borders wanted to see how Loyd was recovering. During their conversation, Borders also asked Loyd for any ideas on how to broaden the game and help expand the league\u2019s reach.Loyd recommended that the W.N.B.A. stream its games on Twitter, as other leagues have done. The idea struck a chord with Borders. On Monday night, the W.N.B.A. became the first women\u2019s professional sports league to sign a rights deal with Twitter.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to calling her and telling her that you made a suggestion, I heard it, we listened and we now have a deal with Twitter,\u201d Borders said on Monday afternoon.The games are exclusive to Twitter and are not simulcasts of local or national television games. Twitter is paying the W.N.B.A. guaranteed money to stream the games, but the league would not release the financial details. The W.N.B.A. also has a national television deal with ESPN that runs through 2022 and includes 16 games per season and coverage of the playoffs, the draft and the All-Star Game.\u201cWe are excited to help extend the reach of women\u2019s sports around the world by collaborating further with the N.B.A. to be the home of weekly live W.N.B.A. games for the next three seasons,\u201d Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a news release. \u201cThe growing women\u2019s basketball fan base will be able to turn to Twitter to watch free games side by side with the real-time conversation.\u201dThis is the latest sports deal for Twitter, which streams weekly out-of-market Major League Baseball and N.H.L. games, some PGA Tour events and other minor events.Facebook also recently struck deals to stream live sporting events. During the 2016-17 season, the N.B.A.\u2019s Development League games were streamed on Facebook Live. In March, Facebook and Major League Soccer announced that at least 22 games in the 2017 season would be available on Facebook.\u201cSports are inherently social, with the power to build and connect communities around the world,\u201d Dan Reed, Facebook\u2019s head of global sports partnerships, said in a statement. \u201cThis aligns closely with our mission, and we feel Facebook is a natural home for sports content, including live games. Early experiments with these events on Facebook have delivered great results for fans, broadcasters and rights holders.\u201dFor now, major broadcasters like ABC/ESPN, NBC, CBS and Fox Sports dominate the market for sports rights and pay hundreds of millions of dollars to televise games. Major internet companies like Facebook and Amazon have the financial resources to compete with traditional broadcasters, although they have not invested much money in sports rights deals so far.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet how to make these profitable in their own right, but because there\u2019s a belief that it can be value-enhancing, I think you\u2019re just going to see more deals of this nature so long as the leagues are willing to sell those rights separately,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.He added, \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s worth putting some money into because they may want to go bigger.\u201dStill, deals with internet and social media companies are a way for smaller leagues like the W.N.B.A. to add revenue and experiment with new ways to show their games. In 2016, the W.N.B.A. streamed the ring ceremony for the Minnesota Lynx on Facebook.\u201cIf folks can\u2019t be physically in a market inside an arena, then we look for them to use tools like Twitter to enjoy the games,\u201d Borders said. \u201cFolks have their choice of when they want to see games and how they want to see games. This is a real nod to the future, on recognizing that some of our fans are consuming sports in very different ways.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anne R. Dick, Memoirist and Writer\u2019s Muse, Is Dead at 90", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byThe events and emotions of that marriage turn up again and again in Dick\u2019s novels, transfigured into science fiction. Anne Dick, as Ms. Rubenstein became, made custom jewelry, which was a major plot element in his best-known novel, \u201cThe Man in the High Castle.\u201d Their children\u2019s Barbies are featured in \u201cThe Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,\u201d where colonists on Mars escape their wretched existence with reality-altering drugs and Perky Pat dolls.The couple were also devoted to their sheep, which are prized possessions in his celebrated novel \u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,\u201d the basis for the film \u201cBlade Runner.\u201dAbove all, Ms. Dick shows up in female characters. She inspired Juliana, the heroine of \u201cHigh Castle,\u201d who has no trouble slashing a Nazi operative\u2019s throat, as well as a number of shrill, carping, unhappy wives in other books.\u201cI was a good \u2014 what do you call it? \u2014 muse,\u201d Ms. Dick said in a recent interview.Ms. Dick died of congestive heart failure on April 28 at her home in Point Reyes Station, Calif., her daughter Tandy R. Ford said. She was 90 and had never remarried.If there were another parallel universe, in which the Dicks had never met, none of this might have happened.\u201cAnne sparked Phil to an incandescent level of achievement,\u201d Gregg Rickman, a biographer of Philip K. Dick, said in a telephone interview.Anne Browning Williams was born on Jan. 16, 1927, in West Englewood, N.J. Her father, Arthur Williams Jr., was a Wall Street executive who was ruined in the 1929 crash. He died when Anne was still a child. Her mother, Hazel Johnson Williams, moved back home to St. Louis with her children.Ms. Dick was a 20-year-old student at Washington University when she met her first husband, Richard Rubenstein, a poet from a well-off St. Louis family. He helped found the little magazine Neurotica \u2014 \u201cfor and about neurotics, written by neurotics\u201d \u2014 which was an influence on the budding Beat generation.The couple moved to San Francisco, had three daughters and immersed themselves in the vibrant local poetry scene. They started another poetry magazine, Inferno, and then a third, Gryphon, which published early work by Robert Creeley and Denise Levertov.On a whim, the couple moved again, in 1955, this time to Point Reyes Station, an isolated farming community north of San Francisco. In 1958 Richard Rubenstein was being treated in an East Coast psychiatric clinic for depression when he abruptly died, apparently from an allergic reaction to tranquilizers.Three weeks later, Anne Rubenstein met a new couple who had just moved to town, Phil and Kleo Dick. After a whirlwind affair, Dick moved in with Anne in the spacious modernist house she had shared with Mr. Rubenstein.\u201cHe used to help with the cooking,\u201d Ms. Dick said of the author. \u201cHe would mop the floors. He was lovely with the children.\u201dBored with science fiction and unable to interest publishers in his mainstream novels, Dick quit writing to help his new wife in her jewelry business. He liked that even less, and so he pretended to work on a new novel. To make it look realistic, he said in a 1976 interview with Science Fiction Review, he had to start typing.What emerged was \u201cThe Man in the High Castle.\u201d It was dedicated, cryptically and not altogether favorably, to his wife, \u201cwithout whose silence this book would never have been written.\u201d (In the 1970s, Dick changed the dedication, dropping Anne Dick entirely.)Ms. Dick said she saw only the pilot of the Amazon series, finding the Nazis a little too threatening.Much of Dick\u2019s work explores the slippery nature of reality. His third marriage proved no less elusive.\u201cI never did understand why he left me; I don\u2019t think people really understand other people,\u201d Ms. Dick said. \u201cIt took me years to get over him. I swear, I thought about him almost continually, obsessively.\u201dThe couple had a daughter, Laura. \u201cI think he was like another child,\u201d Ms. Dick said. \u201cHe was really a very, very nice husband.\u201dNice, except for when his paranoia kicked in. One day they were driving out of a field after putting lumber in the barn. Dick opened the gate; Ms. Dick gunned the motor, and he ran off.\u201cI guess he thought I was trying to kill him,\u201d she said.She often gave as good as she got, however. Dishes flew during quarrels, and so did furniture. Husband struck wife, and wife struck him back.\u201cThey were both very powerful people, and when two powerful people get together, sometimes dynamite goes off,\u201d Ms. Ford, her daughter, said.The nadir came in 1963. Dick had his wife involuntarily committed to a local psychiatric center for two weeks. The ward was kept locked, but according to Ms. Dick\u2019s book, he told the doctors that he was the one who should really be locked up.\u201cI was very good at denial \u2014 or was it faith \u2014 or bourgeois family values \u2014 or an excess of loyalty?\u201d Ms. Dick wrote. When he gave her a garbage disposal for Christmas, however, she did insist that he take it back.She remained in the same house in Point Reyes Station for the rest of her life. In later years, as her jewelry business waned, she used it as a bed-and-breakfast inn. For about $100 a night, people could rent the room where Dick had worked on \u201cHigh Castle.\u201d In truth, though, most visitors were focused on hiking the nearby national seashore.One of Ms. Dick\u2019s daughters, Jayne Reano, died in 2012. The three others \u2014 Ms. Ford, Hatte Blejer and Laura Leslie \u2014 survive her, as do nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.Ms. Dick was making plans in recent months to self-publish her first novel, \u201cGravity Slide,\u201d which tackles the eternal Dick theme of the fluid nature of reality.The heroine, who moves between our world and a world in which the Japanese detonated a nuclear bomb over Los Angeles to win World War II, meets a writer named Philip K. Dick. She tells him that she is from the parallel reality he depicts in his book \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t believe her.Advertisement"}

Back home in Berkeley, \u201cEverywhere that I took it, people would run down the street after me and ask, where could they get this thing?\u201d Mr. Goldwater said.Monkeylectric \u2014 no one remembers how it got the name \u2014 sits at the intersection of safety and art, with an overlay of whimsy. Cyclists pay $25 to $60 for a set of lights to attach to their bicycle wheels. When the wheels spin, they produce rotating light shows with various designs: rainbows, hearts, a skull-and-crossbones or geometrics.\u201cMy colleagues love them and love recommending them,\u201d said Christopher Kisicki, a cycling associate at the flagship store in Seattle of REI, the sporting goods retailer. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep them in stock,\u201d he said.Monkeylectric does $1 million in sales annually. There is the Christmas rush and in summer, the Burning Man bump.\u201cI hate to say it, but it\u2019s almost mandatory to have them on your bike at Burning Man,\u201d said Jefferson McCarley, manager of the Mission Bicycle Company, which builds custom bikes in San Francisco.Monkeylectric\u2019s market is a niche one, but growing: As of 2015, 885,000 people commuted on bicycles in the United States, up from 488,000 in 2000, according to the Census Bureau. And biking in the dusk or dark is clearly very dangerous. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, bicycle deaths occur most often from 6 to 9 p.m.In an unscientific survey along San Francisco\u2019s Market Street one night last week, most cyclists had front lights and weak red reflectors on the back (as required by law), but no side lights. Few bicycle lights are as eye-catching or noticeable to motorists as Monkeylectric\u2019s lights. They are sold in 500 stores and on Amazon, which offers many similar-looking products for much less money.Mr. Goldwater calls many of those products knockoffs. Every year, he said, he saw a half-dozen more companies based in China with look-alike lights that sell for $10 or $15. Mr. Goldwater, who holds five patents on bicycle lighting, refers to them as \u201ctoys,\u201d although some consumers fail to see the difference.Cheaper lights, Mr. Goldwater said, tend to be dim, not very durable and not waterproof.James Hill, a worker owner at Missing Link, a cooperative bicycle shop in downtown Berkeley, who monitors bike lights when he is in his car, recalled being at a stoplight with his wife late one afternoon when they watched a cyclist whip across the road, with \u201cvery impressive lights,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of inventions are terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of them are great.\u201dMonkeylectric lights \u201care arguably the best way to be seen\u201d by motorists, he said.Janelle Wong, operations manager at the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group with 10,000 members, has Monkeylectric lights on three of her five bicycles. \u201cIt\u2019s an affordable way to light up a bike,\u201d she said.The co-founder of Revolights, Kent Frankovich, a 33-year-old mechanical engineer, began his quest for a better bike light after pedaling into a pothole one night while commuting from Stanford University where, among other things, he helped design a solar-powered freezer. Before entering the bicycle business in 2011, he was a researcher at a biorobotics lab and at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, helping build an instrument that identifies rocks and soil on Mars.Despite his product\u2019s benefits, Mr. Frankovich said, \u201cIt\u2019s a hard sale.\u201d Many cyclists are minimalists, reluctant to add anything to their simple mode of transportation.That a product improves safety is insufficient. It has to be cool, Mr. Frankovich said. \u201cWho in the world doesn\u2019t know a helmet will save your life?\u201d he said. Yet many cyclists reject them because \u201cthey think they look dorky.\u201dAt several bike stores contacted for this article, sellers said they liked Revolights, but considered them on the expensive side, particularly for cost-conscious consumers who buy modestly priced bikes.But that is not a problem at the Mission Bicycle Company, the custom bike shop that builds $999 bicycles. Revolights are \u201cfashion forward, high-tech lights,\u201d said Mr. McCarley, the manager. \u201cOur customers appreciate minimalism.\u201dYears ago, the Mission Bicycle Company shared a Kickstarter campaign with Revolights, but today, Mission Bikes is developing an LED wheel light to be built into its bikes.Before Mr. Goldwater started Monkeylectric, he considered his art project \u201ca Ferrari.\u201d The market was there, but, he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine how I could make a commercial project out of it.\u201dHis early work would become a precursor for Monkeylectric\u2019s high-end product that, when spun, shows video clips of, say, a swimming fish or a running dog \u2014 for $1,000.When Mr. Goldwater got started, there was already one LED bicycle light company, Hokey Spokes. Carole Barnes, who with her husband, Richard, bought the business in 2005, said they had since \u201clost our enthusiasm.\u201d They sell a few hundred lights a year, she said.Mr. Goldwater started working on his product 12 years ago, when he was an electrical engineer at the MIT Media Lab researching smart paint and self-assembling robots. He made what he calls \u201ca monumental art piece\u201d \u2014 the bicycle with kaleidoscope wheels he rode at Burning Man. For an electrical engineer who cycles, adding LEDs to wheel spokes \u201cis a coming-of-age project,\u201d Mr. Goldwater said.The appeal is obvious: \u201cWhen you spin, the effect is much greater than when you started,\u201d he said.Lights on rotating wheels create what scientists call persistence of vision, which is an illusion. When bicycle wheels with LED lights rotate, our eyes perceive moving light as a continuous image.Monkeylectric has gone to the Kickstarter well three times. The last time, it raised $248,331, many in preorders for new lights that automatically turn on when rotated in the dark.Mr. Frankovich, the founder of Revolights, holds six patents on bicycle lighting. He has raised funds on \u201cShark Tank,\u201d Indiegogo and Kickstarter.Both companies have marketed their products on Facebook, Instagram and other sites. But Mr. Frankovich said that nothing compared with \u201cstreet viral marketing\u201d \u2014 cyclists pedaling dark streets, with wheeled illumination.\u201cEvery bike is a little billboard for us,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of a bicycle shop in downtown Berkeley. It is Missing Link, not Missing Links. And an earlier version of a picture caption misstated the surname of Monkeylectric\u2019s top engineer. He is Phillip Yip, not Ye.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hollywood Writers and Studios, Scrambling to Avert Strike, Reach Last-Minute Deal", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood writers reached a tentative deal for a new three-year contract with television and movie studios early Tuesday, averting a strike in dramatic overtime negotiations.At nearly 1 a.m. on the West Coast, weary union leaders, including Patric Verrone, the former president of the Writers Guild of America, West, emerged from the offices of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, and said that a favorable contract had been drawn up.In a statement posted on its website, the Writers Guild, West, said it had made \u201cunprecedented gains.\u201d It added, \u201cDid we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild\u2019s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept.\u201dIn a one-sentence joint statement, writers and the producers\u2019 alliance said that they had secured \u201ca tentative agreement on terms for a new three-year collective bargaining agreement.\u201dThe previous contract between studios and more than 12,000 writers expired at midnight. The Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, had vowed to go on strike as soon as Tuesday morning.Union negotiators had locked horns with their studio counterparts all the way through. On Sunday, studios had made a new offer \u2014 one reflecting improvements in some areas (health care) and scant movement in others (raises for streaming series) \u2014 and the unions on Monday made counteroffers that held a hard line on multiple demands, according to three people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings.A deal only started to take shape as midnight approached, with both sides scrambling to find common ground.Writers and studios did not see eye to eye on several issues involving technology. Most prominently, writers wanted pay rates for shows that run on streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime to be more like those for blue-chip broadcast network series. The unions also wanted members to receive bigger residual payments for online reruns of old shows and movies.Another sticking point involved what is known as \u201cspan,\u201d or how long TV writers spend on each script. There are more shows than ever, but networks are ordering many fewer episodes per season \u2014 as few as six, compared with 22 or more in the past. At the same time, the episodes that are ordered are taking longer to produce \u2014 up to three weeks per episode, rather than the usual two. So series writers who are paid per episode are often making less while working more.Under proposals discussed Monday, according to analysts at Moody\u2019s, higher compensation for writers would cost some entertainment companies $100 million to $125 million annually for each year of a new three-year contract. Unions representing directors and actors \u201cwill likely key off any agreement\u201d with writers, adding to cost increases.The actors\u2019 contract with studios expires on June 30.As the entertainment capital waited for word on talks on Monday, union members, including one involved with talks, posted messages on Twitter using the hashtag #wgaunity. Eileen Conn, whose credits include the Disney Channel series \u201cK.C. Undercover\u201d and the 1990s sitcom \u201cJust Shoot Me,\u201d posted a photo of Sally Field as the title character from the film \u201cNorma Rae\u201d and wrote: \u201cWe are strong! We are united!\u201dSome prominent politicians joined them. \u201cI stand with the Writers Guild of America for fair pay and decent health care because it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2014 and because Bruce and I can\u2019t wait for the next season of \u2018Ballers\u2019 to start,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Facebook, referring to her husband, Bruce Mann.In the last big Hollywood strike, a decade ago, an enraged Writers Guild walked out for 100 days over pay for digitally distributed shows. Tens of thousands of entertainment workers were idled, and the action cost the Los Angeles economy more than $2 billion, according to the Milken Institute.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Netflix-Cannes Clash Couldn\u2019t Be Avoided", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byCANNES, France \u2014 France is a paradise for moviegoers, with thriving cinemas and state subsidies for new productions. Netflix is a global streaming giant founded on the concept that movie theaters are a thing of the past. So it was perhaps inevitable that the two worlds would collide over the Cannes Film Festival, which begins here on Wednesday.At the heart of the Cannes-Netflix clash is what\u2019s known as the French cultural exception, a law that requires a percentage of all box office, DVD, video on demand, television and streaming revenues to be pooled to finance homegrown films and help finance foreign films. The law also mandates a 36-month delay between theatrical release and streaming date. Netflix has not wanted to participate in the French system, and that offended some in the film industry here.\u201cThey are the perfect representation of American cultural imperialism,\u201d said Christophe Tardieu, director of the National Cinema Center, known as the CNC, a state entity that coordinates public financing of films. It also underwrites more than half the budget of the Cannes Film Festival and has seats on its board, as do French movie theater owners. \u201cI deplore Netflix\u2019s attitude in this affair, which showed total intransigence and refusing to understand and accept how the French cultural exception works,\u201d Mr. Tardieu added.Representatives of Netflix did not respond to requests for comment. After the festival\u2019s decision last week, Reed Hastings, a co-founder of Netflix, posted on Facebook, \u201cThe establishment closing ranks against us. See \u2018Okja\u2019 on Netflix June 28th. Amazing film that theatre chains want to block us from entering into Cannes film festival competition.\u201dIn contrast, another streaming company, Amazon Studios, says it aims for theatrical releases for its films. It has a film in competition at Cannes this year, Todd Haynes\u2019s \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d which will be shown in theaters in France.\u201cCannes misjudged,\u201d said Thomas Sotinel, a film critic and journalist at Le Monde. Festival programmers thought \u201cthey could get away with showing Netflix movies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they found out Netflix wouldn\u2019t move, and at the same time they were reminded that on the board of Cannes sit people like the theater owners, who don\u2019t want to budge either. So they were caught between those two very immovable protagonists \u2014 or rather, antagonists.\u201dIn France, the CNC said the Netflix films did not qualify for limited releases under an exemption for less mainstream work. But if Netflix had agreed to a wide release, it would have meant a 36-month wait before the movies could be streamed. That delay is part of France\u2019s \u201cmedia chronology\u201d in the cultural exception law, which sets a strict time frame in which a film moves from theaters to video-on-demand after four months, to cable television after 10 months, to free television after 22 months and finally to a streaming service.Most of the entities in France\u2019s film industry, as well as viewers, agree the 36-month wait is far too long, but complex talks about altering the time frame broke down just days before Cannes announced its rule change.Any new chronology must be approved by cinema owners, producers, cable and free television broadcasters, on-demand operators and associations representing writers, among others. Cable television operators like Canal Plus, which help finance productions aimed for theatrical releases, eventually want those films to be shown on their channels before they move to free channels or to a service that is not contributing to the financing system.\u201cThe difficulty is that you have a system that\u2019s extremely regulated but that works,\u201d said Marc-Olivier Sebbag, the general delegate of the National Federation of French Cinemas.\u201cThere are idiotic rules that don\u2019t let Netflix films come out for 36 months; I understand it\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Pascal Rogard, director general of the authors\u2019 society. \u201cThe real open question that will be given to the next culture minister is, \u2018Can we create a modernized media chronology so a film doesn\u2019t have to wait three years to go to Netflix?\u2019\u201dMr. Rogard and others said that they hoped the new government of President Emmanuel Macron would dedicate some political will to helping the parties shorten the time frame. Mr. Macron is expected to name a new culture minister this week.Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the Cannes Film Festival director who oversees selecting films for competition, said he had no comment beyond the official statement last week.That statement said that the festival was \u201caware of the anxiety aroused by the absence of the release in theaters of those films in France,\u201d adding that it had \u201casked Netflix in vain to accept that these two films could reach the audience of French movie theaters and not only its subscribers.\u201d As a result, it stated, \u201cthe festival regrets that no agreement has been reached.\u201dOn Monday, the festival announced that its opening and closing ceremonies would be broadcast to select French movie theaters \u2014 at the same time they\u2019re broadcast live on Canal Plus pay television.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buying Into the Turmoil: Investors Embrace the Risks", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byBuy the dip.Be it stocks, bonds or more complex derivative bets, investors following this Wall Street maxim have reaped robust rewards in recent years.Such buying has been evident in the shares of large American companies since March 2009, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index touched a low of 666. (It closed on Wednesday at 2,399.63.)Yet as stock markets hit record highs and the yields on volatile junk and emerging market bonds plunge, this view that market corrections should be seen as a buying opportunity, as opposed to a warning to be heeded, has begun to worry investors.The fear is that each subsequent rebound will embolden excessive risk taking and inflate richly valued stock and bond markets.Investors have repeatedly shaken off the risks of political turmoil, including the latest shock, President Trump\u2019s firing of James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, the S.&P. 500 ended the day up 0.11 percent, while the VIX was still near its decade lows, at 10.21.\u201cNo one has been penalized for buying the dip,\u201d said Bill Luby, an independent investor and active blogger who specializes in trades connected to the VIX.Until recently, he has been an active participant in Wall Street\u2019s most popular trade: Betting against VIX futures with the expectation that market volatility will remain quiescent.Now, he is worried about what will happen when the dip becomes something more severe than just a temporary dip, and the index bolts higher as investors panic.\u201cThat trade is really loaded up,\u201d Mr. Luby said. \u201cIt won\u2019t take much of a spike to cause a lot of pain.\u201dShorting, or betting against, the VIX is not the only trade of late where investors have been handsomely compensated for setting aside their fears.Investors have been snapping up government bonds issued by countries like Russia, Turkey and even Mongolia, enticed by mouthwatering yields and a perception that economic and political risks, which previously warned investors away, are no longer so severe.And in the United States stock market, stock pickers continue to ignore sky-high valuations of stocks and the market as a whole, buying up index giants like Amazon, which has a price-to-earnings ratio of 136, Apple and Facebook at the slightest sign of weakness.Few are predicting an outright market collapse.Economic growth, at home and abroad, is picking up, and the earnings for companies listed on the S.&P. 500 have been strong. And even with the political upheaval in Washington, most market participants remain convinced that the Trump administration\u2019s pledges for lower taxes and lighter regulation will provide ballast to the market.And with bank deposits and bonds from developed countries still offering meager returns, stocks and higher-risk fixed-income securities have come to be seen as the default option for investment managers looking to the long term.Nevertheless, the combination of complacency and rising markets has prompted a growing number to become more cautious.\u201cWe have been in a long up cycle and valuations are above average,\u201d said Bradley J. Vogt, a portfolio manager who invests in large capitalization United States stocks for the Capital Group, the Los Angeles-based fund giant that oversees $1.4 trillion. \u201cI am holding more cash than I usually hold in my funds right now.\u201dTo be sure, some of this recent spate of buying can be explained as investors looking for bargains in beaten-down areas \u2014 like emerging markets.Having lagged the broader rally in recent years, these markets took a further hit in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Currencies tumbled and investors took flight, fearful of the administration\u2019s anti-trade policies and a resurgent dollar, not to mention the usual dose of political turmoil.Nishant X. Upadhyay, an emerging market bond investor at HSBC Global Asset Management, took the opportunity late last year to buy Turkish government bonds, betting that worries about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his political ambitions were overdone.It was a winning trade \u2014 bond yields have fallen and the lira has strengthened substantially. Now, billions of dollars (Mr. Upadhyay estimates over $30 billion last quarter) are flowing into emerging market bonds as investors rush in to get a piece of the action.\u201cNo doubt the spreads are tightening,\u201d he said, in describing how the recent boom in the asset class has made them less attractive relative to lower-yielding bonds in developed markets. \u201cAnd there are risks out there. But the question is: Do you want to be sitting in cash right now or investing your dollars in alternative markets?\u201dFund managers with a long memory argue that while it may be true that markets are richly priced, it would be a mistake for investors to try to predict when markets will fall and remove their funds accordingly.Especially now, when cash and safe government bonds are such unattractive alternatives in terms of investment returns.Indeed, for all the ups and downs in the stock market over the last five years, the total return of the S.&P. 500 stock index is up close to 15 percent \u2014 beating most of the opportunities available to investors.\u201cThe view we frequently hear today is, \u2018aren\u2019t stocks expensive now given S.&P. price to earnings multiple,\u2019 which is at a 15 to 20 percent premium to the historical average,\u201d said William C. Nygren, who has been investing in United States stocks, under the Oakmark Funds brand, at Harris Associates in Chicago for more than 30 years.Making market timing bets have been a \u201ckiss of death\u201d for investors over the years as stocks continue to rise over the long term, he said.And that holds true for today, he believes.\u201cWe have better economic growth looking forward the next five years than we do looking backward,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cAnd alternative asset classes offer returns that are exceedingly low.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Online Marketplace That\u2019s a Portal to the Future of Capitalism", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byThe Money IssueAbout three years ago, like millions of other Instagram users, I became acquainted with an app called Wish. At first, my awareness was purely subliminal. Wish ads appeared in my social-media feeds without explanation or context, peddling a deliriously weird selection of heavily discounted products: a smartwatch for under $20; selfie sticks for around $5; a \u201cself-stirring mug.\u201d By the end of 2015, though, these posts were appearing with striking frequency. That year, Wish\u2019s parent company was reported to be one of the largest advertisers on Facebook and Instagram during the holiday season.Finally, I relented. A friend and I signed up and agreed on an amount each of us would spend on the other. The packages, ordered over the course of New Year\u2019s Eve, would be surprises. Ordering on Wish, I soon found out, is dangerously easy. (When I signed up, the first purchase was free; I chose yellow toe socks.) Shopping involves scrolling through an intoxicating admixture of goods: Commodity necessities appear next to fast fashion and knockoff apparel; extraordinarily cheap but on-trend electronics mingle with what I can only describe as global manufacturing overspill. Among the items I sent to my friend, on our modest budget: a laser pointer; 100-count \u201csuper strong\u201d small magnets; a functioning violin; a spare part for the window mechanism on an Audi A6; a deep-V-neck sweater; and of course, the self-stirring mug. Shipping was often free, or only a dollar. The items were extraordinarily well reviewed, often by thousands of customers. The deals seemed, if not exactly too good to be true, at least economically unfeasible \u2014 which, close enough.My experience as a recipient was more informative. A sampling of my haul, clearly selected under the influence: \u201cMacho Man\u201d Randy Savage-style sunglasses with built-in Bluetooth speakers; a pillow cover emblazoned with unrepeatably offensive text; a T-shirt with an obscene graphic print; a pale silkish robe; a bag of loose Sri Lankan coins; a fondant mold shaped like a human fetus; and a 12-hole ceramic ocarina. Packages arrived in waves over the next month, carrying with them a hint at what makes operations like Wish possible: their shipping labels. Most were classified as \u201cePacket,\u201d courtesy of the United States Postal Service and China Post.These shipments were made in accordance with a bilateral trade agreement between the United States and China that originated in 2010, meant to address the rising tide of cross-border e-commerce. Items up to 4.4 pounds \u2014 more than the weight of, for example, a violin and bow \u2014 can be shipped as ePackets, at extremely low rates with tracking numbers and delivery confirmation. Tracking is crucial for foreign sellers that are up against consumer skepticism and comparatively slow shipping times. The deal seems to have worked: ePacket\u2019s usage has ballooned in recent years.This obscure trade deal has become the quiet conduit for an explosion in a new and underexamined American consumer behavior: buying things directly from their countries of manufacture. (Similar agreements also exist with Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.) This, obviously, presents a problem for the stores and retailers accustomed to serving as importers themselves. Brick-and-mortar retailers are already experiencing a grim 2017, shedding tens of thousands of jobs a month under pressure from e-commerce. Cross-border purchases compound the issue: Because of ePacket, and the decades-old international postal agreements that serve as its foundation, lightweight product shipments from China are heavily subsidized by the U.S.P.S. \u201cIt\u2019s providing an artificially low rate,\u201d says Jim Campbell, a consultant and lawyer specializing in international postal law. \u201cIt\u2019s redistributing wealth, and the winners are essentially the big exporters.\u201d Accordingly, these agreements have drawn intense criticism from American retailers large and small. In 2015, an Amazon representative testified in front of Congress about what he called a \u201ccompletely unnecessary and illogical\u201d system.It\u2019s tempting \u2014 and not entirely unfair \u2014 to see this surge in American cross-border shopping as nothing more than a strange side effect of international postal policy. But that would be too tidy. Wish certainly illuminates the peculiarities of international shipping, but it casts a much brighter light on the state of globalized manufacturing and commerce. In fact, it offers a somewhat convincing vision of what they might become in the near future.The Walmart shopping experience is largely opaque with respect to the chain\u2019s dependence on imports. A product\u2019s country of origin is relegated to labels or printed on mandatory stickers, subordinate to a curated and thoroughly American shopping experience. Wish wastes no such effort on concealing its international character. Its product selection feels like a churning, infinite cascade; its lack of any sort of organizing principle is part of the reason it\u2019s so hard to stop scrolling. More recently, I ordered a smartwatch for the cost of a combo meal. The seller has shipped more than 13,000 units through Wish, and the watch has been reviewed more than 2,000 times. A single day produced ratings written in English, Spanish, Danish, Cebuano, German, French and Romanian.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Washington Welcomes the Wealthiest", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byInside WealthWealth in Washington is being redefined, as the region\u2019s modest millionaires give rise to a new class of superrich.For years, Washington and its surrounding suburbs have been among the most affluent in the country. The four highest-earning counties in the United States, as measured by median incomes, are all near D.C., according to the Census Bureau. The top three are in Virginia \u2014 Loudoun County, followed by Falls Church City (an independent city treated by the Census Bureau as a county) and Fairfax County \u2014 and No. 4 is Howard County, Md.The region also has plenty of millionaires. Maryland, Virginia and Washington are all in the top 10 for millionaires per capita, according to Phoenix Marketing.But there has always been a sharp distinction in D.C. culture between being wealthy and being rich. Let New York and Los Angeles have the mansion-owning, Ferrari-driving, yacht-loving billionaires. The Washington elite were content with a three-bedroom colonial, two incomes and top private schools. Its handful of billionaires were mostly local sports team owners little known outside the capital.Prices and sales of multimillion-dollar mansions are surging. Flashy luxury brands more commonly associated with Madison Avenue and Rodeo Drive are doing brisk business near the Capitol. Celebrity chefs are opening up elaborate restaurants and charging very un-Washington prices (think $280 tasting menus).Along with the region\u2019s traditional Priuses and Mercedes S.U.V.s, six-figure sports cars like Aston Martins and McLarens are now selling well.\u201cThe wealth here is exploding,\u201d said William Shawn, a longtime Washington lawyer who, as a side venture, recently opened a dealership selling Aston Martins and Bentleys. \u201cI\u2019m still amazed at the amount of money that people have coming into the showroom.\u201dThe most obvious signs are in real estate. The average price of a property costing $1 million or more rose by 33 percent in the first quarter, according to Redfin. That increase is among the largest in the country.Part of it was driven by the billionaires and millionaires in the Trump administration. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary and a former hedge fund manager, paid $12.6 million in February for an estate in Massachusetts Avenue Heights. Wilbur Ross, the billionaire commerce secretary, paid $10.75 million in January for a Beaux-Arts mansion in the same neighborhood.Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state and former Exxon Mobil chief executive, paid $5.6 million for a colonial in the Kalorama neighborhood, where Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are renting a six-bedroom home for $15,000 a month.The record smasher for real estate in Washington, however, isn\u2019t linked to the Trump administration. Jeff Bezos, the chief of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, paid $23 million for the former Textile Museum in Kalorama and plans to convert the 27,000 square feet, spread across two buildings, into a single-family home.Brokers say that record may not last long.\u201cI think we\u2019re just seeing a whole new level of client in the city,\u201d said Mark Lowham, a real estate agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in Washington.He has an eight-bedroom home listed for $22 million on Chain Bridge Road in the city\u2019s northwest. He also has a penthouse condominium at the Ritz-Carlton in Georgetown listed for $9.95 million.While those are far from New York prices, they are a quantum leap for Washington. Mr. Lowham said he recently sold a $7.5 million condo on Water Street, which runs along the Potomac River.The buyers aren\u2019t just locals. Increasingly, the superrich from around the world are discovering the benefits of owning a home in Washington. Aside from being a bargain compared with New York or London, it gives business owners and power players access to the seat of government.\u201cThese people already have a home in London and Hong Kong and New York, and they realize that if they add Washington to their portfolio, they can entertain there and advance their cause,\u201d Mr. Lowham said.At a time when many malls are struggling, Tysons Galleria, in McLean, Va., which has tenants like Bottega Veneta, Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada, is reporting growing sales. Instead of a food court, the mall has brought in Mike Isabella, a chef and restaurateur, to build a 41,000-square-foot dining complex with eight eateries, including a raw bar and a tapas restaurant.\u201cOur sales have been strong, and luxury sales have been among the strongest,\u201d said Rich Dinning, the senior general manager of Tysons Galleria.The new administration may be contributing to Washington\u2019s affluence, but big money is also coming from start-ups and newcomers from out of town. A 25-year-old recently walked into Mr. Shawn\u2019s car dealership and paid $340,000 in cash for an Aston Martin Vanquish. The customer said he had recently sold a tech company he founded for tens of millions of dollars.\u201cThe government may have got a lot of this started,\u201d Mr. Shawn said, \u201cbut with cybersecurity now, you\u2019ve got a lot of these smart guys forming their own tech or telecom companies and doing well.\u201dWhile his dealership still lags those in Los Angeles; Greenwich, Conn.; and Palm Beach, Fla., when it comes to sales, Mr. Shawn said, \u201cWe\u2019re closing in fast.\u201dThe Inside Wealth column last Sunday, about rising wealth in Washington, misspelled the name of a county nearby that is among the highest-earning in the country. It is Loudoun County, Va., not Loudon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "20 Years On, Amazon and Jeff Bezos Prove Naysayers Wrong", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byDealBookSkeptics of Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s founder, have spent the better part of the past two decades second-guessing and vilifying him: He has been described as \u201ca monopolist,\u201d \u201cliterary enemy No. 1,\u201d \u201ca notorious international tax dodger,\u201d impossible, a ruthless boss and \u2014 more than once \u2014 \u201cLex Luthor.\u201d His company used to routinely be described as Amazon.con.But you know what?Here we are, 20 years later, and Mr. Bezos has an authentic, legitimate claim on having changed the way we live.He has changed the way we shop. He has changed the way companies use computers, by moving much of their information and systems to cloud services. He\u2019s even changed the way we interact with computers by voice: \u201cAlexa!\u201dEven Warren Buffett was skeptical of Amazon way back when. \u201cI was too dumb to realize what was going to happen,\u201d he admitted at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting this month. \u201cI\u2019ve admired Jeff, and I\u2019ve admired him for a long, long time. But I did not think he was going to succeed on the scale that he has.\u201dMr. Buffett added, \u201cWe missed it entirely.\u201dHe called Mr. Bezos\u2019 work \u201ca remarkable business achievement,\u201d saying, \u201cOne person has built an extraordinary economic machine in two pretty different industries almost simultaneously, from a standing start at zero, with competitors with lots of capital and everything else.\u201dMr. Buffett\u2019s partner, Charles T. Munger, put it this way: \u201cJeff Bezos is a different species.\u201dToday, Amazon\u2019s valuation is $464 billion \u2014 twice the value of Walmart.If you had invested $10,000 at the I.P.O., you\u2019d have nearly $5 million today.Sometimes praise is due. And he is clearly having a moment.Perhaps the most surprising thing Mr. Bezos was able to accomplish, despite his detractors, was to find investors willing to trust him enough to invest in Amazon even as it racked up losses after losses.That\u2019s not to say investors were always happy with Mr. Bezos \u2014 they would frequently punish his stock, making it seem like a volatile investment. Then, every so often, he would surprise investors with profits, as if to suggest, \u201cYes, we can make money whenever we want, if we don\u2019t want to invest in the future.\u201dMost executives are worried about the next quarter, but Mr. Bezos is worried about what will happen years from now. That is a competitive advantage that many chief executives could learn from.\u201cBut,\u201d he continued, \u201cif you\u2019re willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you\u2019re now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that.\u201dTo Mr. Bezos\u2019 credit, he was always upfront with his ambitions and long-term approach. \u201cBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh trade-offs differently than some companies,\u201d he wrote in his first letter to shareholders in 1997. \u201cWe aren\u2019t so bold as to claim that the above is the \u2018right\u2019 investment philosophy, but it\u2019s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren\u2019t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\u201dNone of this is meant to suggest that Mr. Bezos is perfect. Far from it. He has repeatedly failed \u2014 remember his ill-fated foray into mobile phones? \u2014 but he has succeeded enough to outweigh his failures. And along the way, he is likely to fail again, something he says he embraces.Is Mr. Bezos an easy boss? Hardly. He is unbelievably demanding. But it is difficult to believe that the creative new products Amazon has incubated and introduced could have been born if he were a professional soul-crusher.As an author, I\u2019m supposed to hate Mr. Bezos. After all, he has pressured publishers, cut their margins and practically put old-school bookstores out of business. As if to rub it in, he\u2019s now introducing bricks-and-mortar Amazon bookstores.But to take that view would be to misunderstand what innovation looks like. It upends industries \u2014 witness the current carnage in the retail industry, which has been outmoded by Amazon and all the companies trying to copy it.And the future is now happening to retail stores and even supermarkets \u2014 Mr. Bezos\u2019 next conquest. And the future is clearly happening to enterprise computing.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a tough one, although that depends largely on your wheelhouse and your ability to stick with it.Oh, the mistakes I made. Overwrites over overwrites, but that\u2019s O.K.

On Saturday, we are reminded that we are human and fallible, so that by the time Sunday rolls around and the puzzle has let up to a Wednesday-Thursday difficulty level, we are ready for the grace of being right again.It\u2019s every solver for themselves today, but here are a few selected tough ones:\u25a0 24A: Wordplay alert! \u201cNonnative plant?\u201d sounds like a live plant that came from another country, but today it\u2019s a SPY, because a spy is embedded or planted in a community.\u25a0 28A: IN ESSE is Latin for something that is \u201cexisting\u201d or real.\u25a0 21D: This one smacked me in the back of the head. I read \u201cThey\u2019re old and tired\u201d multiple times before I realized why the answer was USED CARS: used cars are old ... and they have tires.\u25a0 31D: You want to tap a maple tree for its sap? Get yourself a SPILE.I always wanted to try my hand at a triple-stack. They\u2019re often filled with gluey crossing answers, not a surprise considering how many triplets of letters must be worked around. It was a (mostly) fun process of attempting this grid over and over \u2014 and over and over \u2014 and over and over \u2014 to generate a stack that had both some sizzle and a high degree of cleanliness.Ah, there was SPILE. As a \u201cHunger Games\u201d lover, it didn\u2019t occur to me at first that SPILE might be esoteric. I would have paid whatever it cost to send in that SPILE Katniss and Peeta (when they needed to tap a tree to avoid dying of thirst.)Okay, I admit it. I\u2019m odd.Triple-stacks often don\u2019t have many long crossing answers, or when they do, those crossing answers can be on the dry side. So I worked hard to stick with friendly and flexible letter combinations, like ANE (that became CANDY CANE), EAT (EATS RIGHT), ELD (ELDER WAND).I can just hear the sci-fi/fantasy haters going off again about that last one, but ELDER WAND is at least made up of two real words, so non-Harry Potter fans (pagans!) ought to at least be able to infer it.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Networks Offer Taste of TV\u2019s Ad Future. Marketers Are Hungry for More.", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingAmerica\u2019s biggest television networks invited advertisers to New York institutions like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center last week, giving them an early glimpse at their fall lineups and treating them to lavish parties and a parade of stars including Stephen Colbert, Kim Kardashian and Tony Romo, all with the aim of attracting billions of dollars in advertising by the end of the summer.The tradition dates to the 1960s, when viewing habits were entirely different. And while the networks have spent the past few years trying to convince marketers of their digital prowess despite falling ratings and new platforms for watching TV, Silicon Valley seemed to cast an especially long shadow this year.\u201cMost networks are starting to recognize that the standard model of 18 minutes of 30-second spots in a 60-minute show will never grow and is probably not sustainable,\u201d said Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer at the agency OMD. \u201cJust making more compelling shows is not going to solve that problem.\u201cThat goose continues to lay golden eggs; they\u2019re just smaller every year,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cThis is the same challenge the record companies had: How fast do you shift to a new model at the risk of your existing, lucrative one?\u201dTurner Broadcasting, which owns channels like CNN, TBS and TNT, especially impressed advertisers with its presentation. The company emphasized its willingness to experiment with new, longer formats for traditional commercials and said it would continue to reduce the number of ads it runs during shows. It is risky to cut back on ad inventory, especially as ratings decline, but the company contends that doing so creates a better viewer experience and more effective, engaging commercials.Turner also highlighted its new data and audience-targeting collaboration with its rivals Viacom and Fox Networks Group and the number of video-on-demand rentals its properties commanded in the first quarter.\u201cI was really kind of blown away by Turner,\u201d said Lou Paskalis, an executive at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who oversees paid media investments. He said the company\u2019s presentation, as well as some of the new advertising ideas discussed by Fox Networks Group and CBS, addressed the major concern that he and other marketers shared: How do you compete for consumers\u2019 attention, especially as they move to block ads and turn to platforms like Netflix, where running commercials is not an option?\u201cIf the consumer\u2019s in control, you have to figure out how to adapt your consumer experience to the device they\u2019re going to consume your content on,\u201d he said.The Fox group also discussed a new system for measuring the effectiveness of ads on its online properties to help marketers determine which versions to use just hours later on traditional TV.That fits into a broader narrative in the TV industry, in which executives have long complained that as Americans increasingly watch shows on an array of devices, and do so outside the three- or seven-day windows that are now measured, networks are not getting full credit for their total audience figures.Joe Marchese, Fox Networks Group\u2019s new ad sales chief, dismissed Facebook\u2019s claim that it could offer advertisers a \u201cSuper Bowl on mobile every day,\u201d saying that the number of video ad minutes available in Fox\u2019s prime-time broadcasts \u201cdwarf\u201d those on YouTube and Facebook.Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal\u2019s ad sales chief, expressed skepticism that people \u201cliking\u201d an ad or product on Facebook actually led to sales. And Les Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, cited Amazon, Apple and Google as companies that, like the network, were \u201call about mass audience\u201d while noting that all three also paid to advertise with CBS.Still, the new ideas about advertising did not dominate the presentations, in part because the concepts are still evolving but mostly because the traditional way of selling TV ads remains the biggest moneymaker for the networks.\u201cThe statement used to be \u2018digital pennies for TV dollars,\u2019\u201d said Mike Law, executive vice president for video investments at Amplifi, Dentsu Aegis Network\u2019s investment arm. \u201cNow it may be digital nickels for TV dollars, but the vast amount of revenue these networks are generating is coming from TV. In a marketplace we think will be down a little bit in spend volume, networks getting their fair share of revenue is critical to them.\u201dThat may have to change, particularly now that networks have given marketers a taste of new possibilities. Mr. Paskalis of Bank of America, for one, was left wanting more.\u201cThe thing I\u2019d like to see the most, frankly, is even more focus on user experience and opportunities for marketers to join the conversation around the programming than just advertise adjacent to the programming,\u201d Mr. Paskalis said. He offered examples like creating polls in advance for marketers to run related to particular plot developments in scripted shows and allowing brands to sponsor limited commercial interruptions.\u201cHow can marketers do more to add to the experience,\u201d he said, rather \u201cthan just be the tax you have to pay to enjoy the experience?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon to Share New Building With Homeless Shelter in Seattle", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byThe motel was on a chunk of downtown property where Amazon planned to eventually erect yet another set of sparkling buildings to meet its insatiable need for office space in this city, where it has come to embody both the region\u2019s economic boom and its struggles with affordability. The hotel would be torn down and the shelter kicked out when that time came.Instead, Amazon has decided to let the shelter stay. In an unusual arrangement, the company has agreed to give the shelter, Mary\u2019s Place, a permanent home inside one of the new office buildings for which it will break ground in the fall.Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter, providing it with 47,000 square feet of space with private rooms that can hold 65 families, or about 220 people and their pets. The facility, expected to open in early 2020, will have its own entrance and elevators.\u201cI see it as this huge gift because everywhere we go, we end up leaving,\u201d said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary\u2019s Place, which runs seven transitional shelters around the Seattle area meant to house families until they can find permanent homes. \u201cYou come in and become a fabric of the neighborhood you\u2019re in, and then you say goodbye. That\u2019s a hard thing for a lot of people to do.\u201dIn an interview at the current Mary\u2019s Place site owned by Amazon, which was bustling with families returning to the shelter for the evening, John Schoettler, Amazon\u2019s vice president for global real estate and facilities, said the company would spend \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d on the design and construction of the shelter\u2019s portion of the building. Amazon will pay the utilities for Mary\u2019s Place, which will occupy the space rent free, although the organization will continue to pay its own staff.\u201cToo often, homelessness gets pushed to the other side of the tracks,\u201d Ms. Roman said. \u201cKeeping them as neighbors is nice.\u201d\u201cIts reputation in Seattle has certainly suffered,\u201d said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research organization focused on the Pacific Northwest. \u201cDoing things like this may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see.\u201dAmazon is also a different company from just a few years ago. It now has 30,000 employees in the city, making it Seattle\u2019s largest private employer, and it has transformed large swaths of the downtown and South Lake Union neighborhoods.One of the residents of Mary\u2019s Place, Patricia Abbott, a mother of four, said she became homeless after losing her job when her son was injured and she needed to tend to his medical needs. She has been at the facility for six months and learned of Amazon\u2019s support for the organization at the shelter\u2019s Christmas party when she received an American Girl doll for one of her children from the company.\u201cThere\u2019s people out there who really do care,\u201d Ms. Abbott said.Mr. Schoettler said he proposed the plan to let the shelter remain at a meeting in January of Amazon\u2019s senior leadership, including Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Schoettler made the invitation to Ms. Hartman of Mary\u2019s Place last week, she said in an interview on Monday.\u201cIt\u2019s permanent,\u201d Mr. Schoettler said, pausing for a moment before adding, \u201cUntil homelessness is solved.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Art Market Is Still Waiting for an Online Revolution", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byYet at least one sector seems firmly resistant to the convenience of the click: the buying and selling of fine art.\u201cIt\u2019s still tiny,\u201d Robert Read, head of art and private clients at Hiscox, said of the online art market. \u201cThe market is crowded and fractured, and still has to deal with trust issues.\u201dThe Hiscox report, compiled by the market analysts ArtTactic based on responses from 758 art buyers and 42 company managers, found 59 businesses actively engaged in either selling art directly online or using some kind of web-based platform to facilitate such sales. It said no dominant player had yet emerged from the competitive shuffle. Established auction houses with physical showrooms have made a comeback over e-commerce specialists.Hiscox\u2019s 2017 ranking of the top 25 online art sales platforms, based on the sample\u2019s usage and satisfaction rates, was led for the second year by Christie\u2019s, a 250-year-old auction house that values online sales more as a marketing tool than as a revenue stream. Sotheby\u2019s, its 273-year-old rival, was ranked second.\u201cThe single biggest reason for our online sales is to bring in buyers to Christie\u2019s,\u201d said Marc Sands, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cLive auctions have a certain barrier. It\u2019s not the case with online. It\u2019s brought in a whole new vista of audiences.\u201dHiscox said, however, that the level of existing art buyers converting to online sales remained static for the third consecutive year. \u201cHesitant art buyers remain unconvinced about buying art online,\u201d its report said. \u201cLack of physical inspection remains the key challenge.\u201dThat might be the case for higher-priced unique works, which represent an immovable mountain of value in the art market, but, as the Hiscox report notes, online bidding is making an impact lower on the price chain, particularly at auctions of prints.One such print sale, Phillips\u2019s Editions auction in New York last month, raised $6.2 million, the most ever by the company in this category. Eighty-eight percent of the lots found buyers, with 35 percent going to online purchasers. More than half of those internet buyers were using Phillips\u2019s own online channel, with the remainder bidding through intermediaries such as Artsy, Invaluable and eBay, said Andy Foster, the auction house\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\u201cThe job of the digital area is to get every other possible bidder internationally,\u201d Mr. Foster said, adding that $100,000 remained a ceiling for many online buyers.\u201cIt turned out to be a sleeper,\u201d said Lark Mason, an Asian art specialist who is president and founder of the iGavel and Lark Mason Associates auction companies. Mr. Mason added that a Western client had bought the vase, now thought to be a rare 15th-century example, without seeing it in person against competition from 14 other bidders.Mr. Mason, like the Hiscox report, sees online auctioneering as the key battleground for e-commerce in 2017, with the major auction houses facing down dozens of online companies that are now going sink or swim in a smaller pool of available business. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a drop in demand and the market is dependent on regional auctions at the lower end,\u201d Mr. Mason said. \u201cBut because of the open access of the internet, now everybody is competing against everybody else.\u201dArtsy, with its depth of editorial content and network of commercial partnerships with major auction houses, dealers and art fairs, is No. 3 in the Hiscox rankings, followed by 1stdibs and Artnet. Definitive sales figures, let alone profits, are hard to find in the online sector. But the 16-year-old 1stdibs, which provides an online sales platform for dealers, is bringing in more than $150 million per year, according to the report.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge market,\u201d said Mr. Fabre, who estimated that as much as $8 billion worth of art could have been left unsold at auction last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the most glorious. The auction houses don\u2019t look at it. I do.\u201dThe site displays items with a catalog description and recommended price, but does not reveal the identity of the auction house. When a sale is negotiated, Auction AfterSale splits the buyer\u2019s fee with the house. At least, that is the business plan.Mr. Fabre said he had approached more than 500 auction houses worldwide to collaborate on after-sales. So far, no major auction house has agreed.Auctionata, which is based in Berlin, has not survived. Paddle8, with headquarters in New York, has reopened as an independent company through a management buyback.\u201cI\u2019m surprised there hasn\u2019t been more consolidation. I know it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Mr. Read, Hiscox\u2019s head of art and private clients, who wrote the foreword to the insurer\u2019s report. \u201cBut in the art world, there will always be a bricks-and-mortar market.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Studios in Leavesden, England, and Ms. Gadot, clad in Wonder Woman\u2019s outfit of leather bustier, very brief skirt and knee-high boots, had just finished the umpteenth take of her heroic dash across a stretch of muddy ground.\u201cThe cold, ugh, that was the hardest thing about shooting the movie,\u201d Ms. Gadot said during an interview in Los Angeles in early March. Tall and rangy, she was eight months pregnant (she has since given birth to her second daughter), with hair scraped back in a ponytail and her face free of makeup. Eagerly eating eggs and fruit (\u201cI\u2019m starving all the time\u201d), she chatted easily about the role that might turn her into a household name after \u201cWonder Woman\u201d is released on June 2.\u201cI think what the studio realized was that they had an asset to exploit, to pull in a larger section of the populace that would ordinarily not be our demographic for that kind of film,\u201d said Charles Roven, a producer of the film. \u201cWhen you open your eyes to that opportunity, you get excited about it.\u201dDaniel Loria, an editorial director at Boxoffice Media, said statistics suggested that the audience for superhero movies \u201cis not as male dominated as one might think.\u201d\u201c\u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 last summer had a big pushback; a segment of a more extreme audience found it sacrilegious that women would be cast,\u201d Mr. Loria said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not seeing that internet fanboy outrage over \u2018Wonder Woman.\u2019\u201dThough the track record for female-led superhero movies is mixed \u2014 \u201cCatwoman\u201d bombed in 2004, but \u201cElektra\u201d did O.K. the next year \u2014 the stubborn perception remains that fans don\u2019t turn out for these films.Asked whether she felt the pressure of being the first actress in a long time to carry a live-action superhero movie, Ms. Gadot laughed. \u201cWhen you put it like that, yes!\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, that can\u2019t be something that drives me. I tried to focus on what is important for me: the heart of the character, and how to deliver the best result in the most interesting way.\u201dBut Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company, said that because Wonder Woman was such a well-known character, he didn\u2019t think that audiences would necessarily care about a big-name actor in the role. \u201cIn some ways, I think there is an advantage to casting someone unknown; when it\u2019s Ben Affleck playing Batman, it\u2019s hard not to look at that and see Ben Affleck,\u201d he said. He added that Warner Bros. had a lot riding on the film, apart from having a female lead.\u201cThe first two films in the series, \u2018Man of Steel\u2019 and \u2018Batman v Superman,\u2019 did well but were panned by critics,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think the pressure is on to make a better movie, or they risk burning out interest in their universe.\u201dMs. Gadot, who grew up in a small town near Tel Aviv, \u201cin a very normal family,\u201d said she had never aspired to be an actress when growing up, although she always enjoyed performing and took dance classes from an early age. \u201cFor a while, I wanted to be a choreographer,\u201d she said. After finishing high school, she was persuaded to enter the Miss Israel contest; to her shock, she won, and subsequently spent a few months modeling before becoming a combat instructor in the Israeli Army during her two years of mandatory service.After leaving the military, she started law school. \u201cA casting director saw my card at my modeling agency and wanted me to test for a Bond girl,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not an actress, it\u2019s in English, it\u2019s pointless.\u2019 I literally went to keep my agent happy.\u201d She didn\u2019t get the part (it went to Olga Kurylenko), but the process of callbacks and screen tests awoke her interest in acting.\u201cI had been talking to them about \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 for 10 years,\u201d Ms. Jenkins said in a recent Skype interview. \u201cThey were interested, but they had a certain idea of what they wanted to do, and didn\u2019t feel I was the right director. Then, I think they realized that they did want to go in my direction.\u201dThat direction, Ms. Jenkins said, was \u201ca very straightforward origin story, true to the positive spirit of Wonder Woman, a great love story, a good sense of humor.\u201dTo that end, \u201cWonder Woman\u201d is faithful, she said, to the legend told by the original comics. Diana Prince, born on the all-female island of Themyscira, is trained as an Amazon warrior, and first sees a man when an American pilot, Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine) crash-lands on the island and tells of a world at war. After the island is attacked, Diana decides to go with Steve to try to stop the war. (The one deviation from the original story, Ms. Jenkins said, was to switch the time period from World War II to World War I.)William Moulton Marston, Wonder Woman\u2019s creator, posited Diana as an alternative to aggressive male superheroes. She is a protector of the innocent, beautiful and good, as well as endowed with superpowers, magical weapons and great strength. The comic-book drawings also convey sexual allure, with Diana in cleavage-baring bustiers and high heels that can seem at odds with the feminist message the character is said to embody.\u201cI think as a feminist, you should be able to wear whatever you like!\u201d Ms. Gadot said. \u201cIn any case, there is such a misunderstanding of the concept. Feminism is about equality and choice and freedom. And the writers, Patty and myself all figured that the best way to show that is to show Diana as having no awareness of social roles. She has no gender boundaries. To her, everyone is equal.\u201dMs. Jenkins, the first woman to direct a big-budget superhero movie, answered with a firm no when asked if she felt all eyes were upon her. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to make a great film about a great, universal character and not be laden down with issues.\u201dBut Robin Wright, who plays Diana\u2019s aunt and mentor, Antiope, said that she did think a superhero film about a woman, directed by a woman, was a watershed moment. \u201cWe were the majority, they were the minority,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of estrogen on set! It was really nice to have a bunch of gals making the movie. It was a lot of physical hard work and so much fun.\u201dReflecting on making the movie, Ms. Gadot said that as the mother of two girls, she felt proud to have played a superhero who can offer a new role model. \u201cWe have seen so many male-driven stories, so the more strong, female narratives we have, the better,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure the movie will inspire girls, but you can\u2019t empower women without empowering men, too. I hope Wonder Woman will be an icon for them, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Giving the Behemoths a Leg Up on the Little Guy", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtEvery year, the internet gets a little less fair. The corporations that run it get a little bigger, their power grows more concentrated, and a bit of their idealism gives way to ruthless pragmatism.And if Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, gets his way, the hegemons are likely to grow only larger and more powerful.This column is nominally about network neutrality, the often sleep-inducing debate about the rules that broadband companies like Comcast and AT&T must follow when managing their networks. But really, this is a story about ballooning corporate power.Which brings us to net neutrality. The rule basically prevents broadband providers from offering preferential treatment to some content online \u2014 it blocks Comcast from giving, say, a speed boost to a streaming video company that can afford to pay over one that cannot.The fight over network neutrality is often seen as a battle between telecom companies and internet companies \u2014 between fat-pipe providers like Comcast (which stand to make some money by charging for priority lanes) and digital innovators like Google (which might have to pay up). As a matter of lobbying, the two sides are definitely in opposition: Broadband companies cheered Mr. Pai\u2019s speech, while the Internet Association \u2014 a group that represents dozens of large and small internet companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 opposed it.So the better way to think about the rules isn\u2019t in terms of what these companies do, but rather in terms of size. Does ending network neutrality help the big fish or the little fish? Will scrapping the rules make the internet fairer, more dynamic and more innovative? Will it create a more favorable atmosphere for potential challengers of the Frightful Five?Probably not. In fact, it could entrench their power even further.But today, Mr. Wu sees neutrality rules as having a broader purpose \u2014 protecting innovators not just from broadband companies, but also from the internet giants that now rule the network.Excerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\u201cIn the earliest days we were trying to save companies like YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s as much about trying to save the net from YouTube as it is about saving YouTube.\u201dBut Mr. Wu points out that at least the giants now have to do something to respond to rivals. In the absence of neutrality rules, all they might have to do its buy up access to speedy lanes online, thus easily preventing rivals from ever working well on people\u2019s phones.\u201cSnapchat has grown up in an era of network neutrality, and I think Snapchat owes some of its existence to net neutrality,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t been able to destroy it yet, and they would have had an easier job in a non-net-neutrality world. The question is, will Facebook and Comcast be able to join together and gang up on a future Snapchat?\u201dThe internet giants \u2014 who, remember, are in favor of neutrality rules \u2014 don\u2019t exactly agree that the rules also help keep the internet giants in check. But they do agree that the rules could help start-ups.\u201cInternet companies of all sizes believe that the current F.C.C. net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,\u201d Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said in an email. He added: \u201cSilicon Valley, since its birth, has held to the belief that the best ideas can compete and win in the marketplace. Consumers and the internet ecosystem benefit when start-ups can leapfrog incumbents, and net neutrality is key to preserving this ethos.\u201dMeanwhile, opponents of network neutrality argue just the opposite \u2014 that removing the rules would actually strengthen start-ups.\u201cThe big companies are already getting huge speed advantages because they\u2019ve built out massive online infrastructure,\u201d said Bret Swanson, who studies telecom policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cBut the upstart that doesn\u2019t have the massive infrastructure and doesn\u2019t have tens of billions of dollars to build it, that company could use things like paid priority to enter this competitive market.\u201dIn other words, if broadband companies start taking money to speed up certain content, start-ups could use that offer to make their content just as fast as that of any tech giant.Well, maybe. Mr. Swanson\u2019s theory rests on the assumption that the new rules would not permit unfair practices. If Google, Facebook or some other giant offered a broadband company millions to block a rival\u2019s service, Mr. Swanson said that could trigger antitrust investigations and other negative consequences for the behemoth.\u201cThe basic antitrust and competition laws will still be applicable, and so companies couldn\u2019t just exclude rivals in this way,\u201d he said.I\u2019m less sanguine. American regulators have shown a near total lack of interest in pursuing tech giants \u2014 and most other companies \u2014 on anticompetitive issues. It does not look like that\u2019s going to change under President Trump.The giants seem likely to keep getting bigger. If we give them a chance to buy up every fast lane online, we\u2019ll be removing another check on their untamed power.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drones Kill, Yes, but They Also Rescue, Research and Entertain", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byOne day in 1945, the crew of the aircraft carrier Intrepid gathered on deck for a group picture with what looks like a model airplane, not too much larger than the radio-controlled planes that hobbyists had been flying since the 1930s.It was a drone.Named for the buzzing sound it made in flight, and manufactured in the thousands during World War II, it served as a remote-controlled target for gunners.The toylike drone had a nifty feature. If the gunners failed to bring down the drone, an operator on deck could send a radio signal that released a small parachute, allowing the drone to float down, ready for pickup and reuse.The show is timely. It seems as if each day\u2019s news brings reports of a military drone attack, or developments in Amazon\u2019s plan to set up a drone-delivery system for small packages. The future is now, drone-wise.\u201cDrones,\u201d like the mind-boggling gadgets it describes, covers a lot of ground, with just enough pop culture diversion, \u201cJetsons\u201d-style futurism and hands-on interaction to keep the exhibition from becoming a drone catalog.The long historical road leading to the eBee, and onward to the Amazon Prime Air drone, starts with the Civil War, for the visitor, and it is a journey worth taking. Charles Perley, a New Yorker, might be considered the father of the drone. In 1863, he patented a bomb-dropping balloon intended to fly over enemy defenses and drop its payload, causing death and confusion. No one could perfect a timing device, so balloon bombing never got out of the starting gate.Fast forward to the Bug, developed during World War I. Resembling a small biplane, it could, in theory, fly over enemy trenches, shed its wings and become, like Clark Kent leaving the phone booth, a lethal weapon. More than a thousand were manufactured, but the war ended before the technology could be employed.There is a Wile E. Coyote aspect to these clever, but not quite clever enough, inventions. The Japanese, in one of the odder experiments in World War II, outfitted paper balloons with incendiary bombs and sent them on an eastward course across the Pacific, transported by a steady air current that Japanese scientists had chanced upon. More than 9,000 balloons made the journey, landing from Alaska to Mexico, and as far as Michigan, their goal to ignite forest fires and spread mayhem.The program was remarkably ineffective, although a balloon bomb was responsible for the only civilian deaths inflicted by the Japanese on the American mainland. In May 1945, Elsie Mitchell, a pastor\u2019s wife, took five children for an outing near Bly, Ore. All were killed when the children poked at a balloon bomb that had lodged in a tree.But back to the drone pictured in the 1945 photograph aboard the Intrepid. It was a TDD, which stands for Target Drone, Denny, and it had a Hollywood connection. Denny was named for Reginald Denny, a suave English leading man during the silent era and, later, a reliable silver-haired uncle in the talkies. Like many others inspired by the feats of Lindbergh and Earhart, he had become a model-airplane hobbyist. He opened a hobby shop and created the Radioplane Company to manufacture model airplanes and engines.In 1940, Denny won an Army contract to produce radio planes as target drones for military use, and at this point, Ronald Reagan enters the picture. As captain at the head of a motion picture unit popularly known as the Celluloid Commandos, and a friend of Denny\u2019s, he sent Pvt. David Conover to take some routine pictures of civilians doing war work at the Radioplane plant in Culver City, Calif.Private Conover trained his lens on a 19-year-old assembler, Norma Jeane Dougherty, who posed, holding a propeller and flashing a million-dollar smile. He told her she was photogenic and should consider a career in modeling. We all know the rest of the story, but the exhibition gives it a slightly different spin: No drones, no Marilyn Monroe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York City Landlords Are Offering Deals", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported by360 ViewNew York City\u2019s rental season kicks into high gear this month, as college graduates start looking for apartments, along with anyone else hoping to move when the weather is warm and school is out. Most years, apartment hunters see rents rise with the temperature. But this season, as the rental market enters its third slow year, renters may instead see some deals.In an effort to lure new tenants, landlords are coming up with increasingly creative offers. Want a free year\u2019s subscription to Netflix with that lease? You might be able to get it. How about a flat-screen TV? That could be on the table, too. Even the security deposit could be up for negotiation, as landlords have been reducing that fee, too.As thousands of new apartments flood the housing market, landlords face steep competition. Last year, 8,774 market-rate units opened in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with an additional 15,291 opening this year, according to Citi Habitats, a brokerage firm. Even though those apartments are among the most expensive in the city, so much new inventory is having an impact on prices at older buildings, even in neighborhoods without much new construction. So landlords are looking for more novel ways to stand out, without actually lowering the rent.Although discounts are concentrated in neighborhoods with new construction, like Downtown Brooklyn and the financial district, landlords across Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn are sweetening the pot. Such offers are not as prevalent in the Bronx or Staten Island, however, because those boroughs have yet to see the same rapid development and price escalations. New projects are scheduled to open in both boroughs in the coming years, potentially changing those markets.\u201cIt\u2019s a good season for renters,\u201d said Grant Long, the senior economist for StreetEasy, adding, \u201cThe concessions are here to stay.\u201dBecause of all these concessions, asking rents have largely held, even though the amount paid works out to be lower when the concessions are calculated. In April, the median rent in Manhattan was $3,417 a month, 0.1 percent higher than the same time a year ago; in Brooklyn, it was $2,800 a month, 0.7 percent higher than the previous year; and in Queens, where concessions were highest, the median rent rose 12.2 percent during that period, to $3,088 a month, according to the Douglas Elliman report.TF Cornerstone, which owns and operates over 7,000 rental units in the city, is one such landlord, offering discounts to avoid cutting the rent. For many of its listings, the company pays the broker\u2019s fee and reduces the security deposit to $1,000.Some offers seem more like gimmicks than genuine discounts. Does a one-year Netflix subscription, worth around $100, really make a difference in a tenant\u2019s life? Rents are punishingly high in New York, and the cost of moving is staggering. How much would a few free Uber rides really affect your bottom line if you pay $4,000-a-month rent? Renters who really just want to pay less rent might not be convinced.Shop around, and there\u2019s a good chance you can find a deal, or haggle until you get one.Some brokers, however, are confident the deals will shrink, and in some cases evaporate, come summer.But the market still has a long way to go before all the new apartments get rented. Thousands of units haven\u2019t even opened yet, and most cost more than what many New Yorkers can afford. As those apartments hit the market, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a roller coaster,\u201d said Mr. Maundrell.So what does renting in a roller coaster market feel like? For Beatriz Ramos, 33, who works in business development and recently moved to New York from San Francisco, it meant looking at 100 apartments in search of a $2,800 one-bedroom. About a third of the listings offered discounts. Some brokers called or emailed her a few days later, hoping to lure her back to apartments no one seemed to want.Without the discounts, Ms. Ramos said she would not have been able to afford the apartment, which has a 600-square-foot private terrace. \u201cI have trees and a hammock,\u201d she said. \u201cWho in New York has a hammock? I\u2019m pretty happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It gets double points for managing to pull off that project with style and charm, not self-seriousness.Mel has smartly identified that while there are seemingly boundless publications dedicated to chronicling the lives of teenage girls \u2014 see Seventeen, Teen Vogue, Rookie, et. al \u2014 few seem invested in adolescent men beyond their stereotypes, so it\u2019s publishing a yearlong deep dive into the lives of teenage boys.I am obsessed with this recently transplanted Japanese reality show. I\u2019ve decided it counts as reading because it has subtitles.Like any real American, I\u2019m well versed in the tropes of our nation\u2019s reality television traditions, and it\u2019s their absence that makes \u201cTerrace House\u201d so deliciously destabilizing to view. In this show, six young people are chosen to live in a house, and \u2026 that\u2019s it. There is truly no script \u2014 the scenes are too mundane to be invented. When conflicts unfold, the unfailingly earnest housemates try to solve them constructively.But then, at regular intervals, the show cuts to a panel of cynical Japanese comedians who viciously roast the participants and bicker over their romantic prospects. The guilty-pleasure narratives that are baked into the structure of so much of American reality TV are instead applied on top by the comedian panel, and the results are equal parts mesmerizing and confounding. I have no idea why it\u2019s called \u201cTerrace House.\u201d__________Edited by Andrea KannapellAdvertisement"}

That has often led to claims by tech executives that the region has an anti-American bias, accusations that European policy makers deny.Facebook, experts say, is only the latest in a long line of Silicon Valley companies to face European regulatory anger, though this time, the focus is likely to be on the reams of online data gathered, including information that Facebook collects on both its users and nonusers through third-party websites.While Facebook started in the United States and has expanded aggressively across the developing world, its actions in Europe \u2014 and the response to those acts by local officials \u2014 are likely to have implications on its global operations.The company\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin. Though that is mostly for tax purposes, it gives European data protection and antitrust officials wide scope to monitor and police Facebook activities involving its more than 1.5 billion users outside North America.In the past, for instance, Facebook has been forced to alter its privacy settings for all of its users worldwide after European privacy campaigners brought legal challenges to how the social network collected and used people\u2019s data.The changes come as policy makers worldwide vie for influence over how people use digital services, including potentially putting limits on how companies like Facebook operate so as to exert some control over the internet.\u201cIt was inevitable that there would be this type of struggle,\u201d Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, said in an interview last year. \u201cThe internet is not used to national borders.\u201dAfter Facebook announced last year that it would use WhatsApp data to bolster its wider advertising business, American privacy campaigners filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, putting forward similar arguments to those made against the partnership in Europe.\u201cU.S. antitrust law has failed to keep up with the digital economy and the emergence of monopoly services,\u201d Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said in an email. \u201cThere is far too much \u2018lock in\u2019 with a dominant provider, and far too much consolidation of personal data.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Frightful Five\u2019 Aren\u2019t So Scary, as Long as They\u2019re Competing", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewThey are each assembling enormous pools of data about their users \u2014 which they use not just to sell more targeted advertising, but to improve and personalize their services, increasing their network advantage against smaller players.In most tech markets, multiple players reach viable scale. And consumers often have an incentive to switch between competing services, based on convenience and price.Not only are these titans vulnerable to regular existential threats (recall Microsoft\u2019s unbreakable hegemony over PC software that didn\u2019t translate to mobile computing), they are also all converging \u2014 therefore competing \u2014 with one another.It is easy to see how commentators get worked up about Facebook, given it controls several large, overlapping networks including WhatsApp and Instagram. But the claim that it has a monopoly over content providers, is risible. Even if Facebook were the singular acquirer of content, that would make it a monopsonist, not a monopolist. This distinction is critical because a monopsonist \u2014 who is the only buyer for a given set of suppliers \u2014 uses its power to squeeze input prices (like the sole employer in a town, keeping wages low). Whereas a monopolist uses its power to raise consumer prices.Facebook\u2019s importance as a major traffic source for many content sites is self-evident, but publishers still go directly to consumers and use other significant intermediaries \u2014 notably Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The woes of the publishing industry are because of the impact of the internet, not Facebook.Mr. Thompson unconvincingly asserts that Facebook\u2019s power over publishers produces a \u201cdead weight loss\u201d (where monopoly taxation leads to a waste of resources) and that consumers are afflicted by Facebook\u2019s stifling of innovation. But Facebook users are not suffering under the yoke of oppressive masters. On the contrary, they are benefiting from a period of intense competition.The same applies when it comes to entertainment. Netflix isn\u2019t one of the big five, but it enjoyed a brief honeymoon as a monopoly after it crushed Blockbuster. But just a few years later, it faces intense competition around the globe. While the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, may say that \u201csleep\u201d is his company\u2019s major rival, in reality, Amazon and Alphabet \u2014 not to mention Hulu, HBO and myriad local players \u2014 prevent Netflix from running away with the market.For diapers, dog food, videos, music, cloud-computing services, voice technology and so forth \u2014 it faces extreme competition from other tech companies, not to mention traditional retailers. Walmart alone is still four times its size in retail (albeit much smaller online). In video and music, Amazon is an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix and Spotify. And in cloud computing, Amazon faces serious competition from Alphabet and Microsoft and others, which offer similar services, also on a grand scale.It is blindingly obvious that traditional retailers are suffering. But holding Amazon responsible for the decline in brick-and-mortar retail is like blaming Craigslist for the death of print classifieds. The natural gravitational pull of the internet caused those problems, not one company.While almost all of the hand-wringing about tech monopolies is overblown. The player that perhaps warrants the closest scrutiny today is Alphabet, and in particular its Google search engine.Google\u2019s overwhelming dominance of search (it has 90 percent market share in United States search revenue) is particularly critical given search\u2019s centrality to the web\u2019s commercial ecosystem. Google, however, has not been sensitive enough in handling its power \u2014 especially with its history of bringing the fight to smaller, narrowly focused rivals, like Yelp in the local reviews market. Its strategy in certain verticals resembles the old survival maxim: First, eat what the monkey eats, then eat the monkey.However, as consumers continue to migrate to mobile, neutrality matters less. Mobile carriers already use \u201czero rating\u201d (whereby certain services don\u2019t count toward data caps) to advantage their own content (or that of their partners). And unlike in fixed broadband, consumers are afforded some protection by the real choice they have in mobile carriers.Plainly there is no cause to be Pollyannaish. It\u2019s sensible to be wary of acquisitions and potential overreach. And there may be specific cases that cross the line and should be reined in. Over all though, the kind of competition we see among Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft tends to sort things out naturally and brutally.The only surefire winner from this battle is the consumer.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He has an interest (directly or indirectly) in a large number of tech companies \u2014 including several firms to which he refers, and those that both partner with and compete against them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil Yellow Fever Outbreak Spawns Alert: Stop Killing the Monkeys", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 As fears spread in Brazil over the resurgence of yellow fever, health officials are issuing a warning: Stop killing the monkeys.Some assailants clubbed monkeys to death in panicked reactions to Brazil\u2019s most alarming outbreak in decades of a virus that haunted the country in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Authorities found other monkeys dead with fractured skulls after having been being attacked with stones. One monkey was burned to a crisp.\u201cThey\u2019re putting human beings at greater risk by killing the messenger,\u201d said Renato Alves, an official in Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry who is tracking the outbreak. \u201cMonkeys are a crucial alert mechanism that we monitor to deploy vaccines and prevention efforts to the right places.\u201dThe killings reflect broad misunderstanding in Brazil about how yellow fever spreads. Cases that are sylvatic, or in the wild, involve monkeys that are infected by mosquito species inhabiting the forest canopy.The same mosquitoes then transmit the virus to humans who make incursions into jungles, like gold prospectors, hunters or loggers. Such outbreaks are often relatively small. While yellow fever is often asymptomatic in humans, patients who develop severe symptoms can die within seven to 10 days.\u201cPeople in regions where yellow fever is on the march often don\u2019t realize how crucial monkeys are in informing us about the disease,\u201d said Danilo Simonini Teixeira, the president of the Brazilian Society of Primatology.While the outbreak has many people in Brazil on edge, virus specialists fear the possibility that yellow fever could spin out of control by spreading rapidly around cities, stirring ghosts of epidemics that devastated urban areas like Rio de Janeiro more than a century ago.As the authorities grapple anew with yellow fever in Brazil, they are voicing relief that it has not evolved into an urban outbreak. Nearly 19 million doses of vaccine are being distributed in areas where the virus is spreading. The World Health Organization is also providing Brazil with 3.5 million doses of the vaccine from its emergency stockpile.In addition to urging people to get vaccinated and to stop killing monkeys, Brazilian officials are telling people to eliminate places with stagnant water where mosquitoes can breed, like discarded tires or shower floors. Still, in impoverished parts of Brazil where yellow fever has hit hard, some say that the authorities have been slow to act.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that hunting monkeys is wrong, but when monkeys started showing up dead from yellow fever the vaccinations should have started,\u201d said Dalila de Oliveira, 30, a manicurist. Her cousin Watila dos Santos, a 38-year-old construction worker, died in March from the virus in Casimiro de Abreu, an area in the interior of Rio de Janeiro State.\u201cHe went to the public hospital and was mistakenly diagnosed with sinusitis,\u201d Ms. Oliveira said. \u201cThe authorities could have been more aggressive about preventing this tragedy, but they preferred to minimize the situation.\u201dBrazil\u2019s health minister, Ricardo Barros, acknowledged in an interview that fewer people would have died in recent months had the government responded more vigorously in the outbreak\u2019s early stages.\u201cThere may have been a failure in the vaccination blockade after the first monkeys began showing up dead in Minas Gerais,\u201d said Mr. Barros, referring to the Brazilian state that has been hardest hit in the outbreak, with more than 160 fatalities.\u201cA big concern is for the virus to jump the Panama Canal\u201d into Central America, Dr. Durbin said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a woman whose cousin died of yellow fever.

The services offer smaller bundles of channels and allow viewers to watch live television outside the home on mobile devices. Because the video is delivered over the internet, consumers do not need to buy bulky hardware.But choosing a service can be overwhelming. Each lacks channels or features that some viewers consider essential.Here are questions to ask when considering the services:If you live alone, this may not be a concern. But for families with more than one child, or for apartment dwellers with roommates, being able to watch on only two screens at once may not cut it.Several of the services offer packages with different channel lineups and prices. If a specific channel is a must, make sure the package you are considering includes it.All of the services offer the basics for sports fans, including ESPN, ESPN2, FS1 and FS2. But the availability of regional sports networks, or the channels that frequently show Major League Baseball, N.B.A. and N.H.L. games, varies by market. Check the service\u2019s website to see what is included. You will also need to check on the availability of channels that occasionally feature live sports, like TNT, NFL Network, NBA TV, Big Ten Network and SEC Network.Subscribers would gain access to its streaming library, which otherwise costs $7.99 a month.Users of AT&T for wireless phone service have an incentive to choose DirecTV Now: Any video streaming on the app does not count toward monthly data limits.

You can start for as little as $20 and add chunks of channels in categories like sports, news, comedy and kids for $5 each.It is not just for Sony\u2019s video game console.

During a conference call with reporters, Robert M. Lightfoot Jr., the acting NASA administrator, said the change was technically feasible, but that the additional cost, time and risks outweighed the benefits. \u201cIt really reaffirmed the baseline plan we have in place is the best way to go,\u201d he said.Even without that additional work, Mr. Lightfoot announced that the launch date has slipped again, to 2019 from the previous target of November 2018, because of various technical challenges and some bad luck. In February, a tornado struck the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana, where pieces of the rocket are being built, damaging the roof and equipment.\u201cThat really set us back in a big way,\u201d said William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for the human exploration and operations directorate at NASA.This month, a big dome-shaped piece at Michoud was badly damaged while being moved; it was to become the bottom of a liquid oxygen tank that will be used for testing. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not repairable,\u201d Mr. Gerstenmaier said. But there are additional domes, and Mr. Gerstenmaier said he did not expect that to add much to the delay.The construction of the European Space Agency\u2019s contribution to the rocket \u2014 a service module that will provide propulsion, power and supplies for the Orion capsule \u2014 is also behind schedule.NASA will now follow its original plan. For the first flight, Orion is to fly thousands of miles beyond the moon during a three-week trip. Mr. Gerstenmaier said one advantage of a crewless mission is that it will allow more thorough testing, closer to the edge of the capabilities of the spacecraft. \u201cWe will push as hard as we can,\u201d he said.The second flight, the first with astronauts, will come about three years later. It is scheduled for August 2021, but will also likely be delayed.The delays will add to the skepticism of those who think the Space Launch System and Orion will be obsolete by the time they get to the launchpad.SpaceX, the rocket company started by Elon Musk, is planning to finally launch this summer its long-delayed Falcon Heavy rocket. The Falcon Heavy is not as powerful as the Space Launch System, but with a $90 million price tag, far cheaper. The Space Launch System, which would launch only about once every two years, is estimated to cost $1 billion per mission.Blue Origin, a rocket company started by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is also developing a large rocket called New Glenn, which may begin launching as soon as 2020.The Trump administration\u2019s preliminary budget proposal for 2018 keeps NASA\u2019s financing level almost unchanged, while it includes deep cuts to many other agencies. The administration has not offered many details of its plans for NASA in the coming years.At a symposium in Washington this month about efforts to speed the development of much cheaper, fully reusable rockets, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who has advised President Trump on various issues including space, described the Space Launch System as less capable than the Saturn 5 rocket that took astronauts to the moon in 1969, yet far more expensive.\u201cThe handwriting is on the wall,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cThose kinds of programs are going to look stupid.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Amanda Chantal Bacon Perfected the Celebrity Wellness Business", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "FeatureDeciphering the rise of a lifestyle guru who sells self-absorption as the ultimate luxury product.Supported byI did not buy the Brain Dust, but I looked it up online, because I will pursue anything that claims to make me smarter. The product\u2019s ingredients were mysterious: lion\u2019s mane, shilajit, astragalus, rhodiola, stevia, maca. It was sold by a company named Moon Juice, which called itself \u201ca healing force, an etheric potion, a cosmic beacon for those seeking out beauty, wellness and longevity.\u201d In other words, a chain of juice stores in Los Angeles. I thought about Brain Dust for weeks.The name alone seemed precision-calibrated to reel me in. It wasn\u2019t \u201cBrain Powder,\u201d which sounds unappealingly man-made \u2014 protein powder, baby powder, foot powder \u2014 but \u201cDust,\u201d which suggests that the ingredients assembled themselves with the spontaneity of snowflakes on a twig. Then there was the label, with its \u201calpha waves\u201d and \u201cadaptogenic potion\u201d and \u201cneuron velocity.\u201d This was language as Impressionist paint daub; not a signifier of meaning but a blurry, mood-inducing gesture. Questions lingered. Can brain waves be toned? Who is the Brain Dust customer? Does she have no grasp on reality, or does she simply aspire to have no grasp on reality? Why do I assume it\u2019s a woman?A short time later, a news release touting a Moon Juice cookbook appeared in my inbox. It described the book\u2019s author and Moon Juice\u2019s founder, Amanda Chantal Bacon, as \u201ca powerful influencer in the wellness space,\u201d which struck me as the most penetratingly of-the-moment group of words I\u2019d ever read. The release noted that Moon Juice had been featured on Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle platform, Goop, and was beloved by celebrities like Shailene Woodley, who is herself known for dispensing peculiar wellness advice (like eating clay and sunbathing the vagina). The words \u201cEastern healing,\u201d \u201cglowing skin,\u201d \u201cnationwide following\u201d and \u201csocial media\u201d made their way onto the page. In the space of roughly 500 words, someone \u2014 a junior book publicist, probably \u2014 had managed to concentrate the zeitgeist of contemporary female celebrity into its purest form. Amanda Chantal Bacon, whoever she was, was like a superextract distilled from a combination of Paltrow, Jessica Alba, Miranda Kerr, Ayesha Curry and every other contemporary lifestyle guru. Unlike the others, she didn\u2019t have an acting or a modeling career (or a famous husband) to vault her into the public sphere. But she had all the right nouns and adjectives: a robust Instagram following, a line of signature products, an aspirational and photogenic home and enough branding talent to ensnare my gaze and capture my imagination, even if I was ashamed of its capture.Here was proof of the extent to which our nascent wellness culture had finally matured: a woman whose lifestyle was extreme to the point of inscrutability and expensive to the point of implausibility. It\u2019s not surprising that Bacon was mocked; the internet backlash practically wrote itself. The amazing thing was that she was also embraced. She expanded her business, published a cookbook, spoke at conferences and appeared in Vogue. As her fame has rippled outward, so has her influence.Most luxury products are pitched to appeal to a sense of decadence or exclusivity in consumers. Products in the wellness category, which also tend to be decadent and exclusive \u2014 Huffington\u2019s phone bed costs $100 \u2014 are instead pitched as tools of right-living. The second time I spotted Brain Dust in the wild was at a coffee shop in the Hamptons, where it shared shelf space with \u201ccruelty free\u201d toothpaste and boeuf-bourguignon-flavored dog biscuits. \u201cWe believe dogs deserve real food,\u201d read the dog-biscuit slogan.Paying fastidious attention to the minutiae of moods, appetites and sleep habits (or those of a pet) is an activity long enjoyed by the rich and underoccupied, from Edith Wharton heroines to the Kardashian sisters. In Wharton\u2019s day, this kind of life was coveted without being heralded as exactly virtuous. Its opposite, meanwhile \u2014 the quotidian physical martyrdom that was the lot of the working class \u2014 was at least given its due as a creditable human quality.Thanks to advances in technology, our economy has transformed since Wharton\u2019s day, albeit not in the way that Keynes predicted. Instead of bringing about a leisure class living in actual leisure, we have wrought a world where the upwardly mobile are instead obsessed with productivity. Indeed, productivity itself has become a kind of class signifier. Even recreation among the elite bears the hallmarks of work, with metrics and documentation governing all activity. As the increasing demands of work sow anxiety among the elite, leisure time has become a zone heavy with contradiction.In our wellness-obsessed era, the idea of working yourself to the bone is no longer a commendable trait but a failure of self-care; recreation is now cast as a divine pursuit. \u201cThere is a cosmic calling and powerful movement here to push us forward as a race,\u201d Bacon writes in her cookbook\u2019s introduction. \u201cA big part of the movement is caring for our bodies, as well as for the health of our planet. Anytime we make a move toward supporting or joining that mission, we tune in to the flow of otherworldly success and abundance.\u201d What Goop (and acolytes like Moon Juice) sell is the notion that it\u2019s not only excusable but worthy for a person to spend hours a day focused on her tiniest mood shifts, food choices, beauty rituals, exercise habits, bathing routines and sleep schedule. What they sell is self-\u200babsorption as the ultimate luxury product.The front door stood open, and Bacon sailed around in the kitchen ahead. An assistant sat at the countertop typing on an iPhone. I am accustomed to New York City kitchens the size of a bathtub, but this one was majestic by any standard. Every surface stretched gleamingly into the distance: the countertops, the professional range, the island with its basket of gourds, French press and sticks of burning Frankincense. I hollered hello and hesitated at the threshold a moment, waiting to be asked in, but the two kept working, so I entered without a summons. \u201cOne thing,\u201d Bacon called out, as a greeting. \u201cShoes.\u201d I removed them.\u201cI\u2019m about to Dust your coffee,\u201d she said, skipping introductions. Bacon, who is 34, wore a wispy white gown that wafted after her, with a thick untied braid trailing over her left shoulder. Her skin was, indeed, glowing; her cheeks had rose-petal qualities. The kitchen windows faced a hillside resplendent with tropical plants. Acorns occasionally scattered to Earth outside, landing at the feet of a stone deity, who sat among moistly dripping ferns.Bacon\u2019s assistant evaporated out the door as her boss set a plate on the kitchen counter: strawberry-rose-geranium bars, tiny \u201cdoughnuts\u201d made with mushroom and quinoa and a cinnamon bun that looked as if it were forged by a chic cave man with primitive tools. All of it was vegan, organic and raw. She poured coffee from a yellow enamel pot and slid onto a stool beside me, curling her bare feet up and arraying gauzy cottons around her. Sunshine glowed through the layers. She was, I was quickly realizing, the kind of woman who always seems backlit.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Power Dust in that,\u201d she said, pointing to the coffee. Power Dust, like Brain Dust, is a formula of stevia-sweetened powdered herbs that Moon Juice sells in an attractive jar. I would describe the taste as \u201csoil-forward.\u201d\u201cIs it possible to overdose on Dust?\u201d I asked. \u201cI had two doses this morning, and I also had two last night.\u201d In an effort to test the products, I\u2019d been guinea-pigging. So far, any effects were undetectable.\u201cNo,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cYou\u2019re good. You\u2019re safe. I mean, is it possible to overdose? You\u2019d probably have severe physical symptoms first.\u201dAs a housekeeper vacuumed nearby, Bacon kicked into her origin story. Growing up in New York City, she was a sickly child (\u201cbronchial stuff\u201d) whose parents took her to doctors (\u201cI got pumped through the Western-medicine chain\u201d) without satisfactory results (\u201cOf course nothing helped\u201d). One day she went shopping with her family at a downtown health-food store, where, the story goes, an Ayurvedic doctor visiting from India overheard Bacon coughing. The doctor came over and posed some questions (\u201cVery typical Ayurvedic ones, like \u2018How often do you poop?\u2019\u2009\u201d) and took the child\u2019s pulse. After examining Bacon\u2019s tongue, the man provided her mother with a list of forbidden foods: cow\u2019s milk, wheat and white sugar, among others. Bacon stopped eating gluten at age 4 and became a vegetarian at around 7.She is aware that these biographical details invite ridicule, but Bacon doesn\u2019t care if people make fun of her. She\u2019s used to it. And anyway, hers was a challenging childhood: \u201cI was told growing up that I had learning disabilities and mental illness. That was all the rage in the \u201990s.\u201d She reflected on her past calmly. \u201cI came from a family that was like: \u2018Yes. Whatever the doctor says is right. Just take the pills.\u2019\u2009\u201d (Bacon\u2019s mother was the C.E.O. of the fashion company Betsey Johnson, and her father was a musician.)At 18, Bacon moved to Italy alone. Why Italy? \u201cIf I thought about all the times I felt connected or alive, it was around the rituals of people gathering and eating and sharing food and slowing down,\u201d she said. In Florence, Bacon discovered that food was her calling. After several years of traveling, she wound up at a culinary school in Vermont. Following graduation, she emailed the Los Angeles-based chef and restaurateur Suzanne Goin and asked for a job. Goin emailed back with an invitation to meet. Bacon hopped on a plane and moved into a garage three blocks from one of Goin\u2019s restaurants, where she hand-whisked aioli and pounded salsa verde with a mortar and pestle until her biceps ached. In early 2012, having absorbed lessons of entrepreneurship from Goin, she opened the first store. \u201cIt really is not my name,\u201d she explained, when I asked where the phrase Moon Juice came from. \u201cIt just dropped down from the universe.\u201dAlong with cucumber-pineapple-jalape\u00f1o juice and almond milk, the first Moon Juice sold organic bananas with walnut butter and cacao cashew snack bites. In 2014, Shailene Woodley was photographed carrying a Moon Juice tote bag. Zo\u00eb Kravitz called it her favorite juice bar. Bacon appeared on Goop to make \u201cspirit truffles\u201d and \u201csex bark\u201d with Paltrow in 2015. New Moon Juice locations opened in Silver Lake and on Melrose Place.Bacon turned her focus inward, toward marketing the herbal remedies she\u2019d been incorporating into her diet for years. In 2014, the company added the line of jarred herb powders that now includes Spirit Dust, Beauty Dust, Power Dust, Brain Dust, Dream Dust and Sex Dust. The formulas sampled Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine; the labels instructed users to mix a teaspoon with hot or cold liquid (\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to double dose!\u201d). The Dusts proved to be what a venture capitalist might call an \u201cinflection point\u201d: unlike raw juices, they were easy to package and ship, had a long shelf life and faced zero competition from the likes of Coca-Cola (which, for example, has invested mightily in juice, including a $90 million stake in a company called Suja Life). They could be marketed as a beauty supplement and sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. The Dusts were scalable.And Bacon insists they work. \u201cPeople really report back: Wow, my skin changed,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said, turbocharging into evangelical mode. \u201cI hear incredible stories from people. There was a young, beautiful woman who approached me at an event. She said, \u2018I\u2019ve been coming into Moon Juice, I had breast cancer,\u2019 and she went through all that hormonal treatment, and by going through it, she no longer had a sex drive. She\u2019s beautiful! She\u2019s our age. She has a boyfriend ... and she said that the Sex Dust\u201d \u2014 along with pomegranate seed lube \u2014 \u201cgot them to be able to enjoy sex despite the fact that her body wasn\u2019t producing any of the hormones enabling her to do so. So the herbs, they work. They all work.\u201d You can now buy them at Urban Outfitters, the Ace Hotel and Net-a-Porter.While she spoke, Bacon finger-combed her hair, pausing now and then to stare critically at the ends. Incense curled out the window in velvety puffs. When I finished eating the pastries, she unfurled herself from her stool and brought out a second course: cloudlike coconut yogurt sprinkled with bee pollen in a pearlescent stone bowl. Fairy food.The housekeeper paused near Bacon holding a wispy white garment. \u201cSucio o limpio?\u201d she asked.By the time I left Bacon\u2019s house, I wanted to scrub off my makeup and swaddle myself in white cottons and let my hair tumble down my back in sun-lightened coils like hers. I wanted to move to California and eat bee pollen, even though I think bee pollen tastes like the reptile section at the zoo and California is the state where I was born and spent 18 years plotting my escape from, and it can\u2019t be denied that I benefit strongly from makeup. But all of that was wiped away within minutes of meeting this woman, whose ability to perform every action with charisma \u2014 whether pouring coconut milk into a pot or requesting a strategy meeting with her staff \u2014 seemed a direct result of her dietary choices. I understand that Bacon\u2019s success is a product of ambition, luck, privilege and stamina. So why did I covertly order a 16-ounce sack of bee pollen from Amazon on my phone during a three-minute break in our conversation? The answer is obvious: Bacon is a lifestyle guru, and this is what lifestyle gurus do. They insist on a connection between what you buy and who you are. And then they sell you stuff. If they are Bacon, they also pronounce the word guru \u201cgoo-doo,\u201d in what I can only assume is the authentic manner.An employee poked her head out the door, holding a phone. \u201cHey! Are you Milky?\u201d she asked.\u201cMolly.\u201d\u201cHa, ha, autocorrect.\u201d She glanced down at her phone. \u201cAmanda\u2019s running just a few minutes late \u2014 she\u2019ll be here soon.\u201dI sipped my Moon-Dusted recovery nectar and gnawed a packet of fermented seed crisps. They smelled like tree bark. Here, about a dozen miles from Bacon\u2019s home, the only sound was of lawns being mowed. This lightly accessorized silence is the sonic backdrop of L.A.\u2019s expensive neighborhoods. Women with Goyard and Mansur Gavriel bags slid in and out of the shop. I eavesdropped on three customers arguing about whether a peanut was a fruit, a vegetable or a seed.Around 11 a.m., Bacon arrived in white denim overalls and C\u00e9line sunglasses to test formulas with the company\u2019s in-house herbalist, Blaire Edwards. Before the tasting, she darted around the store, repositioning a cluster of skin products and switching the electricity back on when it unexpectedly shut off. From a back room, Edwards fetched tasting supplies and set them up on a table outside the store. The table was within inches of customers, and Bacon voted to drag it 10 feet away, beyond earshot. \u201cI feel like customers enjoying our current formulas don\u2019t need to hear about the new formulas,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could cause anxiety.\u201d At the relocated table, Edwards set out baggies of brown powders labeled in Sharpie marker. She mixed a powder into a cup of water and handed it to her boss.\u201cIs that three grams?\u201d Bacon asked.\u201cYes, madame,\u201d Edwards replied.Bacon sipped the brown liquid thoughtfully. \u201cI like it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy only thought is, less stevia.\u201d She passed the cup to me. \u201cYou\u2019re about to get really high.\u201d I swallowed the potion. It was like mild Ovaltine mixed with floor sweepings. When frothed with chai tea, coconut milk and ghee in one of the store\u2019s $6 lattes, it would be scrumptious.\u201cThese are literally ancient herbs,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something Amanda made up out of thin air.\u201d She mixed another sample in a cup while Bacon took calls, greeted fans, sniffed samples and arranged a conversation with a vendor. She possesses a curious quality I\u2019ve seen in other executives: a tendency toward extreme distraction coupled with the ability to laser in on a single task. She is either doing a million things or one thing, but never any number of things in between.This quality of scattered orchestration is illustrated in \u201cThe Moon Juice Cookbook,\u201d which opens its first chapter with a photograph of Bacon kneeling on a shaggy rug strewn with rosebuds and raw almonds. She is surrounded by crystals, a conch shell, an avocado, a flowering shrub, a string of beads and a sculpted owl. Her head is bowed in what looks like reverence. In her hands is an upside-down bundle of calla lilies. The photograph has been styled minutely, but it is hard to extract meaning from the picture. The filmy white garb, the glistening avocado, the melting calla lilies \u2014 all arrayed in Edenic plenitude \u2014 add up to an alluring, sensory glamour. When you sprinkle Beauty Dust on your almond-milk latte, this is what you are summoning.Or you might be summoning exactly the opposite. We tend to think of \u201cwellness\u201d as the province of swoony liberal elites, but it does, in fact, blossom at both cultural poles. The far-right conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones sells some of the same supplements as Moon Juice on his Infowars website. Jones\u2019s organic fair-trade coffee can be purchased in an \u201cImmune Support\u201d variety that includes cordyceps and reishi mushroom extracts; Moon Juice sells cordyceps and reishi powders with similar claims attached. The \u201cSuper Female Vitality\u201d supplement at the Infowars shop shares a number of ingredients with the Moon Juice Dusts: maca, epimedium, shilajit. Alex Jones and Amanda Chantal Bacon each sell probiotics. They each warn against the encroachment of \u201ctoxins.\u201d Bacon has a recipe for strawberry milk with drops of colloidal silver in it; Alex Jones pushes tiny bottles of colloidal silver online for $19.95. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two purveyors is context. Alex Jones sells his merchandise alongside tactical body armor and Trump shirts; Bacon sells hers next to chia pudding.What unifies the two is the subtext of their pitches \u2014 a seeming conviction that widespread forces are acting on benighted consumers, who can thwart harm only by venturing to the fringes and buying non-F.D.A. approved supplements with which to purify themselves. For Jones, the treachery comes in the form of fluoridated water and chemtrails. For Bacon, it\u2019s Western medicine and the standard American diet. One brand is designed to look like an ashram and the other to look like an underground bunker, but you walk away from each with the same conclusion \u2014 that the only way out is way, way, out, in a land of mystical mushrooms and miracle herbs. The valor of separatism, after all, is our founding myth.No place on earth is better suited to nurturing this mass turning-inward than Los Angeles. After I interviewed Bacon at her house the day before, I put my shoes back on and walked downhill toward the ocean, past sage clusters and foamy crests of bougainvillea and signs for a lost cat named India. Dry-cleaning vans made deliveries. Gardeners edged lawns. I passed the most expensive-looking mailbox I\u2019d ever seen, and more varieties of security fence than you could possibly imagine, and houses that looked like every decade\u2019s concept of the future. I was full to the brim of cleansing foods, strolling down a winding road past $6 million homes, each one an island. My sack of bee pollen would arrive in two to four business days.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "How Marching for Science Risks Politicizing It", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byPulse of the PeopleSome early evidence suggests the march may have widened the divide among liberals and conservatives in their views of scientists but not, crucially, toward the research they conduct.Were these fears realized? Some preliminary evidence is available from Matthew P. Motta, a doctoral candidate in political science at the University of Minnesota who tracked opinions toward scientists and scientific research among a sample of survey respondents recruited on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk workplace. Though these participants are not representative of the general public, we can still conduct a valid test for polarization by comparing how the views of liberals and conservatives in the sample changed from before the march to afterward. (Eight in 10 respondents reported having heard at least something about it, including approximately one in two who said they heard a \u201cmoderate amount\u201d or a \u201cgreat deal.\u201d)Between the Wednesday before the march (April 19) and the Monday and Tuesday afterward (April 24-25), liberals and conservatives in the survey panel moved further apart in how warmly they felt toward scientists. Specifically, liberals reported somewhat warmer feelings toward scientists (up to 86 from 82 on a 0-to-100 feeling thermometer scale) while the feelings of conservatives toward scientists became somewhat less warm (down to 67 from 70).The liberal-conservative gap in agreement with the statement that \u201cScientists care less about solving important problems than their own personal gain\u201d also widened significantly \u2014 conservative agreement increased to 32 percent, up from 22 percent, whereas liberal agreement fell to 8 percent from 11 percent.However, no corresponding increase in polarization was observed on the statements that \u201cMost scientific research is politically motivated\u201d and \u201cYou simply can\u2019t trust most scientific research.\u201d On the latter question, for instance, agreement did not change significantly among conservatives (22 percent agreed before the march compared with 21 percent afterward) or liberals (6 percent agreed before the march; 3 percent did afterward). This finding suggests that the polarizing response that the march elicited toward scientists did not spill over into views of the research they conduct.Mr. Motta cites the emphasis on the marchers in news coverage as a potential explanation for these findings. In an email, he writes that \u201cthe \u2018public face\u2019 of the march appears to be the protesters; the clever signs they came up with, dressing as dinosaurs, etc.\u201d This focus on the scientists who participated, he writes, \u201cput a human face on science, which might be why it led to polarization with respect to attitudes about people, but not necessarily their research\u201d \u2014 a topic that received less attention.These findings should be evaluated in future studies, but they suggest another way in which science can become politicized \u2014 not by challenging the findings of a field of research, but by portraying the people who do science as political. In this sense, the march and events like it could paradoxically make scientists a more inviting target for future attacks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Need Mood Lighting to Go With Your Music? Ask Alexa. No App Required.", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Today, most people know Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker as an easy way to play music using voice commands, but the device and others like it are catching on as ways to control light switches, thermostats and other smart home appliances.Now Amazon has a deal with one of the best known purveyors of home furnishings \u2014 Ikea \u2014 to make Alexa, the voice assistant inside Echo, more integrated into homes.The arrangement is not exclusive to Amazon, so Ikea can strike similar agreements with makers of other smart speakers like Google Home.The backing of Ikea, known for its affordable, mass-market furnishings, could help attract more public curiosity about smart home appliances, which most consumers have not yet seen a compelling reason to purchase. In an interview, Daniel Rausch, vice president for smart home at Amazon, said the relationship with Ikea would allow people to outfit a room with smart lighting for just \u201ctens of dollars.\u201dAmazon has said there have been \u201ctens of millions of Alexa devices\u201d sold, including various devices in Amazon\u2019s Echo family of products and others from independent device makers. While a lot of people use Echo to play music from Spotify or from radio stations, Mr. Rausch said smart home usage of the devices was growing rapidly.He said Alexa users gave home-related commands \u2014 like \u201craise the temperature in the living room\u201d and \u201cturn on the dining room lights\u201d \u2014 millions of times a day. The number of such commands by Alexa users grew 500 percent in the period from March to May compared with the same period the year before he said.One obstacle to the growth of the smart home market has been that most individual products \u2014 thermostats, sprinkler systems, smart plugs and light bulbs \u2014 require separate apps to control them. For a person fumbling in the dark with a bag of groceries, simply flicking the lights on is much less of a hassle than opening an app on a smartphone to perform the same task.But being able to command all or most of a home\u2019s smart appliances using voice, as people can do through Alexa, could make them more appealing, analysts said. \u201cI think this idea of voice control is really going to accelerate this whole market, and I think Amazon is very much ahead,\u201d said Victoria Petrock, an analyst at eMarketer, a technology research firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say the race is won.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Post, Breaking News, Is Also Breaking New Ground", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseSince The Washington Post\u2019s Watergate-era glory days, my need to read that paper has waxed and waned. I already pay for and scour The New York Times (of course), The Wall Street Journal and The New Yorker, which is a lot to manage before I even get to the books on my night stand and Kindle. So I haven\u2019t been looking for more to read, let alone another monthly expense.But for some time, a Washington Post logo with the caption \u201cBreaking News\u201d has been popping onto my laptop\u2019s screen. I\u2019m not sure how The Post insinuated itself into my prime digital real estate, since I don\u2019t recall inviting it there. And I\u2019d probably find it annoying and intrusive if the breaking news weren\u2019t so interesting.That\u2019s when I learned I\u2019d bumped up against The Post\u2019s pay barrier, along with the flattering observation that \u201cYou obviously love great journalism.\u201d And for just 99 cents for the first four weeks and a few more clicks, I could keep reading. Who could resist?I became a subscriber for the first time, and The Post had just monetized its scoop.\u201cThe published numbers speculating about our subscription and ad revenue have so underestimated the reality that it\u2019s comical,\u201d The Post\u2019s chief revenue officer, Jed Hartman, told me this week. \u201cOur digital ad revenue is in the solid nine figures,\u201d that is, in excess of $100 million. This year, he added, \u201cwe\u2019ll have our third straight year of double-digit revenue growth.\u201dCraig Huber, a veteran media and newspaper analyst and founder of Huber Research Partners, said that while he had not seen The Post\u2019s data, the gains reported are striking. \u201cI\u2019m very, very surprised by those numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one else is even coming close. If that\u2019s correct, I\u2019m very impressed.\u201dTo be sure, as with other newspapers, The Post\u2019s economic picture is still encumbered by print, where declines in circulation and advertising revenue continue unabated. And its digital rebound has most likely come from a modest base.Scoops \u2014 and high-quality journalism more generally \u2014 are integral to The Post\u2019s business model at a time when the future of digital journalism seemed to be veering toward the lowest common denominator of exploding watermelons and stupid pet tricks.\u201cInvestigative reporting is absolutely critical to our business model,\u201d Mr. Baron told me. \u201cWe add value. We tell people what they didn\u2019t already know. We hold government and powerful people and institutions accountable. This cannot happen without financial support. We\u2019re at the point where the public realizes that and is willing to step up and support that work by buying subscriptions.\u201dHe said digital subscriptions had soared this week in the wake of the latest Russia revelations, as they have with other scoops. In the first quarter of this year, The Post says, it added hundreds of thousands of new digital subscribers. (It would not disclose the overall number of subscribers.)Investigative journalism also drives advertising, Mr. Hartman said. \u201cIt\u2019s what elevates our brand,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd other brands want to attach themselves to a trusted brand.\u201dMr. Huber, the analyst, concurred. \u201cThe only future for newspapers is at the high end of quality journalism,\u201d he said. \u201cThat and only that are what people are willing to pay for.\u201dHe said The Post was one of three newspapers, along with The Times and The Wall Street Journal, that are successfully transforming themselves. \u201cThey\u2019re showing that a digital strategy is viable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the number of people willing to pay $10 to $12 a month for an online subscription outside those three is a rounding error.\u201d (After the introductory rate, The Post\u2019s digital-only access for national subscribers is $9.99 for four weeks.)Mr. Huber noted that given the winner-take-all nature of the internet, the sources of scoops are gravitating toward just a few news outlets led by The Times and The Post. Sources (and people who want to \u201cleak\u201d) go to a publication with the most impact; opinion makers and influencers seek the publication with the most sources and scoops \u2014 hence the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d so coveted in technology circles, and one well understood by Mr. Bezos.When I asked Mr. Baron to name one thing that has driven the turnaround, his immediate answer was Mr. Bezos \u2014 and not because of his vast fortune.\u201cThe most fundamental thing Jeff did was to change our strategy entirely,\u201d Mr. Baron said. \u201cWe were a news organization that focused on the Washington region, so our vision was constrained. Jeff said from the start that wasn\u2019t the right strategy. Our industry had suffered due to the internet, but the internet also brought gifts, and we should recognize that. It made distribution free, which gave us the opportunity to be a national and even international news organization, and we should recognize and take advantage of that.\u201dBut Mr. Bezos also seems to be a hands-off owner: Although Mr. Baron said they typically have a teleconference call every two weeks, Mr. Bezos hadn\u2019t called this week, even after the Russia scoop.For many, this week\u2019s avalanche of breaking news brought back vivid memories of Nixon and Watergate, \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d and the Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein. But The Post\u2019s current leadership is the first to admit that times have changed so vastly that such pre-internet comparisons are largely irrelevant.\u201cToday you have to be great at everything,\u201d Mr. Hartman said. \u201cYou have to be great at technology. You have to be great at monetization. But one thing I think we\u2019re proving is that if you are, great journalism can be profitable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Strength and Its Shopping Lift Alibaba\u2019s Results", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s vast ranks of consumers are finding ways to spend more money online \u2014 and that\u2019s good news for Alibaba.Alibaba\u2019s results offer a positive sign for those tracking China\u2019s efforts to transform its economy to rely less on government spending and more on American-style consumption. But they also show Alibaba is finding more ways to get the businesses that set up shop on its e-commerce platforms to give it more money.But there are challenges. The results show Alibaba has a long way to go before it can diversify its business amid expectations that even China\u2019s online sales boom has its limits. And Alibaba is increasingly dipping its toe into American politics at an uncertain time.Alibaba said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 85 percent to $1.4 billion, thanks to strong sales as well as selling some investments. Sales across its e-commerce businesses rose 47 percent.While that\u2019s good news for the company, full-year results showed a more complex picture. Alibaba\u2019s revenue for the year grew more than twice as fast as its gross merchandise volume, a measure of sales volume, meaning much of the rise did not come from simply selling more stuff. Alibaba also is finding ways to squeeze more money out of vendors big and small, either by offering new services or charging more for existing ones.Because even China can\u2019t grow forever, Alibaba is hoping to find new sources of revenue. One of the most promising, according to analysts, has been to introduce its own business providing back-end computing to businesses \u2014 much like Amazon Web Services. While growth in the business remains strong, it is from a small base, and some analysts have signaled concern about increasing competition. In the quarter, Alibaba\u2019s cloud revenue more than doubled, to $314 million.It has also expanded into online entertainment and film, hoping to make use of its advertising data and customers to become a cultural force. The company\u2019s main online video acquisition, Youku Tudou, has fallen behind rivals in users and time spent per user. While in the long term it could pay off, in the shorter term heavy investment in content could cut into Alibaba\u2019s margins.Over all, the businesses outside Alibaba\u2019s core commerce business were unprofitable in the quarter.Alibaba has said this year will be the year it pushes in earnest outside China\u2019s borders. While the company\u2019s core business is still in China, some signs show that its efforts overseas are starting to pick up steam. In a recent note the boutique investment bank China Renaissance pointed out that Lazada, a Southeast Asian e-commerce company that Alibaba invested in last year, now leads in market share in the six major countries in the region. Alibaba\u2019s primary branded overseas e-commerce site, AliExpress, has also been picking up customers in Brazil, Russia and Eastern Europe, according to China Renaissance.Advertisement"}

Many of the hottest brands sell directly to consumers through websites and subscription services, cutting out stores altogether.Nielsen, a research and consulting firm, said last month that for the first time in a decade, shoppers were making more trips to stores, but coming out with less in their baskets. \u201cThey\u2019re not stockpiling their pantries as much,\u201d said Jordan Rost, the company\u2019s vice president for consumer insights. \u201cThey\u2019re really buying more fresh produce and prepared meals.\u201d\u201cOur food is making us sick,\u201d he said. \u201cHere we have candy bars masquerading as cereal bars \u2014 no wonder we\u2019re confused by our food.\u201dHe picked up a Special K Caramel Coconut Chewy Snack Bar. \u201cYou think Special K is healthy because it tastes so bad,\u201d Mr. Ruhlman said. \u201cBut one of these has seven grams of sugar in it, meaning it\u2019s 25 percent sugar.\u201dThat brought us to the cereal aisle, which Mr. Ruhlman considers the worst in the grocery store; one chapter in his book is titled \u201cBreakfast: The Most Dangerous Meal of the Day.\u201d\u201cCereal has this healthy halo around it, and it\u2019s anything but healthy,\u201d he said. Much of it is what he calls \u201cstripped carbs,\u201d or rice, wheat and oats from which manufacturers have removed the germ and bran because the oils in them would go rancid sitting for months on the grocery shelves.\u201cOur bodies convert those simple carbohydrates into sugar, and guess what most of the rest of cereal is?\u201d he said. \u201cSugar, either as sugar or corn syrup or fructose or sucrose or some other sugar derivative.\u201dA few aisles over, Perfect Size for One, a new Duncan Hines mix that makes a single cupcake in a mug using a microwave, caught his eye, first for its sugar content (35 grams) and then as an example of how supermarkets are trying to reach younger consumers. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just millennials \u2014 more and more of what gets bought in the supermarket is convenience,\u201d Mr. Ruhlman said. \u201cWe\u2019re grab-and-go eaters.\u201dMr. Ruhlman pointed to another example, Bumble Bee\u2019s new single-serving tuna in pouches, which come in sriracha, sun-dried tomato and basil, and spicy Thai chile varieties, among others.\u201cI wonder how you eat this,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they do provide a spoon. But who eats tuna with a spoon?\u201dBeneath nearly every product on these shelves was a label promising a deal: buy one, get one free; 10 for $10. But such enticements no longer have much impact, according to Nielsen, which found that consumer response to them fell 5.3 percent over the past three years.But grocers still face a quandary: how to maintain a huge store whose center is filled with items that are largely out of step with how we eat today, yet are a steady source of slotting fees (to secure the best spots in the store when a product is introduced) and other payments from the companies that produce them.Mr. Ruhlman is as baffled as anyone else about how to make that system work, and Nielsen recently created a group to study the issue. He is sure, though, that a fix is needed. The ShopRite here probably has to ring up at least $750,000 in sales each week to justify its space, he said, \u201cand I just don\u2019t know how you make money here.\u201dThe owner, Vincent LoCurcio, whose grandfather opened the Nutley store with a business partner in 1953, declined to divulge sales figures. He acknowledged that the floor plan of the Nutley store was traditional, but said it was stocked with \u201cmodern offerings.\u201d He also noted that customers can shop online and through the ShopRite mobile app, and pick the orders up at the store or have them delivered.\u201cWhat\u2019s unique is that we are family-owned, and we deliver a personalized experience in each of our stores,\u201d Mr. LoCurcio said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a place where people still know you by name, but we do know many of our customers by name and that\u2019s an important experience we provide for them.\u201dMr. Ruhlman and I toured the frozen foods section and then, as a test of how up-to-date this ShopRite was, went on a search for kombucha. We had to ask an employee, who at first had trouble understanding what we were looking for. But there it was, a small selection of kombucha drinks in a refrigerated section near juice.Finally, at the other end of the store, we found ourselves in the prepared foods section. \u201cTypical 1970s salad bar,\u201d Mr. Ruhlman said, \u201cbut a nice fish section.\u201d (Nutley\u2019s sizable Asian population may help explain the store\u2019s superior seafood selection and unusual fruits and vegetables. More than two-thirds of the town\u2019s residents, though, are 35 or older and white.)Mr. Ruhlman predicts that much of what is sold in the center of the store \u2014 the cereal, canned soups, detergents and Ziploc bags \u2014 will be largely bought online in the not-too-distant future as food shoppers become more accustomed to e-commerce.And he believes that many supermarkets will simply get smaller, as people order more online and consumers buy groceries from more places.For him, the supermarket has lost some of the thrill it once held when he strolled each aisle with his dad. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t have a lot of the stuff that I personally like,\u201d Mr. Ruhlman said. \u201cAnd it takes too long to get around. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the vice president for consumer insights at Nielsen. He is Jordan Rost, not Ross.An article last Wednesday about the author Michael Ruhlman included an excerpt from the book \u201cGrocery: The Buying and Selling of Food in America\u201d (Abrams) that misidentified the breeders of the Rock Cornish game hen. It was Alphonsine and Jacques Makowsky, not Donald Tyson.Advertisement"}

Not time to make the doughnuts (I\u2019ll leave that to my colleague, food editor Sam Sifton). It\u2019s winter pre-collection time.But wait, you say. I thought spring had finally arrived. What on earth is that?Good question: I ask it myself all the time, and I have been doing this for decades.Pre-collection shows, which take place sporadically in New York and Europe in May-July and November-January, are actually the debuts of the largest collections any designer makes. They are in stores the longest, and they make up the bulk of sales. They are, in other words, the clothes most consumers (that would be you) actually buy. But because designers tend to see pre-collections as clothes people wear, as opposed to clothes they use to make a giant statement, they are conflicted about how to show them.Some have giant shows in glamorous far-flung destinations like Tokyo (Louis Vuitton at the end of this month). Some have little presentations in their showrooms with a model or two. Some skip the models altogether. There is no coordinated time frame for the season, and no central organization. There\u2019s not even a widely accepted name. (\u201cCruise,\u201d \u201cresort\u201d and \u201cpre-spring\u201d are actually synonyms.)

About 30 inches wide and made of wire, beading and burnt ostrich feathers dyed red, it was built by Rodney Gordon, a go-to Broadway hat maker.Santo Loquasto, the costume designer, said he considered several versions of the piece \u2014 one of 93 ladies\u2019 hats in the musical \u2014 before the show\u2019s lead producer suggested it might be unwise to toy with the millinery memory of Carol Channing, who originated the role on Broadway in 1964. \u201cScott Rudin said that if I changed it radically from what Carol Channing had worn, he felt the gay community would stone me,\u201d said Mr. Loquasto, who received a Tony nomination for the show. \u201cI said, \u2018I guess you\u2019re right.\u2019\u201dThis\u00a0vintage straw platter hat is worn by Christine Ebersole as Elizabeth Arden. It was donated to the Goodman Theater, where the show had its premiere last year, by a \u201cvery eccentric socialite in Chicago who bought a new hat every day, according to legend,\u201d\u00a0said the show\u2019s\u00a0Tony-nominated\u00a0costume designer, Catherine Zuber.

In a show filled with quick changes, it helps that Ms.\u00a0LuPone (as\u00a0the\u00a0cosmetics magnate Helena Rubinstein)\u00a0knows her way around headwear. \u201cPatti is very gifted with using hat pins quickly,\u201d said Ms. Zuber.\u201cWe wanted it to be beautiful and, in a good way, stupid, like: it\u2019s a guy with a fish on his head.\u201d That\u2019s how the costume designer David Zinn described his inspiration for this puppet headpiece. About a foot-and-a-half in length and 18 inches tall, the fish, named Fluffy, was the work of the show\u2019s puppet designer, Amanda Villalobos, for a scene in which the title character\u2019s parents force her pet goldfish to be dumped into a canal. Worn by the actor Paul Whitty for just over a minute of stage time, it\u2019s made mostly of wire and soft foam, with a fitted band on the inside to keep it on the actor\u2019s head. The tail and fins are made of textured plastics and organza in shades of orange. Mr. Whitty uses rods to make the fins gesture; hinges make the tail swish.In Paula Vogel\u2019s play about the Yiddish theater, the curled payot are clipped on each side of a wide-brimmed, felted fur hat, purchased from a Jewish hat maker in Brooklyn, according to Emily Rebholz, the show\u2019s costume designer. The hairpieces are set on rollers every night to keep them as tight as possible; the hats (and hair) are worn in a musical number featuring both men and women. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a chorus line number with a costume element that ties everyone together,\u201d said Ms. Rebholz.Jane Greenwood, Tony-nominated for this revival, festooned this hat with metallic-colored feathers, ribbon, tulle, netting and artificial flowers. She asked the hat maker Arnold Levine to make it as dramatic as its entrance, worn in the final act by Laura Linney or Cynthia Nixon as the conniving Regina Giddens. \u201cI said I wanted it to look like she\u2019s coming in full sail, almost like a ship,\u201d she said.For the musical about the youngest Romanov princess, Linda Cho created this onion-domed piece based on the Russian kokoshnik, a traditional folk headdress. Pearls drape over the face like a curtain, and a veil cascades behind. Embedded in the piece are decorative fabrics and jewels, jewels and more jewels. \u201cThere\u2019s a place called Earrings Plaza, a wholesaler near Koreatown,\u201d said Ms. Cho, who is nominated for a Tony for her costumes. \u201cAll the jewelry there is between one and five dollars so I bought a ton of it and we\u00a0sewed.\u201dTwo little top-hat wearing\u00a0Beanie Babies\u00a0\u2014 a male holding a snowflake and a female with flowers \u2014\u00a0are attached to\u00a0these furry creations.\u00a0Worn by Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland, a perky comedic couple, the hats were inspired by a trip\u00a0the costume designer\u00a0Rob\u00a0Howell took to Punxsutawney, Pa., for the yearly sighting of the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil. \u201cThere\u2019s no big thought behind it other than wouldn\u2019t it be fun if....\u201d\u00a0Mr. Howell\u00a0said.A little purple hummingbird hovers over this 40s-era pinwheel hat, worn by the actress Lora Lee Gayer for the \u201cEaster Parade\u201d number in this stage adaptation of the 1942 movie musical. \u201cI wanted something that was elegant that would frame her face, but that was simple and had some humor,\u201d said the show\u2019s costume designer, Alejo Vietti. Glenn Close wears this dramatic piece in the number \u201cAs if We Never Said Goodbye,\u201d as Norma Desmond returns to the Paramount Studio lot after years in seclusion. The turban base is covered in off-white silk jersey, topped with a black felt hat and trimmed with burnt peacock feathers and a crystal jeweled medallion.It was designed by Anthony Powell and built by Woody Shelp for the original Broadway production in 1994, and remade for the revival by the designer Tracy Christensen.\u201cThis is a powerful hat,\u201d said Ms. Christensen. \u201cThis is not soft. It\u2019s not gentle. It\u2019s like, look at me, I\u2019m an important person and I am back.\u201dMr. Chisholm said he and the costume designer Toni-Leslie James, a Tony nominee for this production, agreed that Fielding would wear this seen-better-days hat yet again. \u201cThere\u2019s a remnant of his past life in that hat,\u201d said Mr. Chisholm.What goes with a dress made out of Metrocards? A turnstile, according to\u00a0the costume designer Clint Ramos.

{"Headline": "Walmart, With Amazon in Its Cross Hairs, Posts E-Commerce Gains", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byWalmart has always excelled at selling products in its cavernous stores. It appears to be getting its head around selling online, too.\u201cThis is extraordinary growth, and we\u2019re pleased with the traction we\u2019re generating across our e-commerce offerings,\u201d said Brett Biggs, Walmart\u2019s executive vice president and chief financial officer.Now the question is whether the company can sustain that growth to become a fiercer competitor to the online juggernaut Amazon. Walmart has invested heavily into building its online business over the years, but the results have been mixed \u2014 and Amazon has surged.Walmart\u2019s latest strategy, put in place by its current chief executive, Doug McMillon, has several parts: expand the number of products available online, better leverage its huge physical warehouses and distribution centers to reach customers quickly across the country, and aggressively pursue deals for online stores.The earnings results on Thursday gave only hints of about how much the acquisitions gave the company a one-time bump in sales, rather than long-lasting fruit from other changes the company has made. Overall sales rose 1.4 percent, to $117.5 billion, in the latest quarter compared with a year ago.Walmart executives said that the \u201cmajority\u201d of the company\u2019s online growth was organic \u2014 meaning not from the companies it had bought \u2014 but did not break out specific numbers. And while they were hesitant to declare that such growth was the new normal, they credited an expanded online assortment for helping to lure more repeat customers willing to open their wallets a little wider.Walmart said it now offers 50 million items through its website, up from 35 million in the last quarter and 10 million from the same time last year.Comparable-store sales, one measure of growth that looks at stores that have been open for at least a year, rose 1.4 percent. That number includes Walmart\u2019s core online business, but not items sold through Jet.com.Walmart completed its purchase of Jet in September. Smaller digital acquisitions followed, including ModCloth, a women\u2019s clothing retailer, and the outdoor apparel site Moosejaw.The deal for Jet was also widely seen as a play for its founder, Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur who could help fix Walmart\u2019s online strategy. Mr. Lore was put in charge of running Walmart.com after the acquisition, spearheading the face-off between the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its biggest online competitor.There is no doubt, though, that the company still has a ways to go before coming close to Amazon in e-commerce. Activity on Amazon, which recorded about $136 billion in annual sales last year, accounts for more than half of all online shopping in the United States.Walmart provides a growth figure only for its online business, and does not specify revenue.\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that Walmart is coming from behind online,\u201d said Neil Saunders, the managing director of the research firm GlobalData Retail. \u201cIt has underperformed in that area, so what we\u2019re seeing now is really a catch-up to where it needs to be in order to more seriously compete with the likes of Amazon.\u201dBut Walmart is also trying to improve its physical stores, and the results on Thursday indicated that those changes were helping. While profit fell 1.3 percent for the quarter, the uptick in comparable-store sales bucked the troubles many other large retailers have signaled recently. Target, for example, on Wednesday reported a small drop in same-store sales in its most recent quarter compared with the year before.Bruised by complaints of empty shelves and poor customer service, Walmart pledged to invest in training its in-store associates and revamping its grocery business with services like allowing customers to buy items online and pick them up in a store.It has also cut back on labor costs, relying more on automation. Customers at many stores can now make purchases through self-checkouts.Shares of Walmart stock rose about 3 percent to close at $77.54.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Humanity of Numbers", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byIvory TowerWith their strange and puzzling relationship to numbers, the Pirah\u00e3, a small group of hunter-gatherers who live deep in the Amazon rain forest, seem like some fantastical creation of Jorge Luis Borges. Their relationship to numbers is: They don\u2019t have one. The language they speak has no precise number words, not even \u201cone\u201d or \u201ctwo.\u201d It also lacks what linguists call grammatical number \u2014 terms like \u201cboth,\u201d from which you can tell the speaker is referring to two of something. While the Pirah\u00e3 do have some number-like phrases, they are ballpark expressions, like \u201ca few\u201d in English.More curious still, these linguistic limitations track behavioral limitations. The Pirah\u00e3 cannot, with any consistency, precisely differentiate quantities larger than 3. If you show them a lineup of seven spools of thread and ask them to replicate it, they struggle, creating lineups of five or six or eight. They can tell that a large group of spools is bigger than a much smaller group \u2014 psychologists call that an approximate number sense \u2014 but their exact number sense conks out after 3. Were there four Beatles or five? The Pirah\u00e3 couldn\u2019t rightly say.Everett stresses that numbers are not concepts we arrive at \u201cnaturally and natively.\u201d Like a flint arrowhead or the wheel, they are tools people invented a long time ago, and we know how to use them only because we find ourselves in a society in which that knowledge has been preserved and transmitted. Without these symbols, we, like the Pirah\u00e3, could not \u201csee\u201d divisions between most quantities. With them, as Everett tells it, our ancestors learned to count, and thereby \u201cradically transformed the human condition,\u201d making possible such number-dependent developments as complex agriculture.You needn\u2019t venture into the wild to find illustrations of our crude inborn number sense. Perhaps the most convincing evidence, Everett notes, comes from cognitive research on children. Even shortly after birth, prelinguistic infants are capable of identifying discrepancies between the quantities 1, 2 and 3, as well as recognizing disparities between large and small groups of things. But well after they start walking and talking, children still find it hard to learn what 4 and 5 are, and how they are related.This rudimentary feel for quantities \u2014 precision with small ones, blurry approximation thereafter \u2014 can be observed not only in young children and isolated peoples like the Pirah\u00e3 but also in nonhuman primates like chimps and some nonprimate animals like rats. It appears to be our genetic endowment, an apparatus good enough to have helped us survive the rigors of natural selection. It may also underlie certain widespread features of the world\u2019s languages, such as the fact that they permit distinctions between one thing and many (\u201ccar\u201d versus \u201ccars\u201d) and allow for the identification of two things (\u201cboth\u201d) or three (though not in English), but in no known cases do they give you the means to refer to precise quantities of 4 or more \u2014 unless, of course, you use a number.If numbers don\u2019t come to us naturally, where do they come from? When children learn numbers, Everett emphasizes, it can\u2019t be a process of learning names for concepts they already have. It must be a process of \u201cconcepting\u201d those names: Words like \u201cfour\u201d and \u201cfive\u201d and \u201csix\u201d function as place holders for ideas children eventually grasp. With instruction and practice, they start with concepts they know intuitively (such as that 2 is one more than 1) and learn to construct others by analogy (such as that 8 is one more than 7). Much as a fishing rod is a tool we use to acquire fish, number words are tools we use to acquire number concepts.This account seems to present a paradox: How did we ever manage to create names for quantities if we weren\u2019t able to recognize quantities without names for them? This consideration has led many scholars to conclude, contrary to Everett, that we must be biologically \u201cwired\u201d for numbers. Everett\u2019s response is speculative: While human beings typically cannot discriminate an exact quantity such as 4 without number words, he suggests that some people \u2014 people we might call inventors \u2014 must have occasionally hit upon the idea that the quantity of 4 could be referred to precisely. Many thousands of years ago, by giving names to these otherwise fleeting ideas, such inventors made their insights available to others, creating tools to be borrowed, shared and developed further.In 1202, Leonardo, also known as Leonardo Fibonacci, published \u201cThe Book of Calculation.\u201d While the book didn\u2019t contain any original mathematical discoveries, it did offer elegant methods for solving arithmetical problems, often using examples involving money \u2014 investing, converting or otherwise allocating it. The impact of these examples, which underscored the application of arithmetical methods to business and trade, was considerable. In the early 2000s, a historian of mathematics demonstrated that \u201cThe Book of Calculation\u201d was a main driver of the financial revolution that arose in medieval Tuscany soon after its publication. Around the same time, a professor of finance showed that the book\u2019s innovative treatment of financial decision making facilitated the development of complex financial tools over the next few hundred years.Devlin, a mathematician who has proved a few \u201clargely unremarkable theorems\u201d while distinguishing himself as a popular expositor of mathematics, has more than a little sympathy for Fibonacci. No doubt he was also relieved to learn that although Leonardo\u2019s name is attached to the famous set of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence, Leonardo did not discover them, but merely included a brief discussion of them in his book. The Fibonacci sequence \u2014 a progression of numbers whose first two terms are 1 and 1, and each subsequent term of which is the sum of the two preceding terms (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on) \u2014 seems to have first appeared more than a millennium earlier in a book by a Sanskrit grammarian.Or perhaps you\u2019d rather learn a bit more about that weird tribe in the Amazon?James Ryerson is a senior staff editor for The Times\u2019s Op-Ed page.

{"Headline": "Coach\u2019s $2.4 Billion Kate Spade Deal Aims at Weak Middle of Fashion Market", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byCoach and Kate Spade have long been the affordable luxury brands of choice for the aspirational shopper. From Coach\u2019s embossed logo and leather handbags to Kate Spade\u2019s kitschy, colorful accessories, their products lured buyers who wanted a taste of fashion without the sharpest edges \u2014 or the highest cost.But in recent years, those customers have gravitated to brands at more extreme ends of the style spectrum, toggling between e-commerce giants like Amazon, fast-fashion brands like H&M and Zara, and luxury houses like Gucci.Now, Coach has decided that its best path to growth is spending $2.4 billion for Kate Spade, hoping that expanding its portfolio of brands will help carve new territory in the crowded market.Its acquisition of Kate Spade, announced on Monday, confirms months of speculation on Wall Street, and is the latest in a series of purchases by the company, which aims to build a luxury group in the vein of European groups like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering, with two major differences: an identifiably American aesthetic and price.Coach\u2019s handbags sell for $285 to $3,000, while Kate Spade\u2019s retail for $100 to $500. (Louis Vuitton\u2019s are priced from $970 to $15,800.) The two companies also offer a combination of men\u2019s wear, ready-to-wear fashion, accessories, fragrances and homeware.\u201cWe believe Coach\u2019s extensive experience in opening and operating specialty retail stores globally, and brand building in international markets, can unlock Kate Spade\u2019s largely untapped global growth potential,\u201d he added.Coach, which offered $18.50 a share in cash for Kate Spade, a premium of 9 percent on the closing price on Friday, said it expected to generate about $50 million in savings from the deal within three years.But it has fallen on harder times in recent years, struggling against heightened competition, its own discounting of products and a bloated store network.Those difficulties mirror the challenges facing the retail sector in North America and beyond.While outlet stores have become more popular in recent years \u2014 Coach operates several hundred \u2014 department stores cannot attract the crowds they once did, and traffic to malls has slowed as people hunt for bargains online.Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, too, face the pressure of the migration to e-commerce, where once-mighty chains are struggling to catch up to Amazon and a crop of nimble digital upstarts.That has put more pressure on retailers, especially department stores, to slash prices and, therefore, squeeze profits. Giants like Macy\u2019s, JC Penney and Neiman Marcus have faced particularly challenging times.But that race to the bottom has also affected some of the brands those department stores carry, from mass-market retailers like Gap, J Crew and Urban Outfitters to high-end names like Ralph Lauren. Even Michael Kors, Coach\u2019s archrival and once a star in the sector, has been forced to retrench after a period of overexpansion.With its ubiquitous presence in shopping malls and department stores across the country, Coach has not been spared.This month, the company, which pioneered the sale of luxury handbags at relatively affordable prices, announced that department store revenue had fallen 40 percent in the most recent quarter, a sign of how heavy discounts, falling foot traffic and other troubles have seeped into the brand.\u201cCoach stuff was just so ubiquitous, and the brand had become a bit devalued, and no one wanted to pay full price for it,\u201d said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst with GlobalData Retail, a research firm.The constant discounting had diluted the brand\u2019s luxury appeal, and the company, under the direction of Mr. Luis, looked for ways to cut back on the discounts \u2014 including closing a significant number of its locations within department stores, known as \u201cshop-in-shops.\u201d\u201cIf you want to be a premium brand, you can\u2019t really be too strongly associated with some of the mainstream department stores like Macy\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Saunders said.Affordable luxury, too, is a competitive sector. Weaker brands cannot afford to discount too heavily and risk eroding their cache with customers even further.\u201cIn many ways the market is ripe for consolidation, which is partly what the Coach and Kate Spade merger reflects,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cIt\u2019s about bringing together complementary brands.\u201dKate Spade has also relied on heavy promotions. But the company has been busy remaking itself into a lifestyle brand, one that could benefit from Coach\u2019s broad distribution channels. As of July, Coach operated 228 retail locations and 204 outlets, along with 552 Coach-operated shop-in-shops, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report.The Kate Spade acquisition is the latest step in an ambitious turnaround plan that Mr. Luis has been leading.Mr. Luis also closed or renovated underperforming stores, re-examined Coach\u2019s pricing strategy and began a crusade to persuade customers to once again pay full price for its wares.But crucial to his strategy was the ambition to build a multibrand luxury conglomerate.Now Coach has Kate Spade, a company that has undergone its own transformations.Co-founded by a former fashion journalist in 1993, the brand was sold in 2006. The next year, Kate Spade\u2019s eponymous founder left the company. In 2014, the firm that controlled the brand sold several other brands before renaming itself Kate Spade & Company.The deal for Kate Spade was announced after analysts at HSBC wrote in a note to clients last week that Coach would be well suited to make acquisitions.\u201cWhile M&A, is not often seen positively by equity markets in luxury, we believe that for Coach it is different,\u201d the analysts wrote. Coach would benefit from making deals, they said, because it would reduce dependency on just one brand and lower the company\u2019s reliance on its own-brand stores.Better-than-expected earnings for its third quarter, which ended April 1, suggest that Coach\u2019s strategy is paying off.This is not the first time Coach has tried to expand its profile and balance sheet via separate brands.In 2009, after considering other acquisitions, Coach decided to create a brand from scratch and formed Reed Krakoff, a high-luxury brand with a minimalist architectural aesthetic founded by, and named for, Coach\u2019s executive creative director at the time.Though it received critical praise, the venture proved more costly than Coach had anticipated, and in 2013, it sold the company to a group of investors and Mr. Krakoff, who left Coach to concentrate on his own brand. But they struggled with the long profitability horizon of luxury goods, and in 2015, Reed Krakoff suspended trading.The moral of that story, at least for Mr. Luis, seems to be to focus on the accessible luxury market.An earlier version of a headline with this article misstated the amount that Coach is spending to acquire Kate Spade. It is $2.4 billion, not $2.4 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u2019 Wants That Loving Feeling", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s tough being a hitmaker who isn\u2019t weighed down by corporate expectations, but for a while, Mr. Gunn does a pretty good job of keeping the whole thing reasonably fizzy, starting with an opener that winks at the audience with big bangs and slapstick. The movie begins in medias res, with Quill and the gang facing down a blobby adversary with fat, snapping tentacles and rows of nasty teeth \u2014 the better to eat them with or just tear them limb from limb. The Guardians take whacks at the blob, jumping and thrashing around a patently digital environment that\u2019s vaguely far-out and indeterminate.These introductions are fairly chaotic, which is the usual blockbuster way. The point is to telegraph the movie you\u2019re about to watch \u2014 the threats, fights and winks followed by more threats, fights and winks \u2014 as well as to reintroduce the crew members, their skills, traits and foibles. Alternately bulgy and sleek, hairy and shticky, they make for often-amusing company, even if this time Zoe Saldana, as Gamora, the green-skinned Amazon with grave daddy issues, feels more sidelined than before. One problem, it seems, is that Mr. Gunn is still holding off on developing the romance between her and Peter that was teased in the first movie, probably because he\u2019s saving it for the next installment.The larger problem, as it becomes progressively evident, is that this series lacks a resonant origin story, a myth, on which a world, multiple stories and a fan base can rest. The Guardians\u2019 personal stories are continuing to emerge, and the meme that\u2019s in circulation is family, which at times makes it feel as if the movie is taking cues from the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d franchise. This explains the testy, at times violent and generally dreary exchanges between Gamora and her sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), a bald badass itching to deliver payback for their rotten childhood. The performers look fierce as they slam around, squaring jaws and giving good side-eye, but it just feels like narrative filler.For the most part, Mr. Gunn puts much of his storytelling energy into filling in Quill\u2019s origins, after having already dispatched Mom in the first movie. This doesn\u2019t sound promising and isn\u2019t, alas, despite the good will that Kurt Russell brings to the part of Quill\u2019s father, Ego. At one point, Mr. Russell, or some version of him, assays the role with a weird, disrupting digital face-lift that\u2019s meant to suggest the young Ego, but really only makes you contemplate whether this Benjamin Button-style age-reversing is going to become an increasingly standard (and creepy) industry practice. It\u2019s a distraction that shows a filmmaker making a bad decision mostly, it seems, because he can afford to.Still, before Mr. Russell is swallowed up by the story and digital effects, he holds you with the laid-back vibe of a Hollywood veteran whose tan and crinkly smile tell you that sunsets and Goldie Hawn are waiting for him back in Cali. He brings an unforced looseness to the movie that it very much needs, especially after Mr. Pratt slips into a more sober register in his daddy dearest scenes. Mr. Gunn likes to play a scene straight and then jokingly pull the rug out from under it, a trick that, among other things, helps soft-sell the violence. But the father-son stuff plays flatly less because it\u2019s been told before (like, forever) than because he can\u2019t figure out how to playfully kink it up.At times, Mr. Gunn\u2019s ambitions badly backfire. Like the first movie, this one is jammed with action-driven sequences, some wildly bloated and most of them cartoonish. For one fight, though, he cranks the music and lets the screen bleed as the ostensible good guys kill one villain after another, the casualties falling to the sound of a head-bobbing song. Tonally, the episode feels unpleasantly sour and wrong for this young series, which is best when it goes light; it\u2019s a bummer watching another director attempt the kind of smiling sadism that not even Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino can always pull off.In moments like this, Mr. Gunn loses sight of the insouciance and feeling that were crucial to making the first movie work. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative. Among the most appealing are the animated diorama-like tableaus that Ego uses to narrate his life, each a clue to his character. His private planet, meanwhile, is a kaleidoscopic fantasia that suggests modestly trippy science-fiction and heavy-metal cover art. This look \u2014 with its softly clashing colors and soaring stalagmites \u2014 seems designed to instigate, at least in some, flashbacks to stacks of yellowing paperbacks and lovingly played rock albums.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Frightful Five: They\u2019ve Got Us", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtA few weeks ago, I bought a new television. When the whole process was over, I realized something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction \u2014 figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so \u2014 I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon.It wasn\u2019t just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 percent of my household\u2019s commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What\u2019s more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children.This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there\u2019s a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison.This is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large \u2014 to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche.So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column\u2019s companion quiz.The Big Five tech companies increasingly dominate our lives. Could you ditch them?When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy \u2014 but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialize online using Twitter, Apple\u2019s messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal.Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don\u2019t normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft\u2019s word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I\u2019d hate to lose it.It\u2019s when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It\u2019s here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we\u2019ve come to depend on them.In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can\u2019t fathom living without it. Without the world\u2019s best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes \u2014 email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I\u2019d need after ditching Apple \u2014 I\u2019d be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992).And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life.When the kids were born, it became my household\u2019s Costco \u2014 supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?Which brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks.One evening three days after I\u2019d ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner.If such a future makes you blanch, that\u2019s the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you\u2019re right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behavior \u2014 a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t patronize Amazon.But if it\u2019s not Amazon for you, it\u2019ll be another of the five. Or, more likely, it already is. It\u2019s too late to escape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Our A.I. President", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byThe StoneIt is hard to imagine a more scathing indictment of our ability to read another\u2019s thoughts and intentions than our inability to predict Donald Trump\u2019s next move. From the gross pre-election misjudgments to postelection bafflement, the best pundits are at a loss to accurately anticipate his response to matters like North Korean military aggressiveness or his moment-by-moment political gyrations and opinion reversals. Labeling Trump a narcissist, psychopath, megalomaniac or attention-impaired, or all of the above, might feel explanatory, but even when armed with the best psychoanalytic insights, we have no idea what he will do when presented with a new or unforeseen circumstance.If conventional psychology isn\u2019t up to the task, perhaps we should step back and consider a tantalizing sci-fi alternative \u2014 that Trump doesn\u2019t operate within conventional human cognitive constraints, but rather is a new life form, a rudimentary artificial intelligence-based learning machine. When we strip away all moral, ethical and ideological considerations from his decisions and see them strictly in the light of machine learning, his behavior makes perfect sense.Consider how deep learning occurs in neural networks such as Google\u2019s Deep Mind or IBM\u2019s Deep Blue and Watson. In the beginning, each network analyzes a number of previously recorded games, and then, through trial and error, the network tests out various strategies. Connections for winning moves are enhanced; losing connections are pruned away. The network has no idea what it is doing or why one play is better than another. It isn\u2019t saddled with any confounding principles such as what constitutes socially acceptable or unacceptable behavior or which decisions might result in negative downstream consequences.Now up the stakes; instead of Go, Jeopardy, backgammon, poker and chess domination, ask a neural network to figure out the optimal strategy for the biggest game in town \u2014 the United States presidency. In this hypothetical, let\u2019s input and analyze all available written and spoken word \u2014 from mainstream media commentary to the most obscure one-off crank pamphlets. After running simulations of various hypotheses, the network will serve up its suggestions. It might show Trump which areas of the country are most likely to respond to personal appearances, which rallies and town hall meetings will generate the greatest photo op and TV coverage, and which publicly manifest personality traits will garner the most votes. If it determines that outrage is the only road to the presidency, it will tell Trump when and where his opinions must be scandalous and offensively polarizing.Further imagine that the Trump A.I. machine determines that the opinions most likely to get him elected have slim chances of being carried out once he is president. To the extent that traditional politicians are embarrassed by flip-flops or bound by ethical and moral values or both, they are likely to display a degree of restraint and hedging of controversial positions. Winning at any cost is at least partially balanced by underlying principles. Not so for a neural network. There is no cringe factor, no sense of anticipated embarrassment or humiliation with seemingly random changes of mind. There is no concern with subsequent disclosures of misrepresentations, falsifications and outright lies. As the U.C.L.A. Bruins football coach Henry Sanders, known as Red, once said, \u201cWinning isn\u2019t everything; it\u2019s the only thing.\u201dFollowing the successful election, it chews on new data. When it recognizes that Obamacare won\u2019t be easily repealed or replaced, that token intervention in Syria can\u2019t be avoided, that NATO is a necessity and that pulling out of the Paris climate accord may create worldwide resentment, it has no qualms about changing policies and priorities. From an A.I. vantage point, the absence of a coherent agenda is entirely understandable. For example, a consistent long-term foreign policy requires a steadfastness contrary to a learning machine\u2019s constant upgrading in response to new data.A caveat to media gurus, historians and policy wonks: As there are no lines of reasoning driving the network\u2019s actions, it is not possible to reverse engineer the network to reveal the \u201cwhy\u201d of any decision. Asking why a network chose a particular action is like asking why Amazon might recommend James Ellroy and Elmore Leonard novels to someone who has just purchased \u201cCrime and Punishment.\u201d There is no underlying understanding of the nature of the books; the association is strictly a matter of analyzing Amazon\u2019s click and purchase data. Without explanatory reasoning driving decision making, counterarguments become irrelevant. The most cogent reasons that solar power is preferable to burning coal will fall on deaf circuits as long as the Trump network continues to determine that Trump is doing a great job.To know how this network assesses his performance, we need to know what basic positive and negative values Trump has inputted, and how they might compete with one another to determine whether or not he\u2019s succeeding. It is easy to come up with a list of likely motivating goals such as power, money, brand-name recognition, public praise, vindication, retribution and idolization. As recent history has shown us, these goals seem to vary from moment to moment. Unfortunately, a constantly shifting definition of what constitutes \u201cwinning\u201d further increases our inability to predict his behavior.As armchair psychologists, we have the gut feeling that with enough information and psychological savvy, we can figure out what makes Trump tick. Unfortunately there is no supporting evidence for this wishful thinking. Once we accept that Donald Trump represents a black-box, first-generation artificial-intelligence president driven solely by self-selected data and widely fluctuating criteria of success, we can get down to the really hard question confronting our collective future: Is there a way to affect changes in a machine devoid of the common features that bind humanity?An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a popular crime novelist.

{"Headline": "Have You Heard the One About the Angsty Comic? Yes, Too Often", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byJohnny Carson moved \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d from New York the year before. Since then, the driver says, \u201cevery smart aleck who thinks he can tell a joke has been circling Burbank like a vulture.\u201d (I\u2019m paraphrasing; like his passengers, the cabby works blue.)They say that explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog: The frog dies in the process. At this point, TV is dissecting so many comedians\u2019 psyches that it risks killing the whole genre.Only occasionally, though, did comedians play comedians, and when they did, as on \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d the work was usually ancillary to the plot. Jerry\u2019s stand-up punctuated the show, but his career just sort of happened in between rounds of diner philosophy and run-ins with Newman.But the context of it all is the hustle of comedy life for Louis C.K.\u2019s alter ego, a comic who\u2019s successful, albeit not quite as successful as the star. In one story line, he has a shot at taking David Letterman\u2019s job but doesn\u2019t get it; in another, he nurses jealousy after his frenemy, Marc Maron, lands a TV show.In real life, it was Mr. Maron who got a TV show (\u201cMaron\u201d) after Louis C.K., also playing a version of himself as a comedian. So did, to name a few, Maria Bamford (\u201cLady Dynamite\u201d), George Lopez (\u201cLopez\u201d), Andrew Dice Clay (\u201cDice\u201d), Jim Gaffigan (\u201cThe Jim Gaffigan Show\u201d), John Mulaney (\u201cMulaney\u201d) and Pete Holmes (\u201cCrashing\u201d). Like the Velvet Underground, \u201cLouie\u201d \u2014 now on indefinite hiatus \u2014 had only a cult following, but it seems to have inspired endless followers.As with a lot of showbiz comedy, there\u2019s an element of write-what-you-know insiderism here \u2014 gazing into one\u2019s own belly laughs.But stand-up comedy is also revealing of character in an intimate way. It\u2019s both personal and gladiatorial. Comedians face an audience alone, with no co-stars, no collaborators. They are both material and author, performer and instrument. Even when their material isn\u2019t autobiographical, it\u2019s still personal \u2014 their worldview, their judgment \u2014 and it\u2019s judged immediately: laugh or no laugh.It\u2019s no-risk, no-reward, which is why \u201cDice\u201d and \u201cLopez,\u201d with their generic focuses on the troubles of fame, are so forgettable. What makes a good story about comedy is what makes good comedy: a fresh take and distinctive material.These shows, in other words, knew their voice, or found it. And it\u2019s a lack of original voice that sinks \u201cI\u2019m Dying Up Here,\u201d a drama that takes the travails of comics all too seriously.Created by Dave Flebotte and based on a nonfiction book by William Knoedelseder, \u201cDying\u201d looks at comedy from the cheap seats. It follows an ensemble of thirsty young comics living on Rice-a-Roni and being groomed by Goldie (Melissa Leo), the no-bull owner of a comedy club, while dreaming of \u201cTonight.\u201d (Carson, played by Dylan Baker, is one of several real-life comedy-world figures who figure in the series, \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d style.)One of the group makes it to Johnny\u2019s couch, then dies in an apparent suicide \u2014 and before the first episode ends with Ringo Starr\u2019s \u201cIt Don\u2019t Come Easy,\u201d you know you\u2019re in for another tale of paying dues and showbiz blues. (The executive producers include Jim Carrey, who starred in the Andy Kaufman hagiography \u201cMan on the Moon.\u201d)\u201cDying\u201d is best in its small moments \u2014 comedians disarming hecklers and competitively busting chops, Goldie nudging her brood over who has a \u201ctight 15\u201d (a solid quarter-hour comedy routine). The series has a touch of golden-hued Cameron Crowe romanticism.Ultimately, \u201cDying\u201d is less a show-business story than a ham-handed period drama. Vietnam vets, Bobby Riggs versus Billie Jean King: By the time a character began a scene saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching these Watergate hearings, and \u2026 ,\u201d I was ready to say, \u201cStop, I\u2019ve heard this one before.\u201dIt\u2019s not the story of a bad-boy rebel, but of Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan), a vivacious Upper West Side homemaker married to an aspiring comic. When he leaves her \u2014 claiming that married life is holding him back, though his only talent is for ripping off Bob Newhart routines \u2014 she finds herself onstage at the Gaslight Cafe, improvising a raunchy, fiery set that brings down the house (and gets her arrested on obscenity charges). Her ex has given her the best divorce settlement a budding comic can receive: material.\u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d is all voice, not surprising given that it comes from Amy Sherman-Palladino, of the dialogue-drunk \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d The pilot suffers from whimsy overload \u2014 it\u2019s a bit \u201cWes Anderson does open-mike night.\u201d But Ms. Brosnahan has real verve, and it\u2019s a refreshing twist on a tired story \u2014 the frustrated male artist held back by domestic obligations \u2014 that \u201cDying,\u201d in one of its many subplots, plays completely straight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ESPN Is Betting on Big Personalities to Restore Its Fortunes", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byAnd in a world where viewers can catch a must-see play on Facebook or stream an entire football game on Twitter, who needs a traditional highlight show like \u201cSportsCenter\u201d that focuses on highlights and updates like player injuries and roster moves?\u201cWe at ESPN are optimists,\u201d John Skipper, ESPN\u2019s president, said on Tuesday at the network\u2019s annual presentation to advertisers. \u201cOf course, the current environment forces us to be realists as well as optimists.\u201dSo ESPN is shaking things up.The theme was a bet on the power of the network\u2019s personalities. ESPN formally announced several new shows \u2014 including a three-hour morning block with the longtime ESPN host Mike Greenberg, and one that will feature the commentators Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre. In an apparent effort to draw viewers to \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d its crown jewel since 1979, ESPN has retooled the show, tying time slots to specific anchors, including Kenny Mayne, one of the network\u2019s best-known personalities. The show will not air at all from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. on ESPN\u2019s main channel.The network has also signed new deals with other ESPN veterans, including Sage Steele and Hannah Storm, who will have a new role that includes hosting prime-time specials. Ms. Steele will host a three-hour morning version of \u201cSportsCenter\u201d on ESPN2.In an effort to meet viewers on their various devices, the network announced SportsCenter Right Now, short news updates online and twice hourly on ESPN during the day. During the presentation, Mr. Skipper highlighted ESPN\u2019s inclusion in television packages offered by the likes of Sling TV and Hulu.ESPN\u2019s efforts to adapt to the digital age are indicative of broader challenges facing cable television. Cord-cutting has accelerated sharply in the last quarter, with traditional cable and satellite providers losing 732,000 subscribers compared with a loss of 102,000 in the same period a year ago, according to research by Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. Lower-priced \u201cskinny\u201d online packages of channels have not made up the slack.National television advertising fell 1 percent in the last quarter, the most in nearly two years.The shifting media landscape has been particularly hard on ESPN. The network has dropped subscribers in the last several years even as sports programming rights have become more expensive. ESPN, for instance, recently paid $12 billion for a nine-year deal with the N.B.A.Disney, ESPN\u2019s parent company, has staked some hope on an ESPN-branded subscription streaming service that it plans to introduce by the end of the year. But at least initially, the service will mostly stream sporting events for which ESPN owns the programming rights but does not televise, like certain tennis matches, cricket matches and various college sports.Wall Street, however, has looked mostly askance at Disney\u2019s plans for ESPN. During the conference call, analysts bombarded Mr. Iger with questions about the network. The company\u2019s share price is down 7 percent since the last week in April, mirroring an industrywide decline that was driven by fears of cord-cutting and weak ad sales.At the presentation on Tuesday, ESPN acknowledged its troubles, but did not let them detract from the over-the-top ritual of television\u2019s yearly pitch to advertisers. As they nibbled on breakfast sandwiches and avocado toast, the network paraded stars across the stage at a Broadway theater in Midtown Manhattan. Serena Williams sat for a short interview with Mr. Greenberg to promote his morning studio show that will start next year. Paul Pierce, the former N.B.A. star, appeared (\u201cI\u2019m still pulling for the Celtics,\u201d he said), as did many of the network\u2019s biggest names, including Scott Van Pelt, Suzy Kolber, Jon Gruden and Mr. Mayne.Absent, of course, was the talent the network laid off last month, including the former N.F.L. players Trent Dilfer and Danny Kanell, the former baseball general manager Jim Bowden, and the longtime N.F.L. reporter Ed Werder. Mr. Skipper was not available to talk to reporters after the presentation.But while the network threw out the occasional statistic \u2014 Mr. Skipper said ESPN\u2019s prime-time audience was up 15 percent in the first quarter and digital products reached more than 100 million people \u2014 the program lacked the torrent of sliced-and-diced numbers that often invade such presentations.ESPN was, for the most part, in sell mode, at times poking fun at the notion that television advertising was outdated.\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor for the strength of cable,\u201d he said, as he freed himself. \u201cLook at it that way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jared Kushner\u2019s Other Real Estate Empire", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byFeatureThis article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica, the independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization.In the townhouse next door lived an older woman with whom Warren became friendly, even doing her grocery shopping once in a while. But over the course of a few months, the woman started acting strangely. She began accosting Warren\u2019s visitors. She shouted through the walls during the day. And at night she banged on the wall, right where Warren kept the bassinet in which her third child slept, waking him up.Warren sent a letter reporting the problem to the complex\u2019s property manager, a company called Sawyer Realty Holdings. When there was no response, she decided to move out. In January 2010, she submitted the requisite form giving two months\u2019 notice that she was transferring her Section 8 voucher \u2014 the federal low-income subsidy that helped her pay the rent \u2014 elsewhere. The complex\u2019s on-site manager signed the form a week later, checking the line that read \u201cThe tenant gave notice in accordance with the lease.\u201dSo Warren was startled in January 2013, three years later, when she received a summons from a private process server informing her that she was being sued for $3,014.08 by the owner of Cove Village. The lawsuit, filed in Maryland District Court, was doubly bewildering. It claimed she owed the money for having left in advance of her lease\u2019s expiration, though she had received written permission to leave. And the company suing her was not Sawyer, but one whose name she didn\u2019t recognize: JK2 Westminster L.L.C.Warren was raising three children alone while taking classes for a bachelor\u2019s degree in health care administration, and she disregarded the summons at first. But JK2 Westminster\u2019s lawyers persisted; two more summonses followed. In April 2014, she appeared without a lawyer at a district-court hearing. She told the judge about the approval for her move, but she did not have a copy of the form the manager had signed. The judge ruled against Warren, awarding JK2 Westminster the full sum it was seeking, plus court costs, attorney\u2019s fees and interest that brought the judgment to nearly $5,000. There was no way Warren, who was working as a home health aide, was going to be able to pay such a sum. \u201cI was so desperate,\u201d she said.If the case was confounding to Warren, it was not unique. Hundreds like it have been filed over the last five years by JK2 Westminster and affiliated businesses in the state of Maryland alone, where the company owns some 8,000 apartments and townhouses. Nor was JK2 Westminster quite as anonymous as its opaque name suggested. It was a subsidiary of a large New York real estate firm called Kushner Companies, which was led by a young man whose initials happened to be J.K.: Jared Kushner.But the Kushners\u2019 empire, like Trump\u2019s, was underwritten by years of dealing in much more modestly ambitioned properties. Jared\u2019s grandfather Joseph Kushner, a Holocaust survivor from Belarus, over his lifetime built a small construction company in New Jersey into a real estate venture that owned and managed some 4,000 low-rise units concentrated in the suburbs of Newark. After taking over the business, Charles expanded Kushner Companies\u2019 holdings to commercial and industrial spaces, but the company\u2019s bread and butter remained the North Jersey apartment complexes bequeathed to him by his father.A year later, in August 2012, a Kushner-led investment group bought 5,500 multifamily units in the Baltimore area with $371 million in financing from Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage lender \u2014 another considerable bargain. Two years later, Kushner Companies picked up three more complexes in the Baltimore area for $37.9 million. Today, Westminster Management, Kushner Companies\u2019 property-management arm, lists 34 complexes under its control in Maryland, Ohio and New Jersey, with a total of close to 20,000 units.The complexes date mostly from the 1960s and \u201970s, when white flight from the city was creating a huge demand for affordable housing in Baltimore County. They were meant to exude middle-class respectability \u2014 unglamorous but safe and pleasant enough, a renter\u2019s Levittown. Since then, however, they have slipped socioeconomically, along with the middle class itself, into the vast gray area of the modern precariat \u2014 home to casino workers, distribution-warehouse pickers, Uber drivers, students at for-profit colleges. Although most of the tenants I met in a series of recent visits to the complexes pay their own rent, ranging from about $800 to $1,300, some of them receive Section 8 assistance, as Kamiia Warren did; Baltimore County has no public housing for a population of more than 825,000, so these and similar complexes have become the de facto substitute.At the time of the 2012 Baltimore purchase, Kushner raved about the promise of the low-end multifamily market. \u201cIt\u2019s proven over the last few years to be the most resilient asset class, and at the end of the day, it\u2019s a very stable asset class,\u201d he told Multifamily Executive. He said things were proceeding well in the Midwestern complexes he purchased a year earlier. \u201cIt was a lot of construction and a lot of evictions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the communities now look great, and the outcome has been phenomenal.\u201dThe garnishing started that month. Warren was in the midst of leaving her job, but JK2 Westminster garnished her bank account too. After her account was zeroed out, a loss of about $900, she borrowed money from her mother to buy food for her children and pay her bills. That February \u2014 five years after she left Cove Village \u2014 Warren returned to court, this time with the housing form in hand, asking the judge to halt garnishment. \u201cI am a single mom of three and my bank account was wiped clean by the plaintiff,\u201d she pleaded in another handwritten request. \u201cI cannot take care of my kids when they snatch all of my money out of my account. I do not feel I owe this money. Please have mercy on my family and I.\u201d She told me that when she called the law office representing JK2 Westminster that same day from the courthouse to discuss the case, one of the lawyers told her: \u201cThis is not going to go away. You will pay us.\u201dThe judge denied Warren\u2019s request without explanation. And JK2 Westminster kept pressing for the rest of the money, sending out one process server after another to present Warren with legal papers. Finally, in January 2016, the court sent notice of a $4,615 lien against Warren \u2014 a legal claim against her for the remaining judgment. Warren began to cry as she recounted the episode to me. She said the lien has greatly complicated her hopes of taking out a loan to start her own small assisted-living center. She had gone a couple of years without a bank account, for fear of further garnishing. \u201cIt was just pure greed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was unnecessary.\u201d I asked why she hadn\u2019t pushed harder against the judgment once she had the necessary evidence in hand. \u201cThey know how to work this stuff,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey know what to do, and here I am, I don\u2019t know anything about the law. I would have to hire a lawyer or something, and I really can\u2019t afford that. I really don\u2019t know my rights. I don\u2019t know all the court lingo. I knew that up against them I would lose.\u201dA search for \u201cJK2 Westminster\u201d in the database of Maryland\u2019s District Court system brings back 548 cases in which it is the plaintiff \u2014 and that does not include hundreds of other cases that have been filed in the name of the company\u2019s individual complexes.A vast majority of these cases have been filed by a single small law firm in the Baltimore suburb of Owings Mills. The law office of Jeffrey Tapper specializes in \u201ccollections\u201d work, with an emphasis on landlord-tenant cases. It has represented several other real estate management companies, including Sawyer, which retains a stake in many of the Kushner complexes.In April, I drove to Owings Mills in hopes of speaking to Tapper. As I waited for him by reception, I overheard an assistant making a call about a new case, saying that the firm would continue to pursue one tenant even if the other person on the lease had filed for bankruptcy. Tapper emerged, a man in his mid-60s with white hair, a paunch and a large smartphone clipped to his belt. Our interview was brief. \u201cI\u2019m not having any conversation with you that has to do with one of my clients,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not helping you with any of whatever you\u2019re trying to do.\u201dIn the cases that Tapper has brought to court on behalf of JK2 Westminster and individual Kushner-controlled companies, there is a clear pattern of Kushner Companies\u2019 pursuing tenants over virtually any unpaid rent or broken lease \u2014 even in the numerous cases where the facts appear to be on the tenants\u2019 side. Not only does the company file cases against them, it pursues the cases for as long as it takes to collect from the overmatched defendants \u2014 often several years. The court docket of JK2 Westminster\u2019s case against Warren, for instance, spans more than three years and 112 actions \u2014 for a sum that amounts to maybe two days\u2019 worth of billings for the average corporate-law-firm associate, from a woman who never even rented from JK2 Westminster. The pursuit is all the more remarkable given how transient the company\u2019s prey tends to be. Hounding former tenants for money means paying to send out process servers who often report back that they were unable to locate the target. This does not deter Kushner Companies\u2019 lawyers. They send the servers back out again a few months later.In March 2009, Joan Beverly, a probation agent, signed the lease for her daughter, Lennettea, for a unit at Dutch Village, a complex on the northern edge of Baltimore. Lennettea moved out a year later, several months before her lease was up. Kushner Companies bought Dutch Village more than two years later. In December 2012, JK2 Westminster filed suit in Baltimore County District Court against Beverly, seeking $3,810.16 \u2014 several months of rent it said it was owed, plus about $1,000 in repair costs, including $10 for \u201cfailure to return laundry room card.\u201dThat February, Lennettea filed a written court notice explaining that her mother, who was dying of pancreatic cancer, was \u201cin terminal hospice care and is not eligible to work.\u201d She added by way of supporting evidence a letter from the hospice provider to Joan Beverly\u2019s bank, explaining her and her husband\u2019s late mortgage payments on their home: \u201cThere has been added financial stress because Mrs. Beverly is very ill at this time.\u201d But JK2 Westminster persisted in seeking a hearing on the suit. In March, a district court judge found in favor of the company \u2014 a total judgment against Joan of more than $5,500.Joan died two weeks later. Her husband, Tyrone Beverly, a retired longshoreman, requested that the judgment against his deceased wife be removed but was denied. The case remains open in the court database. Tyrone, who was married to Joan for 32 years, told me that he had assumed the judgment had been dismissed and was unaware that it was still listed as awaiting payment. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t treat us fair,\u201d he said.The sweeping nature of the company\u2019s pursuit of tenants was most evident when those tenants were, in fact, prepared to defend themselves. Shawanda Hough moved out of her unit in the Carriage Hill complex in the northwestern Baltimore suburb of Randallstown in early 2012 after black mold worsened her son\u2019s asthma, landing him in the hospital twice. After the maintenance crew tried and failed to fix the problem, she got the rental office\u2019s written permission to move out in advance of her lease. But then Kushner Companies bought Carriage Hill, and a year and a half later, in August 2013, JK2 Westminster filed a lawsuit against Hough, seeking $4,068.53.Hough fought back. In a court filing, she said that she had kept all of her documentation, and that the company had assured her that it had not lost a dime in rent; she had gone so far as to coordinate the time of her departure with the arrival of a new tenant. JK2 Westminster went ahead with a hearing before a judge a month later, but the judge ultimately found for Hough.Cases like Hough\u2019s, however, were the exception rather than the rule. Over all, about nine out of every 10 cases brought by JK2 Westminster that I surveyed resulted in judgments against the defendants, who often did not appear in person for the hearings \u2014 and if they did, almost never had legal representation. How could it possibly be worth Kushner Companies\u2019 while to pursue hundreds of people so aggressively over a few thousand dollars here and there? After all, the pursuit itself cost money. And it wasn\u2019t happening just in Baltimore \u2014 Doug Wilkins, a lawyer in Toledo who has represented some of the complexes bought there by Kushner, told me the company is seeking far more monetary judgments than did previous owners.When I presented JK2 Westminster\u2019s record of litigation to Matthew Cypher, a Georgetown University business professor who used to work for the real estate giant Invesco, he said it was highly unusual to put so much effort into pursuing former tenants in court. \u201cThese people fade into the shadows of the night,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that there\u2019s that much to go after.\u201d Brian Pendergraft, an attorney in Greenbelt, Md., who works on both sides of landlord-tenant litigation, told me he had heard of large property-management companies pursuing former tenants for unpaid rent but not going so far as to pursue tenants who predated the company\u2019s ownership of a complex. \u201cI guess you can do it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool.\u201dBut Matthew Hertz, whose Bethesda, Md., firm represents landlords and tenants in similar cases, explained to me that there is a logic behind such aggressive tactics. The costs of the pursuit are not as high as you might imagine, he said \u2014 people are not that hard to find in the age of cellphones and easily accessible databases. \u201cIf I give my process server a name and phone number, it\u2019s generally enough to trace you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I have a date of birth and Social Security number, it\u2019s even easier.\u201d The legal costs can be billed to the defendant as attorney\u2019s fees, if the terms of the lease allow. And garnishing wages is relatively easy to do by court order, assuming the defendant has wages to garnish.As for pursuing former tenants from years before the new company\u2019s ownership of a complex, Hertz said it was hardly different from an investor\u2019s buying a portfolio of mortgages: It\u2019s debt to be collected on. \u201cIf you buy someone\u2019s properties, you\u2019re buying their debts, not just their assets. You take the good with the bad, and try to collect on the bad. Even if you only get back 5 percent, you\u2019re making something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m buying up this property and if I can collect anything, it\u2019s gravy on top.\u2019\u2009\u201dThere was, Hertz added, an ancillary benefit to such relentless pursuit: sending a message to current tenants. One way to make sure that tenants are paying their rent and to keep them from breaking leases early \u2014 which brings with it the costs and hassles of having to clean apartments and find new tenants \u2014 is to instill a sense of fear about violating a lease. \u201cAny landlord takes that into account,\u201d Hertz said. \u201cThey know tenants are going to talk to each other. If they say, \u2018He\u2019s going to come after you,\u2019 it\u2019s deterrence.\u201dWhen Kushner Companies finally responded to my questions about the cases, they essentially affirmed Hertz\u2019s reasoning. As manager for the Baltimore complexes, the company had a \u201cfiduciary obligation\u201d to its ownership partners to collect as much revenue as it could, said Kushner Companies\u2019 chief financial officer, Jennifer McLean, in a written response. She said the company\u2019s legal costs have been \u201cminimal\u201d compared with what it seeks to recover.McLean declined to comment on several cases, including Kamiia Warren\u2019s. But she said the pursuit of Joan Beverly, the woman dying of cancer, was justified. \u201cThis tenant owed the landlord $3,819.16,\u201d she said in the written statement. \u201cAs property manager, it\u2019s our job to collect rent payments.\u201dIn general, \u201cWestminster Management only takes legal action against a tenant when absolutely necessary,\u201d McLean said. \u201cIf legal action is pursued, however, the company follows guidelines consistent with industry standards.\u201d She added: \u201cWhile taking a tenant to court is far from an ideal outcome, that option \u2014 and clear rules governing it \u2014 must exist as a last resort.\u201dThe complex, like the others I saw, seemed designed to preclude neighborliness \u2014 most of the townhouses lack even the barest stoop to sit out on, and at least one complex has signs forbidding ball-playing (\u201cviolators will be prosecuted\u201d). At another complex, kids had drawn a rectangle on the side of a storage shed in lieu of a hoop for their basketball game. The only meeting points at many of the complexes are the metal mailbox stands, the Dumpsters and the laundry room. And the only thing that united many of the residents I spoke to, it seemed, was resentment of their landlord.They complained about Westminster Management\u2019s aggressive rent-collection practices, which many told me exceeded what they had experienced under the previous owners. Rent is marked officially late, they said, if it arrives after 4:30 p.m. on the fifth day of the month. But Westminster recently made paying the rent much more of a challenge. Last fall, it sent notice to residents saying that they could no longer pay by money order (on which many residents, who lack checking accounts, had relied) at the complex\u2019s rental office and would instead need to go to a Walmart or Ace Cash Express and use an assigned \u201cWIPS card\u201d \u2014 a plastic card linked to the resident\u2019s account \u2014 to pay their rent there. That method carries a $3.50 fee for every payment, and getting to the Walmart or Ace is difficult for the many residents without cars.Tenants who pay after the 5th are hit with late fees that start around $40 to $50 and escalate from there, with court fees usually added on as well. What upsets residents most, though, are not the fees themselves but that the property managers, instead of putting pink or yellow late notices and court summonses discreetly in mailboxes or under doors, post them in public \u2014 on the front doors of townhouse units or on lobby walls or lobby doors of apartment buildings. This bothered even tenants who said they always paid their rent on time. \u201cThe whole neighborhood knows,\u201d said Marquita Parmely, a truck driver who pays $1,010 a month to rent a townhouse at Essex Park, near Cove Village. Dareck Cromwell, a retiree living at Carriage Hill, told me: \u201cThey put them in the windows for everybody to see, to see your business. That\u2019s not right. You don\u2019t put people\u2019s business out like that.\u201dCompounding these grievances was Westminster\u2019s maintenance of the properties \u2014 or lack thereof. Their complexes comprise hundreds of units, but typically have only four or so workers looking after them. Alishia Jamesson, a 30-year-old Highland Village resident, invited me into the small living room of the $842-a-month townhouse she and her fianc\u00e9 share with her two children. The room was cluttered with bags from Walmart and Dollar Tree, ketchup packets and supplies for the work Jamesson took up after she lost her cashier\u2019s job at Walmart for missing too many shifts for parenting duties: making personalized tote bags and gift baskets for weddings.Jamesson showed me three large holes in the walls of the townhouse, which Westminster charged her and her fianc\u00e9, Keith Riggs, $150 to fix in October but had not yet repaired. \u201cEvery time I ask about drywall they say, \u2018Oh, well, we only have one drywall person,\u2019\u2009\u201d Riggs told me. There was also black mold spreading around the bathtub, a large brown stain and crack on the wall adjacent to the stove and a gap in the bathroom skylight that allowed in rain and snow. Jamesson told me that the refrigerator hadn\u2019t worked for more than a month before being replaced; her family had lived on canned food and boxed milk.Complaints about poor upkeep abounded at the other complexes too. At Highland Village, there was the matter of the vacant unit that burned down one night a couple of months ago: its shell was still standing, attended by nothing but plywood and a tarp. At Essex Park, east of the city, Marquita Parmely, the truck driver, told me she had a mouse infestation that was severe enough that her 12-year-old daughter recently found one in her bed. Parmely also has a 2-year-old with asthma, which is aggravated by allergens in mice droppings. She moved her own bed and other furniture away from the walls to dissuade mice, kept the family\u2019s laundry in tote bags after mice started appearing in the hamper and vacuumed twice a day. Her neighbor told me it took weeks for staff members to replace a rear window that had been shot out by kids with a BB gun.At the Carroll Park complex in Middle River, Md., Jen Jackson showed me a ceiling leak that was causing a mold problem. At the Whispering Woods townhouses nearby, a resident named Nicole, who asked that I not use her last name, told me she had filed unheeded complaints about loose plastic shutters, one of which finally fell off and hit her in the head. (When I visited Nicole again a few weeks later, she told me that Westminster staff had scolded her for speaking with me and told her not to do so again. A large black pickup followed me and a photographer as we walked through the complex until we left.) In the same complex, Renee Cook showed me the large swath of her downstairs ceiling that had collapsed and the mold and mildew beneath the carpet, each resulting from a leak from her neighbor\u2019s (illicit) washer-dryer.Asked about such conditions, Kushner Companies said it follows industry standards for maintenance staffing and exterminator visits, and that it and its partners had spent $10 million on upgrades across the complexes. \u201cDespite those improvements, issues still arise, given the age of the properties,\u201d said McLean, the chief financial officer. Shortly after I put questions to the company about specific tenants\u2019 complaints, Cook\u2019s ceiling was repaired.The worst troubles may have been those described in a 2013 court case involving Jasmine Cox\u2019s unit at Cove Village. They began with the bedroom ceiling, which started leaking one day. Then maggots started coming out of the living-room carpet. Then raw sewage started flowing out of the kitchen sink. \u201cIt sounded like someone turned a pool upside down,\u201d Cox told me. \u201cI heard the water hitting the floor and I panicked. I got out of bed and the sink is black and gray, it\u2019s pooling out of the sink and the house smells terrible.\u201dCox stopped cooking for herself and her son, not wanting food near the sink. A judge allowed her reduced rent for one month. When she moved out soon afterward, Westminster Management sent her a $600 invoice for a new carpet and other repairs. Cox, who is now working as a battery-test engineer and about to buy her first home, was unaware who was behind the company that had put her through such an ordeal. When I told her of Kushner\u2019s involvement, there was a silence as she took it in.\u201cGet that [expletive] out of here,\u201d she said.East of the city, I met Chris Freimiller, a 38-year-old resident of the company\u2019s Morningside Park complex, who was smoking Newports in his car before heading to work at a Rite Aid distribution center. Freimiller complained to me about the persistent leaks from the toilet and the ceiling damage it had caused, and about being hit repeatedly with late fees. He told me he voted for president for the first time ever last year \u2014 for Donald Trump. His vote, he said, was motivated by \u201cthe racial and police issues. How bad it got with Obama and how he seemed to promote the cop-bashing and the racial divide.\u201d Did knowing that he was sending his late fees to Trump\u2019s son-in-law change anything? \u201cYeah, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cAs if they need any more money.\u201dOn April 17, three cases were being held consecutively in Baltimore\u2019s District Court involving tenants of the Dutch Village complex. One was against Catherine Silver, a Morgan State University student who had given notice that she was moving at the end of March \u2014 she was fed up with lousy maintenance (among other things, a perpetually clogged toilet and a ceiling leak in her closet). But when Silver went to Walmart to pay her March rent with her WIPS card, the money mistakenly ended up not in the account for Dutch Village but the one for Kushner Companies\u2019 adjacent complex, Pleasantview.Westminster Management started eviction proceedings. On March 23, a sheriff\u2019s deputy changed the locks on the unit. Silver was traveling at the time \u2014 it was spring break \u2014 and it was not until March 31 that she was able to explain to a judge what happened and get her keys back. By that point, it was too late to get her possessions into the moving truck she\u2019d rented, and classes had resumed. She stayed in the unit, in which Westminster had turned off the heat and hot water, trying again to plan her departure. But Westminster was now after her for April\u2019s rent, despite the fact that the company had literally barred her from being able to move before April, as she had intended. On April 25, a judge ruled that she needed to pay half of April\u2019s rent, plus court costs: $471.Westminster had a lawyer from Tapper\u2019s firm, Andrew Rabinowitz, at the April 25 hearing, which lasted more than three hours \u2014 all over less than $500. The next day Rabinowitz was back to defend Westminster against Silver\u2019s criminal complaint over the unfounded eviction. This time, he was more accommodating, perhaps because he realized a reporter was present. After conferring with Dutch Village\u2019s property manager, who was also in attendance, Rabinowitz agreed to let Silver have until the end of May to move out, rent-free, as long as she paid for April. Silver asked if she could have her hot water turned back on. He said he would look into it. But when I visited Silver two weeks later, the hot water was still off. The stove was covered with the pots she was using to boil water for bathing.On May 10 at the Highland Village complex, a woman was distributing the yellow \u201cfailure to pay rent\u201d notices filed with the District Court to tenants who were behind on their May rent. One went up on the door of a man who introduced himself to me as Tommy, a recently divorced house painter with two children, who was at that moment sitting in his pickup truck reading Psalm 91 to gird himself for a visit to traffic court. He said he didn\u2019t know why he kept being hit with late fees and court fees at Highland Village because he was up to date on the rent itself.Over at Carroll Park, Mike McHargue, the private investigator, had also received a yellow notice and was trying to find out when he needed to come up with money to avoid eviction. So was Chris Freimiller, the Rite Aid worker. He had missed a couple weeks of work with back pain related to a metal bar in his leg from an earlier car accident, and Westminster Management had moved quickly to file for eviction over $722.09 in missing rent, plus $66 in fees. When I arrived, Freimiller was sleeping on the couch after a night shift, and his wife, Jaclyn Meador, was trying to get an eviction date from the constable while their 11-year-old son, Ethan, looked on.One more yellow notice was affixed at the Highland Park home of Alishia Jamesson, the wedding-basket maker. Her fianc\u00e9 had left his job as a casino housekeeper to take a job handling Amazon packages near the airport, but his first check hadn\u2019t come through yet. Jamesson was working at Walmart again. The couple\u2019s car tags had expired, so both were enduring long public-transit commutes. No one had come from maintenance. There were still three holes in the wall.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Profits From Store-Branded Credit Cards Hide Depth of Retailers\u2019 Troubles", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byDepartment stores and big name retailers are increasingly making the hard sell to sign up customers for credit cards at the register. The store cards promise deep discounts on clothing, furniture and electronics, and are tough for shoppers to resist.For some retailers, those credit cards are not just a sales tool, but also an essential way to bolster their struggling businesses \u2014 a trend that has worrisome implications for the industry and its customers.Weak consumer spending, digital competition and changing shopping habits have already roiled retailers. In recent months, the industry has shed tens of thousands of workers, making it one of the job market\u2019s weakest links. Macy\u2019s reported a sharp drop in earnings on Thursday, sending its stock spiraling and dragging down the rest of the industry.But the businesses may be in worse shape than they appear, since store cards are a shaky foundation. If more consumers fall behind on their payments, the profits could dry up, intensifying retailers\u2019 troubles.At Macy\u2019s, the money from branded credit cards accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s total profit of $1.9 billion last year, up from 26 percent in 2013, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley. Bloomingdale\u2019s, which is owned by Macy\u2019s, has pushed to increase the number of credit card customers that workers are expected to sign up each month, according to the store workers\u2019 union.At Kohl\u2019s, the profit from plastic totaled 35 percent, up from 23 percent, over that same period. At Target, it made up 13 percent of total earnings, up from 11 percent in 2013.Amazon, by comparison, derives only about 3 percent of its total operating profit from its credit cards.The cracks are starting to show. As signs of customer distress rise, one major lender, Synchrony Financial, which handles the credit cards for stores like Sam\u2019s Club, Gap and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, is now setting aside more money for bad loans.\u201cInvestors may not appreciate the magnitude of the retailers\u2019 stress because of the store card income stream,\u201d said Kimberly Greenberger, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley.J. Crew offers card holders 15 percent off their first purchase, while Home Depot offers one year of \u201chassle-free\u201d returns for card holders. A Macy\u2019s card offers savings of up to $100 for a two-day shopping spree.At first the cards can seem appealing to customers with limited budgets, allowing them to finance purchases they might not otherwise be able to afford. But the retailers make much of their money on interest charges, so they are counting on many customers going into debt.\u201cThese stores are propping up their failing businesses on the backs of lower-middle-class people,\u201d said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in New York, whose clients often have rung up thousands of dollars in debt on retail cards.Lillian Esposito, of Queens, accumulated at least 10 different credit cards, including ones from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Walmart. The mother of two young boys, she used them to buy school supplies and Christmas gifts, taking advantage of store discounts on the cards.But any savings quickly evaporate when borrowers cannot pay off their bills right away.As Ms. Esposito watched her balances grow every month, she calculated paying $25 on interest for every $100 she spent. And she fell behind on some payments.She has since sworn off big retailers. \u201cNever again,\u201d said Ms. Esposito.Synchrony Financial, which issued some of Ms. Esposito\u2019s cards, declined to comment on her experience. But Samuel Wang, a spokesman for Synchrony, said the company underwrote \u201cin a way that takes into account a customer\u2019s ability to pay\u201d and encouraged customers in distress to contact the lender \u201cso we can help address their situation.\u201d Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said in a statement the terms of its cards were similar to others.In some cases, customers end up owing more in interest than the original bill. Many store cards carry rates around 30 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s like fool\u2019s gold,\u201d said Bryan Hall, who lives in the Bronx.Mr. Hall, 48, charged thousands of dollars on cards from P. C. Richard, Best Buy and Kay Jewelers, for an iPad, a 46-inch television and a ring for a friend who was getting married. He then sold off items he bought to pay his rent and keep his car on the road. He stopped making payments on several cards.Kay Jewelers and Best Buy declined to comment on Mr. Hall. P. C. Richard did not respond to requests for comment.The payoff for employees is low. Workers at some stores earn as little as $1 for each new account they open, and the discounts that their customers get for signing up for a card also cut into the employees\u2019 sales commissions.A company spokeswoman, Cheryl Heinonen, said credit card enrollments are only one aspect of how employees are evaluated, but declined to discuss the confidential negotiations.Ms. Heinonen added that the company was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with its store cards, noting that card holders were among Macy\u2019s \u201cmost loyal and happiest customers.\u201d Citigroup, which issues the Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s cards, declined to comment.Credit card profits could prove a fleeting lifeline for retailers. When customers fall behind or default, the banks are likely to clamp down on extending new cards, meaning that source of income for retailers can quickly evaporate.Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse, said credit card profits were a \u201ctemporary subsidy\u201d that the industry could not count on over the long term.The problems are already starting to appear.Among the company\u2019s struggling borrowers was Jose Luis Garcia, a 75-year-old whose only income is from Social Security.Last August, Mr. Garcia went into a furniture dealer on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn planning to buy a box spring for $100 in cash. But after the aggressive sales pitch, he came out with a full bed set, totaling $2,041, including delivery. The purchase was charged to a Synchrony card, which he says he never wanted.Unable to keep up with interest payments of 29.99 percent, Mr. Garcia sought legal assistance from New Economy Project, a nonprofit group that helps low-income New Yorkers. After an inquiry from The New York Times, Synchrony said it looked into the matter and forgave his debt.\u201cThey took me for an idiot,\u201d Mr. Garcia said.Advertisement"}

Ms. Kraus, a writer, has lived in Los Angeles since 1995, but the first chapter of her life was set in the Bronx, and her last apartment in New York was a short subway ride from the garden. Its flora and fauna were familiar friends.\u201cThis is a classic,\u201d she said, looking up at a just-bloomed cherry blossom tree. \u201cThis is my Facebook cover photo.\u201dMs. Gevinson, the editor and actress, has been a fan of Ms. Kraus\u2019s since 2013, when she was 17 years old and working on the second Rookie Yearbook. \u201cI have two journals where the spines say something like \u2018Mostly \u201cI Love Dick\u201d Quotes: Part 1\u2019 and \u2018Mostly \u201cI Love Dick\u201d Quotes: Part 2,\u2019\u201d she said in a phone interview.\u201cOn a certain level, your first reaction is to cringe,\u201d Ms. Kraus said of the increased exposure, \u201cespecially because the character names in the book are not changed.\u201dIn real life, Mr. Lotringer was the founder of Semiotext(e), and he is still an editor at the press, along with the writer Hedi El Kholti and Ms. Kraus.

They lived in the Bronx until 1960, and then Milford, Conn.When Ms. Kraus was 13, the family moved to New Zealand on the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme, and after a whirl through high school, she enrolled at the Victoria University of Wellington when she was 16. \u201cMaturity is being increasingly delayed and deferred these days,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, you\u2019re on your parents\u2019 health insurance until you\u2019re 26. But in New Zealand, at 16, you\u2019re pretty much an adult.\u201dAfter graduation, Ms. Kraus became a journalist but was ambivalent about how she had to \u201cbond with people and then betray them by writing about them.\u201dAt 21, she moved to the East Village in New York and studied acting. \u201cI wrote a lot for a feminist newspaper called Majority Report, where they paid you in restaurant vouchers and subway slugs,\u201d she said. To pay her rent, she took up odd jobs and artist assistantships, including one with Louise Bourgeois.It was a \u201cmoment where all of these brilliant people who hadn\u2019t published books yet were keeping blogs,\u201d Ms. Kraus said.\u201cBut that\u2019s a long time ago, and that certainly isn\u2019t why I chose to write about her,\u201d Ms. Kraus said. \u201cIn fact, that\u2019s why it took so long to write about her.\u201dWatching a white-dress-and-veil wedding amid an Earth Day parade in the garden, Ms. Kraus described her comparatively modest wedding to Philip Valdez, a psychologist, a little over two years ago. The ceremony took place in front of a dozen or so friends, on the patio of their home in Los Angeles, with decorations from a 99-cent store, a homemade cake and an officiant they found online.\u201cWe staged this thing at Cal Arts where I was going be giving a lecture as part of their series to the art students, about the American artist Amboy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all showed up for it, and they didn\u2019t know it was fake.\u201d In fact, they pretended they had heard of him.The neighborhood where she and Mr. Valdez live, near MacArthur Park, is \u201cas close as you can come\u201d to New York in California, Ms. Kraus said with a touch of wistfulness. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the same.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chanel\u2019s Boomerang Comes Back to Hit It", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayRather, the French brand is being accused of cultural appropriation, exploitation of the underprivileged and ignorance.And a lot more like that.Chastened, Chanel has issued a quasi-apologetic statement through a spokeswoman that reads in part: \u201cChanel is extremely committed to respecting all cultures and deeply regrets that some may have felt offended. The inspiration was taken from leisure activities from other parts of the world, and it was not our intention to disrespect the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and the significance of the boomerang as a cultural object.\u201dHowever, that being said, the boomerang is still for sale.As it turns out, Chanel has been selling boomerangs sporadically since 2005, as part of its line of sporting accessories, which has also included boxing gloves, skis, bicycles, tennis balls, tennis rackets, surfboards \u2026 you get the idea. All branded, and all very expensive.Eyes have been rolling pretty much since it started \u2014 after all, no self-respecting athlete in any sport would play with Chanel-branded equipment; it\u2019s practically a badge of a lack of seriousness \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t stopped the brand from selling the items, so something must have been working. Apparently it is not working any more.So what changed? The issue seems to be a combination of heightened cultural sensitivity broadly speaking and newly empowered digital activists.By contrast, the Chanel boomerang has no story, and no deeper meaning.And whereas once borrowing inspiration (a synonym for cultural appropriation) might have been seen as an acknowledgment of the value of that creation, now it is viewed as stealing.This is especially true when it comes to offerings like the Chanel boomerang, where there doesn\u2019t seem to be any particular added value to the item \u2014 it\u2019s not as if Chanel took the object and \u201cChanel-ified\u201d it in any apparent way, other than to plunk their logo in the middle. The average weekend boomerang, for example, is sold on Amazon for about $14.95.So what\u2019s a brand to do? Never look to another culture for ideas? Hide in its little box until President Trump tweets and the digisphere is distracted by another issue?Perhaps the answer is simply to broaden the tent. Imagine, for example, if Chanel has enlisted actual Aboriginal artisans in the making of their product; if they had earmarked some percentage of sales for Aboriginal causes, and spent time with them. If instead of simply seeming to profit from other people\u2019s history and symbolism, they enabled it? Would the reaction have been so furious?Maybe. But at the very least, Chanel would probably have had some on-the-ground defenders.There have been enough of these sorts of minifurors lately that you would think brands would learn from them instead of repeating them. Perhaps it\u2019s time to begin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With New Echo Speakers, Amazon Lets You Ask Alexa to Phone Mom", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byNow Amazon wants you to do more than talk to Alexa. It also wants you to call friends and family through Echo speakers \u2014 and it is even putting a screen on one of the devices so you can see them while talking to them.On Tuesday, Amazon introduced the latest model in its expanding family of Echo products, the Echo Show, which has a seven-inch touch screen and a video camera that let people place video or voice calls to each other over a Wi-Fi connection. In a move that could have broader impact, Amazon also said it would release a free software update this week that brings voice-calling features to existing Echo devices.The changes, which thrust Amazon into the crowded landscape of internet communications tools like Microsoft\u2019s Skype, Apple\u2019s FaceTime and Google\u2019s Hangouts, underline the company\u2019s ambitions for the Echo. In a way, the new communications functions turn the speaker into something like a traditional landline telephone, which many people have given up in favor of smartphones. Rather than pulling a phone out of their pockets, people will be able to simply command their Echoes to call someone.The goal is to make the Echo, and Alexa, even more of a fixture inside people\u2019s homes \u2014 a system that can help you shop online, control your home\u2019s temperature and, now, converse. And it allows Amazon to once again chart a path ahead of others with how it is using the speaker.\u201cAmazon now has a huge first-mover advantage,\u201d said Werner Goertz, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm.Amazon said it planned to release the Echo Show in late June, with a starting price of about $230 for a single device, or two for $360.According to eMarketer, more than 35 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month this year, more than double the number from last year.Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said its Echo products were part of a category of \u201cambient computing\u201d \u2014 devices that can be controlled in a communal setting, like inside a home or a car, primarily with voice.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be compelled to go and interact with the screen \u2014 you should be able to do it with your voice,\u201d Mr. Limp said in a product briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from traditional computing as we\u2019ve known it for the last three decades.\u201dYet there are obvious limitations to devices that rely entirely on voice interfaces, which the Echo Show is intended to address.The screen on the device adds the ability to stream videos, show lyrics while playing music, and display calendar events and voice-dictated text messages to other Echo users. Displaying movie showtimes and other lists on a screen, as the Echo Show can, is more convenient for users than Alexa reading them.\u201cI think Echo Show fits very well in the kitchen,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies.The catch is that for now, the only people an Echo user can call are other Echo owners, or anyone with an Alexa app on an iPhone or Android device. Mr. Limp said there was no technical limitation that would prevent Amazon from connecting a phone number to an Echo device that would allow them to be reached by people with telephones. But he declined to say whether Amazon intended to offer that capability.Because the Echo can be used only as a speakerphone, it also is not likely to be used for private calls when others are present in a room. Ms. Milanesi said she was skeptical about whether Echo could supplant smartphones for voice calling.\u201cWe\u2019re so used to using our phones,\u201d she said. \u201cFinding a reason to use Alexa for that is harder. They need to give you something more specific and interesting and different than other platforms we\u2019re engaged with.\u201dBrian X.

{"Headline": "The Little Red Book for Children", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byRed CenturyThere\u2019s only one small problem: None of it is true.To do so, Ms. Adamczak tells a tale of peasants surviving the transition from feudalism to capitalism, a story about workers adapting to the market demands of capitalist productivity and a parable about different, failed attempts by proletarians and unemployed people to improve their social and economic conditions through collective organizing. Scary stuff, I know. Although the narrative is full of suffering, defeat and failure, the real scandal of the book lies in its optimism, its hope that another world is still possible in the womb of the old. More outrageous, such hope cannot be decreed from above by politicians, leaders or businesspeople, but only created from below by people struggling together for a fair, dignified and free way of life.Long before the Soviet Union crushed all political tendencies that favored a more libertarian form of socialism, the name for that way of life free from the misery of wage labor was called communism. In the philosophical epilogue to her book, Ms. Adamczak explicitly confronts the problem of how to speak about communism after a century of disasters committed in its name. As she makes abundantly clear, it\u2019s not easy.And yet, that doesn\u2019t let us off the hook. The only way to truly understand the failures of communism is to take seriously the motivations, desires and ideals of those who advocated it. But to do that, one must first understand capitalism.Alas, the history of communism is littered with failed attempts by communists to be better at capitalism than the capitalists themselves. As Ms. Adamczak argues, this is because most communist criticisms of capitalism take one idealized aspect of capitalist society and pit it against the others, unwittingly perpetuating the framework communism sets out to abolish. This recipe for disaster recurs throughout history, and the only way to stop it is for everyone to learn about the unsuccessful attempts at revolution, so as not to repeat those mistakes in their current struggles. Hence, \u201cCommunism for Kids.\u201dNaming the problem may be the first step toward curing the illness, but it doesn\u2019t yet tell us how to proceed. For that, we need ideas, experiments and dreams. Is it wise to dream about utopia while living in the dystopia of the present?There\u2019s another reading of Adorno\u2019s remark. We may not be able to live a wrong life rightly, but we can stop living wrongly altogether. To do that requires a depth of social imagination, the courage of collective struggle and a wellspring of political desire that seems all but evaporated in the present moment. \u201cCommunism for Kids\u201d is not a message in a bottle to some imagined future audience; it is rather a collection of broken shards from lost futures still jammed in the present. It is a cry from behind the curtain of history to rectify the injustices of the past by attending to the suffering of the present. I suggest we pay attention.Jacob Blumenfeld, a writer and translator, is a researcher in philosophy at the New School for Social Research.This is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018I Love Dick\u2019 Sketches an Artistic Love Triangle", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byWatching \u201cI Love Dick\u201d is like attending an exhibition for which the artist has supplied her own curator\u2019s notes. It\u2019s an experience as much as a story: arresting, disorienting and provocative. It\u2019s also very conscious of explaining to you how and why it arrests, disorients and provokes.The first corner of that triangle is Dick Jarrett (Kevin Bacon), a famous abstract sculptor and rancher in Marfa, Tex. (The novel\u2019s Dick was based on the media theory scholar Dick Hebdige; this one is inspired by the Marfa artist Donald Judd.)As a sideline, Dick runs a residency fellowship program, where he collects artists and intellectuals like prickly cactuses. One makes video game art; another studies the aesthetics of pornography. Enter Sylv\u00e8re (Griffin Dunne), Dick\u2019s newest fellow and a Holocaust scholar, who arrives from Brooklyn with his wife, Chris (Kathryn Hahn), an experimental director whose latest work has just been dropped from the Venice Film Festival.Over dinner with Chris and Sylv\u00e8re, Dick condescendingly suggests that she failed because women are lousy filmmakers. \u201cThey have to work from behind their oppression,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich makes for some bummer movies.\u201dChris plans to keep the letters to herself, but reads one to Sylv\u00e8re. It has an aphrodisiac effect. Dick becomes an invisible third player in their marriage and a source of creative arousal \u2014 until the letters become public, and the season spins into drama and farce.A theme here \u2014 and in case you miss it, the characters explain it explicitly \u2014 is the experience of women in an art world that has historically seen them as nudes to be painted, forms to inspire. Chris flips this by making the great-man artist into her muse. (\u201cIt\u2019s humiliating,\u201d he admits.)Ms. Hahn, a frequent comedy actress whose dramatic talent Ms. Soloway showcased in \u201cTransparent\u201d and the movie \u201cAfternoon Delight,\u201d shows fantastic range as Chris: raw-nerved, hyperverbal and caught up in her own head.Dick, whom Mr. Bacon plays as dry as jerky, is her opposite: coolly dismissive and laconic. His work is rugged and phallic, austere and withholding. One of his signature pieces is a brick on a table. He refuses to title his sculptures and says he hasn\u2019t read a book in 10 years because he\u2019s \u201cpost-idea.\u201dMore accurately, he\u2019s all idea, a beefcake avatar of linear thinking and pretension. (In a hilarious art-porn fantasy sequence, Chris imagines him shirtless, shearing a lamb in the middle of the road.)\u201cI Love Dick,\u201d like \u201cTransparent,\u201d owns its seriousness and its characters, but it has a sense of humor about it. Early on, Sylv\u00e8re is introduced to the president of the fellowship\u2019s board, who, he\u2019s told, is \u201ca big fan of the Holocaust.\u201dBut the series is best when it does what art does: to express what can\u2019t be said literally, to be the painting \u2014 or the brick \u2014 and not the plaque next to it.Ms. Soloway directs the fifth and best episode, a transfixingly visualized 20-minute collection of monologues by women in the Marfa community about art and their sexual awakenings. Roberta Colindrez is luminous and intense as Devon, a lesbian playwright and working-class Marfa native. If the series has future seasons, it has a strong ensemble to build on.If the first season doesn\u2019t entirely hang together, it\u2019s bracingly risk-taking. At its best, it captures the artistic process in a way that TV rarely does, and it works as a kind of video art itself. But as with some other recent experimental series \u2014 \u201cThe Young Pope,\u201d for instance \u2014 it\u2019s best to realize that going in.Toward the end of the season, Chris mentions to Dick that she\u2019s seen a new work of his \u2014 a line of boulders outdoors, snaking toward the horizon. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d he asks.She hedges: \u201cI just need a little bit of time to, you know, just process it.\u201d\u201cI Love Dick,\u201d too, feels as if it might work better in memory than in the moment \u2014 once you\u2019ve had some time to sit with it for a while, and tune out the noise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Take a Load Off. The Robots That Fold Laundry Are Coming.", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipCars can now drive themselves. Cellphones talk to us. How long will it be until the dreams of every college student and overworked parent come true \u2014 and laundry can fold itself?At least two companies are promising to bring laundry-folding robots for the home to market by the end of 2017. Known as Laundroid and FoldiMate, both machines work by analyzing each garment they take in, figuring out its ideal folding shape and delivering a drawer-ready stack of smoothly folded clothes.Laundroid is slightly smaller than a typical refrigerator and looks like the monolith from \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d except with drawers. The robot arms are inside.The FoldiMate, more compact, has large clips dangling outside, making it look like a mash-up of a clothesline and a plastic oven.A working prototype of Laundroid \u2014 backed by about $90 million in investment capital, including funds from George Roberts and Henry Kravis of the buyout firm KKR \u2014 is set to be publicly demonstrated at the end of this month in Tokyo. It will retail \u2014 only in Japan, at first \u2014 for about $16,000. Seven Dreamers, the company introducing Laundroid, aims to bring the cost down to $2,000 a unit and begin international sales by next year.The Whirlpool Corporation, owner of the Maytag brand, is also aggressively tinkering. The company plans to introduce in January an all-in-one $1,700 washer/dryer hybrid featuring a detergent reservoir that decides on the proper portion per load, squirts it into the basin unassisted and wirelessly reorders from Amazon when empty.\u201cThere is a high level of excitement around innovating in laundry,\u201d said Danielle Whah, Whirlpool\u2019s North America product director for laundry.\u201cThe robot arm picks up the clothes one by one and then artificial intelligence recognizes if this is a T-shirt or pants or pajamas,\u201d Shin Sakane, Laundroid\u2019s inventor, said in a Skype interview from Japan.The biggest technical challenge for both Laundroid and FoldiMate is for the machine to know what it is holding. Because clothes are shapeless in a pile, and the robot arm will grab each item sometimes by the edge, sometimes by a midpoint, \u201cthere will be no times that a garment will be picked up in the same shape,\u201d Guy Hayazaki, a Laundroid spokesman, said.The Laundroids will work as a team. The concept is that, using a Wi-Fi connection, the networked robot brain will connect to a server that is constantly learning best folding methods for each type of clothing by downloading data from all the other Laundroids. This hive mind promises to be able to differentiate between T-shirts, overalls and rompers, fold each according to its needs and sort them into separate piles for members of the household.Slowly. In the first-generation Laundroid, image analysis of each garment takes up to 10 minutes; folding only a minute or two. But that adds up to nearly a full workday for a full load.Gal Rozov, an inventor of FoldiMate, said his machine was faster.

Mr. Sakane wanted to work on fully realized consumer products, along the lines of his business heroes: Steve Jobs of Apple and Konosuke Matsushita, a founder of Panasonic.He formed his own company, Seven Dreamers, which already has two inventions on the market: One, called Nastent, is a tube that slides up the nose to stop snoring (not yet for sale in the United States); the other is a carbon-fiber golf shaft that is meant to decrease drag.Mr. Kravis and Mr. Roberts of KKR are fans of the shaft, leading to their interest in Laundroid. A spokeswoman for KKR said they had invested their own money, not the company\u2019s. Other investors include Panasonic and the Japanese homebuilder Daiwa.Mr. Sakane said he was casting about for a business idea more than a decade ago when he asked his wife, \u201cIs there anything in your mind which is not available anywhere in the world, something to use at home and something that you really, really want to have?\u201cAnd she said, \u2018Of course! It\u2019s a laundry-folding robot!\u2019 And then I thought \u2018Yes, this is it!\u2019\u201dSo, has Mr. Sakane brought a Laundroid into his own home yet?\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife keeps asking me when.\u201dWhile the modern laundry room is generally built to contain a separate washer and dryer, Whirlpool\u2019s market research has found that many consumers will be interested in buying two washer/dryer hybrids and standing them side by side to increase capacity and to reduce time spent on the chore, Ms. Whah said.Last year, about 17 million washers and dryers were sold in the United States, according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. Mr. Sakane projected that Laundroid sales could reach 20 million units a year worldwide.Perhaps. But as Ms. Whah noted, consumers still consider the core benefit of laundry to be \u201cgetting your clothes clean in the washer and dry in the dryer.\u201dAnnalee Newitz, a technology writer, wondered in a phone interview if Laundroid would eventually become like a bread machine: an oft-gifted, rarely used appliance.Hugh Howey, the science fiction writer, said in an email: \u201cWhat I hope to see is a future where all our hours are filled not with mandatory drudgery needed to sustain our finances, but freely chosen tasks which sustain our souls.\u201dIt\u2019s an attractive future. With that in mind, I\u2019d add something to the already long product name for one of these new laundry devices: Whirlpool Smart All-in-One Washer and Dryer Combo \u2026 and Massage Chair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Price Amazon Is Content to Keep High: $1,000 a Share", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 On Monday, Amazon.com\u2019s share price briefly crossed the $1,000 mark for the first time in its 20-year history as a publicly traded company.Cracking the arbitrary threshold of a four-digit stock price is a reminder of just how heavy Amazon has become.It is now the fourth most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The top five, Apple, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, have emerged as the dominant forces in technology. Amazon\u2019s shares are up almost 33 percent for the year and up 368 percent over five years.Crossing the $1,000 mark, said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify ETFs, which includes a fund that holds Amazon shares, \u201cspeaks to the triumph of e-commerce and the vision of Jeff Bezos.\u201dThe investor optimism about Amazon is, in many respects, unchanged from when it went public in 1997.Amazon remains a long-term play based on a wager that online shopping will replace a healthy chunk of traditional retail over time. Even with all of Amazon\u2019s staggering growth \u2014 $136 billion in revenue last year, compared with $148 million in 1997 \u2014 e-commerce still represents only around 10 percent of total retail spending in the United States, the company\u2019s most mature market.That leaves Amazon \u2014 which accounted for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the United States last year, according to Slice Intelligence \u2014 with a lot of room to grow. Some analysts say its gains could be especially large in the coming years as more physical retailers close stores and file for bankruptcy.\u201cFor any stock analyst trying to find growth and return on investment in the retail sector today, they\u2019re clearly putting money into Amazon because that\u2019s where they anticipate the growth coming from,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2, a retail research firm.Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. The stock closed at $996.70 on Tuesday, up 0.09 percent.Amazon has also given investors reason to believe it is not content to remain simply an e-commerce giant. Through its Amazon Web Services business, it is now the largest provider of cloud computing services in the world. It stands to benefit for many years as hundreds of billions of dollars in information technology spending shifts from traditional purchases of hardware and software to effectively renting them in the data centers.Because profit margins in cloud computing are wider than those in the retail business, Amazon, which had only a passing familiarity with profits over most of its life, is now consistently in the black.After an embarrassing smartphone venture, Amazon demonstrated that it, too, could stay ahead of important changes in consumer technology with the invention of Echo, a voice-activated speaker powered by an artificially intelligent assistant called Alexa. Although the company says little about sales of the devices, other than that tens of millions have been sold, Alexa appears to be emerging as a significant new technology platform, and Amazon\u2019s strategy is being widely imitated by rivals.One of those rivals, Alphabet, is not too far behind Amazon in chasing the $1,000 a share milestone (the market capitalization of Alphabet, which is far more profitable than Amazon, is still about $200 billion higher than that of the internet retailer).The most powerful technology companies are becoming even more powerful. Of course, that is no guarantee of staying power. Apple and Microsoft, much older than Amazon, each lost its way for a time. And tech pioneers like Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies two years ago, and IBM have struggled to adapt to technology changes.Amazon is known for being ruthlessly competitive on prices for products it sells on its website, but that does not extend to its share price. Last week at the company\u2019s annual investor meeting in Seattle, a woman who said she was a longtime Amazon shareholder beseeched Mr. Bezos to split the company\u2019s stock to help make it more accessible to less wealthy investors.Mr. Bezos said Amazon considered such possibilities from time to time but had no plans for a split.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Superfood Gold Rush", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byThe Money IssueOn an April Monday in Sherman Oaks, Calif., the Harvest Bar was packed with adults in athleisure, eating pur\u00e9ed a\u00e7a\u00ed from bowls the size of flowerpots. The restaurant is a fast-casual \u201csuperfood cafe,\u201d one in a growing class of health-food restaurants doing brisk trade in the a\u00e7a\u00ed-bowl business, selling heaps of the pur\u00e9ed berries topped with diced fruit and other sweets. \u201cThe blend is like an ice cream,\u201d the owner, Aric Haut, explained. \u201cBut healthy.\u201d More than 5,000 miles to the south, harvesters in the Amazon basin of Brazil climb palm trees to pick the wild-growing fruit. What lies between these two distant parties is the latest unspooling of the food-fad plot \u2014 a supply chain driven by remarkable health claims, with money exchanged at every step along the way.If the superfood plot were a bit more predetermined, you might expect a\u00e7a\u00ed to go the way of quinoa. When the protein-rich grain spread to supermarket aisles and started to appear in fast-casual restaurants, it moved out of reach for the Bolivian farmers whose dependence on the grain made it famous in the first place. The story with a\u00e7a\u00ed is not so simple. Here, surprising parties become heroes and scoundrels as the coveted berry changes hands in different ways.Global consumption has further increased demand, but because of the high value of good vibes, some superfood exporters have an incentive to hew to best practices. Sambazon, the leading exporter of the berry, has emerged as an unlikely steward of the crop. The company\u2019s chairman, Ryan Black, first tasted the fruit in the late \u201990s, back when it was mostly unknown in America. Black, a jock with a stoner\u2019s lilt, was a former football captain at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has since cornered the a\u00e7a\u00ed export market, in part by paying a guaranteed minimum price to harvesters, protecting wages from dipping too low. According to a sustainability study, workers along Sambazon\u2019s vertical supply chain can earn up to three times what the average Brazilian takes home. Beyond taking pains to demonstrate that its harvest is sustainable, the company has begun funding local schools for agro-forestry education and even devoting some of its fair-trade funds to health and child-care services in the region.The domestic Brazilian a\u00e7a\u00ed market, by contrast, is structured as a game of pass the baton. The berry\u2019s rise to fame in tandem with internal migration yielded a fluid and decentralized network: The guy who picks the fruit sells to the guy with the boat, who sells to the guy with the bigger boat, who sells to the guy with a stall in the market, who sells to the guy with the processing shop, who turns the fruit into frozen pur\u00e9e and ships it to distributors in Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo. According to studies of the a\u00e7a\u00ed economy, these stages of the chain are often disconnected, their workers unaware and uninvested in the steps that come before. This poses a risk to long-term sustainability. Should some ambitious operator upstream decide it\u2019s easier and cheaper to simply cut a\u00e7a\u00ed trees down, the ecosystem could collapse. But for now, this nascent economy offers low barriers to entry in a region much in need of opportunity.As a\u00e7a\u00ed mania has progressed, even multinationals have latched on to the trend, with both Coca-Cola and Pepsi now peddling a\u00e7a\u00ed-tinged drinks. The berry, for now, remains harvested in the wild, but some who study sustainability in the region worry that increased demand for the crop might ultimately strain wild harvesting operations and result in large-scale a\u00e7a\u00ed plantations. The same vibes that drive growth in the region might also destroy the same wholesome ethic that made a\u00e7a\u00ed appealing to Americans in the first place. For us, it might not matter; we\u2019ll probably have found a new superfood by then.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tales of \u2018Flippers\u2019 Led to a Housing Bubble", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThere is still no consensus on why the last housing boom and bust happened. That is troubling, because that violent housing cycle helped to produce the Great Recession and financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. We need to understand it all if we are going to be able to avoid ordeals like that in the future.But the explanations for what happened in housing are not, I think, to be found in the conventional data favored by economists but rather in sociologically important narratives \u2014 like tales of getting rich through \u201cflipping\u201d houses and shares of initial public offerings \u2014 that constitute the shifting mentality of the era.Consider the data for a moment. It shows us that extreme changes took place but doesn\u2019t tell us why.Instead, during the 1997 to 2005 boom there were multitudes of narratives about smart investors who were bold enough to take a position in the market. To single out one strand, recall the stories of flippers who would buy a house, fix it up, and resell it within months at a huge profit. These stories appear to have been broadly exciting to people who didn\u2019t flip houses themselves but who appear to have begun to think that stretching a little and buying a house with a large mortgage would make them wise investors.It can take a long time for narratives like this to grip the popular imagination. Flipping was \u201ca thing\u201d in the condominium conversion boom of the 1970s and \u201980s. The idea then was this: Big-time converters with deep pockets would buy apartment buildings and convert the rental apartments to owner-occupied condos, selling units to diverse individuals, some of them flippers. For public relations purposes, converters would offer to sell at reduced prices to renters already living in a building, and typically to some outsiders, too.This generated buzz. When renters and speculators flipped their purchase contracts at a big profit, sometimes using borrowed money for down payments to flip multiple units without actually even closing on the condos, it was thrilling. It seemed that anyone with energy and initiative could get rich doing this.Some people eager to make quick profits bought Donald J. Trump\u2019s well-timed 2004 book, \u201cTrump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life,\u201d written with Meredith McIver. Some enrolled in the less well-timed Trump University, which emphasized real estate investment in 2005, at the very end of the housing boom; it shut down, amid lawsuits and recrimination, in 2010.The promoters of condo conversions and I.P.O.s were onto something. By giving discounts to buyers who would make a high return, they captivated the nation with tales of people who had no advanced degrees or hefty r\u00e9sum\u00e9s but made fortunes anyway.The public fascination with speculating in housing has been held in check by regulators empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, but that restraint is tenuous with the election as president of a real estate promoter intent on reducing regulators\u2019 power. These narratives are still potent and could easily spur further spirals in the housing market.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coal Country\u2019s Power Plants Are Turning Away From Coal", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byCoal is on the defensive in the nation\u2019s power industry. Even in coal country.The pressure to shift more of the country\u2019s electric supply to renewable sources is not just a rallying cry for environmentalists. Some of the power industry\u2019s biggest customers, like General Motors and Microsoft, have made a commitment to clean energy. And to help them meet it \u2014 and keep them from taking their business elsewhere \u2014 utilities are changing their ways.West Virginia, where coal is king, is no exception.Appalachian Power, the leading utility there, is quickly shifting toward natural gas and renewable sources like wind and solar, even as President Trump calls for a coal renaissance. Appalachian Power still burns plenty of coal, but in recent years it has closed three coal-fired plants and converted two others to gas, reducing its dependence on coal to 61 percent last year, down from 74 percent in 2012.Chris Beam, the company\u2019s president, made the industry\u2019s shifting dynamics clear in an encounter with Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, at his inaugural ball in January.\u201c\u2018Look, I\u2019d like to see you guys build another coal plant,\u2019\u201d he recalled the governor saying. \u201cAnd our answer was: We\u2019re not going to build another coal plant.\u201d (The governor confirmed the account, but added in an email, \u201cI\u2019ll continue to encourage power companies to burn more coal to put our miners back to work.\u201d)It\u2019s the same story in Virginia, where Dominion, a leading utility based in Richmond \u2014 near where commercial coal mining got its start \u2014 designed a special rate to make it easier for Amazon Web Services and similar customers to buy renewable energy.In Kentucky, a chance meeting between a state regulator and a Facebook employee ultimately led the Public Service Commission to advise utilities that they could offer customers renewable energy packages, part of an effort to attract new business and hold on to automakers like G.M. and Toyota.And in Wyoming, the nation\u2019s leading coal producer by far, Black Hills Energy worked with Microsoft to create a complex arrangement for the technology giant to get enough wind energy to fulfill current and future needs at Microsoft\u2019s data center in Cheyenne.\u201cI\u2019ve not spoken to a single utility that\u2019s truly holding on to a future of more coal,\u201d said Brian Janous, who directs energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to attract, as in the Appalachian case, new customers, and those customers aren\u2019t attracted by coal.\u201dAlmost half of the Fortune 500 companies have adopted at least one climate or clean-energy goal, with 23 of them pledging eventually to run their businesses on 100 percent renewable energy, including Walmart, Bank of America and Google, according to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund and other environmentally minded organizations and investors.Though corporations are buying renewable energy across the country, energy executives and analysts say it is notable that the trend is taking hold in states where coal production is part of the economic heart and soul.Coal executives say that they are watching the impact of the renewable-power demands on the coal industry, but that it is a matter of rising unease.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about it,\u201d said Harry Childress, president of the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance. \u201cWe see the pressure from these companies is pushing power producers more away from coal, which is a cheaper power.\u201dFive years ago, corporate renewable-energy partnerships with utilities were barely a blip on the electric industry radar. But they are rapidly increasing, according to a recent report by the World Resources Institute, which has helped to promote them.Last year, utilities made deals with corporate customers through rate arrangements known as green tariffs for 220 megawatts of power, enough to run about 40,000 average American homes. Thus far this year, there have been 360 megawatts worth of agreements, with an additional 465 megawatts under negotiation.\u201cThis is what these corporations want and, for the electric companies, they have to figure out how to do it,\u201d said Lisa Wood, executive director of the Institute for Electric Innovation at the Edison Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the utility industry. \u201cThis is a tremendous driver. These are very, very large customers.\u201dOne reason for the rapid acceleration is that utilities and regulators \u2014 often with technical assistance from environmental groups \u2014 are learning how to devise rates and transaction structures to accommodate the energy purchases.Appalachian Power\u2019s switch from coal was in part pushed as a result of a summit meeting that its parent company, American Electric Power, held at its headquarters last fall with corporate giants including Walmart, Facebook, Hilton, Procter & Gamble and Marathon Petroleum.Those companies stressed that if they were going to expand their businesses in A.E.P. regions, they would need access to low-carbon energy. American Electric Power organized a second meeting in Washington in May that included Amazon, Caesars Entertainment, DuPont, Marriott International and Starbucks.With the goal of attracting big business to coal country, Mr. Beam is now in the market to buy, lease or build a fleet of wind and solar power farms across West Virginia and Virginia. The goal is to increase Appalachian Power\u2019s renewable-energy fleet to 34 percent of its power capacity by 2031 from 17 percent today.An announcement for a new wind farm in southern West Virginia is expected within weeks, as discussions with big companies \u2014 which American Electric Power executives refused to identify \u2014 continue.\u201cSpecific customers are looking specifically for renewables and to what degree you are moving toward a new clean energy economy,\u201d said Nicholas K. Akins, A.E.P.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cShareholders are more interested in sustainability going forward and improvements from a climate change perspective and carbon emissions perspective.\u201dMr. Akins said American Electric Power, which serves over five million customers in 11 states, intended to respond to the demands of customers whatever policies were dictated in Washington. He added, \u201cWe are trying to make our company long-term sustainable regardless of administration.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So how best to keep them charged? Nick Guy, senior staff writer for The Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s site that evaluates products, plugged the devices into chargers and came up with some answers.When I type \u201cwall charger\u201d in Amazon, I get 32,819 results. Help me sort it out.I lug my charger around. Could I carry it in my pocket? Would it weigh down a purse or bag?The PowerPort 4 would fit in a bag, but it might be just a hair big for a pocket. We like iClever\u2019s Dual USB Travel Wall Charger as a more portable option. It has only two ports, but it\u2019s about an inch and a half square by just over an inch thick, so it\u2019s pretty compact.I recently read that public charging stations can be dangerous to use because they could suck down data. Is that a concern?And you get the added bonus of charging multiple devices at once without being that person at the airport hogging all the outlets.I like that. What car chargers do you recommend?Our pick is Anker\u2019s PowerDrive 2, which has two high-speed 2.4-amp ports, and is only $10. There are actually a fair number of good chargers around that price, but we like Anker\u2019s because of the company\u2019s 18-month warranty and the little status light that lets you know when it is plugged all the way in.You guys like a lot of Anker products. What about Amazon Basics or Monoprice?Anker has really been knocking it out of the park for the past few years with powerful, well-designed stuff that\u2019s really affordable.Amazon Basics and Monoprice both tend to have good, inexpensive products as well, but when it comes to cables they are often, if not always, white-label products that the seller simply slaps its name on. We used to recommend Monoprice cables, but the models would change too frequently; you might order a cable one day and see a different design in the store the next.You even have a recommendation for the cord that connects your charger to a device?Yes! Again, we pick Anker here. Its PowerLine Lightning and Micro USB cables are strong, inexpensive, come in a number of lengths and colors and, once again, there\u2019s that warranty.Anyone who has ever had a busted cable will appreciate being able to get it swapped out without hassle.I\u2019ve seen plenty of that, and plenty of people who just let the exposed cabling show through. The strain relief \u2014 the part where the cable itself meets the plug end \u2014 on these cables is stronger than most. Anker says it can withstand up to 5,000 bends.How do you test the chargers?Thankfully all the testing has been straightforward. Plug it in and it charges at full speed or, rarely, it doesn\u2019t. No sparks or smoke. Of course we take considerations such as port positions and overall design into account, too. A charger doesn\u2019t need to be a design piece, but why settle for an ugly one?What\u2019s the strangest one you\u2019ve seen?There are a few clever car chargers that have charging units on the end of a long cable, so they can reach to the back seat and keep your passengers charged. I don\u2019t have kids, but I imagine that could be superuseful for when they\u2019re watching videos and playing games.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Czeslaw Milosz Still Matters", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 2011, on the centenary of the birth of the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz and seven years after his death, a conference about his life and work took place in Sejny, a small town on the Polish-Lithuanian border. Because I had just written his biography, I was invited to discuss \u201cNative Realm,\u201d an autobiographical work, written over half a century before.The book relates his own life experiences, yet at the same time stands as a biography of an intellectual from the eastern \u2014 or, as we Poles prefer to put it to differentiate ourselves from Russia, the central \u2014 part of the continent. In that book and elsewhere, Milosz wrote powerfully about totalitarianism, anti-Semitism and nationalism, the topics that occupied European intellectuals for much of the 20th century.I declared to the audience that in my view many of the author\u2019s political diagnoses were outdated. After all, I thought, most of my students view themselves primarily as citizens of Europe, as countless young people do throughout the European Union. They speak foreign languages, travel and work abroad to get a feel for the world, and generally do not feel under threat. The issues that outraged Milosz were things of the past.It turns out, however, I was deeply mistaken.Someone once said that in his life Milosz had encountered every kind of hell the 20th century could devise, yet also had at times tasted paradise. And, like Dante, he captured both for us.As a boy, he witnessed the demise of the 19th century, which took place on the battlefields of World War I. For a while he lived in Wilno \u2014 then part of Poland, now Lithuania\u2019s capital, Vilnius \u2014 and increasingly became aware of what was happening nearby, just beyond Poland\u2019s eastern border, where the empire of the czars morphed bloodily into the Soviet Union.Like the majority of young intellectuals, he retained leftist leanings, but, at the same time, found himself caught in an ideological quandary. From the mid-1920s and the early 1930s onward, much of the continent fell under the spell of two totalitarian ideologies, communism and fascism. Though they proclaimed concern for the future of humanity and pledged to bring justice and build heaven on earth, what they created bore no relation to their promises. Instead they led millions of people to their deaths.Milosz witnessed World War II and the Holocaust, living through the German occupation of Poland and the terrible, pitiless slaughter that accompanied it. Among his many famous poems is \u201cCampo dei Fiori,\u201d which movingly commemorates the fate of the Uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943.After the war, he spent several years in the United States as a diplomat representing the new, communist-run Poland. While he enjoyed reading Faulkner\u2019s novels, translating Auden and Eliot\u2019s poems and meeting Einstein, he was unable to come to terms with what to his mind was a consumerist, soulless society. He frequently felt at odds with communism as well as with capitalism and considered joining a Christian farming community in Paraguay.In 1951, not without misgivings, he defected to the West, enduring the migrant\u2019s life and fate, first in France, where at times he was shunned like a leper by Paris\u2019s Left Bank intellectuals because he had betrayed communism. Albert Camus was one of the few French writers who helped him survive a long period of solitary exile.Still, it was during this period that Milosz produced one of his most famous widely read works, the 1953 book \u201cThe Captive Mind.\u201d In it he examined why so many intellectuals and artists of the time succumbed to, or pretended to believe in, communism. A successful ideology, he wrote, is comforting, an all-encompassing tool to salve our deepest fears and orient our lives. The book brought him international fame, although as a poet he felt uneasy about being pigeonholed as an analyst of Soviet politics.Perhaps a decade ago, it would have been easy to pass off \u201cThe Captive Mind\u201d as a relic of the totalitarian 20th century: However, the last decade has demonstrated how the mechanisms of mind control Milosz exposed continue to be deployed throughout the globe.Some people, for example, feel certain that their failures or the collective failures of the state are caused by enemies one can easily pinpoint. They embrace ideologies that demonize liberals, communists, capitalists, Jews and, more fashionably in recent times, migrants and Muslims.The importance of Milosz\u2019s analysis is that it applies to much more than communism and fascism, or even political ideology. Toward the end of his life the British historian Tony Judt was reading \u201cThe Captive Mind\u201d with his students and pointing out that there are many different ideologies to which we passively yield and lies we choose to believe in: that wealth will make us happy, that thanks to the latest iPad we will find sense in our existence, that Facebook will bring us closer to others and that, because of all this, we will avoid pain and disappointment.Many of the political and social transmutations that appalled Milosz \u2014 the fears and hatreds \u2014 have been revived. In \u201cNative Realm\u201d he tells of his journey through France in the 1930s and how, walking together with his friends across a bridge joining Switzerland and France, he encountered a sign saying, \u201cGypsies, Poles, Romanians and Bulgarians are forbidden entry.\u201d Change the ethnicities, and one could easily find a similar message along other borders today, and not just in Europe.It could be said that the history of humanity is defined and dictated by two opposing processes: building bridges and raising walls. A bridge brings us closer to others, allows us to get to know them; it is a beginning of or an extension to a road. A wall separates, closes. And although it appears to provide security, it also generates a defensive mentality, the conviction that everything on the other side represents a threat, as the Polish writer Ryszard Kapuscinski points out.Milosz was deeply critical of the narrow nationalist views of his fellow countrymen, which provoked hostility from many quarters and accusations that he was \u201cbetraying\u201d the homeland. He often said that Poles, Lithuanians, Jews and Russians could live amicably with each other, as his long, deep friendship with the poets Joseph Brodsky of Russia and Tomas Venclova of Lithuania proved.At least in my country, Poland, the end of 20th century and the beginning of the 21st belonged to the bridge builders. Today, however, watchers on the walls \u2014 physical and political \u2014 can be observed there and everywhere.It is hard to comprehend why fanaticism, violence, hatred, fear and a desperate search for security are on the loose again. Could anyone a few years ago have anticipated that George Orwell\u2019s \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d would become a best seller on Amazon?The vision of multicultural societies seems to have vanished; the language of politicians has become more and more nationalistic; people no longer tolerate open discussion, determined to accept only confirmation of their own point of view. That stance makes life much easier, as \u201cThe Captive Mind\u201d shows. Everything that surrounds us has to be familiar. There should be no opponents or outsiders. We should be able to exist in an airtight bubble.In my country, despite surprising prosperity over the last few years, millions of people imagine that they have become worse off than others and that they have been wronged by someone. Is it the Germans? The Russians? The Jews? As a result they vote for the far right. There are more and more young people, like those in the 1930s, who demonstrate, chanting chauvinist slogans against immigrants, leftists and homosexuals. Some among them break the windows of cafes run by migrants. Perhaps they will soon begin burning books.Andrzej Franaszek is the author of \u201cMilosz: A Biography.\u201d This article was translated by Aleksandra and Michael Parker from the Polish.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Network Ad Wrangler Undaunted by Facebook and Google", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingAfter completing her first year as the head of advertising sales for NBCUniversal, Linda Yaccarino went out to dinner with her husband to celebrate.She soon found herself crying into a bowl of shrimp scampi.The tears were a rare reaction to what she called the hardest year of her career, when Ms. Yaccarino started dragging an ad sales operation for television programming as varied as \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and Bravo reality shows into the digital future.Things haven\u2019t gotten any easier in the television ad world, but five years later, Ms. Yaccarino, 54, is still at it. And far from weeping, she has become an outspoken leader in an industry that is contending with far-reaching changes in how people watch television while competing against a host of technology companies that have begun to vie for those same audiences by investing in original video content.Ms. Yaccarino, who oversees $10 billion in annual ad revenue, has drawn particular attention for her vocal criticism of Nielsen ratings, which have long been the standard for how TV ads are bought and sold, and for her use of digital properties that NBCU has either invested in or forged partnerships with, like Snapchat, BuzzFeed and Apple News.\u201cLinda has the ability to stay a step ahead, and I think she\u2019s done that wherever she\u2019s been,\u201d said Julie Rieger, the executive vice president for media at 20th Century Fox, who has known Ms. Yaccarino for more than a decade. \u201cShe is in some ways the Wayne Gretzky of media. It\u2019s not about where the puck is \u2014 it\u2019s about where the puck is going.\u201dAs broadcast television audiences shrink and people spend more time on digital platforms, Ms. Yaccarino has reoriented herself to think of the competitive landscape as stretching beyond NBC\u2019s rival networks to include online behemoths like Facebook and Google. During this week\u2019s annual ritual known as upfronts, when networks trot out their biggest stars and announce new shows in an attempt to lure advertising dollars, Ms. Yaccarino will surely be promoting the fact that the NBCU universe includes more than 17 cable channels, 50 online destinations and partnerships that reach to all sorts of platforms and devices.During a recent interview in her sun-filled office, Ms. Yaccarino explained the ways that marketers might use NBCU\u2019s properties and partnerships to reach, say, a young, busy mother.First, she wakes up and checks Apple News on her phone, Ms. Yaccarino said. Then she might turn on the \u201cToday\u201d show while making breakfast, catch up on E! on Snapchat at the school drop-off and check stock prices on CNBC or sports scores during the day. In the evening, she\u2019ll tune in to a show like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d then end the evening watching Jimmy Fallon. Each presents a distinct marketing opportunity.\u201cIt\u2019s about the media mix,\u201d she said.Ms. Yaccarino\u2019s desk faces two flat-screen televisions mounted side by side, and her office is peppered with photographs of stars like the Kardashians, whom she adores in part because of E!\u2019s success in marketing their reality show. She\u2019s married with two children, but jokes that Jack Pearson, the character from \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d will be her second husband once she figures out what to do with the first. And she professes excitement for the \u201cpinch me\u201d moments in her job, like holding business meetings with Mr. Fallon and talking with Megyn Kelly about her move from Fox to NBC.She has forged new relationships, inviting the sales chief of a rival network to speak at an NBCU innovation event this year and teaming up with AOL for automated advertising a couple of years ago \u2014 when the notion was viewed as \u201cheresy in the TV world,\u201d Ms. Yaccarino said.She first oversaw sales for NBCU\u2019s cable channels and was quickly promoted to overseeing all of the network\u2019s ad sales, a move that combined its broadcast, cable and digital properties for the first time.Previously, sales teams for divisions like NBC Sports, Bravo and USA functioned independently of one another. With the new structure, the idea was that if buyers wanted to be on \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d they could also be sold on \u201cModern Family\u201d reruns, Bravo shows and more, providing the network with more scale and efficiency.Wrangling a 1,000-plus person organization and 15 teams into doing that was the grueling part for Ms. Yaccarino. But it also forced her to grow comfortable with acting quickly in an industry where her competitors were changing by the day.\u201cHer job is understanding the marketplace and how to combine the assets she has under NBCU, connecting the dots between all the channels and ensuring the parent company gets as much revenue as possible,\u201d said Irwin Gotlieb, the chairman of GroupM, the media investing arm of the ad giant WPP. While that may occasionally make it harder for buyers, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s what she does, and she does it well.\u201dIf that was Act 1 of Ms. Yaccarino\u2019s time at NBCU, she\u2019s now ready for Act 2.\u201cThe next frontier is: How do we really bring it all together in terms of linear and digital?\u201d she said.\u201cImagine if the advertising-supported ecosystem went away,\u201d she said. \u201cThere would be no Hulu, no Netflix, no Amazon, because that\u2019s what fuels all their content. They\u2019d have to go to 100 percent original, and the cost for the consumer would be absolutely unaffordable. So I think everyone agrees that advertising-supported content needs to remain the main driver or the epicenter of the business. We just need to figure out a way to do it respectfully to consumer behavior today.\u201dThe frustrations have cast old rivalries in a new light. Joe Marchese, who was named the head of ad sales at Fox Networks Group last week, was invited by Ms. Yaccarino to speak at an internal NBCU event this year.\u201cIt was kind of like a Macy\u2019s-Gimbels type of thing for her to invite a senior person from Fox to come up and talk about where the industry is headed,\u201d Mr. Marchese said. But it reflects the challenges networks are facing as some viewers opt out of ads entirely through platforms like Netflix, while at the same time TV ratings numbers are being compared with online ad views on Google and Facebook.TV executives have seethed in the past two years over a frequently repeated remark from Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, who said the social network has a Super Bowl on mobile every day in terms of the people it can reach. While the size of audiences on Facebook and YouTube are undeniable, there is fierce debate over the value of video views on such platforms, particularly when the ads take up only, say, half of the screen, or appear for a couple of seconds without sound.\u201cFrom a consumer experience, we all know what it\u2019s like to experience a Super Bowl as you have people over your home, family, friends, or you go somewhere and you\u2019re watching this communal experience and you\u2019re talking about the show and you\u2019re yelling and screaming and holding your breath and talking about the commercials,\u201d Ms. Yaccarino said. \u201cThat\u2019s a Super Bowl.\u201dShe held up her phone and exaggeratedly swiped the screen without breaking eye contact. \u201cDoes this look like a Super Bowl?\u201d She kept swiping. \u201cThis is not a Super Bowl.\u201dNBC, it should be noted, will air the game next year.While much has been said about technology companies coming for TV advertising dollars, Ms. Yaccarino said the companies were \u201creally coming for TV content.\u201d She pointed to Twitter\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s deals with the N.F.L. and YouTube\u2019s new ad-supported shows with stars like Ryan Seacrest and Ellen DeGeneres.\u201cReally, you just can\u2019t snap your fingers and invent that,\u201d she said of premium content.And that is why she believes her focus on aligning with tech companies and reaching a large number of people on a variety of platforms will pay dividends.\u201cIt\u2019s about real audiences, real people who buy stuff, because they experienced your content all throughout the day,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf we can do that, then we can really compete with the Google, Facebooks, Twitter, etc., etc., or whoever\u2019s next of the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Young Comic TV Showrunners From Left Field", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byBURBANK, Calif. \u2014 \u201cBajillion Dollar Propertie$,\u201d the Seeso streaming service\u2019s workplace comedy about the hot young brokers of Platinum Realty, is set in a glass-and-steel tower in Beverly Hills, Calif. But the sound bites in this mockumentary, where their whining and conniving are exposed, are filmed in a cramped studio in the production offices here belonging to its creator and showrunner, Kulap Vilaysack.The dues-paying of the past, or the traditional pairing of younger showrunners with more experienced hands, is no longer as great a concern for TV executives. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a point-of-view shift where the industry is beginning to value the audiences that those producers bring to the table,\u201d said Evan Shapiro, a former president of IFC and the former executive vice president of digital enterprises for NBC Universal, who greenlighted \u201cBajillion.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten past the tipping point on that.\u201dAn inveterate viewer of reality shows like Bravo\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d and HGTV\u2019s \u201cProperty Brothers,\u201d she concocted \u201cBajillion\u201d and its diverse coterie of hypercompetitive real estate brokers. Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, the improv and sketch performers who created \u201cReno 911!,\u201d joined \u201cBajillion\u201d early in development as executive producers, and the show sold to Seeso, NBC\u2019s streaming network devoted to comedy.\u201cI thought that real estate world \u2014 high stress, high stakes \u2014 and that \u2018Million Dollar Listing\u2019 style would lend itself to comedy,\u201d she said.Even though a spoof of reality TV doesn\u2019t seem like the stuff of heartfelt, first-person storytelling that you see on shows like \u201cLove\u201d or HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d Ms. Vilaysack has been able to layer in personal touches. One of the leads on \u201cBajillion\u201d is a go-for-the-jugular broker named Victoria \u2014 \u201ca bully with daddy issues,\u201d Ms. Vilaysack said. The character\u2019s father, a real estate tycoon with his own reality show, never went to her fencing competitions when she was growing up, and she\u2019s still bitter about it. In a Season 2 episode, Victoria has an uncomfortable lunch with her father, who praises a waitress more than he does his own daughter. Ms. Vilaysack directed and was a writer for the episode.\u201cI have daddy issues; I have mommy issues,\u201d Ms. Vilaysack said over takeout salads in her office after a talking-head taping in late April. \u201cI have the feeling that I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d\u201cWe were looking for something to write together, and that set our brains on fire,\u201d Ms. Flahive said. \u201cWe sent Jenji Kohan [the creator of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cWeeds\u201d] a one-line email asking if she wanted to work on a show about women\u2019s wrestling in the \u201980s,\u201d Ms. Mensch said, \u201cand she wrote back, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201dZander Lehmann, the creator of \u201cCasual\u201d on Hulu, who had no previous TV experience, found a different route to showrunner: being discovered by the TV version of an angel investor. Mr. Lehmann, armed with a psychology degree from Washington University in St. Louis, sold an HBO pilot when he was 25 that didn\u2019t go forward. A year later, he wrote a pilot called \u201cCasual,\u201d a dramedy about a pair of romantically challenged adult siblings, that caught the eye of the filmmaker Jason Reitman.\u201cI thought it would be a good sample to get staffed on a TV series,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said over drinks at a pool hall in Glendale, Calif., in April a few hours after wrapping production on Season 3. \u201cI got really lucky.\u201dThat Mr. Reitman, the director of \u201cJuno\u201d and \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d liked the script wasn\u2019t the lucky part; directors read good scripts all the time. Lucky was Mr. Reitman looking for a TV project in 2014 just after Mr. Lehmann had written one and Hulu, Netflix, Seeso and other services were broadly expanding the market for offbeat comedies. Season 3 of \u201cCasual\u201d began Tuesday, May 23, on Hulu.The brothers Shipley (Justin, 28, and Jordan, 26) were recent college graduates with no Hollywood experience as well when they sent their script for \u201cWrecked\u201d \u2014 a comedy set on a Pacific island \u2014 to TBS.\u201cIt\u2019s about a plane crash, and the nose of the plane actually falls out of a tree and crushes a guy in the first episode,\u201d Justin Shipley said by phone from Fiji, where the brothers are in production on the second season, which debuts June 20. \u201cWe never thought it was producible as a half-hour comedy.\u201dAs with Mr. Lehmann and \u201cCasual,\u201d the Shipley brothers had impeccable timing with \u201cWrecked.\u201d TBS was replacing its light comedies with darker, higher-concept shows \u2014 a lineup that would eventually include \u201cThe Detour,\u201d \u201cPeople of Earth\u201d and \u201cSearch Party\u201d \u2014 at the same time the Shipley brothers were shopping their millennial take on \u201cLord of the Flies.\u201dAnother avenue that could grow over the next several years is the migration from YouTube to more mainstream platforms. The YouTube channel started by Ms. Ballinger, 30, has 7.7 million followers and nearly 1.3 billion views. \u201cHaters Back Off!,\u201d the Netflix spinoff that is a surprisingly touching series about teenage alienation and tolerance, is now in production on its second season.All these first-time showrunners are being helped by the voracious appetite for new material fed by streaming services like Hulu, Amazon, Seeso and especially Netflix. According to FX Networks data, the combined number of original scripted shows on broadcast, cable and premium channels has been essentially flat since 2014, while the number of shows on streaming has exploded \u2014 to 92, from 32 \u2014 during those same years.And it\u2019s not a fluke that comedies are the shows being greenlighted. \u201cComedies are less risky,\u201d said Mr. Shapiro, the former Seeso and IFC executive. \u201cThey\u2019re cheaper, they\u2019re easier to make, and the audiences for comedies tend to be more open to the way Aziz Ansari [the co-creator of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaster of None\u201d] brings a completely different point of view to the table.\u201dMr. Shapiro is in development on a weekly panel show that would primarily book nontraditional \u2014 that is, not straight, white, middle-class, male \u2014 comedian panelists. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to hear from everyone else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Opera Lovers, Make a Pilgrimage to Munich for \u2018Tannh\u00e4user\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byMUNICH \u2014 \u201cNach Rom!\u201d the cast of Wagner\u2019s \u201cTannh\u00e4user\u201d cries at the end of that opera\u2019s second act, pressing the title character to make the Catholic pilgrimage to Rome and save his troubled soul.But in that second-act finale \u2014 when Tannh\u00e4user, back at court in Wartburg but disgraced once his venture to Venus\u2019 lair has been revealed, resolves to travel to Rome \u2014 Mr. Petrenko builds the scene with a steadiness and patience that shows the music\u2019s debt to the early 19th century and the grand finales of Rossini and Bellini.What unites these two sides of Wagner, the early and late, here is Mr. Petrenko\u2019s unshowy energy, which emerges from the root of the orchestra: Listen closely, and there\u2019s always warm, full, rounded precision in the low brasses and low strings. The music down there may not be the tune you end up whistling, but it\u2019s the scaffolding of that tune that gives intensity and purpose to the melodic lines layered on top of it.Mr. Petrenko brings fresh vigor to this score \u2014 not the superficial verve of loudness or fastness, but a more elusive grandeur and dignity \u2014 and his cast does, too, including the earthy Elena Pankratova (Venus) and authoritative Georg Zeppenfeld (Hermann, Elisabeth\u2019s uncle).As Wolfram, the stable, upstanding counterweight to Tannh\u00e4user\u2019s tortured confusion, Christian Gerhaher faded the end of his great \u201cHymn to the Evening Star\u201d almost beyond audibility. Yet his scrupulous attention to the text kept the line vividly present, a ghost whose contours you could somehow see and feel.A serene, queenly presence as Elisabeth, Anja Harteros focused her emotions in her attractively unsettled voice, practically vibrating with feeling. Her choices of tone color constantly surprised: Describing Tannh\u00e4user\u2019s disappearance, her sound palpably grayed; later, a single word, \u201cj\u00e4hen,\u201d was a memorably sour sneer as she told how his betrayal had destroyed her. Klaus Florian Vogt, singing the title role for the first time, united his pure, boyish tone with heldentenor weight.What convinced me to make my own Munich pilgrimage was the promise of these peerless musical forces being set in motion by Mr. Castellucci, whose enigmatic, elegant, calmly brutal theater works have brought him avant-garde acclaim since the 1980s.This time, the result is disappointingly bland. No one wants or expects clear answers from a Castellucci production, but I wanted more suggestive images, a more charged mood.There are ideas, particularly in the first act. During the overture, a troupe of bare-breasted Amazons shoots arrows toward a gigantic image of an eye looming at the back of the stage. (Much is made of the similar construction of an archery bow and Tannh\u00e4user\u2019s harp.) The eye is later replaced by a slowly rotating circular panel; when a thin stream of blood leaks onto it, it becomes a mesmerizing exercise in slow-motion spin art. Venus\u2019s realm is a platform full of lethargically, primordially pulsing heaps of flesh \u2014 sensuality\u2019s nightmarish overkill.But the second act, at the Wartburg court, is slack, framed by endlessly shifting sheer, silky curtains, perhaps meant to contrast Venus\u2019s viscous ooze. It\u2019s a handsome set but it doesn\u2019t quite work: Mr. Castellucci seems to have conceived Elisabeth as chilly and detached, a kind of Hitchcockian heroine, which doesn\u2019t fit the sensitive, easily emotive Ms. Harteros. The staging isn\u2019t so much cool as dull; the singers seem game but at sea.The final act \u2014 in which Elisabeth dies, still praying for Tannh\u00e4user\u2019s redemption, and he returns from Rome, rejected, before a last-minute miracle of salvation \u2014 elicits a bit of Castelluccian meta-theater. The dead characters are placed on plinths inscribed with \u201cKlaus\u201d and \u201cAnja,\u201d the star singers\u2019 first names, and their bodies are then replaced \u2014 and replaced, and replaced \u2014 with progressively rotting versions to simulate the process of decomposition. All that\u2019s eventually left is two piles of dust, bits of which are sprinkled together for a cloying ending.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google, Not the Government, Is Building the Future", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut don\u2019t be fooled by expensive juice. The idea that Silicon Valley no longer funds big things isn\u2019t just wrong, but also obtuse and fairly dangerous. Look at the cars, the rockets, the internet-beaming balloons and gliders, the voice assistants, drones, augmented and virtual reality devices, and every permutation of artificial intelligence you\u2019ve ever encountered in sci-fi. Technology companies aren\u2019t just funding big things \u2014 they are funding the biggest, most world-changing things. They are spending on ideas that, years from now, we may come to see as having altered life for much of the planet.At the same time, the American government\u2019s appetite for funding big things \u2014 for scientific research and out-of-this-world technology and infrastructure programs \u2014 keeps falling, and it may decline further under President Trump.This sets up a looming complication: Technology giants, not the government, are building the artificially intelligent future. And unless the government vastly increases how much it spends on research into such technologies, it is the corporations that will decide how to deploy them.Consider Google. On Wednesday, the internet search company kicked off its annual developer conference near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company showed off several advances to its voice-enabled assistant and its mobile operating system. Among other things, you can now point your phone at an object in the real world \u2014 a flower, a sign in another language, a marquee for a rock concert \u2014 and the phone will give you more information about what you\u2019re looking at (for instance, a button to buy tickets for the concert).The real advances at Google are in that second category. At last year\u2019s show, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, inaugurated what he called a new era for Google. The search company would henceforth be an \u201cA.I.-first\u201d company \u2014 that is, most of its advances would be driven by artificial intelligence techniques.A lot of these plans will fail, but Google isn\u2019t making big, long-term bets out of altruism. The company understands that the A.I.-based projects that succeed could be transformational: They will alter existing industries and create huge new ones, including a stream of new businesses from which Google can profit.Google is not alone in this quest to build a future out of A.I. Its parent company, Alphabet, is spending billions to inject machine intelligence into much of the global economy, from self-driving cars to health care.There are two ways to respond to the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in the intelligent future. On the one hand, you could greet the news with optimism and even gratitude. The technologies that Google and other tech giants are working on will have a huge impact on society. Self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives a year, for instance, while computerized methods for diagnosing and treating disease could improve our health and cut the cost of care.What\u2019s more, experts in the field say that many tech giants are currently approaching A.I. with a kind of academic ethos. For instance, they regularly publish papers on their findings, and \u2014 through their cloud server businesses \u2014 they are allowing third-party companies to access some of their latest A.I. tech.But the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in A.I. might also be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government.\u201cWe created OpenAI partly because industry is investing such vast sums of money into A.I. research that commercial, private entities were on track to create the first powerful A.I. systems, and these entities don\u2019t have a built-in mechanism to ensure that everyone benefits from advances,\u201d Mr. Brockman told me in an email.He went on to note that one reason the internet has been so successful is that it was created through government funding to be open and accessible to everyone. If it had been created by a single company, it might have ended up like the phone network: useful for certain tasks, but not a broad-based engine of economic opportunity.\u201cSimilarly, as powerful A.I. systems come online, the intent and motivations of their creators will be major factors in determining their impact,\u201d Mr. Brockman said. \u201cIf A.I. development is done entirely in for-profit companies, then these systems are likely to be deployed to benefit just one organization and group of people.\u201dWhat\u2019s interesting is that many in the tech industry agree with the need for greater federal funding. OpenAI was created by Elon Musk and other tech luminaries, and it has received funding from Microsoft, Amazon and Y Combinator, the start-up incubator.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America\u2019s greatest advantages,\u201d he wrote.In other words, the tech giants that are building the future would like some help changing the world. We would be wise to chip in \u2014 or let them take over the future for themselves.An earlier version of this article incorrectly included Peter Thiel as among those who helped create OpenAI. While Mr. Thiel was among those who sponsored it, he was not a creator.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Charlie Hunnam: Pushy When It Counts (Picky, Too)", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byNeither director wanted him, but then they took a look at him, and then he opened his mouth.Charlie Hunnam is not exactly a household name in the United States, at least not just yet.But all those parts did not make a breakout star of Mr. Hunnam, 37, not least because he has been enormously picky about roles. He once spent a few lean years living off an organic marijuana crop he cultivated in his Los Angeles home, he said, rather than taking jobs that left him cold.\u201cI can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m being this candid,\u201d Mr. Hunnam said as he revealed his pot-growing days \u2014 they\u2019re behind him now, he swears \u2014 over a lunch of seared halibut and spring peas at the Four Seasons in Lower Manhattan a few weeks ago.Tall and V-shaped, blond and chiseled, Mr. Hunnam has been likened to Brad Pitt and Channing Tatum. Yet he didn\u2019t carry the \u201chere we go again\u201d ennui or whiff of wariness that often permeates the air around celebrities. This despite the fact that he was in the thick of the press tour for \u201cKing Arthur,\u201d the $102 million film Mr. Ritchie directed and helped write, in theaters Friday, May 12, with Mr. Hunnam as its star.Infuriated, Mr. Hunnam flew to London from Los Angeles to force a meeting that Mr. Ritchie couldn\u2019t say no to because Mr. Hunnam\u2019s manager is his close friend. Looking back, Mr. Hunnam said he was not sure how much he wanted the role; he just wanted to be seen. Yet within five minutes, Mr. Ritchie said, \u201cI knew I loved him.\u201dThe director continued, \u201cWhen someone\u2019s hungry and pushy and they can back it up with something, then it\u2019s a wonderful conspiracy.\u201d Mr. Hunnam was smart, meticulous and dived deep. He also hit the gym like a madman and, soon enough, looked like He-Man.This in turn dismayed Mr. Gray, when, eight days after wrapping \u201cKing Arthur,\u201d Mr. Hunnam showed up for a costume fitting for \u201cZ.\u201d The film is about Percy Fawcett, a real-life British explorer who disappeared in the Amazon in 1925 while searching for signs of an ancient civilization.Mr. Hunnam recalled that the \u201cZ\u201d director \u201clooked in abject horror at my body and said, \u2018This is a disaster, this is nowhere close to the physicality that we need for Fawcett.\u2019\u201d Mr. Hunnam added: \u201cI just looked like a superhero, you know? Stupid.\u201dMr. Pitt was to star but dropped out because of scheduling conflicts; then the lead was to be Benedict Cumberbatch, but his wife was about to give birth. Plan B suggested Mr. Hunnam, at which point Mr. Gray balked.\u201cI thought he was a Hells Angels kind of guy, which makes me feel like an absolute fool beyond comprehension,\u201d Mr. Gray said, in a phone chat.After learning Mr. Hunnam was British, Mr. Gray invited him over for dinner, making spaghetti and meatballs, which Mr. Hunnam dutifully ate even though, as Mr. Gray later learned, he avoids carbs.\u201cHe was so warm and funny. My wife thought he was handsomest man in the world, and my son was obsessed with him,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201c\u2018Lost City of Z\u2019 is all about feelings of inadequacy about class. He understood all that stuff, and spoke to it directly.\u201dFor Mr. Gray, that was key. Like his character in the film, Mr. Hunnam burned with the need to prove himself.Yet while his father had off-the-books wealth, he gave little money to Charlie, his brother or their mother, something Mr. Hunnam bears no animus about.\u201cIn his immortal words,\u201d Mr. Hunnam recalled, \u201che said to my mum, \u2018Look, if I\u2019m not going to be there to teach my sons to be men, then poverty will teach them to be men.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt was obvious to me he was going to wait for interesting roles to come along, and you can be waiting for a long time,\u201d said Mr. Gillen, who plays Littlefinger in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and who also stars in \u201cKing Arthur.\u201d \u201cHe hasn\u2019t made it particularly easy for himself.\u201dThen \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d came along. Kurt Sutter, who created the series, said he saw a movie star in Mr. Hunnam, one who grasped outlaw culture (his father Billy\u2019s doing) and who was also hypercritical of himself (Mr. Hunnam later said he\u2019s hypercritical of everything). \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of insane unobtainable need for perfection,\u201d Mr. Sutter said. \u201cHis methodical ascension wasn\u2019t an overnight pretty-boy success. It was mounting a body of work for the right reasons.\u201dMr. Hunnam has since added yet another feather to his cap; he starred, with Rami Malek, in the remake of \u201cPapillon,\u201d which wrapped production this past December.But he can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, breathe easy yet.\u201cOn set is the only time life fully makes sense, that I feel connected to the rhythm of my life and what it all means,\u201d he said. Once that\u2019s over, he added: \u201cThat thing that was filling me up is gone. And so in its wake is a giant hole that screams out every day \u2018please fill me.\u2019\u201dHe also knows his time at the summit might be fleeting.\u201cThe fear of \u2018Is it going to happen?\u2019 just immediately gets replaced with \u2018Is it going to be temporary?\u2019\u201d he said.By all indications, his boomlet has not gone to his head. One recent night in New York, Mr. Ritchie invited Mr. Hunnam to join a bunch of friends for a nice dinner. Mr. Hunnam replied thanks, but he was already eating dinner, by himself, in a sushi joint a few blocks away.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Sets Up Shop in the Heart of the Publishing Industry", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byJeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has often struck a defiant tone when asked about the company\u2019s dominance of the book industry.But when he made that remark four years ago, even a visionary like Mr. Bezos might not have imagined that the future would look so retro.Now, Amazon is bringing its experimental, data-driven approach to physical retail to Midtown Manhattan, the heart of the publishing industry. On Thursday, Amazon will open a store \u2014 its seventh \u2014 in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. The 4,000 square-foot space, near the site of a now-shuttered Borders store, is just a few blocks from Penguin Random House, and walking distance from Simon & Schuster and Hachette\u2019s Midtown headquarters. This summer, the company plans to open another store on 34th Street.In a city that prides itself on being a literary mecca, the response to Amazon\u2019s arrival was, unsurprisingly, mixed.Amazon is planning to open six more stores this year, including outlets in Bellevue, Wash.; Paramus, N.J;, and San Jose, Calif.The company\u2019s push into physical stores might seem at odds with its origins as an online retailer. But it fits with Amazon\u2019s continuing expansion into nearly every corner of the publishing industry. Since its founding more than 20 years ago, Amazon has become the dominant book retailer, and has created niches along the way.It accounts for nearly half of all book sales in the United States, including print and e-books, according to the Codex Group, which analyzes the industry. With the introduction of the Kindle in 2007, Amazon drove the e-book and self-publishing boom. It bought Audible, the audiobook producer and retailer, and Goodreads, the popular book review sharing site. It started a publishing company, and now has 14 imprints.\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re sharing this information with readers,\u201d said Susan Stockman, who oversees Amazon Charts.With its lists, Amazon aims to redefine the notion of a best seller, expanding it to include books that are \u201cborrowed\u201d from its e-book subscription service, and ones that are streamed on Audible. As a result, the lists give increased visibility to books that might not typically appear on other best-seller lists, like The New York Times\u2019s or The Wall Street Journal\u2019s. The inaugural Amazon Charts list for most-sold fiction features five books from Amazon Publishing, out of 20 on the list.\u201cThis is their attempt to push back and say, we\u2019re legitimate,\u201d said Peter Hildick-Smith, the president of the Codex Group.All of Amazon\u2019s acquisitions and new features are having a cumulative effect, allowing the company to draw on its vast customer base and troves of data to discover what is popular, and return that information to customers, creating a lucrative feedback loop. Eventually, the weekly best-seller lists may be incorporated into displays in Amazon\u2019s bookstores, and perhaps posted on Goodreads. They are already available on Alexa, Amazon\u2019s virtual assistant, which will recite the new best-seller lists when asked.\u201cAmazon created a new model, and now they are hijacking the best-seller list idea to conform to what they were doing,\u201d said Mike Shatzkin, the chief of Idea Logical Company, a book industry consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely an intrusion of their business model into the overall ecosystem.\u201dThe new lists have led to speculation that they might eventually challenge more established best-seller lists like The Times\u2019s. David Naggar, Amazon\u2019s vice president, while not referring to a specific competing list, said, \u201cMany of the weekly lists that are out there today tend to curate, they rerank or add or remove books.\u201d He described Amazon\u2019s new lists as \u201cunfiltered and unedited.\u201dDanielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said that readers \u201cvalue the rigor and independence of the New York Times best-seller lists.\u201d\u201cUnlike lists from individual retailers, our best-seller lists are based on a detailed analysis of book sales from a wide range of retailers in markets nationwide who provide us with specific and confidential context of their sales each week,\u201d she said. \u201cThese standards are applied consistently, across the board in order to provide readers the best assessment of what books are the most broadly purchased at that time.\u2019\u2019Crowdsourcing and data mining are also driving the company\u2019s approach to its bookstores, which act as showcases for books popular with customers on the site. While the stores have traditional categories, like fiction, nonfiction and travel, the most eye-catching shelves feature categories culled from Amazon\u2019s customer data.\u201cWe call this a physical extension of Amazon.com,\u201d said Jennifer Cast, vice president of Amazon Books, during a tour of the Manhattan store on Tuesday. \u201cWe incorporate data about what people read, how they read it and why they read it.\u201dThe first thing customers see when they walk into the store is a large display table, labeled Highly Rated, which includes books with an average rating of 4.8 stars or higher on a scale of 5, among them best sellers like \u201cBorn a Crime\u201d by Trevor Noah and \u201cShoe Dog\u201d by Phil Knight.Another display case, labeled Page-Turners, features books that people finish reading on their Kindle in fewer than three days. It includes a few thrillers, but also some serious nonfiction books like \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d by J. D. Vance and \u201cWhen Breath Becomes Air\u201d by Paul Kalanithi.Another section features the most \u201cwished for\u201d books from Amazon\u2019s website, among them \u201cTools of Titans\u201d by Tim Ferriss. At the back of the store is an area with books that have amassed more than 10,000 customer reviews.The books bear no prices. \u201cAmazon\u2019s pricing is dynamic,\u201d Ms. Cast said. So shoppers must scan books with an Amazon app on their cellphone or at one of the store\u2019s digital kiosks.The books are all displayed face out. Under each book is a card with the average customer rating, the number of reviews and a featured review from an Amazon reader. Displaying the full cover of each book mimics the visual look of Amazon\u2019s website, and might lure customers to unfamiliar titles.\u201cThe purpose of this store is discovery,\u201d Ms. Cast said. \u201cIf you already know what you want, you\u2019ll go online and get it.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about Amazon\u2019s continuing expansion into various parts of the publishing industry misstated the number of imprints from Amazon Publishing. It has 14, not nine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Wants to Be Everywhere With Everyone", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 Sometimes you just need to have a party, even if there\u2019s nothing special to celebrate.That was Google\u2019s situation on Wednesday, when it held its annual conference for developers on a perfect spring day in the outdoor amphitheater adjacent to its Silicon Valley campus.There were no headline-making announcements, no big reveal of the sort that Steve Jobs would make (iPod and iPhone) in his glory years at Apple. The tech world moves too fast these days for companies to save products for an annual event; they appear when they\u2019re finished. But the conference must go on anyway.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, began by talking about Google\u2019s impressive reach. Seven of its products \u2014 including Search, YouTube and Maps \u2014 have more than a billion users each. The Android operating system software is on more than two billion devices.Google\u2019s ambition, as Mr. Pichai and the speakers that followed him made clear, is to knit all those devices and services together. Google users \u2014 which means just about everyone, in Google\u2019s vision \u2014 will interact with the company all day long and do it so seamlessly that they barely notice it.\u201cIn an A.I.-first world, we are rethinking all our products,\u201d Mr. Pichai said.Simply pointing a phone at a restaurant would bring up reviews of it. And a search for a small product \u2014 a screwdriver, say \u2014 in a vast hardware store would be enabled by what Google calls Visual Position Service.\u201cGPS gets you to the door, and then V.P.S. can get you the exact item you\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Clay Bavor, Google\u2019s virtual reality team leader. With an audio interface, V.P.S. would be a gift to the vision-impaired.Google Home, introduced at I/O last year, was rushed out to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo. While Google does not release sales figures, analysts say Home lags far behind the Echo, which recently announced new features that Home does not have. Perhaps Google can catch up or perhaps Home will become another Google Buzz, a social network that failed a few years ago.The same caution goes for Google\u2019s efforts in virtual reality. It is developing its first stand-alone headsets, done in partnership with Qualcomm, Lenovo and HTC, which will be released this fall. But Facebook and Samsung already have their own well-publicized V.R. initiatives.At the end of the keynote, Mr. Pichai discussed a new initiative called Google for Jobs that will pull data from partner sites to making job-hunting easier.One major job listing site, Indeed, is not one of Google\u2019s partners. Within a few hours of the keynote, the company fired back. \u201cWe are happy to see that 13 years after Indeed launched, Google has woken up to the fact that searching for jobs is one of the most important searches in anyone\u2019s life,\u201d said Chris Hyams, the president of Indeed, in a statement.That makes another battle joined.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "LVMH and the Next Big Digital Shopping Experience", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe believe we are on the cusp of revealing something very exciting,\u201d Mr. Rogers, 44, said in hushed tones.The \u201cwe\u201d was the project\u2019s 60 employees, many of whom have been hired from the Paris technology sector and who are hidden far from the corporate headquarters in new offices in the 15th Arrondissement. Mr. Rogers rolled up the sleeves of his navy V-neck sweater and added, \u201cI guess it\u2019s time to see if the customers think so, too.\u201dHe was referring to the imminent unveiling of LVMH\u2019s high-stakes foray into multibrand luxury e-commerce. Rumors of a shopping platform that would fall under the branding umbrella of Le Bon March\u00e9, LVMH\u2019s upmarket department store, have swirled for months. Now 24 S\u00e8vres, a boutique shopping website and mobile app named after the Paris street that Le Bon March\u00e9 is on, goes live in under a month.A successful entry by LVMH, however, could shake up everything.\u201cLe Bon Marche is already a multibrand physical retailer; moving that store online is a clear and natural next step,\u201d said Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst with Exane BNP Paribas. \u201cOf course, the natural advantage for LVMH is that they can get so many brands to play ball straight away, because the businesses belong to them. Easy, no?\u201dNot so fast. LVMH has previously faltered in the multibrand luxury space. The website eLuxury, closed in 2009, was a rare and high-profile misstep. What makes the group think it can succeed now where it has failed before?\u201cOne word: Timing,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.Other people, though, might say that he is the answer.Born in Goshen, Ind., Mr. Rogers has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 rarely seen in haute luxury. He is a computer science graduate and onetime roadie for the Beastie Boys who first became a father at 17 (that daughter, now 26, is finishing her Ph.D. in genetics in the United States).He spent the early part of his career as president of new media for the band\u2019s record label Grand Royal. (\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be anywhere without those guys,\u201d he said of the Beastie Boys, looking affectionately to their picture up on the office wall).But, he said: \u201cI was ready to move on from music because it felt like a solved problem. The main players are now established. The space has gone from science fiction to mainstream, from an industry in denial to an industry in free-fall to an industry in growth.\u201cAnd I just had this feeling about retail, that it would be the next frontier to really change, where the real winners are yet to be determined. Then LVMH approached me with this opportunity. And I realized if I really believed that, there could be no place better to go.\u201d\u201cA lot of the stuff we\u2019ve been working on, I just wouldn\u2019t have been able to do without Alex,\u201d Mr. Rogers said, emphasizing that his responsibilities extend far beyond the introduction of 24 S\u00e8vres, where day-to-day operations are run by its chief executive, Eric Goguey. He also oversees the LVMH brands\u2019 e-commerce strategies, customer data management upgrades, the building of the online wholesale business in perfumes and spirits and LVMH\u2019s China digital strategy.\u201cThere is a lot on our plate right now,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cAnd Alex, outside of his full-time day job, is very switched on as to where this business needs to go.\u201d The younger Mr. Arnault is the chief executive of Rimowa, a luggage brand owned by LVMH.Still, there is no question that this e-commerce endeavor is extensive and eagerly anticipated. Mr. Rogers said LVMH had considered every branding possibility for 24 S\u00e8vres, which will initially stock only woman\u2019s wear, but settled on maintaining a connection to Le Bon March\u00e9 because of its 160-year history as a pioneer in catalog sales.\u201cI find it interesting that the Parisian perspective on fashion has been missing from the e-commerce landscape until now,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my view it is a conspicuous absence and a huge market gap that we intend to fill.\u201d He declined to reveal the exact cost of this investment for LVMH to date other than to say that it was relatively \u201cmodest \u2014 a brick-by-brick, start-up style approach.\u201d He added that 24 S\u00e8vres is also the name of the current loyalty program run by the department store, with legions of existing members. That program will also now be shared with users of the website and app.In many ways 24 S\u00e8vres shares characteristics with its more established rivals, including fast delivery times to scores of international locations; chatbots or stylists-on-demand; glossy packaging, complete with Eiffel Tower cutout pop-ups and love notes from Paris; and an efficient checkout process. Luxury e-commerce has become about the price of the consumer\u2019s time, Mr. Rogers said, leading to an increasingly competitive field in terms of service across the retail spectrum. But there are differences, too.\u201cThe move toward social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat comes hand-in-hand with the rise of the internet as a more visual medium and of mobile domination,\u201d Mr. Rogers said, his hand on \u201cLouis Vuitton Windows,\u201d a suitcase-size Assouline tome by the Louis Vuitton visual image director, Faye McLeod, that sits as a touchstone in the middle of his office (Ms. McLeod has been heavily involved in the creative direction of 24 S\u00e8vres). \u201cIncreasingly consumers want pictures over words,\u201d he said. As a result, he added, \u201cif you look at our site, we lean far further toward visually-led merchandising than the more editorial skew of our competitors.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think of this as the LVMH e-commerce project; think of this as us taking Le Bon March\u00e9 international via the internet,\u201d Mr. Rogers said, playing down expectations for the first step of an overhaul of the group\u2019s approach to reaching customer. The initial success of the project will be measured by sales, although he emphasized that LVMH is a group that consistently takes a long-term view.\u201cWhere I am from, people always said to me, \u2018You\u2019re late,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s already too crowded a space. But with Beats, we showed them they were wrong. I\u2019ve walked that path before. I see that path here again.\u201d\u201cWe actually currently have more Vuitton stores in the U.S. than Amazon does distribution points, which is great,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cIn context, it means that hypothetically we could have as much logistics capacity in the U.S. as Amazon does. And as for our rivals, well, it is a big sky. There is still plenty of room for growth for all the players.\u201dReferring to eLuxury, he added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be early adopters. We have been before and we paid the price for that. And when it comes to the internet specifically, there isn\u2019t necessarily a reward for being first. There is, however, currently a major focus on omnichannel and experience, and we are moving from a mass culture to a mass of niches. If there\u2019s quality in what you do, you\u2019re not threatened. Timing-wise, this is exactly where LVMH wants to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates was a close second with $1.4 billion.Further down the list was Robert Mercer, the co-chief executive of Renaissance and one of the biggest backers of Donald J.

But is it waking up?The idea is catching fire.As the big broadcast networks and ad buyers descend on Manhattan this week for the start of the annual advertising sales season known as upfronts, that Colbert-Fallon role reversal says everything you need to know about the political charge that\u2019s shaking up the television world.The thinking at the time had it that people wanted a party-like-it\u2019s-1999 late night experience, which Jimmy Fallon and Mr. Corden offered and Mr. Colbert, then struggling in the ratings, presumably did not. Now, as Alexander Nazaryan wrote in the Newsweek piece on Mr. Fallon\u2019s new standing, \u201cAmericans want rage.\u201dActually, it seems, a good subset of them want \u201cwoke.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to declare this the age of \u201cWoke TV,\u201d but that seems to tread too close to Pepsi/Kendall territory.When applied to television, both usages are in play. And, given that they\u2019re often referring to television that appeals to people distraught over the Trump presidency, perhaps the genre should be referred to as \u201cResistance TV.\u201dWhatever you call it, it\u2019s not for everyone. There\u2019s no concurrent surge in scripted television shows capturing the pro-Trump zeitgeist, though there would seem to be an audience for one (\u201calt-TV?\u201d).He says he\u2019s working on a new show that will do that.Resistance/Woke/Whatever-You-Want-to-Call-It TV didn\u2019t dominate the Top 10 shows this television season. According to Nielsen, among the most-watched shows were the sitcom \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d which has an average audience of 14 million people on CBS; the zombie thriller \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d the second-most watched show, with an average audience of more than 11 million people on AMC; \u201cThe Voice\u201d with more than 10.6 million people on NBC; and \u201cThis is Us\u201d with nearly 10 million people tuning in on NBC.The audience for the new streaming hit \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d may pale in comparison, given that Hulu had 12 million users at the last official count. (Netflix counts nearly 99 million.)But something\u2019s going on for sure, considering that Hulu says the show\u2019s premiere a few weeks ago was the biggest in the company\u2019s short history.Based on the Margaret Atwood novel of the same name, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is about once-modern women forced into indentured servitude to bear children. The production team\u2019s embrace of the political moment is extraordinary by historical television standards.\u201cWe think that Planned Parenthood is an essential part of the fabric of this country and we don\u2019t want to back away from having an association,\u201d said the show\u2019s executive producer, Warren Littlefield.Mr. Littlefield probably wouldn\u2019t have been so quick to sign off on that kind of overtly political cross promotion in the job he\u2019s best known for, the former president of NBC Entertainment.His own career progression says it all. He helped preside over NBC\u2019s rise to the top of the broadcast television ratings, drawing audiences of tens of millions with hits like \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d That was \u201ca show about nothing,\u201d the perfect subject for those carefree days before September 11.That brings me to the key ingredients in all of this: television\u2019s nichification and a leap into original programming by the streaming services, which, led by Netflix and Amazon, took spending on original programming to almost $50 billion last year, according to Boston Consulting Group.In this Peak TV era, there\u2019s room for everything, especially shows that hit the political moment. That doesn\u2019t mean being merely topical or overt. \u201cThe idea of, \u2018Hey, be politically aware, deal with the politics of the moment\u2019 \u2014 good,\u201d David Nevins, the Showtime chief executive told me. \u201c\u2018Be politically correct\u2019 \u2014 the caricature of lefty identity politics \u2014 not so interesting.\u201dQuality has to be part of the equation. The money is there to do it, and the market is there for it. And this is where the idiot box\u2019s self-improvement comes in.That raises the question: If television got us here, can it get us out?The Mediator column on Monday, about the popularity of political issues on television shows, misstated the surname of the writer of an article on the online magazine The Root who commented about the interest in a new Netflix show \u201cDear White People.\u201d He is Jason Johnson, not Jones. The column also misidentified the celebrity who was the face of a Pepsi commercial that appeared to incorporate a Black Lives Matter protest. The ad featured Kendall Jenner, not her sister Kylie.Jaclyn Peiser contributed research.Advertisement"}

When it started up in April, Boomerang had 1,000 \u201cepisodes\u201d (shorts, actual television episodes, movies) at hand; that\u2019s about one-fifth of what the larger library contains. The \u201cBugs vs. Daffy\u201d playlist feels almost definitive: \u201cShow Biz Bugs\u201d casts the two as vaudeville rivals; \u201cRabbit Fire\u201d is the first of the duo\u2019s \u201cRabbit season/Duck season\u201d duels, featuring the immortal line \u201chow a person could get so despicable in one lifetime is beyond me;\u201d and the immortal \u201cDuck Amuck\u201d finds an unseen animation artist tormenting Daffy with a brush and eraser.A \u201cBest of Droopy\u201d playlist doesn\u2019t feature \u201cNorthwest Hounded Police,\u201d but it does have its 1943 precursor \u201cDumb-Hounded,\u201d which features the running-out-of-the-frame gag and also has much more sumptuous animation and background art than \u201cNorthwest.\u201d Other amusements include the 1946 Tom and Jerry short \u201cSolid Serenade,\u201d in which Tom, who spent most of his cartoon career silent save for mewls and hisses, sings \u201cIs You Is or Is You Ain\u2019t My Baby\u201d in the style of Fats Waller. And the cartoons all look great on the app \u2014 a lot of this material is frequently bootlegged onto YouTube in inferior-looking versions.This kind of thing can keep a person busy for hours, I\u2019m sure, but my brief here is to report on the pleasures of streaming movies, so I\u2019m obliged to say that cinema is pretty thin on the ground at Crunchyroll. (Much of the site\u2019s content is available free, but an ad-free premium subscription is $6.95 a month.) One title that stands out is \u201cFist of the North Star\u201d (1986), from Toei Animation, a gruelingly violent post-nuclear dystopian tale replete with martial arts and despotism.To its credit, Crunchyroll offers only the subtitled version of the movie. (Even if you\u2019re not a fan, the English-dubbed version is a travesty of the original.) All of the other material I watched on the service was presented the same way. And let it be said that the service knows its core demographic. I logged onto Crunchyroll on my PlayStation 4, and the menu is configured to work best not with that box\u2019s universal remote but with a gaming controller.Advertisement"}
