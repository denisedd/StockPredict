{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Caring About Tech News", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byBitsLook at all the sides Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are playing in self-driving. Through Waymo, Alphabet is building its own self-driving tech. But through its venture capital firm, Alphabet is also a huge investor in Uber. And it is also suing Uber. Also, through Waze, its mapping app, Google is running a car-pooling service that could compete with Uber. And now Waymo is partnering with Uber\u2019s biggest competitor.Isn\u2019t this exactly the sort of thing people complain about when they say Google is getting too big and powerful? In every way imaginable, Google is trying to use its huge power to completely dominate the future of driving tech.This is exactly why Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.Since our Federal Trade Commission seems relatively toothless in big tech acquisitions, methinks Facebook is going to face a lot of pain in the E.U. over the next few years. Keep an eye on that.But to be honest with you, the Google stuff reminds me of what I really wanted to talk about this week: I genuinely do not care about any of it.How do you stay passionate about tech news throughout this stuff? I find it difficult to do more than warm up microwave burritos every night for dinner and watch CNN for hours.Self-driving cars are a good example. Everyone in tech seems pretty sure that self-driving cars will change society in big ways, when they come. But when will that happen? Uber, Waymo, Tesla and others are locked in this existential battle for the future of transportation, but the battle is sure to be long, slow and unpredictable.We might have a sense of where self-driving tech is going next year, and a better sense the year after that, and an even better sense in five or 10 years. But at any given moment, a particular development in the industry is going to seem like pretty small ball, especially compared to the car crash of politics news.One thing I\u2019ve found is that chatting with folks in tech can be pretty therapeutic. A lof techies are relentlessly optimistic. Even when the world is falling apart, they can see some better version of the future, and they\u2019re working to build it. We journalists can get pretty cynical about the world, but being around techies does give me some sense, sometimes, that things could get better. Maybe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Ford Takes Investor Meeting Online, Brickbats Still Sting", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Ford Motor moved its annual shareholders meeting from the physical world to the virtual on Thursday. But the new format did little to shield the company from dissatisfied investors.Mark Fields, the chief executive, said the company was making progress in its transition to new technology to compete in an era of self-driving cars and electrified vehicles. But shareholders who took part in the meeting\u2019s online question-and-answer session hardly shared his optimism.In a series of questions read aloud by Ford\u2019s chairman, William C. Ford Jr., investors called the company\u2019s stock performance \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201cdismal,\u201d and said the sinking share price indicated a \u201clack of confidence\u201d in the company\u2019s direction. (Mr. Ford did not identify the shareholders.)Ford\u2019s shares have dropped nearly 40 percent since Mr. Fields became the C.E.O. three years ago, and Mr. Ford conceded that the stock price was a major concern. Last month, Ford\u2019s market capitalization fell behind that of Tesla, the upstart electric-car maker.\u201cLook, we are as frustrated as you are by the stock price,\u201d said Mr. Ford, whose family effectively controls the company through a class of shares that carry outsize voting rights. \u201cA couple of people have said, does the Ford family care about the stock price? The short answer is yes \u2014 a lot.\u201dAnd Ford came under fire from shareholders for the format of the meeting itself, one that for years has been held in an auditorium in Wilmington, Del., where the company is incorporated.The format also allowed some shareholders to call in. One of them, John Chevedden, commented on shareholder proposals that included eliminating the 16-votes-per-share rights attached to the Ford family\u2019s special class of stock. (The proposal failed on a vote of about 2 to 1.)Mr. Chevedden likened the online meeting to a \u201cretreat into a foxhole\u201d by Ford\u2019s leaders. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re hiding in Dearborn today in the basement,\u201d he said, referring to Ford\u2019s corporate headquarters in Michigan.At their own meeting this week, Ford\u2019s board reflected some of the concerns expressed by shareholders, scheduling extra time to press Mr. Fields on the prospects for growth in the company\u2019s core auto operations and its expansion into autonomous vehicles.Like most other major automakers, Ford has benefited in recent years from surging sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles in the American market.But after two consecutive years of record sales industrywide, the market has cooled off. Ford\u2019s sales slid about 5 percent in the first four months of 2017, slightly worse than the industry\u2019s overall performance.The company recently reported that its first-quarter earnings fell by about 35 percent, to $1.6 billion, from the same period last year. Ford\u2019s United States market share also dipped, mostly because of plunging sales of passenger cars.Other automakers are also coping with slower sales, particularly those of cars.But Ford is suffering compared with larger competitors such as General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota, which have greater resources to devote to emerging technology. Ford, for example, is lagging behind Tesla and G.M. in introducing electric vehicles to the mass market.While Mr. Fields has been vocal about the need to move aggressively into electrified models, Ford is still at least three years from producing its first long-range, battery-powered model for mainstream consumers.And the company is locked in an expensive race with automakers and Silicon Valley companies to perfect self-driving equipment considered critical to the growth of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.\u201cThe bottom line is the biggest strategic shift in the history of our company is well underway and gaining momentum,\u201d Mr. Fields said in his presentation to shareholders.Mr. Fields described Ford\u2019s mission as balancing two imperatives: manufacturing traditional automobiles for global markets, and investing in technology to capture new revenue eventually from autonomous models.\u201cWe continue to deliver solid results in our core automotive business by keeping one foot in today,\u201d he said, adding that Ford\u2019s technology push was akin to \u201cplacing one foot in tomorrow\u201d as well.Mr. Ford and the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, dismissed the potential for a share buyback program to increase the value of the stock.Mr. Shanks also said the company needed to conserve its cash reserves for investing in new technology and maintaining its dividend in the event American auto sales continue to decline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "First Came the Hydrogen Cars. Now, the Refilling Stations.", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byWheelsThe daily commute is a real grind for most people, but not for Heather McLaughlin.In February, Ms. McLaughlin leased a 2017 Honda Clarity FC, a sedan powered by hydrogen fuel cells and available only in California. And it has transformed her daily 20-mile commute near San Francisco.With no pistons or spark plugs, the car is serenely quiet. Its electric motor provides a peppy ride. And wherever Ms. McLaughlin goes, the only thing that comes out of the tailpipe is a bit of water vapor. There are no pollutants, no greenhouse gases.\u201cOn cold mornings you can actually see drops of water \u2014 it\u2019s so cool,\u201d Ms. McLaughlin said recently. \u201cDriving to work is usually the best part of my day.\u201dRight now, a morning ride in a hydrogen-powered car is possible only in California. But in the coming months, environmentally minded consumers on the East Coast will have the opportunity to join in.Automakers and environmentalists have long hailed fuel cells as a revolutionary technology that can reduce planet-warming tailpipe emissions, which account for a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released in the United States. After years of development, several models are now on the road, like the Toyota Mirai and the Honda Clarity FC.The next challenge is building networks of hydrogen stations so owners can refuel their cars.So far California has 30, enough to enable owners to drive throughout the state without worry of running out of hydrogen, and it intends to expand that to 100 by 2020. Sales of fuel-cell vehicles have been limited to the state so far.The automakers are poised, however, to expand into the Northeast. Air Liquide, a producer of industrial gases, is working with Toyota to set up a chain of 12 hydrogen fueling stations stretching from New York to Boston; the first is expected to go into operation later this year. Locations will include the Bronx; Brooklyn; Hempstead, N.Y., on Long Island; Lodi, N.J.; Hartford; and Braintree and Mansfield, Mass.The availability of hydrogen fuel will pave the way for the start of East Coast sales.The Northeast is \u201cthe next critical step toward a much wider distribution of fuel-cell vehicles,\u201d said Craig Scott, director of Toyota\u2019s advanced technology group. The densely populated Northeastern states \u201cin some sense could rival California as a market,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAs a region, they have very good sales potential.\u201dIn March, Hyundai previewed a new fuel-cell sport utility vehicle that it plans to introduce next year.Steve Center, Honda\u2019s vice president for environmental business development, said oil companies and others were also showing interest in adding hydrogen fueling stations on the East Coast. \u201cWhat we want to see is clusters of fueling stations in the cities, and then connectors in corridors between the big cities so you have fueling between Boston, New York, Washington,\u201d he said.California has had an advantage because it is a large state with a government committed to supporting zero-emissions technologies. \u201cIn the Northeast, you have different states under different leadership, so it\u2019s a little tougher to get a unifying plan,\u201d Mr. Center said.The automakers say they plan to continue to push ahead with fuel-cell technology even if the Trump administration pulls back federal support for advanced-technology cars. The companies believe that they will be required, within a decade or two, to produce large numbers of cars and trucks that release nothing into the atmosphere in most markets around the world.\u201cWe know the end game is zero emissions,\u201d said Mark Reuss, General Motors\u2019 executive vice president for global product development.Fuel cells operate by setting off a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. The two elements bond, creating an electric charge. Stack a few hundred cells together, and they can generate enough electricity to power a car motor.Hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, if they take off, could offer advantages over the battery-powered cars on the road now, like the Tesla Model S and the Nissan Leaf. Electric vehicles need to be recharged, sometimes for a few hours, when their batteries run down. While the Chevrolet Bolt is said to go 238 miles before needing to recharge, others are more limited.A version of the Clarity powered by batteries goes just 80 miles on a single charge. By comparison, the Clarity FC \u2014 the fuel-cell version \u2014 can go 366 miles on a full tank.The Clarity FC is a four-door sedan and is the same size as a Honda Accord, but it features more futuristic touches including slitlike headlamps, a sloping roofline and angular taillamps. It was designed from the ground up for an electric powertrain, which enabled Honda to create more interior space while fitting in two nearly indestructible hydrogen tanks.Refueling the Clarity and the Mirai is virtually the same process as filling a car with gasoline. In California, owners pull up to what looks like a normal fuel pump. The fueling hose clicks into the car\u2019s intake port, and hydrogen gas is forced into the tanks. It all takes three to five minutes.Most of the hydrogen pumps in California are at existing gas stations. The state recently provided $32 million in grants to fund the construction of 15 additional fueling stations.So far, Toyota is in the lead in sales, having sold about 1,400 Mirais. The company expects sales to exceed 3,000 by year\u2019s end. Honda started selling the Clarity this year and has delivered about 100. Hyundai has also leased a small number of fuel-cell versions of its Tucson S.U.V. in Southern California.In a bid to cut the cost of fuel-cell systems, G.M. and Honda are setting up a plant in Michigan to mass-produce fuel-cell systems that both companies will use in future hydrogen-powered vehicles. The companies hope that by pooling their resources they can quickly increase production and lower costs.For now, subsidies are offered to make fuel-cell vehicles more affordable. Both the Clarity FC and the Mirai have list prices of about $58,000, although almost all customers lease the vehicles. The federal government gives a $7,500 tax credit on zero-emissions vehicles, and the state of California offers a $5,000 grant on top of that.The automakers add incentives of their own, too. Toyota and Honda give their customers credit cards for up to $15,000 of fuel over the first three years of ownership. Hydrogen fuel is still significantly more expensive than gasoline. Filling a tank costs about $75.In addition, both Toyota and Honda provide a rental car for up to three weeks a year, in case a customer needs to go on a long trip out of range of hydrogen fueling stations and their Mirai or Clarity FC has to stay home.Ms. McLaughlin, the Clarity FC owner in California, says she pays $369 a month to lease her car \u2014 a great deal in her view, given the benefits Honda is providing.\u201cI love never paying for fuel, and I probably will take advantage of the rental car coverage at some point,\u201d she said. \u201cI almost feel like they are paying me to own the car.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla, Reporting Bigger Loss, Emphasizes Gains in Production and Sales", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byThe electric-car maker Tesla said on Wednesday that its losses had widened in the first quarter, but that sales and revenues had grown rapidly as the company prepared for the critical launch of a mass-market model.The company said it lost $397 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $282 million in the same period a year earlier.The gains on the production side are being watched closely by investors and analysts who are seeking evidence that Tesla can meet its plans to begin manufacturing the Model 3, its first mass-market offering, this summer.Tesla shares were down 2.4 percent, to $303.50, in extended trading after the earnings announcement and Mr. Musk\u2019s conference call with analysts; they remain almost 70 percent above where they were five months ago.Analysts are hoping that Mr. Musk will focus more on incremental improvements in sales, production schedules and earnings than on long-term, big-picture goals geared toward promoting clean energy.Mr. Musk has pledged to begin producing the Model 3 this summer at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, Calif., which was once operated jointly by Toyota and General Motors.The Model 3 \u2014 a compact, electric car that is expected to sell for about $35,000 \u2014 is considered Tesla\u2019s pivotal product.The company has built intense loyalty and demand for its two luxury offerings, the Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle. Both cost more than $90,000 with options, and their appeal is limited to a small number of wealthy customers.The introduction of the Model 3, however, puts Tesla in the mainstream of the automotive market. And Mr. Musk has created high expectations not only for the car\u2019s performance and quality, but for its widespread availability.In the conference call with analysts, Mr. Musk said the company was moving quickly to further automate its assembly plant to include Model 3 production, and was hoping to build 5,000 vehicles a week by sometime this year.\u201cModel 3 will be roughly comparable to the best high-volume vehicle production lines in the world,\u201d he said.Anticipation for the new vehicle has caused some confusion among consumers that the Model 3 could be more technologically advanced than Tesla\u2019s current models.Mr. Musk declined to say whether orders for the Model S had fallen because buyers were waiting for the Model 3. But he underscored that the Model S would continue to set the brand\u2019s benchmark by offering its highest level of assisted-driving capability and other features.Industry analysts said the quarterly results were a secondary issue given the weight of expectations for the Model 3. \u201cA flawless launch of the Model 3 is critical to the company\u2019s future success,\u201d said Jack R. Nerad, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book.Mr. Musk said on the call that he was pleased with the company\u2019s quarterly results. \u201cWe are executing well,\u201d he said. Yet even as he updated investors on the progress of the Model 3, he was already looking ahead to plans to expand into electric pickups and heavy trucks.\u201cI am absolutely confident that electric vehicles will occupy every segment without exception,\u201d he said.Tesla expects to make 500,000 cars a year by 2018, with the Model 3 accounting for the bulk of the production. That translates into a fivefold increase in its manufacturing pace.Tesla is also dealing with growing pains in its labor force. Some production employees have accused the company of suppressing efforts to unionize its work force.Last month, the United Auto Workers \u2014 the union representing hourly workers at the three big Detroit automakers \u2014 filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board asserting that Tesla was trying to block its workers\u2019 organizing efforts.Tesla has said the allegations \u201care entirely without merit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Fires Former Google Engineer at Heart of Self-Driving Dispute", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber said Tuesday that it had fired Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer brought in to lead the company\u2019s self-driving automobile efforts who was accused of stealing trade secrets when he left a job at Google.What Mr. Levandowski did when he quit Google to start his own company, Otto, which was acquired by Uber for nearly $700 million last year, is the key question in a closely watched lawsuit that pits one of the world\u2019s most powerful companies against Uber, a richly financed up-and-comer.The stakes are enormous for both businesses. Google was a pioneer in autonomous car technology and has spent nearly a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars on its effort, which is now run through Waymo, a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. And Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has said the future of his ride-hailing company, privately valued at nearly $70 billion, hinges on work being done to create cars that can drive themselves.The dismissal of one of Uber\u2019s most prized technical talents also points to the risks of the star engineering culture that has emerged in Silicon Valley in recent years, leading to giant paydays for a small group of employees.Uber agreed to pay $680 million \u2014 mostly in company equity \u2014 in exchange for the company\u2019s technology and a team of experienced self-driving technology engineers. Mr. Levandowski and his staff would also be entitled to a small percentage of any profits earned from an Uber-owned, self-driving trucking business developed under Mr. Levandowski\u2019s direction.But just months after the acquisition, Waymo sued Uber in civil court, claiming that Uber was using trade secrets stolen from Google to develop Uber\u2019s self-driving vehicles \u2014 a plan Waymo alleges was aided by Mr. Levandowski.\u201cOver the last few months Uber has provided significant evidence to the court to demonstrate that our self-driving technology has been built independently,\u201d Angela L. Padilla, Uber\u2019s associate general counsel for employment and litigation, wrote in an email to employees. \u201cOver that same period, Uber has urged Anthony to fully cooperate in helping the court get to the facts and ultimately helping to prove our case.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe take our obligations under the court order very seriously, and so we have chosen to terminate his employment at Uber.\u201dJohnny Luu, a spokesman for Waymo, declined to comment.Uber had little choice but to cut ties with Mr. Levandowski, legal analysts said. The company risked being tarnished if it continued to stand by him, as if it were indirectly condoning his actions.\u201cI don\u2019t think this was an easy decision, but at the end of the day, Uber did what it had to do,\u201d said Elizabeth A. Rowe, a professor at the University of Florida\u2019s law school and an expert in trade secrets law.Firing Mr. Levandowski provides Uber \u201ca way to cut off liabilities potentially and highlights that they were not acting willfully,\u201d said Russell Beck, an intellectual property lawyer and founding partner at the Boston law firm Beck Reed Riden.But firing Mr. Levandowski could mean that he becomes a witness against Uber if he were to claim, for example, that Uber executives looked the other way while he used proprietary information from Waymo to advance Uber\u2019s self-driving car efforts. Uber has repeatedly said that it has developed its autonomous car technology on its own.\u201cIt makes it easier for Mr. Levandowski to cut a deal, because he\u2019s no longer associated with Uber,\u201d Ms. Rowe said.More grave for Mr. Levandowski are potential criminal charges. Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the Waymo versus Uber civil case, referred the matter to the United States attorney\u2019s office to look into possible theft of trade secrets. The action opened Mr. Levandowski \u2014 and perhaps Uber \u2014 to the possibility of criminal charges if the Justice Department decides to pursue the case.Miles Ehrlich, a lawyer for Mr. Levandowski, did not respond to phone and email requests for comment. Court transcripts show Mr. Levandowski\u2019s lawyers have advised him to assert his Fifth Amendment right.Engineers like Mr. Levandowski are part of a small pool in Silicon Valley with the specialized know-how to lead efforts on self-driving cars. Technology companies and traditional automakers alike are sometimes paying tens of millions of dollars per employee.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Mr. Levandowski, however, may not see his rich payday from Uber. He has been employed at Uber for less than a year and none of his shares have vested, according to a person familiar with the terms of the agreement, nor has he met certain project milestones determined at the time of acquisition. Typically, shares in Uber reach vested status over a multiyear period.Uber will also face hardship as a result of the dismissal. Mr. Levandowski, who has dedicated his entire professional life to the study and development of robotics and self-driving research, was integral to nearly every component of the company\u2019s autonomous operations.Eric Meyhofer, a former deputy of Mr. Levandowski, will lead the autonomous vehicle project, overseeing hundreds of engineers working in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and soon in Toronto.Uber has also experienced a string of executives departing, including Jeff Jones, president of the company\u2019s ride-sharing operations, and Amit Singhal, the senior vice president for engineering, who left after accusations of sexual harassment while working at Google were unearthed shortly after he started at Uber.This week, Josh Mohrer, a general manager at Uber who had been embroiled in controversy, left to join a venture firm. And the results of an investigation into Uber\u2019s companywide culture are expected to be delivered to the company\u2019s board of directors on Wednesday.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Pedro, Calif.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Moves to Trim Its Ranks as Its Chief Faces a Test", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 It was not long ago that Ford Motor was considered the healthiest of the Detroit automakers.Unlike General Motors and Chrysler, Ford survived the financial crisis that began in 2007 without the help of bankruptcy or a government bailout, and had appeared well positioned to take advantage of the booming American auto market.But investors have taken a more pessimistic view, raising questions about the leadership of its chief executive, Mark Fields.Ford\u2019s stock has declined about 40 percent since Mr. Fields took over three years ago, and 10 percent since Jan. 1, even as the overall market has risen. And with profits slipping, Ford is under pressure to engineer a turnaround \u2014 starting with Wednesday\u2019s announcement that it would cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia.The cutbacks are relatively small given Ford\u2019s global work force of 202,000. Yet it appears to be just the beginning of a long retrenchment for the nation\u2019s No. 2 car company, and a critical test for Mr. Fields and his strategy to vault Ford into the high-tech race to develop self-driving cars and electric vehicles.\u201cI think Ford is in a tough spot,\u201d said David Whiston, an analyst with the investment firm Morningstar. \u201cThere\u2019s no one or two silver bullets that will make the stock rally.\u201dCutting costs while investing in advanced technology is, indeed, a difficult balancing act. Ford is trimming salaried employees, G.M. is cutting production shifts at some factories and Fiat Chrysler has idled plants that make passenger cars. Automakers have also increased discounts to move bulging inventories of unsold models.Ford, for its part, is tamping down expectations for its all-important North American division, which accounts for a vast majority of its profits. The company\u2019s earnings fell more than 30 percent in the first quarter, and Mr. Fields has said the full-year results will also be down from 2016.But it is proving hard to sell Ford shareholders on diminished results in the short term, while the company continues to invest heavily in future technology \u2014 particularly when it is competing with Silicon Valley heavyweights like Google on self-driving research.Some analysts have suggested that Mr. Fields should be bolder in remaking the company by reducing its car lineup further \u2014 and possibly getting out of the unprofitable small-car business entirely.But most have generally supported Ford\u2019s twin-barreled approach. Brian Johnson of Barclays, for example, said the company\u2019s strategy was sound, and contrasted its \u201cunsplashy\u201d actions with the stock-market hype surrounding the upstart electric carmaker Tesla.\u201cAs opposed to making Twitter claims around full autonomy and electric trucks, Ford has an underappreciated strategy toward electrification and autonomy,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote in a research note.The anticipation for Tesla\u2019s future has helped it pass Ford and G.M. in market value, even though it makes a fraction of the cars that Ford produces. And Tesla already has two distinct electric cars on the road, while Ford is limited to selling niche, battery-powered versions of conventional models.The business pressures add up to a moment of truth for Mr. Fields. His predecessor, Alan R. Mulally, was given credit for steering Ford through the recession and simplifying its product lineup through his \u201cOne Ford\u201d strategy. Much of Ford\u2019s emphasis during his tenure was on smaller, fuel-efficient passenger cars, which have since lost favor with customers because of low gas prices.And while G.M. and Chrysler floundered with high costs, shifting strategies, and constant turnover of senior executives, Ford seemed a model of consistency.\u201cThe One Ford plan was an elegant and powerful blueprint that became the mantra of the firm\u2019s reinvention from the last crisis,\u201d said Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere are important lessons here.\u201dMr. Fields is clearly trying to sharpen his focus after an extended board meeting last week. William C. Ford Jr., Ford\u2019s chairman, admitted at the company\u2019s recent annual meeting that he was frustrated by the stock price.The first sign of how Mr. Fields is responding to the drumbeat of negative news came on Wednesday, when the company said it would offer early retirement packages and buyouts to 10 percent of salaried workers in certain business units in North America and Asia.Those separation packages, however, do not include employees in product development, information technology and the company\u2019s Ford Credit arm. The company said factory jobs were also unaffected.The cutbacks are aimed at \u201creducing costs and becoming as lean and efficient as possible,\u201d the company said in a statement. At the same time, Ford said it was committed to \u201cinvesting aggressively, but prudently\u201d in new operations devoted to future technology.Ford is holding its own in selling truck and sport-utility vehicles, but it has big problems in passenger-car segments, where sales have plunged almost 25 percent so far this year.By comparison, sales of cars at Toyota and G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet division are down only about 11 percent during the same period.One analyst said Ford\u2019s cars were older in comparison to its rivals, and need to be updated to better compete. \u201cThe Fusion was pretty cutting edge when it was redesigned in 2013, but now it looks dated,\u201d said the analyst, Jessica Caldwell of the auto-research site Edmunds.Ford also has a big hole in the subcompact S.U.V. segment, and has gained little traction in the market from its hybrid gas-electric models.The larger issue is whether Mr. Fields could tinker with the current strategy enough to convince investors that Ford has a bright future.Those investments were intended to help Mr. Fields reach an ambitious goal. Last summer, speaking at Ford\u2019s research center in Silicon Valley, he vowed that the company would begin mass producing a self-driving car \u2014 with no steering wheel and no pedals \u2014 by 2021.Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Neal E.

Instead, it is for a sleek battery the size of a mini-fridge that will allow homeowners to take better advantage of the energy their solar power systems produce, whether to cut costs or to maintain a steady source of electricity during power failures.Mercedes has been selling the batteries in Europe and South Africa this year, but its partnership with Vivint, announced Thursday, represents its entrance into the United States market.The combination, said Boris von Bormann, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Energy Americas, will allow customers \u201cto take the next step toward a sustainable energy future.\u201dTo the companies, along with rivals like Tesla and other solar installers that have joined forces with battery providers, that future involves tracts of software-enabled homes with solar panels on their roofs feeding batteries that can charge electric vehicles and power lighting and appliances at times when drawing from the grid is costliest.In some states, like California, where Mercedes and Vivint will first focus their efforts, the economic equation is beginning to make sense, investors and analysts say. But in many other states, potential customers may be driven more by emotion \u2014 like feeling environmentally responsible or self-sufficient \u2014 than by cost savings.\u201cEverybody\u2019s adding an energy-storage offering one way or another,\u201d said Shayle Kann, who leads GTM Research, which tracks the solar industry. \u201cSolar plus energy storage at the residential level is almost definitely the future, but it isn\u2019t yet the present.\u201dFor solar companies, battery storage may provide a lift in a market whose dizzying pace of growth has suddenly slowed, especially for leading installers like SolarCity and Vivint, which both reduced their installation estimates amid corporate upheaval, and Sungevity, which went bankrupt.At the same time, policy changes and proposals reducing incentives in Arizona, Indiana and other states have dimmed the prospects of rooftop solar. And in two leading markets \u2014 California and Hawaii \u2014 new rates, incentives and rules are pushing customers to obtain batteries along with the solar panels.For the automakers, adding solar to the mix allows them to market themselves and their electric vehicles as even more environmentally friendly.\u201cThe electric-car story is good \u2014 it\u2019s better than internal combustion from an environmental point of view \u2014 but electric cars powered by solar: That\u2019s kind of nirvana from an environmental perspective,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book.Although customer adoption of electric cars has been slow, the industry is poised to accelerate, with additional lower-priced, longer-range cars on the horizon, Mr. Brauer said. And although Mercedes is mainly a luxury brand in the United States, offering a home power system allows the company to tie itself to environmentally friendly cars in general, and to position itself as being \u201cnot just about the car but the entire infrastructure that supports the car,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.At Vivint Solar, said David Bywater, the chief executive, surveys indicated that at least half of the company\u2019s customers were looking for storage along with their solar arrays. \u201cWe think with this ecosystem and how it\u2019s evolving, this is a crucial component,\u201d he said.Mr. Bywater met Mr. von Bormann at the beginning of the year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and the partnership grew from there. The battery systems are made up of 2.5-kilowatt-hour modular batteries that can be combined in systems up to 20 kilowatt-hours, enough to run a typical refrigerator for a week.Vivint plans to use its regular sales force, which largely goes door to door, to market the batteries. Mercedes has no plans to offer Vivint solar systems through its car dealerships, Mr. von Bormann said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Uber and Waymo Ended Up Rivals in the Race for Driverless Cars", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported bySo Mr. Kalanick spent much of 2015 raiding Google\u2019s engineering corps. To learn about the technology, he struck up a friendship with Anthony Levandowski, a top autonomous vehicle engineer at \u201cG-co,\u201d Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pet name for Google.The friendship developed into a partnership. Mr. Levandowski left Google last year to form Otto, a self-driving trucking start-up. Uber acquired it months later for nearly $700 million. Mr. Kalanick subsequently appointed Mr. Levandowski to run Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicle research.The implications are set to reverberate far beyond the courtroom. Any setback for Uber will shake up the driverless car industry, which is locked in a bitter race to introduce and commercialize autonomous cars. Silicon Valley tech titans and Detroit automakers are making huge investments \u2014 bets that autonomous vehicle technology will usher in a new age of how people get around. For some companies, especially traditional carmakers, their very survival is at stake.That aggressiveness has spurred an intense rivalry with Waymo. Waymo\u2019s legal pursuit of Uber and Mr. Levandowski is out of corporate character; Google has tended to refrain from suing former employees who move to competitors. Many at Google and Waymo are incensed at Mr. Levandowski and how he may have betrayed them for a rich payday, according to current and former employees.\u201cThis is a race where every single minute seems to count,\u201d said Carl W. Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, who has followed the Waymo-Uber case.Uber and Waymo declined to comment for this article.Uber and Google once considered each other allies. Google\u2019s venture capital arm, now known as GV, spotted Uber\u2019s potential early and invested more than $200 million in the fledgling ride-hailing network in 2013.David Drummond, then Google\u2019s chief legal counsel and an early Uber enthusiast, took a seat on Uber\u2019s board. At one point, Google promoted Uber as a transportation option in the Google Maps app, and Uber drivers relied on Google Maps.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.But the relationship crumbled as the two companies\u2019 paths converged. Google began testing its own car-pooling service inside Waze, a mapping app it owns. Uber eventually moved away from relying solely on Google Maps.Around then, the friendship between Mr. Levandowski and Mr. Kalanick deepened, according to people close to both men. After \u201cjam sessions\u201d between the two \u2014 essentially brainstorming meetings where they would walk and talk over the future of driving \u2014 Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pedometer would clock in with thousands of steps.Both men had little love for Google. Mr. Levandowski had grown impatient with the pace at Google\u2019s self-driving car unit, which was suffering from infighting and had been slow to move forward with some of its plans, according to two people familiar with Mr. Levandowski.Mr. Kalanick, meanwhile, had realized the growing threat from Google. Uber\u2019s reliance on Google Maps was making him nervous, especially after Google started \u201crate-limiting\u201d Uber\u2019s use of the service, asking Uber to pay for access over time.Mr. Kalanick also had a personal ax to grind with Mr. Brin. The night before the 2014 tech conference, Mr. Kalanick received a call from Mr. Drummond, who said Mr. Brin might raise the possibility of Google\u2019s dabbling in the ride-hailing market onstage the next day \u2014 a way to monetize autonomous vehicles \u2014 according to three people familiar with the conversation. Google stopped short of saying it planned to introduce such a service, but Mr. Brin showed Google\u2019s self-driving car.Mr. Kalanick was shocked at what he saw as a potential strike against Uber, according to people with knowledge of the event. He and Mr. Brin were supposed to clear the air at a private dinner that evening, but they spoke only briefly. After Mr. Brin\u2019s presentation, Mr. Kalanick later called Mr. Drummond to vent for what he considered an unexpected ambush from a friend and partner.In February of this year, Waymo sued Uber. Uber had crossed the line, Waymo said in legal documents, with Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up created as a way for Uber to steal trade secrets and copy its designs for lidar \u2014 short for light detection and ranging, a crucial hardware component in an autonomous vehicle.Before Mr. Levandowski left Google, Waymo claimed, he and other Google staff members who would become Otto employees took thousands of files of research, as well as valuable supplier lists, manufacturing details and other technical information. Mr. Levandowski then tried to cover his tracks, according to the complaint, wiping his laptop\u2019s hard drive of its data.The behavior could be traced to December 2015, Waymo said. At the time, Mr. Levandowski searched Google\u2019s network for login details for a document repository for the autonomous vehicle program, whose code name was \u201cChauffeur.\u201d He then installed software that let him download 9.7 gigabytes of data on Google\u2019s driverless car program. A few days later, Mr. Levandowski put a memory card into his laptop for eight hours, according to Waymo.Waymo discovered the deception inadvertently when it was copied on an email from a supplier, with drawings of Uber\u2019s design for its lidar. The designs bore a \u201cstriking resemblance\u201d to Waymo\u2019s designs, the company said.\u201cOtto and Uber have taken Waymo\u2019s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time and expense of independently developing their own technology,\u201d Waymo said in its lawsuit.On Monday, the federal judge in the case said Waymo had shown \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that Mr. Levandowski \u201cdownloaded over 14,000 confidential files before leaving the company.\u201d He ordered Uber to return any files to Waymo. The judge had separately referred the case to the United States attorney\u2019s office, raising the possibility of criminal charges for those involved.The case is headed to trial this year, but Mr. Levandowski is planning a break from the legal action. He and Eric Meyhofer, another Uber self-driving car executive, are discussing a trip to Indiana, according to two people familiar with the plans. There they intend to watch the Indianapolis 500 over Memorial Day weekend.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Future of European Transit: Driverless and Utilitarian", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byOn the outskirts of Berlin, Michael Barill\u00e8re-Scholz is testing a driverless vehicle that is neither sleek nor futuristic. The machine is boxy and painted white. Its top speed barely reaches 20 miles per hour.The self-driving vehicle is a shuttle with room for 12 passengers. Mr. Barill\u00e8re-Scholz, who leads the driverless research team at Deutsche Bahn, Germany\u2019s largest train and bus operator, and his team have been testing the vehicle around a local office park. Later this year, the partly state-owned public transit company will also begin separate trials of a similar autonomous bus on public roads in southern Germany, connecting a local train station with stops along a predetermined route.\u201cWe want to show that autonomous cars don\u2019t have to be limited to luxury consumer vehicles, they also have a role in public transport,\u201d Mr. Barill\u00e8re-Scholz said. \u201cThe market in Germany for this type of vehicle is huge.\u201dThe coming age of driverless cars has typically centered on Silicon Valley highfliers like Tesla, Uber and Google, which have showcased their autonomous driving technology in luxury sedans and sport utility vehicles costing $100,000 or more. But across Europe, fledgling driverless projects like those by Deutsche Bahn are instead focused on utilitarian self-driving vehicles for mass transit that barely exceed walking pace.Forgoing the latest automotive trends of aerodynamics and style, European transportation groups and city planners are instead aiming to connect these unglamorous driverless vehicles to existing public transportation networks of subways and buses. The goal is to eventually offer on-demand driverless services to those who cannot afford the latest expensive offerings from Tesla and others.While cities in the United States \u2014 including Ann Arbor, Mich., and Las Vegas \u2014 have tested some of these mass transit driverless vehicles, Europe is a particular hotbed of this activity. That is because of the region\u2019s densely packed urban areas and decades-old and widely used public transit systems, which often include subways, trains and buses.In total, more than 20 pilot or existing public transport programs have taken place in Europe involving autonomous vehicles, according to a review by The New York Times. Most of these projects have received government funding, tapping into local research institutions and tech start-ups that are not household names.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.For those who dream of owning a sleek driverless vehicle of the future, this generation of autonomous public shuttles \u2014 often half the length of a traditional bus with capacity for less than a dozen people \u2014 will not set hearts racing. Though they include much of the high-tech sensors and gadgetry required for autonomous driving, the vehicles are designed for functionality rather than speed and style.Unlike the driverless trials from Uber and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo, which aim to bring autonomous vehicles to personal transport, a focus on self-driving public transit is a significantly easier challenge. That is because these autonomous vehicles are often limited to operating in the \u201clast mile,\u201d to existing public transit, or smaller distances on often well-traveled routes. That reduces the complexity required to make the machines navigate across an entire city.In London, city planners conducted a three-week trial in April involving a self-driving electric shuttle moving slowly around a well-defined three-mile route on mostly private roads. Nick Reed, the project\u2019s coordinator, said that by offering people autonomous connections to the British capital\u2019s existing transportation network, his team was helping the city to meet public demand without having to invest millions, if not billions, in traditional subways or buses.Not all of the autonomous vehicles being tested for public transport in Europe are glamour-free.In December, Carlo Ratti, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, stood on the banks of a picturesque canal in Amsterdam to test his team\u2019s latest contraption: a driverless boat.Mr. Ratti\u2019s goal is to bring a fleet of these driverless boats to the Dutch city by the end of the decade, where they will be used to ferry people and goods around Amsterdam\u2019s miles of canals. If everything goes to plan, the researcher also hopes the autonomous boats will be able to automatically dock with each other, creating on-demand bridges and walkways whenever necessary.\u201cThere are rivers and waterfronts in most cities, so the applications are quite wide,\u201d said Mr. Ratti, whose team is split between Amsterdam and Boston, where they use a university swimming pool to try out their latest version of the Roboat. \u201cNot many people have looked at self-driving boats.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2017 Could Prove to Be a Turning Point for Plug-In Hybrids", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byWheelsUntil recently, if you wanted to ditch your gas guzzler and go electric, there were few choices. You could take the high road and opt for a $70,000 luxury vehicle, like the Tesla Model S, or take the low road and choose a more modest commuter, like the $31,000 Nissan Leaf.But this year, all that appears to be changing.More and more, plug-in hybrid models will go head-to-head with different versions of the same car. The current Kia Niro, for example, a hybrid that relies on a gas engine and braking to recharge its battery, will compete later this year with a plug-in hybrid sibling, with similar features and amenities including luggage space \u2014 and with a price to match, around $23,000.\u201cWe want to be price-neutral for the consumer,\u201d said Steve Kosowski, long-range strategy manager for Kia Motors America. \u201cWhen you walk into the showroom, it should be, why wouldn\u2019t you buy this one?\u201dSome of the pricing parity relates to economies of scale.\u201cBattery prices have decreased by 70 percent over the last six years,\u201d said Simon Mui, a director at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.\u201cThe strategy is to make the latest S-550e plug-in the same price as the V8 counterpart,\u201d said Paul La Penta, a supervisor in electromobility at Mercedes-Benz.\u201cThe biggest benefit of these cars is the torque,\u201d said Frank Wiesmann, a spokesman for Porsche, referring to the superiority of electric motors in delivering an initial boost from a standing start. \u201cWith electric help, it\u2019s faster to 60 m.p.h. and delivers a higher top speed.\u201dAfter voicing support for the federal standards, the biggest car companies have recently appealed to President Trump to loosen the fuel economy targets.\u201cThere\u2019s a Jekyll-and-Hyde component to automakers,\u201d Mr. Mui said. \u201cEngineers say, yes. Lobbyists say, no, don\u2019t make us do this. They are conflicted.\u201dBut like a supertanker under full power, the electrification ship may be too hard to turn around. In interviews with car company representatives, the most often repeated responses to questions regarding the easing of current regulations were: \u201cWe like to plan long term\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re a global company.\u201dIt takes several years to design and build a new car, and many electric vehicles are already in development. General Motors representatives stressed that the automotive industry was a long-term, capital-intensive business. Kia said it was already investing $10.2 billion over five years on vehicles ranging from plug-in hybrids to those running on fuel cells.Other car markets, such as China, are offering their own incentives to encourage electrics and plug-in hybrids, regardless of what happens in the United States.\u201cWe want to demonstrate several different powertrains in the same market,\u201d said Steve Center of Honda\u2019s environmental business development office. Such models often offer plug-in and pure electric versions, as well as hydrogen fuel-cell options. These are no longer combustion engine models simply retrofitted with electric motors, nor are they impractical experimental vehicles.\u201cNow, we\u2019re developing the plug-in version right from the beginning,\u201d Mr. La Penta of Mercedes said.Indeed, automakers across the board are hoping that plug-in hybrids prove to be the gateway to fully electric vehicles. While the electric-only range of plug-in vehicles can be modest at best \u2014 Mercedes\u2019s S-Class plug-in hybrid can go only 13 miles solely under electric power \u2014 it is improving. When the Chevy Volt was introduced in late 2010, it could travel only 35 miles before having to rely on gas. This year\u2019s model can go 53 miles without having to switch over.As drivers become more comfortable with these cars, the thinking goes, the anxiety over having to recharge electric vehicles\u2019 batteries every day will lessen.Electric-only vehicles are also improving their range. The electric version of the Kia Soul has a 93-mile range while the Chevy Bolt has a 238-mile range.According to G.M., a 40-mile range should meet the needs of about 80 percent of American drivers. But the psychological barrier still exists. Fred Ligouri, a Chevrolet spokesman, said that 200 miles on a single charge seemed to satisfy most consumers. Hence, cars like the Tesla Model S and Chevy Bolt are seen as breaking the range-anxiety barrier.When analysts look back, 2017 may turn out to be the tipping point in popularizing plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles. Companies are promising more to come. Porsche says it plans to introduce an electric sports car that can go 300 miles on a single charge by the end of the decade. And Tesla is expected to announce plans for the first production all-electric truck this fall.When Chevrolet introduced the plug-in Volt more than seven years ago, it received considerable press criticism for failing to meet high expectations. The question is, with so many companies now following in its footsteps, does it feel vindicated?\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on being first,\u201d Mr. Ligouri said. \u201cBut we showed there\u2019s customer demand for this.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford, Trudging Into the Future, Ousts Mark Fields as C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byDEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 Ford Motor was the American automaker savvy enough to avoid bankruptcy when industry sales collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis. Then it rode economic recovery and cheap gasoline to record sales and profits. But what looks like success can turn upside down quickly in Detroit these days.The latest evidence came Monday when Ford ousted its chief executive, Mark Fields, after only three years in the job. Mr. Fields had failed to persuade investors and his own board that the company was moving fast enough to develop the vehicles of the future, like battery-powered cars that drive themselves.Industry stalwarts such as Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen are no longer the only automotive trendsetters. Now they share that distinction with interlopers from the tech world like Google, Apple, Uber and not least Tesla, the electric-car maker now valued more highly than any of the Detroit giants.The upheaval at Ford, the nation\u2019s No. 2 automaker by sales, after G.M., reflects the challenges that lie ahead for companies that cannot adapt to that new landscape fast enough.\u201cOur world has changed dramatically,\u201d said William C. Ford Jr., Ford\u2019s chairman and great-grandson of its founder. \u201cLook at the pace of change and the competitors coming into our space, and we need to match or beat that.\u201dMr. Fields, a 28-year veteran of Ford, was a victim of rapidly evolving expectations for carmakers that for decades had been judged on how many vehicles they could manufacture and sell at a profit.Mr. Hackett, 62, made his reputation as the head of Steelcase, an office-furniture maker based in Michigan. There, he built credibility in Silicon Valley for adapting workplaces to fit the needs of legions of computer programmers and other tech workers.Since last year, he has been in the middle of the automotive revolution as the head of Ford\u2019s nascent division devoted to autonomous vehicles and new forms of personal mobility like ride-hailing services.When he was introduced as chief executive on Monday, Mr. Hackett defended the company\u2019s commitment to self-driving technology. \u201cI would challenge that idea that we are not moving fast on mobility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve mapped out a path that gives us a lot of opportunity.\u201dOne of Mr. Hackett\u2019s first tasks will be to demonstrate that progress, and change perceptions that Ford is behind not only Tesla and Google but also traditional rivals like G.M. that are testing prototypes of autonomous cars.Mr. Fields, for his part, had been under pressure for months from Ford\u2019s board to sharpen the company\u2019s strategy on future technologies and reverse what had been a 40 percent drop in its stock price since 2014.He also became embroiled in controversy over a $1.6 billion plant the company was planning to build in Mexico to assemble small cars.When President Trump was campaigning for the Republican nomination and criticizing American companies for moving factories to Mexico, Mr. Fields defended the company\u2019s expansion plans there. But once Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Fields was forced to backtrack, and he ultimately canceled the project.Mr. Ford also felt the need to step in and smooth the testy relationship by speaking directly to Mr. Trump. While it hardly affected Ford\u2019s overall performance, the Mexico episode may have distracted Mr. Fields from corporate issues.And with the American auto market starting to decline after peaking last year, Ford\u2019s profits were also dropping \u2014 more than 30 percent in the first quarter alone.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.By Friday, the company\u2019s directors had had enough, authorizing Mr. Ford to ask Mr. Fields to retire and paving the way for Mr. Hackett\u2019s ascension to the top of the company.Industry analysts viewed the decision as a wake-up call for the company, as well as any other automaker lagging in the high-tech race toward driverless cars.\u201cGiven how rapidly the transportation sector is expected to transform in the next decade, Ford can\u2019t afford to be behind the eight ball when it comes to emerging technology,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the auto-research website Edmunds.com.But it will not be easy. Mr. Ford and Mr. Hackett concede that Ford has been underperforming in some of the core parts of its business, in particular its sales of passenger cars.Investors reacted favorably to the Ford shake-up, with its shares gaining more than 2 percent on the day and closing at $11.10. But Wall Street analysts said the transformation to a leaner, more tech-focused company could come at a price.\u201cThe earnings situation may need to get materially worse before it gets better,\u201d Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a research note on Monday.And even a stronger emphasis on new technology will not immediately close the gap between Ford and its competitors that are developing self-driving equipment.Traditional automakers have focused mostly on lower levels of automated driving where the car handles specific tasks, such as braking and cruise control.Some tech companies, on the other hand, are pushing relentlessly toward higher levels of driverless capability.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Google is miles ahead of other tech companies in the space right now,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, a transportation specialist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut automakers have been working a long time on lower-level, connected automated vehicles.\u201dThe best solution for some carmakers may be to align themselves with tech firms to share costs and accelerate development.Auto companies, however, are not yet pursuing full-scale partnerships with Silicon Valley. Instead, they are competing to hire software engineers to develop their own expertise as well as buying start-up firms to augment their research.While car companies are reluctant to give up control in the development of any of their vehicles, they may be forced to seek broader, long-term alliances with Silicon Valley on driverless models.\u201cWhat we may end up seeing is partnerships that could really benefit all players,\u201d Ms. Shaheen said.In Ford\u2019s case, the company has to maintain a fine balance between building quality cars and trucks for consumers in every region of the world and beefing up its commitment to self-driving technology.Mr. Hackett says he knows the automaker cannot ask for unlimited patience from investors eager to see more progress. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re dealing with the future,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s ambiguous \u2014 until you prove it.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Neal E.

Not that here\u2019s a whole lot \u2014 we\u2019re in the spring doldrums. Everybody has one foot in vacation, so basically very little is happening in the industry we cover.If he is running for office (maybe, probably, not) then we still have no idea what his platform would be. I saw some people tweeting (cough, Mike) that it seemed as though he wanted to say more. I think this seemed pretty standard for Zuckerberg, in that he limits his public comments to what will offend the least number of people. It would be fascinating to see him take a strong political stance.At this point, Facebook arguably has the wealth and political sway of a medium-size country (in which Zuckerberg never has to worry about getting re-elected). It\u2019s standing at the center of a lot, and yet its users rarely get insight into what its managers are thinking about the world.But I wonder if the car companies are getting a little too paranoid about self-driving tech. I think the tech will come, but it is, at best, in the research stage now, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how many years it will take to go mainstream. I suspect we\u2019re at the top of the hype cycle right now, and soon we\u2019ll all begin to see the limits of self-driving \u2014 and the story will change to one of pessimism rather than optimism. What do you think?All that being said, I think the technology is inevitable, at least here in the U.S. It\u2019s going to be a long time until the developing world sees the widespread use of self-driving cars.Last year, when I was in Indonesia, I spoke to Google engineers about how hard it is to get accurate maps in much of the rest of the world, where streets don\u2019t really have standard names, and directions are given through landmarks, rather than blocks and feet. Until they sort that out, I can\u2019t see self-driving cars realistically getting rolled out.I like to go through life assuming that everything \u2014 from my Facebook messages to my emails and photos \u2014 will one day get hacked into. If I don\u2019t want it public, I don\u2019t write it down, photograph it, or otherwise save it to any system that is hooked up to the big bad world through the internet. I\u2019m willing to accept that I\u2019m paranoid, but the way that the rate and scale of hackings are exponentially increasing, I think it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.To me, the big issue is that the rules of the game are changing. Nation states are experimenting more with what they can get away with in the world of cyberespionage, disinformation campaigns and overall mischief-making online.

And that could cause headaches down the road for investors and for the stock market as a whole.Apple shares, among the most widely held in the world, hit a new record on Friday, yet the company\u2019s sales have been so-so and no new game-changing gadgets other than a revamped iPhone are in sight.In a nutshell, after a stumble in 2016, Apple started to grow again late in the year and continued to do so in the first three months of this one, but not by much. Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier \u2014 a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won\u2019t restore Apple\u2019s old reputation as a paradigmatic \u201cgrowth company.\u201dYet Apple\u2019s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what\u2019s the problem? It is simply that Apple\u2019s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone.A major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers?It may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple\u2019s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I\u2019m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados, though I\u2019m not one of them. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years.\u201cApple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it\u2019s not growing much. It\u2019s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.\u201dOn Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple\u2019s already colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion.In the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other American company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S & P Dow Jones Indices.But there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced on Tuesday that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp.In a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple\u2019s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple\u2019s shares and total value, Apple\u2019s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple\u2019s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise).Furthermore, in the next two years, Mr. Maestri said, the company intends \u201cto return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.\u201dAll of which is to say that if Apple\u2019s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors.The fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Mr. Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company.Apple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know how much we need to invest in the business,\u201d Mr. Maestri said in the conference call. \u201cWe will never underinvest in the business. We\u2019re in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple\u2019s shares, which are now trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because \u201cwe\u2019ve found that Apple\u2019s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.\u201d Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said.Like Mr. Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. \u201cThe company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it\u2019s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive.Mr. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view. Back in February, when Apple shares were still trading at $130, he calculated Apple\u2019s value based on metrics like cash flow and declared that the company was \u201cfully deserving of its market value.\u201d But when the stock price reached $140, he sold his own shares. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great company,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the price.\u201dIt isn\u2019t a crazy price, not if you expect that Apple will remain disciplined and highly profitable and, maybe, even have another growth spurt next year. But unless the old Apple magic returns, the company right now is not a bargain.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World Is Getting Hacked. Why Don\u2019t We Do More to Stop It?", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported byThe path to a global outbreak on Friday of a ransom-demanding computer software (\u201cransomware\u201d) that crippled hospitals in Britain \u2014 forcing the rerouting of ambulances, delays in surgeries and the shutdown of diagnostic equipment \u2014 started, as it often does, with a defect in software, a bug. This is perhaps the first salvo of a global crisis that has been brewing for decades. Fixing this is possible, but it will be expensive and require a complete overhaul of how technology companies, governments and institutions operate and handle software. The alternative should be unthinkable.Just this March, Microsoft released a patch to fix vulnerabilities in its operating systems, which run on about 80 percent of desktop computers globally. Shortly after that, a group called \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d released hacking tools that took advantage of vulnerabilities that had already been fixed in these patches.It seemed that Shadow Brokers had acquired tools the National Security Agency had used to break into computers. Realizing these tools were stolen, the N.S.A. had warned affected companies like Microsoft and Cisco so they could fix the vulnerabilities. Users were protected if they had applied the patches that were released, but with a catch: If an institution still used an older Microsoft operating system, it did not receive this patch unless it paid for an expensive \u201ccustom\u201d support agreement.The cash-strapped National Health Service in Britain, which provides health care to more than 50 million people, and whose hospitals still use Windows XP widely, was not among those that signed up to purchase the custom support from Microsoft.They were out in the cold.On May 12, a massive \u201cransomware\u201d attack using one of those vulnerabilities hit hospitals in Britain, telecommunication companies in Spain, FedEx in the United States, the Russian Interior Ministry and many other institutions around the world. They had either not applied these patches to systems where it was available for free, or had not paid the extra money for older ones.Computer after computer froze, their files inaccessible, with an ominous onscreen message asking for about $300 worth of \u201cbitcoin\u201d \u2014 a cryptocurrency that allows for hard-to-trace transfers of money. Ambulances headed for children\u2019s hospitals were diverted. Doctors were unable to check on patients\u2019 allergies or see what drugs they were taking. Labs, X-rays and diagnostic machinery and information became inaccessible. Surgeries were postponed. There was economic damage, too. Renault, the European automaker, had to halt production.The attack was halted by a stroke of luck: the ransomware had a kill switch that a British employee in a cybersecurity firm managed to activate. Shortly after, Microsoft finally released for free the patch that they had been withholding from users that had not signed up for expensive custom support agreements.But the crisis is far from over. This particular vulnerability still lives in unpatched systems, and the next one may not have a convenient kill switch.This isn\u2019t all Microsoft\u2019s fault though. Its newer operating systems, like Windows 10, are much more secure. There are many more players and dimensions to this ticking bomb.During this latest ransomware crisis, it became clear there were many institutions that could have patched or upgraded their systems, but they had not. This isn\u2019t just because their information technology departments are incompetent (though there are surely cases of that, too). Upgrades come with many downsides that make people reluctant to install them.For example, the more secure Windows 10 comes with so many privacy concerns that the Electronic Frontier Foundation issued numerous alerts about it, and the European Union is still investigating it. My current Windows 10 machine is more secure but it advertises to me in the login screen. (Are they also profiling me to target advertisements? A fair question in this environment.)Further, upgrades almost always bring unwanted features. When I was finally forced to upgrade my Outlook mail program, it took me months to get used to the new color scheme and spacing somebody in Seattle had decided was the new look. There was no option to keep things as is. Users hate this, and often are rightfully reluctant to upgrade. But they are often unaware that these unwanted features come bundled with a security update.As an added complication, the ways companies communicate about upgrades and unilaterally change the user interface make people vulnerable to phishing, since one is never sure what is a real login or upgrade message and what is a bogus one, linking to a fake website trying to steal a login.The next crisis facing us is the so-called \u201cinternet of things\u201d: devices like baby monitors, refrigerators and lighting now come with networked software. Many such devices are terribly insecure and, worse, don\u2019t even have a mechanism for receiving updates. In the current regulatory environment, the people who write the insecure software and the companies who sold the \u201cthings\u201d bear no liability.If I have painted a bleak picture, it is because things are bleak. Our software evolves by layering new systems on old, and that means we have constructed entire cities upon crumbling swamps. And we live on the fault lines where more earthquakes are inevitable. All the key actors have to work together, and fast.At a minimum, Microsoft clearly should have provided the critical update in March to all its users, not just those paying extra. Indeed, \u201cpay extra money to us or we will withhold critical security updates\u201d can be seen as its own form of ransomware. In its defense, Microsoft probably could point out that its operating systems have come a long way in security since Windows XP, and it has spent a lot of money updating old software, even above industry norms. However, industry norms are lousy to horrible, and it is reasonable to expect a company with a dominant market position, that made so much money selling software that runs critical infrastructure, to do more.Microsoft should spend more of that $100 billion to help institutions and users upgrade to newer software, especially those who run essential services on it. This has to be through a system that incentivizes institutions and people to upgrade to more secure systems and does not force choosing between privacy and security. Security updates should only update security, and everything else should be optional and unbundled.The United States government has resources and institutions to help fix this. N.S.A.\u2019s charter gives it a dual role: both offensive and defensive. That the agency discloses software vulnerabilities it finds to companies more quickly may be a good idea, but doing so doesn\u2019t solve this problem, since finding bugs is not limited to the N.S.A. \u2014 criminals and other nations can keep finding them. Nor are bugs in limited supply, so we cannot get to the bottom of the problem by fixing them one by one. There are, however, many technical measures that can be taken to build operating systems that are structurally less vulnerable to bugs. In other words, we can\u2019t eliminate bugs, but with careful design, we can make it so that they cannot easily wreak havoc like this. For example, Chromebooks and Apple\u2019s iOS are structurally much more secure because they were designed from the ground up with security in mind, unlike Microsoft\u2019s operating systems.It is past time that the N.S.A. shifted to a defensive posture and the United States government focused on protecting its citizens and companies from malware, hacking and ransomware \u2014 rather than focusing so much on spying. This isn\u2019t just about disclosing vulnerabilities, a hot-button topic that often distracts from deeper issues. It also means helping develop standards for higher security \u2014 something an agency devoted to finding weaknesses is very well suited to do \u2014 as well as identifying systemic cybersecurity risks and then helping fix them, rather than using them offensively, to spy on others.There is also the thorny problem of finding money and resources to upgrade critical infrastructure without crippling it. Many institutions see information technology as an afterthought and are slow in upgrading and investing. Governments also do not prioritize software security. This is a sure road to disaster.As a reminder of what is at stake, ambulances carrying sick children were diverted and heart patients turned away from surgery in Britain by the ransomware attack. Those hospitals may never get their data back. The last big worm like this, Conficker, infected millions of computers in almost 200 countries in 2008. We are much more dependent on software for critical functions today, and there is no guarantee there will be a kill switch next time.It is time to consider whether the current regulatory setup, which allows all software vendors to externalize the costs of all defects and problems to their customers with zero liability, needs re-examination. It is also past time for the very profitable software industry, the institutions that depend on their products and the government agencies entrusted with keeping their citizens secure and their infrastructure functioning, step up and act decisively.Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, is the author of the forthcoming \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of the Fat Start-Up", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn 2003, Keith Rabois, a longtime Silicon Valley investor and executive, had an ambitious idea: He wanted to start a website that would instantly offer a fair price for your home. If you accepted the offer, the site would agree to buy your house immediately, closing the deal in a matter of days.To Mr. Rabois, the plan seemed obvious: Homes are the most expensive possession many of us own, and yet they are also the most difficult to trade on \u2014 to sell in a hurry if you need to relocate or are otherwise looking for quick cash. But tech could solve that. By analyzing lots of sales data, a company could come up with an accurate price for most homes; then the start-up could buy houses quickly, charge people a convenience fee and sell the homes over a longer period of time.There was just one problem: Back then, Silicon Valley was in the middle of a post-dot-com bust and nobody would fund such an expensive plan. So Mr. Rabois sat on the idea for more than a decade. Then in 2014, amid flusher times, he and several partners opened the home-buying company, called Opendoor. Opendoor has since raised more than $300 million in equity and has also taken out more than $500 million in debt. It plans to be in 10 markets by year\u2019s end.In the process, Opendoor also has become a model for a new kind of tech upstart: Call it the fat start-up.But modern capital markets have since unlocked far grander opportunities for tech entrepreneurs. They are blessed with essentially unlimited access to money, and ideas that once seemed too expensive, too risky or just too crazy are now getting off the ground. These start-ups are fat \u2014 with capital, with industry-altering ambition and, to their critics, often more than a little hubris.Opendoor fits that mold. Its plan is precarious: It faces rising competition, high operating costs and \u2014 because we are talking about the market that caused the global financial crisis \u2014 the possibility of an unforeseen blowup. But if it works, Opendoor could be transformative; by making buying and selling houses as easy as buying and selling cars, it might thoroughly alter the American economy and change how we think of homeownership.\u201cReal estate is a $25 trillion asset class \u2014 people spend more on housing than food, transit, health care and education,\u201d said Eric Wu, a founder and the chief executive of Opendoor. \u201cWe think we can make it work much better than it does now.\u201dSo far, Opendoor is growing quickly. In broad strokes, the service works exactly like Mr. Rabois\u2019s original vision. If you want to sell a home in Opendoor\u2019s price range, you go to the site, type in your address, answer a few questions and then wait for an email.The company has data scientists who have developed a sophisticated system for modeling home prices. Opendoor focuses on the middle of the market, and will neither buy distressed homes nor luxury homes, for which pricing dynamics aren\u2019t predictable. If your house meets its criteria, it will send you an offer meant to reflect the best estimate of your home\u2019s value.The offer comes with costs. If you use a traditional real estate agent, you pay a commission of around 5 percent to 6 percent of the sales price (the commission is split between the buyer\u2019s agent and the seller\u2019s agent). Opendoor charges an average commission of around 7.5 percent (it pays a portion of it to real estate agents).For the extra fee, you get certainty: Opendoor will close on the sale of your house in three days, clearing the way for you to relocate, buy a new house or, who knows, leave the country in case of political instability. It will also let you lease back your house if you need extra time, a convenient feature if, say, your new house needs some work.A surprising number of people are saying yes to Opendoor\u2019s offer. Mr. Wu said that about 30 percent of people who request an offer decide to take it. Opendoor declined to provide revenue or growth numbers, but because housing sales data is public, outside analysts have been able to track the company\u2019s progress. Once it buys your house, the company makes necessary repairs and then puts it up for sale. On average, it sells the house within about 90 days.The company has been streamlining other parts of the real estate process. The houses it sells are fitted with internet-enabled cameras, sensors and door locks, allowing potential buyers to unlock the home with Opendoor\u2019s app and come and go as they please. (I tested this on a visit to Phoenix in December; it was quite handy.) It also started a mortgage brokerage operation, so buyers can speed up their access to capital \u2014 a potential precursor to offering home financing on its own.Opendoor is aiming to stay ahead by offering a more customer-friendly service and by rapidly expanding. Mr. Wu argues that as the company grows, Opendoor will be able to unlock more efficiencies in its business, allowing it to reduce its commission much further \u2014 even approaching parity with the traditional sales process.\u201cThere is obviously substantial appeal for this product,\u201d Mr. Mahapatra said. \u201cBut my question would be, \u2018Is there a way that other players in this space might reproduce this seamlessness, but be less expensive?\u2019\u201dFinally, there\u2019s the nightmare scenario: a real estate crash. Part of the reason Opendoor is expanding to new markets is to avoid the vicissitudes of the business. Opendoor\u2019s biggest liability is all the houses it owns; if some kind of disaster were to befall Phoenix and home sales cratered there, Opendoor would find itself holding hundreds of houses it couldn\u2019t sell. By operating in several markets, Mr. Wu said, the company could insulate itself from local crashes.What if there\u2019s a nationwide correction? Mr. Wu said his team had run simulations on previous crashes, including in 2008, and had found one of two scenarios: On the one hand, the business might slow down for a few years, then pick up as the market does. Or it might even do better, because sellers would decide to pay a higher premium to get a certain offer.\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that we might thrive in times of volatility,\u201d Mr. Wu said.Sound crazy? Yeah, well, we\u2019re talking about a website that will make an offer on your house, sight unseen. Everything about it is crazy. But that\u2019s the tech business these days, and who knows \u2014 it could work.An earlier version of this column misstated Opendoor\u2019s operating procedure. It will make an offer on your house sight unseen, but it will not close the deal without seeing it.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. Accused in Lawsuit of Deceit on Diesel Truck Emissions", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byA Seattle law firm that specializes in suing automakers has filed a class-action lawsuit against General Motors, accusing the company of programming some of its heavy-duty pickup trucks to cheat on diesel emissions tests.News of the lawsuit was enough to send the company\u2019s shares down almost 2 percent on Thursday. It is the latest sign of the intense scrutiny of the methods that automakers have devised to meet stringent diesel-emissions regulations, an issue that has led to major legal cases against Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler.General Motors denied the allegations. \u201cThese claims are baseless and we will vigorously defend ourselves,\u201d it said in a statement.It was unclear whether environmental regulators would open investigations into G.M. and the emissions-control technology used in its diesel trucks.The suit accuses the company of using software that helps the diesel versions of Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD and GMC Sierra 2500HD heavy-duty pickup trucks with Duramax engines meet emissions requirements.The software was used in about 705,000 trucks sold from 2011 to 2016, the suit says. It argues G.M. deceived customers by marketing the vehicles as \u201cclean\u201d diesel trucks and seeks to force the company to buy the vehicles back and compensate owners for economic losses.According to the suit, the trucks conform to emissions standards when they are being driven at steady speeds and when outdoor temperatures range from 68 to 86 degrees \u2014 the conditions used for some of the emissions testing such trucks undergo.Absent those conditions, the vehicles emit four to five times the pollutants than are allowed, the suit says. It alleges that G.M. intentionally programmed the vehicles\u2019 emissions controls to pass emissions tests and to then scale back those controls in real-world conditions to improve power and fuel-economy.In response to the suit, G.M. said heavy-duty trucks with its Duramax diesel engine complied with all emissions regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, which plays an influential role in vehicle emissions.The E.P.A. did not respond to requests for comment on the suit. The California agency is reviewing the lawsuit, a spokesman said. He declined further comment.The suit was filed by Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, a law firm that specializes in class actions and that previously filed a diesel-emissions suit against G.M. related to the Chevrolet Cruze compact and another against Fiat Chrysler; those suits are pending. A similar suit filed by the firm against Mercedes-Benz was dismissed. Hagens Berman has also filed liability claims unrelated to emissions against Ford Motor, Kia Motors, Tesla and others.John German, a senior fellow at the International Council on Clean Transportation in Ann Arbor, Mich., said he had reviewed some details of the lawsuit and was not sure if G.M.\u2019s emissions controls amounted to a so-called illegal defeat device. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough information to say right now,\u201d he said.Hagens Berman said the suit was based on tests it conducted on a 2013 Silverado 2500HD with about 51,000 miles on the odometer. Steve W. Berman, a partner, said the firm had hired its own engineers to test diesel vehicles after Volkswagen acknowledged in 2015 that it had cheated on emissions tests.\u201cWe came to the conclusion that all manufacturers in Europe had cheated, and we began to ask, \u2018How could it be that the vehicles manufacturers are selling in the U.S. are clean?\u2019\u201d Mr. Berman said.Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays Capital, said in a research note to clients that the suit could merely be a \u201cfishing\u201d attempt to extract a settlement from G.M. \u201cWe\u2019d only know that it\u2019s more serious if the E.P.A. steps in,\u201d he wrote.The diesel versions of the heavy-duty Silverado and Sierra make up a small portion of G.M.\u2019s total United States sales, but contribute significantly to its bottom line.A decade ago, BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen began offering a new generation of cars that they promoted as \u201cclean diesel.\u201d They were designed with new pollution-control technologies and intended to meet more stringent emissions limits being set by the European Union and California.Among the innovations was a system that sprays ammonia into a vehicle\u2019s exhaust system to remove nitric oxide, one of the most harmful pollutants in diesel exhaust. New filters that trapped and burned particles common in diesel fumes were also introduced.But then Volkswagen began selling cars that passed the tighter emissions tests without using the exhaust additive, which is known as urea. Researchers at West Virginia University and elsewhere eventually discovered that emissions from VW\u2019s diesel models were far higher on real roads than in tests, and the E.P.A. demanded that the company explain the discrepancy.In September 2015, Volkswagen admitted that its cars had used software to detect when they were being tested, and to turn on emissions controls. In real driving, the controls were dialed back to give cars better fuel economy and a peppier ride.In all, Volkswagen sold some 11 million cars and sport-utility vehicles \u2014 including about 600,000 in the United States \u2014 equipped with the offending software.\u201cVolkswagen, because the cheating was so clear with them, sort of because the poster child for misbehavior when it comes to diesel emissions,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s look at all the other diesels and see if they\u2019re doing the same thing.\u2019\u201dOn Tuesday, the federal government filed a lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler, accusing it of using illegal engine-control software on diesel versions of its Ram 1500 pickup truck and Jeep Grand Cherokee. That case involves about 104,000 vehicles from the 2014 to 2016 model years.In Europe, where diesel cars account for a much larger portion of the market, regulators and researchers have begun investigations of several automakers to determine whether they are using illegal means to comply with diesel-exhaust rules.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford Was Unprepared for Investor Revolt and C.E.O. Change", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIt was no secret that Mr. Fields\u2019s job had been in jeopardy. The 36 percent decline in Ford shares since he replaced Alan Mulally nearly three years ago was the mathematical manifestation of investors\u2019 discontent with his stewardship. Even General Motors withstood only a 10 percent slide, while Fiat Chrysler and Tesla both increased strongly.Despite robust investment, Ford is perceived to be lagging rivals \u2014 not just Tesla but even the dowdy GM \u2014 in developing the next generation of electric and self-driving cars. Car sales are down this year, and margins are under pressure.This spurred a last-ditch move by Mr. Fields a week ago to cut white-collar workers, potentially irritating President Trump, with whom the company had also clashed over plans to move production of some small cars to Mexico. It backtracked on that decision, in part because of slack demand for those vehicles.All these woes coalesced at Ford\u2019s annual meeting. Shareholders didn\u2019t just call out Mr. Fields. Some 35 percent of them also voted to abandon the dual-class share structure that gives the descendants of Henry Ford two-fifths of the vote with less than 2 percent of the stock. Stripping out the family\u2019s votes meant that at least 58.5 percent of investors favored moving to one share, one vote \u2014 an act of open rebellion.What\u2019s surprising is the family\u2019s solution: appointing Jim Hackett, an executive from an unrelated industry. That worked with Mr. Mulally, a former Boeing executive, who arrived in 2006 and kept Ford from bankruptcy. Mr. Hackett, who runs Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicle division, is a year older than Mr. Mulally was when he took the reins. Mr. Hackett ran another old Midwestern industrial company, the furniture maker Steelcase, for nearly two decades.

But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Mr. Trump also proposes repealing part of a 2006 law that diverted about 37 percent of the revenues from oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama from the federal government.The White House estimates that repealing the law and redirecting the state oil revenue back to Washington could yield $3.5 billion over 10 years. Those states, and the oil lobby, are expected to push back fiercely.2016 is the hottest year on the historical record and the third consecutive record-breaking year, scientists say.The administration estimates that selling the oil will generate a profit of $16.5 billion over 10 years. While the Energy Department has the authority to sell some oil in the reserve, such a major reduction would almost certainly need action from Congress, and the prospects of success for such a move are unclear.\u201cThere are credible arguments that the optimal size of the S.P.R. should be smaller than it is,\u201d Mr. Bordoff said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re selling off a big chunk of a national security asset that we\u2019ve held for 40 years, that should be rooted in a detailed analysis of the country\u2019s energy needs, not short-term budget considerations.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s budget also proposes a drastic restructuring of the way electricity is bought and sold in Western states, which rely heavily on cheap hydroelectric power generated by government structures like the Hoover Dam in Nevada. Mr. Trump proposes selling off thousands of miles of government-owned transmission lines that move this electricity to homes across nearly 20 Western states, from Arizona to Wyoming, creating estimated revenue of about $10 billion over a decade.Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, said the plan had no chance.\u201cSelling government-owned transmission lines to the highest bidder will just have the effect of jacking up power rates, and no one in that region is going to be in favor of this,\u201d she said.The proposal would also restart the Nuclear Waste Fund fee program, which charges electricity users money to be funneled toward construction of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump in Nevada, with estimated revenues of about $3 billion over 10 years. But that money would be specifically earmarked for construction of the nuclear waste repository, which has been mired in delays and disputes for decades.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

{"Headline": "The Death and Life of Jersey City", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "The downtown boom, visible in the new night-life scene along Newark Avenue, poses a threat to the urban pioneers from the city\u2019s grittier days.Supported byBetween Jersey City\u2019s downtown and waterfront districts sits a single-story windowless pillbox of a bar with a sign outside that says \u201cGolden Cicada.\u201dInside you\u2019ll find pizza parlor chairs, flypaper chandeliers and fluorescent lights, some of them pulsating.On a recent night, a middle-aged man with a Stetson hat and salt-and-pepper goatee entered the Cicada with his right arm in a sling.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d someone asked.\u201cI got into a fight.\u201d\u201cWith who?\u201d\u201cJack Daniel\u2019s.\u201dThe man with the compromised arm was Peter Kingsley, a self-described \u201cgentleman actor\u201d and part of the Goon Platoon, a group of Cicada regulars who were spending the night at their customary corner of the bar, ribbing one another over Tsingtao beers and whiskey while \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d played on the bar\u2019s TV.\u201cI always find myself highlighting the growth of the restaurant and bar scene,\u201d said Jeremy Kaplan, chief operating officer of the Kushner Real Estate Group, one of the major players in the development boom here. (President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a nephew of one of the founders of KRE Group.) \u201cI\u2019m screaming it from the rooftops.\u201d The Kushner Group owns four large residential buildings with 1,800 rental units and has two more buildings under construction.This vibrant scene is at the heart of Jersey City\u2019s revival. But it has also made way for large and rowdy nightclub-like spots along Newark Avenue near the PATH train station. These bars, often owned by companies with multiple properties, may well price out the indie upstarts and Brooklyn exiles.\u201cIn my opinion, Jersey City downtown is only two to three years away from becoming Hoboken,\u201d said Danny Harrison, a Jersey City resident and vice president for real estate at B&D Holdings, \u201cwhich will significantly increase the real estate value but will take away from the flair and uniqueness of Jersey City.\u201dThe enduring flair and uniqueness of Jersey City is in no small part the result of Mr. Tan\u2019s perseverance.A small man with a wide grin and a monkish buzz cut, he is an autodidact and former engineer and the reason educational PBS is on the TV. He provides Scrabble and discussions on Thomas Paine for a slew of regulars ranging from English expat investment bankers to restaurant deliverymen ending their shifts. In order to keep his place of business running just the way he likes, Mr. Tan has engaged in legal battles and adapted to significant cultural shifts, watching the demographics of his own bar change from blue-collar, born-and-bred Jersey types and street toughs to young bankers, local artists and college students who initially arrived from somewhere else.\u201cThis used to be a working-class bar,\u201d said Mr. Tan, 72. \u201cWe had one guy in here who worked for City Hall. He couldn\u2019t read! Spoke English fine but couldn\u2019t read.\u201dWhen Mr. Tan bought the Golden Cicada Tavern in 1986, Jersey City had been a blasted landscape for years, the result of the collapse of the local railroad industry in the 1960s and 1970s.At the time, Hoboken was starting its revival, though the spread of New York wealth and development across the Hudson was slow, said Max Herman, director of the urban studies program at New Jersey City University. \u201cIn the 1980s, Hoboken had fallen so low that people were setting buildings on fire for the insurance money,\u201d he said. In the \u201990s, professional New Yorkers saw opportunity in the inexpensive brownstones that remained in Hoboken, as well as its compact, neighborhood-like footprint. An established working-class Irish and Italian community in Hoboken offered \u201can already-existing infrastructure of bars and taverns,\u201d Mr. Herman said.By contrast, Jersey City was sprawling, covering an area almost the size of Manhattan. With its abandoned buildings, long-neglected waterfront and larger minority communities, it was seen as a rougher place and more risky for investment. What passed for night life in many neighborhoods took place in \u201csocial clubs\u201d in peoples\u2019 basements and backyards, where the membership rules skirted the licensing laws. According to Dr. Herman, artists slowly occupied the old buildings; cafes, bars and restaurants followed.Mattias and Alice Gustafsson moved to the area in 1990 and opened their first restaurant, Madame Claude, in 2002. It sat alone on a corner far from public transportation, its charming yellow walls covered with framed photographs of French film stars of the \u201950s and \u201960s.\u201cThere was nothing there,\u201d Mr. Gustafsson said, \u201cexcept the drug dealers around the corner. The streets were empty at 8 o\u2019clock. On the first night we opened, we had our windows broken. But then we even created a friendship with the drug dealers. We learned their names. We earned their respect.\u201dThe restaurant soon became a go-to date spot, serving moules-frites, cr\u00e8pes and other classic French comfort food.\u201cEverything was word of mouth, and people started venturing out,\u201d Mr. Gustafsson said. \u201cThey had a hard time finding us \u2014 the streets were all dark \u2014 then they saw our string of little fairy lights around the awning.\u201dMost important, the laws govern the sale and distribution of liquor licenses, which are pegged to the size of a municipality and must be purchased outright rather than leased, as they can be in New York.The original Madame Claude had no liquor license but allowed customers to bring their own wine, the only economical course for such a small establishment.\u201cB.Y.O.B. was good for us as long as the rent was O.K.,\u201d Mr. Gustafsson said. \u201cBut Jersey City has a lot more corporate than family restaurants because they have deeper pockets.\u201dMr. Harrison, the real estate investor, agrees, pointing out that rising rents, combined with such a big start-up outlay for a license, can be crippling.\u201cThe boom is unreal; the price per square foot has tripled,\u201d said Mr. Harrison, who said he has lost over 20 real estate bids in this intensely competitive market. He explained that investors are buying buildings at high prices with low returns, which means that they are increasing rents significantly. This, in turn, is pushing out small-business owners.The current boom has occurred under the watch of Jersey City\u2019s dynamic young mayor, Steven Fulop, 40, who has encouraged large-scale development while simultaneously championing small businesses. According to the mayor, there are 10,000 new residential units under construction and another 17,000 approved. At the same time, he says, 650 new small businesses have opened within the past three years, many of them bars and restaurants.The Golden Cicada\u2019s genesis, on the other hand, was something of an accident. Driving past a for-sale sign, Mr. Tan called and bought the nearly burned-out building. Discovering that the purchase came with a liquor license, he found himself a bartender and kept at it.\u201cWe bought a license for $130,000 two years before finding a space,\u201d Mr. Pan said. \u201cWe were confident downtown was going to explode. We wanted to do this before we got priced out.\u201dDowntown\u2019s boom is most obvious on Newark Avenue.Even as a City Council member, Mayor Fulop saw enormous untapped potential for the stretch of Newark Avenue surrounding the busy Grove Street PATH station. For years, city law affecting this particular strip had slowed the development of what seemed to many as a potential restaurant row. The regulations, adding to the existing demands of state laws, required that any bar or restaurant on the strip had to stop serving alcohol at 11 p.m. and that liquor licenses were nontransferable. As a result, Newark Avenue at night was a scene of shuttered discount stores and grim bodegas.The mayor led the city to pass legislation to lift regulations, and change came swiftly, bringing no fewer than seven new restaurants to the strip within three years. A stretch of the street was turned into a pedestrian mall, with planters, bicycle racks and picnic tables.At daytime in nice weather, the plaza is filled with families playing, couples strolling, al fresco diners and buskers. The block plays host to numerous street fairs throughout the year.One Kushner property, Grove Pointe, towers above the Grove Street PATH station. \u201cPart of being successful in development is being sensitive to local concerns,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said.Gentrification has arrived at such a full tilt here that the occasional brawl is more often between the privileged than the poor.\u201cWe went there the other night,\u201d said Mr. Gustafsson, who owns Madame Claude Bis. \u201cAll the bars were playing dance music. It\u2019s fine. Leave it over there.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s office is well aware of residents\u2019 concerns and has deployed a more visible police presence on the strip at peak hours, while also focusing on family-friendly gestures like increased public programming in the outdoor area and requiring every bar on the block to operate a working kitchen.\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Mayor Fulop said.Madame Claude Bis and Pet Shop remain safely off the beaten path of Newark Avenue\u2019s main drag, but not quite as safely off or unbeaten as the Golden Cicada.\u201cAll you see is huge high-rises all around him,\u201d Mr. Pan said of Mr. Tan. \u201cAnd the Cicada just sitting in that little spot. That summarizes what he\u2019s been through.\u201dMr. Tan himself is a chronicle of shrugging opportunity. An ethnic Chinese living in Malaysia during politically restive times in 1969, he walked into the local American library one day and, thumbing through a directory of American colleges, saw the name Antioch, applied to the engineering school, and was accepted. Even the name Terry was a mere suggestion that stuck.\u201cSomebody just mentioned \u2018Call yourself Terry,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cO.K., I\u2019m Terry.\u201dThe name Golden Cicada was the translation of the Chinese name of his first wife, she in turn named after a character in the epic Chinese novel \u201cJourney to the West.\u201d\u201cIn New Jersey nobody wins eminent domain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the government wants it, they take it.\u201dDuring the litigation, Mr. Tan\u2019s wife died of cancer.\u201cThat was the catalyst,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen your dog is in the corner, you fight for your life.\u201dWhen Mr. Tan learned that the city\u2019s intention in seizing his property was to allow the Catholic school next door to expand its football field, he challenged it on First Amendment grounds, putting up a banner outside the bar reading \u201cThou Shalt Not Steal.\u201dWith the help of the Rutgers University Law Clinic and the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey, Mr. Tan defended himself in court and won.As the neighborhood changes fast, the Cicada clings on stubbornly, and Mr. Tan spends his spare time on pet projects, chiefly building an electric car engine that he claims will \u201cdisrupt Tesla\u201d after he installs it into the rusty chassis of an old Volkswagen Beetle he keeps in the lot out back. He swears he\u2019ll drive it to Atlantic City and back on one charge.Minutes after the 20-somethings took their inaugural baijiu shots, a local amateur soccer team filed into the bar after a game. The team it beat was drinking sulkily elsewhere while these athletes, proud members of their self-named Golden Cicada Soccer Club, celebrated victory with shots of baijiu and bottles of Tsingtao.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Awaits Trump Decision on U.S. Future in Paris Accord", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Momentous arguments inside the West Wing over the future of the Paris climate accord became a messy public spectacle on Wednesday, with some aides saying that President Trump had decided to abandon the landmark global warming agreement while others insisted that no decision had been made.In addition, three other officials said later Wednesday that they expected him to withdraw from the agreement, though they said that decision could still change. Hours later, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had made his decision and would announce it in the Rose Garden at 3 p.m. Thursday.The White House\u2019s legislative affairs office has suggested another route: Sending the Paris agreement to the Senate for ratification as a treaty. Since it would require an impossible two-thirds vote, that alternative would also lead to withdrawal.Other White House insiders disputed those reports, saying that no verdict had been reached. Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, offered only that \u201cI\u2019m hearing from a lot of people, both ways,\u201d and promised a decision \u201cvery soon.\u201dWith the world watching nervously, the feuding among the president\u2019s aides further exposed the fault lines of a chaotic decision-making process that has swirled around Mr. Trump since he took office.Signs have been increasing for weeks that Mr. Trump was heading toward pulling out of the Paris agreement, apparently believing that a continued United States presence in the accord would harm the economy; hinder job creation in regions like Appalachia and the West, where his most ardent supporters live; and undermine his \u201cAmerica first\u201d message.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?At home, he faced urgent pleas from corporate leaders, including Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, who told Mr. Trump on Tuesday that pulling out was wrong for business, the economy and the environment. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, threatened to resign from two White House advisory boards if the president withdrew from the Paris agreement.On his recent trip to Europe, Mr. Trump waved aside a barrage of private lobbying by other heads of state to keep the United States in the agreement.A frustrated Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said he opposed \u201cbehaving as vassals of the Americans\u201d and assailed Mr. Trump for failing to even understand the mechanics of a withdrawal, which he said could take three or four years to fulfill.\u201cThis notion \u2014 \u2018I am Trump. I am American. America first, so I\u2019m going to get out of it.\u2019 \u2014 that is not going to happen,\u201d Mr. Juncker said. \u201cWe tried to make that clear to Mr. Trump in clear, German principal clauses in Taormina, but it would appear that he did not understand.\u201dHe added, \u201cNot everything in international agreements is fake news.\u201dMr. Trump has shown a willingness to shift direction up until the moment of a public announcement. He met on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who has advocated that the United States remain a part of the Paris accord. Other advisers pressing Mr. Trump to remain were furiously making their case.In the past, such appeals have worked. In April, Mr. Trump was set to announce a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement, but at the last minute changed his mind after intense discussions with advisers and calls from the leaders of Canada and Mexico. Last week, a senior administration official said Mr. Trump would use a speech in Brussels to explicitly endorse NATO\u2019s Article 5 mutual defense provision, which states that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all. He did not.The exit of the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas polluter, would not dissolve the 195-nation pact, which was legally ratified last year, but it could set off a cascade of events that would have profound effects on the planet. Other countries that reluctantly joined the agreement could now withdraw or soften their commitments to cutting planet-warming pollution.\u201cThe actions of the United States are bound to have a ripple effect in other emerging economies that are just getting serious about climate change, such as India, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton, and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group that produces scientific reports aimed at informing global policy makers.Once the fallout settles, he added, \u201cit is now far more likely that we will breach the danger limit of 3.6 degrees\u201d \u2014 the average atmospheric temperature increase above which a future of extreme conditions is considered irrevocable.The aim of the Paris agreement was to lower planet-warming emissions enough to avoid that threshold.\u201cWe will see more extreme heat, damaging storms, coastal flooding and risks to food security,\u201d Professor Oppenheimer said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the kind of world we want to live in.\u201dForeign policy experts said the move could damage the United States\u2019 credibility and weaken Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to negotiate issues far beyond climate change, like trade and terrorism.\u201cFrom a foreign policy perspective, it\u2019s a colossal mistake \u2014 an abdication of American leadership,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a retired career diplomat and an under secretary of state for President George W. Bush.\u201cThe success of our foreign policy \u2014 in trade, military, any other kind of negotiation \u2014 depends on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Burns said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more destructive to our credibility than this.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, particularly coal-state Republicans, have cheered the move, celebrating it as a fulfillment of a signature campaign promise. Speaking to a crowd of oil rig workers last year, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the agreement, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, has pushed the president to withdraw from the accord as part of an economic nationalism that has so far included pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade pact, and vowing to renegotiate Nafta.Coal miners and coal company executives in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia have pushed for Mr. Trump to reverse all of President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change policies, many of which are aimed at reducing the use of coal, considered the largest contributor to climate change.As President Trump decides whether to stay or leave the international climate agreement, political and corporate leaders on both sides of the debate are lobbying him fiercely.In a May 23 letter to Mr. Trump from Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia and nine other state attorneys general, Mr. Morrisey wrote, \u201cWithdrawing from the Paris agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.\u201d He added, \u201cThe Paris agreement is a symbol of the Obama administration\u2019s \u2018Washington knows best\u2019 approach to governing.\u201dAlthough the administration has been debating its position on the Paris agreement for months, the sentiment for leaving appears to have the upper hand over the views of Mr. Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and close adviser.Other countries have vowed to continue to carry out the terms of the Paris agreement, even without the United States.President Xi Jinping of China, the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas polluter, has promised that his country will move ahead with steps to curb climate change, regardless of what happens in the United States.During a telephone call in early May with President Emmanuel Macron of France, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mr. Xi told the newly elected French leader that China and France \u201cshould protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement.\u201dBut the accord\u2019s architects say the absence of the United States will inevitably weaken its chances of being enforced. For example, the country has played a central role in pushing provisions that require robust and transparent oversight of how emissions are monitored, verified and reported.Without the United States, there is likely to be far less pressure on major polluting countries and industries to accurately report their emissions. There have been major questions raised about the accuracy of China\u2019s emissions reporting, in particular.\u201cWe need to know: What are your emissions? Where are your emissions?\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the lead climate negotiator during the Obama administration. \u201cThere needs to be transparent reporting on countries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions. If the U.S. is not part of that negotiation, that\u2019s a loss for the world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the institution of which Jean-Claude Juncker is the president. It is the European Commission, not the European Union.Melissa Eddy and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As C.E.O. Pay Packages Grow, Top Executives Have the President\u2019s Ear", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "The top 200 chief executives, who make more than last year, are holding meetings with President Trump, who is considering rolling back Dodd-Frank regulations.Supported byPerhaps the pay surge reflects the times: Stocks are coming off a strong run. Unemployment is low. The economy is percolating.And President Trump is not only promising to roll back what he calls excessive business regulations but also listening keenly to what corporate America has to say. Since taking office on Jan. 20, the businessman-turned-politician has met with hundreds of executives, including at least 41 of last year\u2019s 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, a New York Times analysis shows.Several executives in the top 10 are in the media or tech industries.Mr. Rutledge, 63, stormed to the front of the pack after closing his company\u2019s mega-merger, a $65 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller competitor.For that, he got a big bump in pay. The year before, his compensation totaled $16.4 million.This combination \u2014 the gains in pay for chief executives, the president\u2019s pledge to deregulate and cut corporate tax rates \u2014 sets the stage for perhaps the most consequential moment for corporate governance since the financial crisis of 2008. Rising executive compensation only widens the gap between top executives and most American workers. Mr. Rutledge, for instance, made about 2,617 times the average American worker\u2019s salary of $37,632, according to figures maintained by the A.F.L.-C.I.O.Discrepancies like that helped fuel the populist frustration that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s election and, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, led to the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul act.Yet the president\u2019s team is considering rolling back a Dodd-Frank rule that, starting next year, would make it much easier for employees at a publicly traded company to compare their own pay to the chief executive\u2019s.In the meantime, pay for top executives is reaching staggering levels. Mr. Rutledge\u2019s compensation swelled to $98 million largely thanks to a stock options award valued at roughly $78 million. The Charter board awarded Mr. Rutledge that grant, which runs through 2020, about a month before completion of its big merger in May 2016.Over all, technology company chief executives are well represented on the list of 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, along with executives from financial services companies and media companies. The best-paid female chief executive is Oracle\u2019s Safra A. Catz, whose total package was valued at $40.9 million, making her the eighth-highest-paid C.E.O. in 2016.Mr. Trump, who sees himself as the nation\u2019s C.E.O., is hardly the first president to savor the company of corporate executives. But he\u2019s made the pageantry of meetings with C.E.O.s at the White House or at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which he has dubbed the southern White House, a priority during his first few months in office. The visits have become an opportunity for the president to trumpet the progress he says his administration is making in creating jobs and reducing regulations.But Mr. Trump may be getting a one-sided perspective on policy recommendations by spending so much time with a large swath of highly paid executives \u2014 at least 307 since Inauguration Day \u2014 whose views on taxes and economic inequality tend to differ from those of average Americans.Unleashing business by reducing regulations was the subtext of Mr. Rutledge\u2019s meeting on March 24 with Mr. Trump.Justin Venech, a Charter spokesman, said Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of a lighter regulatory environment had enabled the company to commit to locating those new jobs in the United States over the next four years, and to spend billions on broadband infrastructure.What is clear from the Equilar study is that many C.E.O.s were doing quite well even before Mr. Trump took office. Average compensation for the 200 highest-paid executives list \u2014 which changes from year to year \u2014 rose about 2 percent, to $19.7 million, from 2015. For the 200 specific individuals on this year\u2019s list, 2016 was especially kind. Those executives saw an average gain of 16 percent over what they received in 2015.On a percentage basis, Ronald D. Croatti at UniFirst, one of the nation\u2019s largest uniform manufacturers and distributors, had the biggest bump in pay last year. Mr. Croatti, 74, died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia, the company said. His pay package in 2016 rose 740 percent, to $17.69 million, according to Equilar.Steven Sintros, chief financial officer for UniFirst, said Mr. Croatti\u2019s large compensation package merely reflected the way companies are required to report the valuation of stock grants.In all, Equilar reports that the median salary for chief executives at all publicly traded companies with annual revenues of at least $1 billion came in at $6.14 million, down slightly from $6.19 million in 2015.Elon Musk, the brash inventor and chief executive of Tesla Inc., clocked in with a $99.7 million pay package in the Bloomberg survey. But Mr. Musk did not appear in the Equilar survey because Equilar valued stock grants, even ones spread out over several years, at the time they were awarded, as the Securities and Exchange Commission requires.The total compensation for Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric slid 33 percent in 2016, to $17.7 million, according to Equilar. His payout under the company\u2019s long-term compensation plan fell by about $6 million, and his annual bonus shrank by $1 million to $4.3 million, according to the company\u2019s proxy. In 2016, G.E. shares rose just 4 percent compared with 12 percent for the S.& P. 500.Mr. Immelt remained on the list, however. Notable extremely wealthy chief executives who did not appear include Tim Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. Both own enormous quantities of their companies\u2019 stock, but their compensation in 2016 was not high enough to qualify.The list also excludes executives who run big divisions but not entire public companies, even when they make more than the corporate boss.Digging deeper, Equilar found that Marc Lore, president and chief executive of Walmart\u2019s online operation, had the biggest payout of all executives at publicly traded companies, earning an eye-popping $243.9 million in total compensation.His total pay was more than 11 times greater than the $21.8 million pay package awarded to C. Douglas McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive.Another big winner was Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google at Alphabet. Mr. Pichai got a compensation package worth just under $200 million. Like Mr. Lore, Mr. Pichai gets a small base salary and most of his compensation is in stock grants. Last year, Alphabet\u2019s board awarded Mr. Pichai stock valued at $198.7 million.By comparison, Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, draws an annual salary of $1 a year. He hardly needs the salary: Forbes estimates the net worth of the co-founder of Google at $45 billion.The Equilar study points up a trend in compensation: Companies are increasingly moving away from cash bonuses and toward stock grants to reward top executives.Many large investors favor them because they give corporate executives an additional incentive to produce results that increase a company\u2019s share prices. Some critics, however, contend that stock grants and stock options can encourage executives to cut costs and take other short-term steps that don\u2019t invest in a company\u2019s long-term prospects.Supporters of stock grants are winning. Over the past five years, the median cash bonus awarded to the 200 best-compensated C.E.O.s declined to just under $3 million, from $3.37 million, according to Equilar. Meanwhile, the median value of stock awarded to those chief executives last year was $9.2 million.\u201cThe issue with cash bonuses is that they have become a given for most executives,\u201d said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer with the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, or Calstrs. \u201cThere are still companies where they award the same bonus year after year, and the stock price doesn\u2019t reflect any value added.\u201dMs. Mastagni said a cash bonus \u201cis not money at risk,\u201d as is a grant of stock.The board at AMC Networks \u2014 which has produced hit television shows like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d \u2014 has decided to phase out the long-term cash award for its chief executive and other top executives. AMC\u2019s compensation committee decided that a stock award \u201cbetter aligns the interests of its senior officers with those of stockholders.\u201dBut in 2016, Joshua W. Sapan, AMC\u2019s chief executive, hit the daily double of sorts. Mr. Sapan got a big cash award of $15.1 million, which will become much smaller in 2018 under the board\u2019s policy. But he also got a big stock award, valued at $13.2 million, consistent with the board\u2019s new directive on corporate pay. In all, Mr. Sapan\u2019s total $30.5 million pay package soared 72 percent over 2015, even as the company\u2019s stock dropped nearly 30 percent last year.No matter how you look at it, the pay gap between corporate executives and most everyone else in America keeps getting bigger.Some 50 years ago, the typical chief executive made just 20 times what an employee did, according to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. By comparison, it calculated that the average C.E.O. today made 347 times the average salary of an American laborer, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: $37,632.Reversing this ever-widening pay gap is a union rallying cry, especially at companies that have been shedding jobs in the United States.Take Mondelez, the global snack company. Outside the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on May 17 in Chicago, union members protested its decision to eliminate 600 jobs at a local factory that makes Oreo cookies, and shift some operations to Mexico.\u201cMondelez is emblematic of everything that is wrong with our economy, which works for C.E.O.s, but not for working Americans,\u201d said Brandon Rees, who works in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s Office of Investment.Irene B. Rosenfeld, the company\u2019s chief executive, received a 2016 pay package valued at $15.8 million, according to Equilar, a decline of 13 percent. Michael Mitchell, a Mondelez spokesman, said the company\u2019s compensation program is \u201cwell aligned with shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\u201dBut Mr. Rees said the company\u2019s failure to hit certain performance targets, and a 13 percent decline in Mondelez revenue last year, accounted for the decline in her compensation, adding that her pay package was still too high. He said she had focused too much on cutting costs and share buybacks, and not enough on investments that would keep jobs in the United States.Amid populist anger over income inequality, the S.E.C. in 2015 required publicly traded corporations to begin providing standard information in 2018 on the disparities between pay for chief executives and rank-and-file workers. That so-called pay-ratio rule would give investors and employees another metric for evaluating C.E.O. pay.The chairman of Business Roundtable is Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase and the 25th-best-compensated chief executive in the Equilar survey. His pay package rose 49 percent last year, to $27.2 million. Mr. Dimon, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s C.E.O. advisory group, visited the White House on Feb. 3 and has praised the president for awakening \u201canimal spirits\u201d in the economy.Alan Johnson, managing director of the pay consulting firm Johnson Associates, said he supports the opposition to the pay-ratio rule because it \u201cis a cooked-up thing to embarrass firms with a lot of part-time workers.\u201d He added that focusing on compensation leads to \u201cpay envy\u201d and does not do anything to address a fundamental problem, which is that average workers need better job training and job assistance programs.But Susan R. Holmberg, a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal public policy group, said that if the pay-ratio rule encourages employees to join unions, it is a good thing for workers, since it could lead to future wage gains.Mr. Trump \u201cran on this populist message,\u201d she said, and it is odd that the administration would be taking another look at the pay-ratio rule, because \"C.E.O. pay is the No. 1 populist issue.\u201dStill, there is some progress on the pay inequality front.This year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Equity Index Fund and the New York State Common Retirement Fund reached an agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company, to include new language on executive and employee compensation in its proxy statement. It says the company is taking a \u201cnon-elitist\u201d approach by awarding stock options to all of its 5,500 employees, not just to executives. The change has helped lead the union and the New York pension system to withdraw a proposed shareholder amendment on the issue of pay.Alexandra Bowie, a Regeneron spokeswoman, said the revised language in the company\u2019s filings did not reflect a change in policy but a \u201cbroader effort to include more detailed and accessible language.\u201dAs for Leonard S. Schleifer, the chief executive of Regeneron, his total compensation for 2016 was $28.2 million, almost 40 percent less than the year before, and nearly matching the 32 percent slide in the company\u2019s share price.Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, said company boards need to be sensitive to issues of income inequality. \u201cI have no problem with someone doing well, who creates value,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I do think a company and a board as they look at compensation need to make sure everyone down the chain is also benefiting from the performance of the company.\u201dBoards need to consider not only how much top executives are getting paid, she said, but also whether rank-and-file workers are being compensated fairly too. The crucial question is this, Ms. Sheehan said: \u201cAre they investing enough in the human capital in the company?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Ronald D. Croatti, the chief executive of UniFirst, who died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia. He was 74, not 73.An article last Sunday about executive compensation misidentified a company that Charter Communications \u2014 whose chief executive, Thomas M.

Ford is promising to have a fully autonomous vehicle on the road by 2021.The upstart electric-vehicle maker Tesla \u2014 which recently surpassed G.M. and Ford in market capitalization \u2014 is bringing a mass-market model to market later this year.At the annual meeting on May 11, Mr. Fields said Ford was capable of staying competitive in the current market for new vehicles, while also \u201ckeeping one foot in the future\u201d of an industry heading toward autonomous, battery-powered cars.Yet Ford is showing troubling signs of decline. Profit in the first quarter dropped more than 30 percent from a year earlier, and the company\u2019s American market share declined slightly.So far this year, Ford has had a number of safety recalls that have raised red flags about its overall vehicle quality. The company has also experienced a deep decline in the sale of small and midsize cars, leading some Wall Street analysts to suggest that it drop unprofitable models from its portfolio.Ford\u2019s car sales are down 25 percent this year \u2014 far more than the overall industry decline in the car segment \u2014 and it is making little, if any, money on the cars it does sell.The personnel changes at the company extend beyond the departure of Mr. Fields and ascension of Mr. Hackett, according to the officials briefed on the move.Joseph R. Hinrichs, head of Ford\u2019s critical Americas division, will expand his role to become executive vice president for global operations. James D. Farley Jr., who runs Ford\u2019s European unit, has been appointed to oversee worldwide sales and marketing. And the company\u2019s chief technical officer, Marcy Klevorn, will take over Mr. Hackett\u2019s duties as chief of mobility initiatives.In a related move, Mark Truby, who previously led the company\u2019s communications teams in Asia and Europe, will immediately take over as its communications chief. He succeeds Raymond F. Day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber and Waymo Duel at Key Hearing Over Driverless Car Technology", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byOne of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars. The company is involved in a legal dispute over whether it used technology stolen by a top executive who had worked at Google.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the fight over the future of self-driving vehicles, a bare-knuckled brawl between Uber and Waymo is coming to a head.That was clear in a federal courthouse in San Francisco on Wednesday as the two companies clashed at a crucial hearing in a case that could halt the progress of Uber\u2019s autonomous-vehicle research efforts. The hearing was expected to be the final court session before a federal judge decides whether to temporarily shut down Uber\u2019s work on self-driving cars.The thief, Waymo maintains, is Anthony Levandowski, a former top Google engineer whose start-up was acquired by Uber last year to work on self-driving technology. Waymo has accused Mr. Levandowski of illegally downloading 14,000 documents from Google and then applying those stolen secrets at Uber.On Wednesday, lawyers for Waymo argued that Mr. Levandowski had reached an understanding with Uber before he left Google. To keep that agreement secret from Google, the Waymo lawyers said, Mr. Levandowski and Uber needed some cover, so they hatched a plan for Mr. Levandowski to create a self-driving-car start-up named Otto, which Uber would then acquire.\u201cIn fact, there was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Mr. Levandowski had a deal,\u201d Charles Verhoeven, a lawyer for Waymo, said.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cWe\u2019ve interviewed more than 85 Uber employees, and more than 40 attorneys spent more than 6,000 hours reviewing documents, including over weekends,\u201d Arturo Gonzalez, a lawyer for Uber, said. \u201cAfter reviewing more than 300,000 documents, we\u2019ve only found one Google email in the files.\u201dThe case will be decided by Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court, who is expected to issue a ruling within the week. Waymo has asked for a temporary injunction blocking Uber\u2019s self-driving car efforts; such an order would affect hundreds of Uber\u2019s highly skilled engineers.The two companies have been regarded as leaders in driverless technology, a field that has become crowded in recent years as Apple, General Motors, Tesla and dozens of other companies have flooded in. More than 30 companies have applied to test driverless cars in California, which is at the forefront of addressing regulatory issues raised by such vehicles.There has been little love between Uber and Google in the past, with the companies tangling over issues like mapping technology and hiring. Waymo\u2019s lawsuit against Uber is one of the most tangible manifestations of the enmity between the two.Waymo, which was spun off by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, last year, sued Uber in February. Uber has repeatedly denied the accusations and has separately sought to take the matter to arbitration. Mr. Levandowski said last week that he would stop working on Uber\u2019s Lidar system \u2014 a shorthand term for light detection and ranging technology, a key hardware component in the operation of autonomous vehicles \u2014 for the duration of the case.Waymo\u2019s lawyers opened the proceedings on Wednesday by pointing to documents and emails uncovered during the case. The documents include correspondence between Uber executives discussing the acquisition of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up in early 2016 while he was still working for Google, Waymo\u2019s lawyers said.The documents also show Uber agreeing to grant Mr. Levandowski more than 5.3 million company shares, with an estimated value of more than $250 million, in exchange for meeting various technical milestones and project goals should he join Uber.Uber\u2019s lawyers argued there was no proof that the company had used any Waymo trade secrets.Judge Alsup said Wednesday that Waymo\u2019s lawyers had presented strong evidence that Mr. Levandowski had downloaded troves of valuable information from Google before leaving the company and had tried to erase his tracks after doing so. He also said Uber had determined at some point that Mr. Levandowski was \u201cradioactive\u201d and had taken steps to insulate itself from any repercussions he might face.Yet Judge Alsup also indicated that Waymo\u2019s lawyers might not have proved that there was a direct link between Mr. Levandowski\u2019s actions and Uber\u2019s products.\u201cI\u2019ve already given you lots of time for discovery, and you don\u2019t seem to have a smoking gun,\u201d he said to Waymo\u2019s lawyers.Waymo\u2019s lawyers said they believed that there might be additional evidence that Mr. Levandowski had shared the company\u2019s technology with Uber and had used it in Uber designs, but that Uber was withholding that evidence.Waymo\u2019s lawyers also said that Mr. Levandowski could offer similar proof were he willing to cooperate in a deposition. Mr. Levandowski, apparently seeking to avoid criminal charges, has invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.Advertisement"}
