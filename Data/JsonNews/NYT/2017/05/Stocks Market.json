{"Headline": "As Their Clout Wanes, Saudi Arabia and Russia Extend Oil Production Cuts", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byWith oil markets flagging, the world\u2019s two biggest oil exporters agreed on Monday to extend production cuts for several months, sending the price of crude soaring.Major oil-producing nations have struggled of late to bolster prices, as inventories piled up and crimped the potential for demand. Prices dipped below $44 a barrel this month, their lowest level in more than a year.Countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014 which are heavily dependent on energy sales to fund national budgets and government services \u2014 are trying to manage the markets by promising to reduce production. The move on Monday pushed oil prices up by nearly 3.8 percent, to almost $50 a barrel, the highest level in about three weeks.The strength in oil prices sent American stocks to new highs. With energy shares surging, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index surpassed its record, closing just above 2,400 points.The latest swings are proving problematic for global producers. For years, Saudi Arabia and other nations in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries were often able to easily prop up prices. But their clout has ebbed as new players like American shale producers came into the market and the growth in demand for oil slowed.That is forcing Saudi Arabia and Russia to step in again. The two countries agreed on Monday to lower their production levels for nine months longer than originally agreed, through next March. OPEC, of which the Saudis are the de facto leaders, is likely to follow suit when its 13 members meet in Vienna on May 25.Oil prices rose to their highest level in weeks after Monday\u2019s announcement. At the end of trading, West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $48.85 a barrel, up $1.01, while Brent crude rose 98 cents to $51.82.\u201cWhat OPEC, and to some extent Russia, and these other countries have been doing since the price collapse of 2014 is pretending to manage the market,\u201d said Robert McNally, a former White House energy adviser who is president of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based research firm, and the author of a recent book on oil booms and busts titled \u201cCrude Volatility.\u201dIn reality, Mr. McNally said, they were simply \u201cmanaging or manipulating sentiment.\u201dOPEC and other big oil producers, in effect, are no longer the only voice in the market.It is a marked shift for a bloc that even today accounts for about a third of the world\u2019s oil production. In the late 1990s, a series of cuts by OPEC, as well as other producers outside the organization, lifted prices after a collapse to the $10 per barrel range.Now, they are fighting a wave of forces beyond their control.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Shale and other sources are likely to fill in whatever gaps OPEC production cuts created in the market. And OPEC may be making things easier for shale producers by agreeing to rein in output for such a long period.\u201cIt is now becoming very clear that the cuts aren\u2019t making the oil market rebalance sooner,\u201d said Rob West, a partner at Redburn, a market research firm in London. \u201cThey are prolonging the glut.\u201dIn the longer term, increased use of electric cars and more efficient use of energy may contribute to slowing growth in world demand, analysts say. In April, the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based monitoring group, forecast that oil demand growth would slow in 2017 for the second straight year, citing gains in the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles in the United States in particular.The current output cuts, which went into effect in January, may also have been less significant than the fanfare that greeted them might suggest.In the months before the cuts came into effect, OPEC countries produced flat out. As a result, when they finally throttled back, they were effectively just returning to more normal levels.Saudi Arabia, which has taken the brunt of the cuts, produced only about 170,000 fewer barrels a day in April than it had in the same period a year earlier. That is equivalent to about 2 percent of its previous total output, and a tiny fraction of global oil demand.\u201cWhat they have chosen is restraint rather than huge cutbacks,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at IHS Markit, a research firm.And some OPEC members like Libya and Nigeria, who are exempt from the cuts, are now substantially increasing output. Libya, for instance, is producing over 800,000 barrels per day, more than double the level of a year ago.The calculations are complex for the bloc.Three years ago, Saudi Arabia and others decided to do nothing, even as prices dropped swiftly from more than $100 a barrel. Riyadh argued at the time that bolstering prices would spur investment in rival sources of energy like American shale producers, and it hoped that lower prices would kill those rivals\u2019 growth.As OPEC nations continued to pump oil at high levels, prices dropped to around $30 per barrel early last year. So with the Saudis\u2019 budget getting pummeled by the loss of oil revenue, they had to reconsider the strategy.Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister for two decades, lost his job, and his successor, Khalid al-Falih, a veteran oil executive, traveled the world promising to restore balance to the market. Those efforts ultimately paid off when OPEC and other major producers like Russia agreed to trim output.It appears that, for now, they are sticking to that path.The two countries said they would work with others ahead of the Vienna meeting, \u201cwith the goal of reaching full consensus on the nine-month extension.\u201d\u201cWhat they looked to do,\u201d said Mr. Mallinson, the analyst, \u201cis send a positive surprise by exceeding market expectations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Trump \u2018Do a Big Number\u2019 on the Big Banks?", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byDealBookFor a brief moment, Wall Street stopped on Monday, as if time was suspended in an alternative reality.President Trump, for the first time as resident of the White House, said aloud that he was considering breaking up the nation\u2019s biggest banks. Of course, he had said it on the campaign trail, but this seemed different.\u201cI\u2019m looking at that right now,\u201d Mr. Trump told Bloomberg News during an interview in the Oval Office. \u201cThere\u2019s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we\u2019re going to look at that.\u201dThe headline ricocheted around the email boxes of senior bank executives across the industry. At the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles, where Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had just finished speaking \u2014 and didn\u2019t mention breaking up the banks \u2014 the hallways quickly buzzed about the comment, according to participants, as their phones lit up. Shares of bank stocks dived lower within seconds of the headline, only to recover quickly.Before Monday\u2019s musings, Mr. Trump\u2019s thoughts on the matter had felt like a theoretical exercise, those who have met with him say.What would be surprising, however, is if Mr. Trump made it a reality. It would be one thing for him to \u201cdo a big number\u201d on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 law that imposed stricter regulations on banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis \u2014 he has repeatedly stated that he wants to pare it back, repealing parts of the law. But it would be a much more seismic shift to bring back Glass-Steagall, which would be the equivalent of doing \u201ca big number\u201d on the banks themselves. The biggest names in banking would presumably face the choice of having to shed either their commercial banking arm or their investment banking division.When Mr. Trump met with business executives in February at the White House, he turned to Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, an unabashed defender of big banks, for advice. JPMorgan Chase would not exist in its current form were it not for the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall.\u201cThere\u2019s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you\u2019re going to tell me about it,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time, to the consternation of proponents of more banking regulation.Viewed through the prism of goosing the economy and creating jobs \u2014 as Mr. Trump has pledged his efforts should be viewed \u2014 it\u2019s hard to see how breaking up the biggest banks would help, especially in the short term. Indeed, it would most likely have the opposite effect.Mr. Trump\u2019s chief complaint about Wall Street is that he doesn\u2019t think lenders are extending enough money. \u201cI have so many people, friends of mine, that had nice businesses. They can\u2019t borrow money,\u201d he famously said. \u201cThey just can\u2019t get any money because the banks just won\u2019t let them borrow, because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.\u201dGiven that commercial lending is at a record, according to the Federal Reserve, that\u2019s a hard statement to square.But let\u2019s be generous and assume for a moment that he is right. What is undoubtedly true is that big banks would probably be even more conservative with their loan books during whatever transition would be required to comply with a new version of Glass-Steagall. Such a law would inject as much uncertainty into the economy as Dodd-Frank did initially, when banks were sorting out how they would comply. The process did throw some big banks\u2019 lending into a state of paralysis.And while proponents of ending too-big-to-fail love to point to the repeal of Glass-Steagall as the culprit, by now that meme should have resolved itself.\u201cI don\u2019t think that Glass-Steagall was a cause of the crisis,\u201d Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who has no horse in this race, told me matter-of-factly.Indeed, he said, he would be worried if the law were brought back, because it would hamstring the government if it ever needed to intervene in a crisis similar to what happened in 2008. \u201cIf Glass-Steagall had been in effect, we couldn\u2019t have had some of the failing firms taken over,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cJPMorgan took over Bear Stearns, and so on.\u201dOn the other hand, Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve and a former Treasury staff member who oversaw the bailouts of the banks, has been on a campaign to break up the biggest banks, concerned that they still pose too much of a risk to taxpayers if they were to fail.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments came on the same day that he and his team spoke with about 100 community bankers led by Cam Fine, president and chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America. One issue they discussed was the idea of a two-tiered system of regulations, one for big banks and another for community banks. Whether that construct is now being interpreted as a new version of Glass-Steagall or a breakup of the banks remains an open question.But let\u2019s be clear: If Mr. Trump were to try to bring back what he described on the campaign trail as Glass-Steagall, it wouldn\u2019t be to prevent the next crisis. He would have to be convinced that bringing back the law would stoke the economy. And that\u2019s an even scarier prospect, because it means firms like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, which have been forced to reduce the risk they take, would ultimately be less regulated.There are a lot of good reasons to reform Dodd-Frank. And there are lots of good ways to make regulations less onerous to the nation\u2019s smaller banks, which complain they are drowning in legal and compliance bills; giving them some relief could indeed open the loan spigot even more. But both of those measures would be very different from bringing back Glass-Steagall.Whether Mr. Trump\u2019s talk translates into action on this front remains to be seen. The prevailing view seems to be: \u201cBe prepared for more headline risk for big banks as lawmakers keep piling on the anti-Wall Street rhetoric \u2014 most of it will be substantively meaningless,\u201d according to Ian Katz of Capital Alpha, whose comments were highlighted by Ben White of Politico.Of course, with President Trump, the prevailing view could change in an instant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Turmoil Is High, but Wall Street\u2019s Fear Gauge Is Very Low", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byIt has become one of the knottier puzzles on Wall Street.As political risks have increased at home and abroad, complacency among investors has rarely been so widespread.This trend, which began soon after President Trump\u2019s victory in November, culminated on Monday, when the VIX index, known widely as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, dipped briefly below 10 \u2014 the first time it had done so in more than 10 years, in the months before the financial crisis.The VIX measures investor expectations that stock markets will move sharply up or down.On Tuesday, the VIX turned up, to close at about 10.6 \u2014 but still sharply lower than its historical average of roughly 20. At current levels, the VIX reflects a striking sense among investors that the persistent rise in stocks would continue, regardless of election fears in Europe and concerns here that Mr. Trump might not deliver on his ambitious economic agenda.\u201cThe pricing of risk is at near historic lows, and the pricing of the stock market is at near historic highs,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock and derivatives specialist at the investment bank UBS. \u201cAnd all of this at a time when political risk is very elevated \u2014 at home and abroad.\u201dSince the VIX reached a recent peak of 22 in the days before the election in November, it has fallen sharply as equity markets have rallied in the belief that the president\u2019s promises to slash regulations, cut taxes and spend money on infrastructure would buoy the economy.The gauge generally moves in the opposite direction of the stock market. So with the major stock indexes having hit highs, it would make sense that the VIX would reach these unusual lows.But what is less clear is why investors have been so willing to ignore so many outcomes that would send stocks reeling.This means that even as Mr. Trump has difficulties in getting his bills passed, investors are not abandoning the stock market, but are switching out of stocks tied directly to a Trump recovery, for example, banks and industrial companies.The net effect of this rotation is a stock market that goes up and a VIX that goes down.\u201cThere has been this epic disconnect between soft and hard economic data,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cAnd investors are just not willing to sell out of their stocks right now.\u201dRussell Rhoads, the director of education at the VIX\u2019s home, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, calls the high level of faith investors have shown in the president\u2019s promise to reinvigorate the economy the Trump put.Now, Mr. Rhoads says, investors are making a similar wager on Mr. Trump.\u201cWe used to have the Greenspan put, maybe it is the Trump put now,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said, citing a propensity of investors to stay in the market despite political ups and downs. \u201cHe is so business-friendly \u2014 there is a view that whatever happens he will do things that spur economic growth.\u201dUnlike a stock index like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the VIX is not driven by stock prices but by the prices of options to buy or sell the S.&P. For that reason, it is a forward-looking indicator \u2014 30 days to be precise \u2014 that measures how volatile traders think the market will be before the option expires.One reason for the gauge\u2019s recent equanimity, Mr. Rhoads said, is that even when investors purchase options to sell the S.&P. index at a certain level (betting that the market will fall) to insure against a sell-off, they are at the same time keeping their broad exposure to stocks.It is this tricky balancing act that has kept the VIX at these low levels.Mr. Rhoads, a student of financial market history, noted that the index is what is known as \u201ca means reverting vehicle.\u201d This means that even if it stays at these low levels for a while, the index will spike up when the next bout of fear hits the market.\u201cIt\u2019s like a rubber band that stretches and stretches until it pops,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said. \u201cEveryone might be too confident right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Ford Takes Investor Meeting Online, Brickbats Still Sting", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Ford Motor moved its annual shareholders meeting from the physical world to the virtual on Thursday. But the new format did little to shield the company from dissatisfied investors.Mark Fields, the chief executive, said the company was making progress in its transition to new technology to compete in an era of self-driving cars and electrified vehicles. But shareholders who took part in the meeting\u2019s online question-and-answer session hardly shared his optimism.In a series of questions read aloud by Ford\u2019s chairman, William C. Ford Jr., investors called the company\u2019s stock performance \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201cdismal,\u201d and said the sinking share price indicated a \u201clack of confidence\u201d in the company\u2019s direction. (Mr. Ford did not identify the shareholders.)Ford\u2019s shares have dropped nearly 40 percent since Mr. Fields became the C.E.O. three years ago, and Mr. Ford conceded that the stock price was a major concern. Last month, Ford\u2019s market capitalization fell behind that of Tesla, the upstart electric-car maker.\u201cLook, we are as frustrated as you are by the stock price,\u201d said Mr. Ford, whose family effectively controls the company through a class of shares that carry outsize voting rights. \u201cA couple of people have said, does the Ford family care about the stock price? The short answer is yes \u2014 a lot.\u201dAnd Ford came under fire from shareholders for the format of the meeting itself, one that for years has been held in an auditorium in Wilmington, Del., where the company is incorporated.The format also allowed some shareholders to call in. One of them, John Chevedden, commented on shareholder proposals that included eliminating the 16-votes-per-share rights attached to the Ford family\u2019s special class of stock. (The proposal failed on a vote of about 2 to 1.)Mr. Chevedden likened the online meeting to a \u201cretreat into a foxhole\u201d by Ford\u2019s leaders. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re hiding in Dearborn today in the basement,\u201d he said, referring to Ford\u2019s corporate headquarters in Michigan.At their own meeting this week, Ford\u2019s board reflected some of the concerns expressed by shareholders, scheduling extra time to press Mr. Fields on the prospects for growth in the company\u2019s core auto operations and its expansion into autonomous vehicles.Like most other major automakers, Ford has benefited in recent years from surging sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles in the American market.But after two consecutive years of record sales industrywide, the market has cooled off. Ford\u2019s sales slid about 5 percent in the first four months of 2017, slightly worse than the industry\u2019s overall performance.The company recently reported that its first-quarter earnings fell by about 35 percent, to $1.6 billion, from the same period last year. Ford\u2019s United States market share also dipped, mostly because of plunging sales of passenger cars.Other automakers are also coping with slower sales, particularly those of cars.But Ford is suffering compared with larger competitors such as General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota, which have greater resources to devote to emerging technology. Ford, for example, is lagging behind Tesla and G.M. in introducing electric vehicles to the mass market.While Mr. Fields has been vocal about the need to move aggressively into electrified models, Ford is still at least three years from producing its first long-range, battery-powered model for mainstream consumers.And the company is locked in an expensive race with automakers and Silicon Valley companies to perfect self-driving equipment considered critical to the growth of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.\u201cThe bottom line is the biggest strategic shift in the history of our company is well underway and gaining momentum,\u201d Mr. Fields said in his presentation to shareholders.Mr. Fields described Ford\u2019s mission as balancing two imperatives: manufacturing traditional automobiles for global markets, and investing in technology to capture new revenue eventually from autonomous models.\u201cWe continue to deliver solid results in our core automotive business by keeping one foot in today,\u201d he said, adding that Ford\u2019s technology push was akin to \u201cplacing one foot in tomorrow\u201d as well.Mr. Ford and the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, dismissed the potential for a share buyback program to increase the value of the stock.Mr. Shanks also said the company needed to conserve its cash reserves for investing in new technology and maintaining its dividend in the event American auto sales continue to decline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hot Stocks Can Make You Rich. But They Probably Won\u2019t.", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIndividual stocks can be hazardous to your financial health.You may not want to hear that right now, with the stock market regularly hitting new highs.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index set another record on Wednesday after reaching a new high on Monday. It set records on two days the previous week, too. Counting dividends, it has returned more than 6 percent this year and more than 15 percent in the last 12 months.What\u2019s more, big bets on hot stocks are generating enormous gains. So far in 2017, for example, two companies in the S.&.P. 500 \u2014 the biotechnology company Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the video game developer Activision Blizzard \u2014 have each returned more than 50 percent to their fortunate shareholders. No question about it, if you pick a sizzling stock at just the right time, you can become rich. Some stock pickers have done well over long periods, too.But before you jump headlong into stock picking, you may want to consider the odds. It\u2019s not just that bull markets like this one eventually come to an end. It\u2019s that over the long run, while the total stock market has prospered, most individual stocks have not.A new study by Hendrik Bessembinder, a finance professor at Arizona State University, demonstrates persuasively that while investing in the overall stock market makes sense, the obstacles facing individual stock pickers are formidable. It\u2019s much less risky to invest with diversified low-cost mutual funds.What\u2019s more, 58 percent of individual stocks since 1926 have failed to outperform one-month Treasury bills over their lifetimes, he found. That is a low bar, given the piddling returns on one-month Treasury bills, which now yield less than 1 percent.Professor Bessembinder found that a mere 4 percent of the stocks in the entire market \u2014 headed by Exxon Mobil and followed by Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and IBM \u2014 accounted for all of the net market returns from 1926 through 2015. By contrast, the most common single result for an individual stock over that period was a return of nearly negative 100 percent \u2014 almost a total loss.All that gloom about individual stocks may seem counterintuitive. After all, it\u2019s often said that stocks outperform bonds over the long haul. That\u2019s why long-term investors are generally advised to hold stocks in their portfolios.The problem is that the rosy long-term outlook for stocks, as opposed to bonds, is based entirely on the big picture. When you look more closely, the details are disconcerting.\u201cMany studies have shown that stocks outperform bonds over all, and I don\u2019t question that data at all,\u201d he said in an interview.How can those two sets of facts \u2014 the underperformance of the typical stock and the outperformance of the overall stock market \u2014 both be correct?It is because a relative handful of stocks tend to outperform all others by tremendous amounts.There is a technical explanation for this. Bear with me. In the language of statistics, the stock market generally has a positive skew \u2014 meaning, a relatively small number of outliers like Exxon or Apple have such great returns that they pull up the average stock, which has a mediocre showing. Put another way, the average return is higher than the median or typical return.What does all of this mean for investors?It does not imply that stock picking can\u2019t be successful or that it\u2019s wrong for those who do it with their eyes wide open. \u201cSome people who pick the right stocks can have lottery-like returns,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cThey may want to take that risk and do that.\u201dBut it does imply that most people picking stocks are unlikely to do well for very long.In response to a question, Professor Bessembinder said that he, personally, favors low-cost index mutual fund investing, through which he maintains a widely diversified portfolio of bonds and stocks.That is a less risky strategy \u2014 though investing in stocks always involves risks, perhaps especially in a period like this one, when stocks have been rising for a long while. And it\u2019s not a revolutionary approach by any means. It won\u2019t produce the stratospheric returns that are possible if you are able to pick the one stock that will outperform all others for the next several decades.\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that it will be a stock that we haven\u2019t even heard of,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said.If you are confident that you can identify that stock, good for you. I\u2019m sticking with dull, diversified mutual funds because I know that I can\u2019t.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "India\u2019s Bad Debt Is Looking Better to Investors", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 In India, the vultures are circling.These vultures are investors looking for opportunities in distressed assets and bad debts. For years they had avoided investing in India, put off by a creakingly slow legal system and a labyrinthine bureaucracy.But a new bankruptcy law and a move this month to give India\u2019s central bank expansive powers to tackle bad debt have excited investors both here and abroad who think investing in India\u2019s distressed market could produce double-digit returns.\u201cThe new bankruptcy laws have been given teeth, which finally makes Indian credit markets attractive to foreign investors,\u201d said Saleem Siddiqi, founder of Musst Investments, a family office in London. Mr. Siddiqi is creating an Indian merchant bank to invest in middle-market corporate loans.A test of the new approach came this month, when a tribunal in New Delhi dismissed an appeal by a steel company, Innoventive Industries, which was arguing, among other claims, that a state law allowed it to suspend its liability temporarily. The tribunal ruled that the country\u2019s new bankruptcy law prevailed.\u201cNow the first case is resolved, you will see an onslaught of deals from the big guys,\u201d says Ravi Chachra, managing partner of the Mumbai-based asset manager Eight Capital.The new bankruptcy law is aimed at cleaning up the nation\u2019s mountain of debt, making it easier to dissolve a company and recover money. In India, where parties can drag out bankruptcies for years, the law has an important feature requiring a bankruptcy to be completed within 180 days in the event of default.Mr. Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs partner, made a fortune buying into Japanese banks nearly 20 years ago, but struggled with some of the investments he made during the financial crisis.In India, Mr. Flowers noted, \u201cyou have a credit market which doesn\u2019t function very well because creditors can\u2019t collect on their debt and credit ends up in the wrong places.\u201d\u201cBorrowing costs are high and banks don\u2019t make money,\u201d he said. \u201cBad debt clogs the system.\u201dOne of the challenges investors like Mr. Flowers face is that so far, banks have been reluctant to swallow the big discounts that investors are demanding to acquire bad assets. Little more than $3 billion in nonperforming assets were sold to asset reconstruction companies in the 2016 fiscal year, according to a report from Credit Suisse.Some widely reported deals haven\u2019t materialized. The San Francisco-based asset manager Farallon Capital is no longer expected to acquire a 24 percent stake in the struggling Essar Steel.India\u2019s robust growth slowed recently as a result of the government\u2019s unexpected move last year to ban 86 percent of the nation\u2019s currency in an effort to root out \u201cblack money,\u201d currency on which taxes haven\u2019t been paid. The move has produced widespread shortages of cash. Economic growth is expected to face challenges as long as banks here are saddled with enormous bad debts.Long term, some foreign investors think the bankruptcy law change could have far-reaching ramifications for India\u2019s capital markets, the jet fuel of a soaring economy. Indian companies have historically relied on selling stocks or lining up bank loans to finance their activities. Corporate bonds represent a tiny fraction of capital-raising.\u201cFor the corporate bond market to develop in India, you need to have jurisprudence, you need to have recourse, you need to have laws, you need to have transparency,\u201d said Mr. Siddiqi of Musst Investments. \u201cThe way India deals with nonperforming loans will be a litmus test of that.\u201dIn addition to J. C. Flowers, other foreign players have set plans to participate in India\u2019s distressed-debt market.ICICI Bank of India and an affiliate of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management have agreed to work together in resolving debts in India \u201cin an effort to revitalize and turn around overleveraged borrowers.\u201d And Bain Capital and Piramal Enterprises, a diversified Indian company, have signed an accord to create a strategic partnership to invest in Indian restructurings.Both of the American firms are following in the footsteps of the restructuring investor Wilbur L. Ross, now the United States commerce secretary. Nearly a decade ago, Mr. Ross invested in the struggling Indian airline SpiceJet, helping turn around the company by installing new leadership before selling at a profit. It was among a handful of investments in India for Mr. Ross.In contrast with their solo forays into private equity, this time big foreign firms entering the distressed arena are largely choosing to team up with Indian firms.The Edelweiss Group, a Mumbai brokerage firm, signed an agreement last fall with Canada\u2019s second-biggest pension fund, Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec, for the Canadian fund to invest up to $700 million in distressed assets and private debt in India over four years. As part of the deal, Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t plans to take a 20 percent stake in Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company, which has about $5.4 billion in assets.In March, a Carlyle Group fund, which owned an 8.2 percent stake in Mr. Ramaswamy\u2019s brokerage firm, Edelweiss, sold its holding for about $130 million.Many foreign firms have been waiting for the first big test of the bankruptcy legislation.In 2016, ICICI began an insolvency proceeding against Innoventive, the first move by a bank to recover assets under the new law. Innoventive fought back, arguing that a special act by the state of Maharashtra, where the company is based, had resulted in suspension of the company\u2019s liabilities for a year, thus nullifying ICICI Bank\u2019s claim at the time.After a hearing, the National Company Law Tribunal, the body adjudicating cases under the new bankruptcy law, moved to admit the case. Undeterred, Innoventive challenged the constitutional validity of the new law.The recent ruling upholding the law does not guarantee clear sailing ahead, however.\u201cThere will be some teething problems,\u201d says Srini Sriniwasan, managing director at Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd., a unit of the Indian bank Kotak Mahindra.Still, he is optimistic about the efficacy of the new bankruptcy law. \u201cThe speed at which the insolvency code was introduced and implemented is remarkable by Indian standards, \u201d he said.Kotak has enjoyed a ringside seat while watching India\u2019s distressed market swell.The glass-walled building Mr. Sriniwasan sits in, in Mumbai\u2019s Bandra Kurla complex, was built by a finance company. It had been allotted the land in an auction more than a decade ago.When the firm failed, Kotak started buying some of the debt underlying the property from other public-sector banks.An auction was set to sell off the property, but before it could proceed, Kotak had acquired all the nonperforming loans \u2014 and in doing so, secured ownership of the property.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drama in Washington Rattles Wall Street, and Stocks Dive", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byConfidence in President Trump\u2019s agenda to stoke economic growth was questioned Wednesday, as stocks tumbled and the dollar weakened.The sell-off was startling because it followed months of a steadily climbing, tranquil stock market, a rally that came to be known as the Trump bump. And domestic employment and corporate profits have been strong, usually a boon for stocks.Yet investors, who have shrugged off previous turmoil in the Trump administration, were clearly rattled by the most recent episode. Some on Wall Street speculated about whether the White House\u2019s pro-business pledges to cut taxes, lighten regulation and increase infrastructure would be thwarted by the growing tumult in Washington. Some bank analysts even discussed the probability of impeachment.And at a gathering of big money managers in Las Vegas, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said he was worried about the stability of Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201cI think it\u2019s a reasonable concern, obviously,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. He later added that after years of a strong economy, statistically speaking, it was time for a slowdown.\u201cOver the next four years,\u201d he told an audience of hundreds of investors, \u201cthere is a pretty good chance we\u2019ll have a downturn.\u201dThe question is whether it began on Wednesday.Investors flocked to markets considered safer in times of political risk. The price of gold rose nearly 2 percent, while Treasury securities rallied. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for many interest rates, fell to 2.22 percent from 2.33 percent on Tuesday. (Yields and prices move in the opposite direction.)But the revelations on Tuesday that a memo written by Mr. Comey detailed a plea by Mr. Trump to shut down a federal investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over his ties to Russia, seemed to be more than investors could stomach.\u201cThis piece of news, the market appears to be acting differently towards,\u201d said Curtis Schenker, co-founder of Scoggin Capital Management. \u201cFor the first time, there is real concern that Trump has overstepped his boundaries, which may create some chaos in the market.\u201dThe political risk has existed for months, with Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative Twitter posts drawing scrutiny. Questions have been raised about links to Russia in his campaign team and administration, and the White House has fumbled its legislative agenda.Yet throughout the president\u2019s first months in office, stock investors focused not on the questions and the missteps, but on the pro-business policies he had promised.These included health care changes that would save the government money, paving the way for lower taxes, and help private insurers. One important pledge has been lighter regulation to help banks redeploy their capital and speed infrastructure projects. Perhaps the most anticipated change is a tax overhaul that would lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, helping big corporations and small businesses alike.\u201cEquities had been rallying for a long time, without much of a pause,\u201d Stephen Jen, a London-based hedge fund manager, wrote by email Wednesday. \u201cTo the extent that the political noises in the U.S. further reduce the prospect of market-boosting measures such as tax cuts,\u201d he added, \u201ca correction in the risk assets,\u201d in this case, stocks, \u201cmakes sense.\u201dWednesday\u2019s rout was so unexpected that, even with stock futures sagging early, few research notes analyzing the implications of the Comey news were written.Traders said on Wednesday morning that concerns about the Comey memo could easily blow over, as other recent indications of presidential dysfunction had. But by midmorning, that confidence appeared to be fading.In Las Vegas, where investors had gathered for the annual SALT hedge fund conference, participants spent the early morning catching up on the news from overnight. Outside a ballroom at the Bellagio Hotel, where the meeting was being held, some people hovered near a television screen tracking the S.&P. 500.In his remarks, Mr. Bernanke described Mr. Trump as a \u201cvery unprecedented, unusual person\u201d with no government background who would have a harder time pushing through tax reforms and infrastructure changes because of his low approval ratings.Analysts at Japan\u2019s Nomura bank wrote that, while \u201cimpeachment still seems a distant prospect,\u201d the \u201cnegative impacts that the latest developments have on Trump\u2019s ability to pursue his policy agenda could be more important for markets.\u201dStill, not every investor was unnerved. With the United States job market robust, the prospect of improving growth and a season of healthy corporate earnings ending, the domestic economy is in good shape, some investors said.That strong foundation cannot be undermined by possible presidential misconduct, they argued, no matter how serious.In the absence of more negative economic factors a sustained sell-off in the markets was hard to envisage, Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note to clients.\u201cWe might see a bigger drawdown,\u201d or dip in the markets, \u201cbut it is likely to be both limited and reasonably short-lived,\u201d Mr. McMillan wrote. \u201cThere will be a time to worry, but right now, despite the very real issues being debated, we are still in a good place as investors.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump Effect on C.E.O. Pay", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byFair GameAfter the November election, the stock market experienced a Trump bump. The surge in share prices thrilled investors, but some corporate executives had even more reason to celebrate. That\u2019s because rising prices can fuel higher pay even if other corporate results are so-so, which seems to be the case for some companies right now.Total shareholder returns were explosive \u2014 up 14 percent for the median company. A close look at the numbers suggests that the levitating 2016 stock market was a powerful driver of C.E.O. pay last year, and the bull market seems to have made shareholders less likely to complain about the pay increases executives received. Yet there are serious questions concerning the ties between executive pay and a company\u2019s stock performance.But calibrating how much weight a stock price should have on C.E.O. pay is tricky: A company\u2019s stock price can be influenced by share buybacks and other financial engineering that does little to produce long-term value. Why reward a C.E.O. for that?Something similar may have happened after last year\u2019s presidential election. Call it the Trump effect on C.E.O. pay.By early November, many stocks were barely up on the year \u2014 the S.&P. 500 had eked out a mere 2 percent gain. But after the election, the overall market rallied on expectations of the incoming Trump administration\u2019s pro-business agenda. The S.&P. 500 wound up almost 10 percent higher for 2016.For an outsider, determining precisely how a company assesses a performance metric is difficult, of course. But the lift from the Trump effect seems to have been most pronounced among industries in which investors believed the administration\u2019s deregulatory fervor would be greatest and thus lead to lower costs and more profits.The financial arena is a prime example. Throughout most of 2016, the S.&P. Financial Select Sector Index bounced around a narrow range, essentially trading flat on the year. But it took off after the election, soaring to a 20 percent gain by year\u2019s end. Investor assumptions that the new administration would roll back the Dodd-Frank Act and generally reduce restrictions on financial activities powered this move.There are 31 finance executives on Equilar\u2019s highest-paid C.E.O. list for 2016. Over half of them \u2014 17 \u2014 got raises last year, and each of the 17 companies used shareholder returns as a metric in determining their pay. Ten of those C.E.O.s received double-digit increases.The highest-paid finance executive was Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. His total compensation was $27.2 million, nearly a 50 percent increase from the $18.2 million he received in 2015, according to Equilar.In the top 200 rankings, Equilar relied on standard compensation figures required in proxies by the Securities and Exchange Commission. JPMorgan supplied those figures, but in another section of its proxy, it listed Mr. Dimon\u2019s pay as $28 million in 2016 and $27 million in 2015, so according to the financial firm, Mr. Dimon\u2019s pay increased by just $1 million, or nearly 4 percent.In detailing Mr. Dimon\u2019s pay, the proxy noted that the bank gained market share in most of its businesses and generated record net income and earnings per share. The fact that JPMorgan\u2019s total shareholder return was 35 percent for the year isn\u2019t lost on investors.Shareholders seem relatively content with Mr. Dimon\u2019s package. At the bank\u2019s annual meeting in mid-May, 92 percent of votes cast approved its pay practices, the same percentage as last year.Several executives in the top 10 are in the media or tech industries.Investors in most other financial companies did well \u2014 only five showed a decline in total shareholder returns for 2016.However, while 12 of the finance companies\u2019 shares outperformed the sector stock index, 19 did not. In spite of this underperformance, 10 of the 19 companies awarded their C.E.O.s higher pay, and some of the increases were significant.It looks like a very sweet game: Heads I win, tails you lose.One fortunate chief executive was Arthur M. Coppola, a co-founder of the Macerich Company, a real estate investment trust in Santa Monica, Calif. Although revenues at the company fell 19 percent in 2016 and its shares lost 9 percent, Mr. Coppola received $13.5 million, a 2.6 percent increase over last year.Thomas O\u2019Hern, Macerich\u2019s chief financial officer, said the bulk of Mr. Coppola\u2019s pay consisted of stock grants with three-year earn-out periods based on the company\u2019s performance against all public real estate investment trusts. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely he would end up earning that amount based on where we are today,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hern said.Shareholders are scheduled to vote on Macerich\u2019s pay practices on Thursday.Daniel H. Schulman at PayPal Holdings is another case in point. He received a compensation package valued at $19 million, a 31 percent increase over 2015. That pay raise far exceeded growth rates in the company\u2019s sales, which were up 17 percent, and earnings and shareholder returns, which both rose around 9 percent during the year.Amanda Coffee, a PayPal spokeswoman, said in a statement, \u201cThe majority of Dan Schulman\u2019s compensation is driven by performance; 2016 was an extraordinary year for PayPal as we delivered results that exceeded our targets and delivered double-digit growth across all key metrics.\u201dAt the company\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday, 95 percent of the votes cast favored PayPal\u2019s compensation practices.To be sure, the Trump bump didn\u2019t push every company\u2019s shares higher in 2016. As the pay rankings show, though, even a falling tide lifts the boats of some C.E.O.s.A total of 44 companies on the list had the same C.E.O. in place in 2015 and 2016 and also had declining shareholder returns. Yet at 23 of these companies, chief executives received raises in 2016.Among the bigger winners in this group was Steve Ells, the chief executive of Chipotle Mexican Grill. Even as his company\u2019s revenues fell 13 percent and its shares declined by 21 percent, Mr. Ells snared a 13 percent increase in pay, receiving $15.7 million in 2016.Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said most of Mr. Ells\u2019s raise last year came in the form of stock grants. \u201cThe 2016 award will not vest and therefore will be completely without any realizable value,\u201d he said, \u201cunless our stock price reaches an average of $700 per share for a period of at least 60 consecutive trading days before February 2019.\u201dMr. Arnold added that a 2013 grant, originally worth $8 million, had no value when it expired in 2016.Then there\u2019s Kimberly-Clark\u2019s C.E.O., Thomas J. Falk. He, too, received a 13 percent increase in pay, even as sales at his consumer products company fell 2 percent and its stock lost 7.5 percent.A Kimberly-Clark official said that its board believes the most accurate way to measure longer-term performance is to use multiyear total shareholder returns. \u201cThe company\u2019s three-year return is 24.9 percent and its five-year return is 90.3 percent,\u201d the official said in a statement, \u201cwhich demonstrates the value that Kimberly-Clark has delivered to shareholders under C.E.O. Tom Falk\u2019s leadership.\u201dSure enough, Kimberly-Clark\u2019s shareholders seem content with Mr. Falk\u2019s pay. At the company\u2019s annual meeting in April, only 3.3 percent of the votes cast opposed its pay practices.It\u2019s hard for investors to think analytically when the market has been rising. That\u2019s precisely why skepticism about soaring pay is important right now.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buying Into the Turmoil: Investors Embrace the Risks", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byBuy the dip.Be it stocks, bonds or more complex derivative bets, investors following this Wall Street maxim have reaped robust rewards in recent years.Such buying has been evident in the shares of large American companies since March 2009, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index touched a low of 666. (It closed on Wednesday at 2,399.63.)Yet as stock markets hit record highs and the yields on volatile junk and emerging market bonds plunge, this view that market corrections should be seen as a buying opportunity, as opposed to a warning to be heeded, has begun to worry investors.The fear is that each subsequent rebound will embolden excessive risk taking and inflate richly valued stock and bond markets.Investors have repeatedly shaken off the risks of political turmoil, including the latest shock, President Trump\u2019s firing of James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, the S.&P. 500 ended the day up 0.11 percent, while the VIX was still near its decade lows, at 10.21.\u201cNo one has been penalized for buying the dip,\u201d said Bill Luby, an independent investor and active blogger who specializes in trades connected to the VIX.Until recently, he has been an active participant in Wall Street\u2019s most popular trade: Betting against VIX futures with the expectation that market volatility will remain quiescent.Now, he is worried about what will happen when the dip becomes something more severe than just a temporary dip, and the index bolts higher as investors panic.\u201cThat trade is really loaded up,\u201d Mr. Luby said. \u201cIt won\u2019t take much of a spike to cause a lot of pain.\u201dShorting, or betting against, the VIX is not the only trade of late where investors have been handsomely compensated for setting aside their fears.Investors have been snapping up government bonds issued by countries like Russia, Turkey and even Mongolia, enticed by mouthwatering yields and a perception that economic and political risks, which previously warned investors away, are no longer so severe.And in the United States stock market, stock pickers continue to ignore sky-high valuations of stocks and the market as a whole, buying up index giants like Amazon, which has a price-to-earnings ratio of 136, Apple and Facebook at the slightest sign of weakness.Few are predicting an outright market collapse.Economic growth, at home and abroad, is picking up, and the earnings for companies listed on the S.&P. 500 have been strong. And even with the political upheaval in Washington, most market participants remain convinced that the Trump administration\u2019s pledges for lower taxes and lighter regulation will provide ballast to the market.And with bank deposits and bonds from developed countries still offering meager returns, stocks and higher-risk fixed-income securities have come to be seen as the default option for investment managers looking to the long term.Nevertheless, the combination of complacency and rising markets has prompted a growing number to become more cautious.\u201cWe have been in a long up cycle and valuations are above average,\u201d said Bradley J. Vogt, a portfolio manager who invests in large capitalization United States stocks for the Capital Group, the Los Angeles-based fund giant that oversees $1.4 trillion. \u201cI am holding more cash than I usually hold in my funds right now.\u201dTo be sure, some of this recent spate of buying can be explained as investors looking for bargains in beaten-down areas \u2014 like emerging markets.Having lagged the broader rally in recent years, these markets took a further hit in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Currencies tumbled and investors took flight, fearful of the administration\u2019s anti-trade policies and a resurgent dollar, not to mention the usual dose of political turmoil.Nishant X. Upadhyay, an emerging market bond investor at HSBC Global Asset Management, took the opportunity late last year to buy Turkish government bonds, betting that worries about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his political ambitions were overdone.It was a winning trade \u2014 bond yields have fallen and the lira has strengthened substantially. Now, billions of dollars (Mr. Upadhyay estimates over $30 billion last quarter) are flowing into emerging market bonds as investors rush in to get a piece of the action.\u201cNo doubt the spreads are tightening,\u201d he said, in describing how the recent boom in the asset class has made them less attractive relative to lower-yielding bonds in developed markets. \u201cAnd there are risks out there. But the question is: Do you want to be sitting in cash right now or investing your dollars in alternative markets?\u201dFund managers with a long memory argue that while it may be true that markets are richly priced, it would be a mistake for investors to try to predict when markets will fall and remove their funds accordingly.Especially now, when cash and safe government bonds are such unattractive alternatives in terms of investment returns.Indeed, for all the ups and downs in the stock market over the last five years, the total return of the S.&P. 500 stock index is up close to 15 percent \u2014 beating most of the opportunities available to investors.\u201cThe view we frequently hear today is, \u2018aren\u2019t stocks expensive now given S.&P. price to earnings multiple,\u2019 which is at a 15 to 20 percent premium to the historical average,\u201d said William C. Nygren, who has been investing in United States stocks, under the Oakmark Funds brand, at Harris Associates in Chicago for more than 30 years.Making market timing bets have been a \u201ckiss of death\u201d for investors over the years as stocks continue to rise over the long term, he said.And that holds true for today, he believes.\u201cWe have better economic growth looking forward the next five years than we do looking backward,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cAnd alternative asset classes offer returns that are exceedingly low.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Stock Market, International Is Actually First", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIf you had taken his words at face value, you might have expected that big American companies that make nearly all of their money in the United States would flourish in a new, America First environment.But that\u2019s not the way it has turned out, at least not in the stock market so far.Shares of American companies that make nearly all of their sales domestically have lagged behind those that generate most of their revenue outside American borders. In fact, those globalized companies \u2014 I\u2019ll call them International First companies \u2014 have outperformed America First companies by a wide margin.Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, ran the numbers at my request. He found that 113 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index make at least 50 percent of their sales outside the United States. Their fortunes depend, to a large extent, on the rest of the world\u2019s economic trends.By contrast, the America First category contains 161 S.&.P. 500 companies that make at least 90 percent of their sales within the United States. The group includes retailers like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Target, railroads like CSX and Norfolk Southern, and regional natural gas and petroleum companies like Southwestern Energy, Range Resources and Pioneer Natural. All of their fortunes are determined mainly by events and policies within the United States.While each stock has its own story, Mr. Hickey said he found a clear pattern in the overall data. From the presidential election on Nov. 8 through this past Tuesday, he said, shares in the International First group gained an average 13.56 percent, compared with only 8.15 percent for the America First shares, for a spread of 5.41 percentage points.Why have the internationally oriented companies outperformed the domestically focused ones? Several factors explain the discrepancy.First, the initial wild enthusiasm in financial markets for Trump policies faded.\u201cThere was a lot of optimism by people in the markets about America First policies right after the election,\u201d Mr. Hickey said, \u201cbut in 2017 in actual terms, that has been completely flipped.\u201dSoon after the election, when the Trump rally in the overall stock market had the most momentum, the America First companies did outperform the International First group. The markets may then have been reacting to Mr. Trump\u2019s publicly stated views, which he summarized in his inaugural address this way: \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our product, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\u201dAmerican companies with little foreign exposure maintained an advantage in the stock market until mid-March, when the tables turned and the International First group pulled ahead.More precisely, measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar peaked in strength on Jan. 3 \u2014 with a 6.53 percent gain since the election \u2014 and then began to plummet. On Thursday, the dollar was still stronger than it had been on Election Day, but by less than 1 percent.Some of that decline may have been simple mean reversion, a tendency of markets to return to an average level after a big move. But there was more to it than that.Domestic problems \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s political struggles, and Congress\u2019s inability to enact major legislation \u2014 may have led the stock market to ignore the Trump agenda. That helps globalized companies.\u201cYou don\u2019t hear much about America First policies these days,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut it\u2019s becoming clear that even if you don\u2019t get thorough tax policy reform done or a big infrastructure stimulus program done, the stock market isn\u2019t falling apart. Instead, the stocks that are leading the market now are not America First plays, they are international plays \u2014 companies geared toward international exposure that benefit from a weaker dollar and better growth overseas.\u201dThen there is the tax question. Despite the political turmoil in Washington, tax cuts and a possible windfall for the International First companies remain on the table. The administration still aims at repatriating at least some of the $2 trillion in stranded overseas corporate cash and ending the taxation of newly minted corporate profits earned abroad. Market analysts are already calculating the potential benefits to companies with substantial foreign earnings and big cash hoards, like Apple.Put all of that together, and you get a recipe for a rally in International First companies. America First may be the administration\u2019s slogan, but for the most part, the stock market has been ignoring it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "John Paulson\u2019s Fall From Hedge Fund Stardom", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "The hedge fund Paulson & Company manages just under $10 billion today, down from $36 billion in 2011.Supported byJohn A. Paulson is one of the best-known names in the hedge fund industry. But these days, Mr. Paulson is having more success in the political realm than he is managing his business.Mr. Paulson, 61, was one of the first people on Wall Street to back Donald J. Trump\u2019s bid for the presidency. He counseled Mr. Trump on economic matters during the campaign. He gave $250,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. And he recently visited President Trump at the White House for a \u201cC.E.O. Town Hall.\u201dBut his investors are unlikely to be impressed by his political access. His firm, Paulson & Company, has recorded nearly double-digit losses in several of its larger funds as of the end of March.Mr. Paulson\u2019s struggles come after a gut-wrenching 2016, when he recorded even steeper losses in those funds, partly because of several wrong-footed bets on drug makers, including the troubled Valeant Pharmaceuticals. That followed a painful 2015, when investors first balked and began pulling their money from his firm.A representative of Mr. Paulson declined a request for an interview with him. His funds are said to have performed better in April, said a person with knowledge of the firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cIt is clear that Paulson has dug in with both heels and committed to steering the firm through this period,\u201d said David Black, founder of Quadra Advisors, a recruiting firm for hedge funds and other investment firms.Nonetheless, his assets under management continue shrinking. Paulson & Company manages just under $10 billion today, down from $36 billion in 2011. Nearly two years ago, some Wall Street banks began to recommend that investors redeem some of their money from the firm.And while Mr. Paulson is not the only hedge fund manager to see large investors pull their money in recent years, he has become a symbol of what some pension funds have taken issue with for the industry at large: big fees for little reward and little originality.Mr. Paulson has remained upbeat with investors, according to two people who have seen recent investor letters but spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWhile we are disappointed in performance in 2016, we believe we have a path to a recovery,\u201d Mr. Paulson told investors in one letter.But it has not been smooth sailing. In another letter to investors of a merger arbitrage fund that declined by 49 percent last year, Mr. Paulson called 2016 \u201cthe most challenging year since inception.\u201d In May, Mr. Paulson will address his investors at a meeting at Claridge\u2019s Hotel in London.Mr. Paulson\u2019s fall from stock-trading stardom underscores a common disclaimer in industry parlance: Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.In early 2007, Mr. Paulson, who started his firm in 1994, was still a relatively unknown hedge fund manager. A former Bear Stearns investment banker, he had a reputation for running a solid if boring hedge fund that made bets on the outcomes of various mergers and acquisitions.But as the housing market began to show signs of overheating, Mr. Paulson had a hunch that home loans to borrowers with spotty credit histories \u2014 which were ballooning at the time \u2014 were about to go sour. He positioned his firm to benefit in the event of a huge failure of the subprime mortgage market.It was a bet that few were willing to take, but one that resulted in a major payday for him and his firm, and was later referred to as \u201cThe Greatest Trade Ever,\u201d in a book by the reporter Gregory Zuckerman.After the financial crisis, investors flocked to Mr. Paulson\u2019s firm, which is in Midtown Manhattan, a stone\u2019s throw from Rockefeller Center.For several years, Paulson & Company continued to make money for some of his investors, but the performance increasingly grew bumpy. This was particularly true for the firm\u2019s flagship Advantage fund. It lost 36 percent in 2011 and plunged another 14 percent in 2012, but rallied to post a 26 percent gain in 2013, according to an HSBC industry report and people with knowledge of the firm\u2019s performance. The losses were amplified in Advantage Plus, a version of the fund that uses leverage to enhance returns.Over the last three years, Advantage has consecutively recorded double-digit losses. Some of Mr. Paulson\u2019s merger funds, credit funds and gold funds have posted positive returns, but the overall picture has not been pretty.Health care bets, in particular those on pharmaceutical companies, have proved especially punishing for Mr. Paulson and his investors. Losing wagers on economic recoveries in Greece and Puerto Rico haven\u2019t helped.Some of Mr. Paulson\u2019s top talent have moved on. Putnam Coes, his former chief operating officer, left the firm in September. Soon after, John Reade, a senior vice president who was based in London, left.Despite his losses, Mr. Paulson is still making new and speculative investments. In November, Paulson made an investment in Didi Chuxing, a fast-growing Chinese ride-hailing firm that signed a deal to acquire Uber Technologies\u2019 operations in China.One bright spot could be a bet on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has pledged to return the mortgage finance giants to free-standing publicly traded companies, a development that could make Mr. Paulson\u2019s funds big profits. Mr. Paulson and Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, once worked together to pull OneWest Bank out of the wreckage of IndyMac, a lender that the federal government seized in 2008.Several new funds the firm has started are posting positive returns, too.\u201cWe remain confident in the long-term relationship we have with Paulson,\u201d said Christopher Zook of CAZ Investments, a Texas wealth management firm that recently rotated out of the poorly performing Paulson Special Situations fund into a newer Paulson fund.And Mr. Paulson and other hedge fund managers stand to be big beneficiaries of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to slash taxes.Yet 2017 is shaping up as another rough one for Mr. Paulson. The Advantage fund was down 9.7 percent as of the end of March and the Partners Enhanced fund continues to sink \u2014 falling just over 8 percent after last year\u2019s 49 percent plunge.But, as the financial magazine recently noted, he is now $2 billion poorer.Advertisement"}

Jana refused.On Wednesday, Whole Foods announced a sweeping overhaul:\u2022 Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive (who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times) is the new chairwoman.\u2022 Keith Manbeck, a former vice president of Kohl\u2019s, will be the new chief financial officer.\u2022 Five members of the board were replaced.\u201cWe pay attention to what our shareholders tell us,\u201d John Mackey, a founder and the chief executive of the retailer, said in an interview.Although the changes indicate the growing influence that activist investors have over companies, there is still discontent among shareholders.Neuberger Berman wrote to the board last week, urging Whole Foods to consider \u201cpossible strategic mergers, partnerships, joint ventures, alliances\u201d and internal investments.Has the good will around Snap\u2019s debut been as ephemeral as the messages sent on its network?The company disappointed investors with a $2.2 billion loss for the first quarter, lighter revenue than expected, and a sharp slowdown in the growth of its user numbers.Evan Spiegel, one of the founders, may like to say that bigger is not better, but Wall Street still uses Facebook as a benchmark.By that measure, Snap is starting to look more like Twitter, another social network struggling with anemic growth in the number of users.And even though its executives have cautioned that results could be \u201clumpy and unpredictable\u201d as it focuses on the quality of engagement rather than the number of users, investors still punished the stock on Wednesday, with shares plummeting more than 25 percent in after-hours trading.The tactic has paid off in recent years, but the view that market corrections should be seen as buying opportunities (rather than warnings) could lead to more excessive risk taking and might inflate richly valued stock and bond markets.Take Bill Luby, an independent investor who specializes in trades connected to the VIX, a measure of how sharply investors think stocks will shoot up and down.The VIX was still near decade-long lows \u2014 indicating low levels of market volatility \u2014 even after President Trump fired James B.

{"Headline": "Stocks Are Responding to Washington. That\u2019s Bad News for Markets.", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsWall Street is finally waking up to the reality in Washington. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1.8 percent on Wednesday in the most notable reversal to the so-called Trump rally since last year\u2019s election. Stockholders nevertheless remain too optimistic about any policy uplift.The promise of relaxed regulation, corporate tax cuts, and investment in America\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges under President Trump and a Republican Congress has excited investors for most of the past six months.Clinging to that cheery outlook required overlooking a plethora of warning signals, not least the daily dysfunction in the nation\u2019s capital and the possibility of detrimental decisions on matters such as trade. There were also the slapdash efforts at overhauling United States health care and regular leaks about investigations into potential links between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling into the election.Investors elsewhere have expressed a good deal of concern about the chances of Congress\u2019s passing legislation that might buoy both the economy and corporate bottom lines. The United States dollar index is right back where it was in early November. The 10-year Treasury yield, after soaring to 2.6 percent from under 2 percent, has retreated to 2.2 percent.The biggest market slump since September means equity investors are getting rattled, too. For that to happen, though, it took news that Mr. Trump had asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end an investigation into the administration\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn \u2014 along with the ensuing fallout, which has stirred mention of the word impeachment on Capitol Hill.There are, of course, other factors behind the stock market surge. For example, nearly all S & P 500 constituents have reported first-quarter results, revealing average profit growth of about 15 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Interest rates are low, and the employment picture is solid.Even after Wednesday\u2019s wobble, however, bank shares have jumped by more than a fifth, and the broader market is still up by some 13 percent since Mr. Trump won at the polls. That translates into a valuation of about 25 times earnings, a multiple hard to justify without at least factoring in ancillary benefits such as a tax cut. It should mean there is a bigger D.C. discount in store.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Route to Air Travel Discomfort Starts on Wall Street", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byBut ultimately, the episode was set in motion elsewhere \u2014 on Wall Street.Relentless pressure on corporate America is creating an increasingly Dickensian experience for many consumers as companies focus on maximizing profit. And nowhere is the trend as stark as in the airline industry, whose service is delivered in an aluminum tube packed with up to four different classes, cheek by jowl, 35,000 feet in the air.\u201cThere\u2019s always been pressure from Wall Street,\u201d said Robert L. Dilenschneider, a veteran public relations executive who advises companies and chief executives on strategic communications. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been watching this for 30 years, and it\u2019s never been as intense as it is today.\u201dRich bonus packages for top executives are now largely tied to short-term income targets and fatter profit margins instead of customer service. Of course, bolstering profits \u2014 and in turn, stock prices \u2014 has always been a big part of management\u2019s responsibility to shareholders, but making it virtually the only criterion for executive pay is new.Five years ago, American Airlines factored in on-time arrivals, lost baggage and consumer complaints to help calculate annual incentive payments for top management. Today, these bonuses are based exclusively on the company\u2019s pretax income and cost savings.United has also scaled back bonuses linked to reliability and customer satisfaction for senior executives in recent years. But in the wake of what happened in April, bonuses \u201cwill be made more comprehensively subject to progress in 2017 on significant improvement in the customer experience,\u201d the company said in a financial filing.\u201cFifteen years ago, airlines competed with each other over who could buy the most planes or have the most routes,\u201d said Jamie Baker, a top airline industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cExecutives are just as competitive today, but it\u2019s about who can achieve an investment-grade rating first, who can be a component in the S. & P. 500, and who has better returns for investors.\u201dThese new incentives also partly explain why airlines are packing seats more densely and squeezing more passengers into the back of the plane. \u201cDensification is driven by the desire to sweat the assets and generate revenues without having to commit capital to building new planes,\u201d Mr. Baker said.Such a shift isn\u2019t unique to the airline industry.\u201cAs in other industries, like manufacturing or consumer goods, the focus is on more traditional financial metrics like pretax income, margins, return on capital and total shareholder return,\u201d said Andrew Goldstein, head of the executive compensation practice in North America for Willis Towers Watson. \u201cAirlines haven\u2019t abandoned operational and customer-service metrics, but they are putting less emphasis on those factors.\u201dAnd with the economy growing at a rate of only 2 percent while the stock market rallies on promises of soaring earnings, something must give so profit margins can grow.In the case of United or Spirit Airlines, whose repeated cancellations led to a melee among travelers this month at a terminal in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., it was customer service. At other companies, like Ford and Alcoa, it was the head of the chief executive that was served up when profits failed to meet expectations.Mature industries \u2014 where double-digit annual profit growth is a reach in the best of times \u2014 are especially vulnerable to activist investors\u2019 demands for board seats, bigger stock repurchases and other short-term financial rewards.The pressure is especially brutal in the airline industry because the key expense, fuel, is for the most part beyond management control. Yet airline executives have largely convinced Wall Street that the bad old days of bankruptcies and fare wars are over, replaced by the kind of predictable annual profits more common among industrial companies.That\u2019s among the reasons fees have popped up in recent years for everything from checking bags to securing an assigned seat before boarding. Known on Wall Street as ancillary revenue, this stream of income is especially favored by investors because it doesn\u2019t swing sharply the way fares do.And so far, despite occasional bouts of air rage and frequent consumer complaints, Wall Street has been getting what it wants.United\u2019s stock has surged to more than $80 per share from $25 per share five years ago, with profit margins rising to 13.6 percent from 3.7 percent over the same period. Overall industry margins hit 16.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent in 2012.Spirit\u2019s operating margins are among the highest in the industry, topping 20 percent in 2015 and 2016. But Paul Berry, a company spokesman, said Spirit had pivoted to focus more on customer service in the last year, even as some larger rivals keep cutting costs to compete.Despite rewarding top executives strictly according to financial targets, American said it, too, was committed to improving the passenger experience.\u201cEvery single person at American knows we succeed or fail based on how well we serve customers,\u201d said Joshua Freed, a company spokesman. \u201cWe will only meet those financial goals if we keep our customers happy.\u201dStill, the promise of steady profit growth has prompted even Warren E. Buffett to take a fresh look at airline stocks. He once famously called the industry a money-losing \u201cdeath trap,\u201d but reversed course late last year, with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, acquiring stakes in several airlines.\u201cIn the past, airline stocks were seen as hazardous to one\u2019s wealth,\u201d said Mr. Baker, the JPMorgan analyst. \u201cThey were trading vehicles, and potential destroyers of capital.\u201dThe pressure on United, American and other giants is only going to increase with the rise of so-called ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant. In fact, American and United are rolling out a stripped-down new class called Basic Economy.Here, in exchange for the cheapest tickets, fliers can\u2019t choose their seats before checking in and are more likely to be stuck in the middle of the row. They board last and are less likely to be able to sit with companions. No carry-on luggage is permitted, forcing anyone without elite frequent-flier status to check anything larger than a backpack \u2014 for a fee.\u201cThat\u2019s the experience on a ultra-low-cost carrier,\u201d said Rajeev Lalwani, an airline industry analyst with Morgan Stanley. As the legacy airlines introduce similar no-frills offerings to hold off upstarts like Spirit, he said, \u201cpart of the idea is to get folks to upgrade to premium economy and collect fees.\u201dIt\u2019s also the wave of the future, at least for budget-conscious travelers.\u201cFor the lowest price comes the most basic product,\u201d said Alan Wise, a senior partner with the Boston Consulting Group, who leads the firm\u2019s travel and tourism practice for North America. \u201cSpirit has been a growth story in the space, and it\u2019s forced the legacy carriers to adapt and innovate.\u201dTo be sure, some industry veterans insist it is a mistake to simply blame investors or hedge-fund managers for fostering a race to the bottom in customer service.\u201cThe response isn\u2019t to Wall Street. It\u2019s to customer behavior,\u201d said Alex Dichter, a senior partner at McKinsey who works with major airlines. \u201cAbout 35 percent of customers are choosing on price, and price alone, and another 35 percent choose mostly on price.\u201dMr. Dichter noted that when American added two to four inches of legroom in coach in the early 2000s, \u201cas far as I know, the airline didn\u2019t see one bit of improvement in market share or pricing.\u201d\u201cThe great irony is that most C.E.O.s would love to compete on product and experience,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s much more fun. The problem is that customers aren\u2019t paying attention to that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Sephora Is Thriving Amid a Retail Crisis", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byIt was hard to tell if the opening of Sephora\u2019s new store near Herald Square was a red carpet affair or a girl\u2019s night out at the spa. A D.J. played techno-pop while guests sipped Mo\u00ebt Champagne and dabbed Jo Malone on their wrists. One 20-something wrapped her hair in a paper headband while an attendant dabbed cream on her cheeks. Another stood before a screen with a front-facing camera and sampled virtual eyelashes, swiping left to explore an array of styles before committing to the real thing.\u201cOh! Do another!\u201d said her friend, who was snapping photographs. \u201cThis is so much fun.\u201d\u201cFor the older consumer it can be confusing,\u201d said Karen Grant, the global beauty industry analyst at the NPD Group. \u201cBut for the younger consumer, it\u2019s like, \u2018Wheeeee! Look at that! Look at that!\u2019 It\u2019s all about play. And the more time you stay in the store or online, the more money you are likely to spend.\u201dMs. Grant estimates that two out of five women between ages 18 and 54 wear five or more makeup products every day. \u201cIt defines the selfie-obsessed, image-driven culture of our time,\u201d she said.Deborah Yeh, Sephora\u2019s senior vice president for marketing and branding, said: \u201cThe lady at the counter has been replaced by hundreds of people on YouTube. There are more voices. And we are trying to cut through the confusion,\u201d in part by allowing customers to try before they buy.Rebecca Pahle, a writer and editor in Manhattan, visits the two Sephora stores near her Times Square office twice a month. \u201cIt is easy to kill time, play around with things and then spend more money than I should,\u201d Ms. Pahle said. \u201cI am experimenting a lot, trying to figure out what I like.\u201d She doesn\u2019t shop at department stores. \u201cI don\u2019t associate them with makeup,\u201d she said.What she appreciates most is autonomy. \u201cAt Sephora they ignore me, which I like,\u201d Ms. Pahle said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the hard sell.\u201dIn 2015, Sephora opened its Innovation Lab in a converted warehouse in San Francisco to experiment with ways to combine mobile apps and in-store shopping into a cohesive experience. As a result of their efforts, customers can have as little or as much personal contact they want in stores like the one at Herald Square, which Ms. Yeh called the company\u2019s \u201cstore of the future.\u201dNow department stores are scrambling to follow suit. In a few months, Bloomingdale\u2019s will begin a major renovation of its cosmetics department, which could take as much as a year to complete. \u201cThe new in-store experience will have more technology and an ability to \u2018play,\u2019\u201d said Francine Klein, who oversees cosmetics at Bloomingdale\u2019s. \u201cThe challenge is to keep pace.\u201dKohl\u2019s, meanwhile, has revamped all of its beauty stores, adding high-end brands like Lorac and Bliss. And last year, Barnes & Noble began testing the Glossary, its beauty-store-within-a-bookstore, on college campuses, among them William & Mary, Emory and Tulane. There, students can test brands without having to leave campus.Naturally, the changing industry makes traditional brands nervous. Of particular discomfort to some is that Sephora is owned by LVMH, and thus stocks many of the brands the group owns, including Make Up For Ever, Fresh, Benefit, Givenchy, Guerlain and Dior. This has led to complaints among beauty companies that fear an even more powerful Sephora will favor LVMH brands or new cosmetic makers that appeal more to millennials than heritage brands.Ms. Yeh pointed to Sephora\u2019s partnership with Est\u00e9e Lauder to create the Est\u00e9e Edit, a line of brightly colored lipsticks and eye shadows marketed to millennials, as an example of the company\u2019s broad-mindedness. Even so, an update doesn\u2019t mean much if those young consumers don\u2019t buy it.\u201cNow everything is agnostic, and you have to play differently,\u201d said Ms. Grant, the NPD Group analyst. \u201cYou just have to get the traffic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the American financier now had a bold new idea: Court Saudi money to invest in projects like tunnels, bridges, airports and other sorely needed infrastructure improvements, predominantly in the United States.That investment vehicle, which Blackstone plans to double in size, represents a new focus for the firm. More important, the fund \u2014 announced during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and a summit meeting of global chief executives that Mr. Schwarzman attended \u2014 dovetails with a $1 trillion infrastructure initiative the Trump administration has promised, to be fueled by government partnerships with the private sector.\u201cNo one else is in all the categories of infrastructure, in all the regions of the world and all the different classes of infrastructure,\u201d Hamilton E. James, Blackstone\u2019s president, said in an interview after the deal was announced on Saturday. \u201cSo I think we have an opportunity to establish overnight a leadership position.\u201dIndeed, less than a week after the Public Investment Fund\u2019s contribution was revealed, Blackstone\u2019s marketing to other investors has already begun.But its pitch will be made in a crowded field. The low interest rates that led to richly valued stock and bond markets have made infrastructure investing increasingly attractive, and others are seeking similar opportunities.There may also be political hurdles. Blackstone\u2019s $40 billion push and others like it appear to be a bet that the Trump administration, while troubled by its own brand of volatility, will be able to unleash a wave of spending on roads, bridges and other public projects.Investments in projects like bridges and roads \u2014 either by taking stakes in existing infrastructure or by putting up money to build something new \u2014 are, by nature, often longer-term than the corporate buyouts and real estate deals that are typically associated with private equity firms.Yet they also have the benefit of being less volatile investments that produce steady returns.Infrastructure investments average returns of 10 percent a year, according to the data provider Preqin: less than an investment in a basket of stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index would have generated for much of the past decade, but without the wrenching ups and downs of the public market.\u201cThe appetite for infrastructure investing is really strong, and investors are currently looking to increase their exposure right now,\u201d said Tom Carr, an expert in infrastructure investing at Preqin. \u201cThe returns have been very stable, and because these are long-term investments, they sit very well in the portfolios of pension funds and insurance companies.\u201dIn North America, the territory where much of the infrastructure money is raised, fund-raising activity has been on a tear in recent years, with infrastructure investors now overseeing $376 billion, Preqin calculates.Still, there is a long road ahead. Private-sector investing in infrastructure is a nascent business in the United States, compared with countries like Canada and Australia.And while Mr. Trump has vowed to streamline the permitting process for construction projects and has proposed a budget earmarking $200 billion for infrastructure over the next 10 years, his handling of an F.B.I. investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia has raised doubts about what he can accomplish in Washington.Private equity experts also cautioned that the commitment of such a large sum to one fund by a single investor, as in Saudi Arabia\u2019s case, is highly unusual. While Blackstone will be making the investment decisions, navigating the merits of various deals with such a large and influential partner will add complexities that more diversified funds do not face.Some of those are practical, and others optical.\u201cIf I\u2019m driving from here to New York, do the tolls I pay contribute to the improvement of the roads I\u2019m on? Or is it returned to the Public Investment Fund?\u201d asked Simon Henderson, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has written extensively about the Saudi royal family and its economic plans. \u201cIn domestic political terms, that doesn\u2019t work.\u201dBlackstone executives say they are undaunted by the political opposition Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts may face, and note that their infrastructure fund plans began when Hillary Clinton was generally regarded as the most likely next president.\u201cI don\u2019t think we can wait or expect Washington to fundamentally change its ways,\u201d said Mr. James, who raised money for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cSo we try to set up our business to thrive regardless of what happens down there.\u201dHe added that, despite his boss\u2019s advisory role in the Trump administration, the White House was not involved in Blackstone\u2019s deal with the Saudis.Farther from the presidential limelight, Blackstone\u2019s competitors have managed to profit and grow in an environment that is widely regarded as cumbersome for infrastructure projects, which often require dozens of legal permits and years of waiting.Attractive infrastructure investments can vary. Some deals involve existing assets, like taking stakes in airports or major shipping ports with the aim of building up value and then locking in profits with a sale.Other projects, such as gas pipelines and power generation plants, have longer life cycles, with a fund \u2014 often with a partner in tow \u2014 backing investments at the start-up phase.That firm, founded by Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, a former top banker at Credit Suisse, is the second-largest player in the private equity infrastructure sector, according to Infrastructure Investor, a trade publication. Founded in 2006, the company now manages $40 billion and, like Blackstone, recently announced its own record capital raising, with a new $15.8 billion fund.Mr. Ogunlesi is well connected, too. A member of the president\u2019s advisory council led by Mr. Schwarzman, he is also the lead director on the board of Goldman Sachs, where a number of the president\u2019s top aides once worked.He declined, through a spokesman, to comment for this article. But in a recent interview with Infrastructure Investor, Mr. Ogunlesi was measured in his assessment of the White House.\u201cIf there\u2019s anything encouraging about the direction of the Trump administration, it\u2019s that they want to streamline the regulatory approval process in the U.S., which I think is necessary, and I don\u2019t think they need to be less concerned about the environment,\u201d he said, in a nod to the regulatory hurdles that have thwarted a number of infrastructure projects.But then the financial crisis hit, investor appetite dried up, and the recently hired infrastructure specialists left and started their own fund, Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, in 2011, leaving Blackstone without a dedicated infrastructure fund for years.This week, Blackstone named Sean Klimczak, a senior managing director from the firm\u2019s private equity group who had been involved in corporate infrastructure projects as part of that job, to lead its new effort. With the $20 billion from the Saudis, an expected $20 billion from other outside investors, and the possibility of borrowed capital to finance individual projects, Blackstone hopes to generate up to $100 billion in total spending power.Blackstone executives say they are in the early stages of identifying potential infrastructure investments and most likely will not pin down specific projects for weeks to come.Those could range from schools and hospitals to highways, airports and bridges, depending on where the need and the potential returns are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fabulous Apple Cash Machine", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byStrategiesGreat things are expected of the most valuable company on the planet.Apple, which has a world-beating market capitalization of $776 billion, is still meeting those expectations, but barely. And that could cause headaches down the road for investors and for the stock market as a whole.Apple shares, among the most widely held in the world, hit a new record on Friday, yet the company\u2019s sales have been so-so and no new game-changing gadgets other than a revamped iPhone are in sight.In a nutshell, after a stumble in 2016, Apple started to grow again late in the year and continued to do so in the first three months of this one, but not by much. Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier \u2014 a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won\u2019t restore Apple\u2019s old reputation as a paradigmatic \u201cgrowth company.\u201dYet Apple\u2019s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what\u2019s the problem? It is simply that Apple\u2019s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone.A major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers?It may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple\u2019s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I\u2019m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados, though I\u2019m not one of them. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years.\u201cApple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it\u2019s not growing much. It\u2019s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.\u201dOn Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple\u2019s already colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion.In the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other American company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S & P Dow Jones Indices.But there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced on Tuesday that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp.In a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple\u2019s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple\u2019s shares and total value, Apple\u2019s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple\u2019s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise).Furthermore, in the next two years, Mr. Maestri said, the company intends \u201cto return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.\u201dAll of which is to say that if Apple\u2019s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors.The fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Mr. Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company.Apple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know how much we need to invest in the business,\u201d Mr. Maestri said in the conference call. \u201cWe will never underinvest in the business. We\u2019re in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple\u2019s shares, which are now trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because \u201cwe\u2019ve found that Apple\u2019s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.\u201d Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said.Like Mr. Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. \u201cThe company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it\u2019s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive.Mr. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view. Back in February, when Apple shares were still trading at $130, he calculated Apple\u2019s value based on metrics like cash flow and declared that the company was \u201cfully deserving of its market value.\u201d But when the stock price reached $140, he sold his own shares. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great company,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the price.\u201dIt isn\u2019t a crazy price, not if you expect that Apple will remain disciplined and highly profitable and, maybe, even have another growth spurt next year. But unless the old Apple magic returns, the company right now is not a bargain.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Tsunami in Japan Endangered Children in Cambodia", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byGlobal HealthThe tsunami and nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, now threatens the developing brains of children in Cambodia \u2014 but not for reasons that were ever expected.But there is a cheap, easy remedy: iodized salt. As salt is cleaned and packaged, potassium iodate may be sprayed on it, normally at a cost of only a dollar or two per ton.That means, nutrition experts say, that the I.Q. of entire nations can be raised 10 points for just a nickel per child per year.But then things began falling apart.Global iodine stocks were already low because of the 2008 recession. A third of the world\u2019s iodine is produced by Japan\u2019s natural gas drillers, who extract it from brine pumped from coastal wells.Raw iodine prices remained high for two years, forcing the Indian companies that make potassium iodate to plead for donor help. Iodine is also used in X-ray machines, LCD screens and pharmaceuticals. Iodized salt accounted for only a tiny market share, so producers could not match other buyers\u2019 bids.The whole global iodination effort \u201cmay be put in jeopardy unless action is taken,\u201d a 2011 report prepared for Unicef said.High prices also wreaked havoc on Cambodia\u2019s salt industry. Noniodized salt from Vietnam was half the cost, so it was smuggled in. Salt meant for the Kampot co-op was sold without iodination.Some wholesalers who were supposed to test salt before repackaging it for retailers stopped doing so.In 2014, scientists from Unicef and Cambodia\u2019s planning ministry tested 1,862 salt samples bought at dozens of markets. They found that only 1 percent of coarse salt and 23 percent of fine salt met government standards.But monthly reports from the salt co-op said that over 90 percent of its samples did. \u201cWe can be skeptical of the legitimacy of the internal control,\u201d the Unicef report said.A quick test of 2,300 schoolchildren showed that iodine concentrations in urine had dropped by 30 percent since 2011, and that the problem \u201cthreatens the program\u2019s sustainability,\u201d the authors concluded.Unicef is urging the government to enforce its own laws and do better testing, Dr. Kupka said, and the Kampot co-op has set up a fund to buy potassium iodate in bulk.There is still time to save children from permanent damage, said Jonathan Gorstein, the executive director of the Iodine Global Network.\u201cThe thyroid is a pretty efficient gland at storing iodine,\u201d he said, so it can take five to 10 years of deficiency before goiters and brain damage return.After about eight years, \u201ca generation of newborns with no protection against mental retardation was born,\u201d Dr. Gorstein said.In 2011, Ethiopia tackled the problem. With donor help, it got spraying machinery and began enforcing iodination standards on industry. Now, 80 percent of its households use iodized salt.\u201cWhat we really want to avoid,\u201d Dr. Gorstein said, \u201cis this pattern in which success leads to backsliding.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aleppo After the Fall", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byFeatureThe door opened. A middle-aged man appeared. He had a gaunt, distinguished face, but his clothes were threadbare and his teeth looked brown and rotted. At the soldiers\u2019 encouragement, he stepped hesitantly forward into the street. He explained to them, a little apologetically, that he had not crossed his threshold in four and a half years.The man gazed around for a moment as if baffled, his eyes filling with tears. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad had just recaptured the city after years of bombing and urban warfare that had made Aleppo a global byword for savagery. This frail-looking man had survived at the war\u2019s geographic center entirely alone, an urban Robinson Crusoe, living on stocks of dry food and whatever he could grow in his small inner courtyard. Now, as he stumbled through an alley full of twisted metal and rubble, he saw for the first time that the front lines, marked by a wall of sandbags, were barely 20 yards from his house.Three months later, in March, he sat with me under the tall, spindly orange tree in his courtyard and described how he barricaded himself in when the fighting started. He goes by the name Abu Sami, and he has the mild, patient manners of a scholar; he taught at Aleppo University before the war. In the early days of the rebel takeover, he said, his nephews used to drop by with fresh bread and meat. But starting in 2013, the shelling grew worse, and he would go six months or more without seeing another human face. There was no water, no electric light; he gathered rainwater in buckets and boiled it and used a small solar panel to charge his phone. He made vinegar from grapes he grew in the courtyard. He treated his illnesses with aloe and other herbs he grew in pots. Once, when a rotten tooth became too painful, he yanked it out with pliers. He cowered by his bed when bombs shook the house to its foundation.Most of all, he sustained himself by reading. He carried out a stack of books from his bedroom to show me: treatises by Sigmund Freud, novels by Henry Miller, histories of science and psychology and religion and mythology and cooking, a book on radical theater by the American drama critic Robert Brustein. Some were in Russian, a language he learned as a young man. \u201cI read these things so I wouldn\u2019t have to think about politics or current events,\u201d he said. He read plays \u2014 Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re were favorites \u2014 and in his solitude, he found that he was able to see the entire drama acted out in his mind, as if it were onstage.He led me upstairs to see his dusty study, where the walls and ceiling were shredded with dozens of small shrapnel holes that let in fingers of sunlight. He picked up a bomb fragment, rolled it in his palm and laughed. He pointed to the house next door, where his neighbor, a quiet man who kept pigeons on the roof, had lived until a group of rebels arrived, shouting, and dragged him from the door. They brought back his corpse half an hour later.I asked Abu Sami why he never left. He gave the same answer that so many others gave me: because it was his house. And because day after day, year after year, he kept thinking, Surely this war is about to end.In the United States, the drawn-out siege of Aleppo \u2014 where the Syrian regime and its Russian allies repeatedly bombed hospitals and civilian areas \u2014 was widely deplored as a war crime comparable to the worst massacres of the Bosnian war during the 1990s. The refusal to intervene, some said, was a defining moral failure of the Obama administration. On the other side, regime supporters saw only the rebels\u2019 atrocities and their manipulation of civilians for propaganda. The \u201cfall\u201d of Aleppo, they said, was really the \u201cliberation\u201d of a city from terrorist rule, and a sign that Assad had all but won the civil war.Both portraits are false and self-serving. The Syrian tragedy started in a moment of deceptive simplicity, when the peaceful protesters of the 2011 Arab Spring seemed destined to inherit the future. Chants for freedom turned quickly to insurrection, bullets and war. But it took some time for outsiders to recognize how different Syria was, how its internal schisms \u2014 like tightly coiled springs \u2014 would provoke the fears and ambitions of all its neighbors. The Saudis and Turks wanted to replace Assad with a reliable Sunni client, while Iran and Hezbollah held fast to their one foothold in the Arab world. Russia, which intervened decisively in 2015, had its own motives: flouting American designs and protecting a reliable autocrat. The United States, having expected Assad to fall on his own, dithered over support for the rebels.Aleppo became the rebels\u2019 last major urban redoubt. Its fall reconfigured the Syrian battleground: The Saudis and Turks resigned themselves to Assad\u2019s rule, and their rivals exulted in a victory that seemed to justify years of blood and treasure. The Assad regime happily stepped out of the limelight as the world\u2019s attention turned back to capturing Raqqa, the ISIS capital in Syria\u2019s northeast.One small measure of the regime\u2019s confidence was a renewed willingness to let Western journalists \u2014 including me \u2014 travel the country. I was under the usual police-state surveillance, with a minder from the Information Ministry accompanying me during my travels outside Damascus. But scarcely any Americans had been to Aleppo since the regime\u2019s victory in December. The city had become a symbol of sorts, a sprawling commercial hub where every faction seemed to have left its mark. I had been trying to get back there for years; it was a place I loved when I covered the region from Beirut. I wanted to wind back the clock and make sense of how a city that seemed so averse to politics \u2014 of any kind \u2014 had been torn apart.Even Syrians have trouble answering that question. In March, I met a lawyer named Anas Joudeh, who took part in some of the 2011 protests. Joudeh no longer considers himself a member of the opposition. I asked him why. \u201cNo one is 100 percent with the regime, but mostly these people are unified by their resistance to the opposition,\u201d Joudeh told me. \u201cThey know what they don\u2019t want, not what they want.\u201d In December, he said, \u201cSyrians abroad who believe in the revolution would call me and say, \u2018We lost Aleppo.\u2019 And I would say, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 It was only a Turkish card guarded by jihadis.\u201d For these exiled Syrians, he said, the specter of Assad\u2019s crimes looms so large that they cannot see anything else. They refuse to acknowledge the realities of a rebellion that is corrupt, brutal and compromised by foreign sponsors. This is true. Eastern Aleppo may not have been Raqqa, where ISIS advertised its rigid Islamist dystopia and its mass beheadings. But as a symbol of Syria\u2019s future, it was almost as bad: a chaotic wasteland full of feuding militias \u2014 some of them radical Islamists \u2014 who hoarded food and weapons while the people starved.As for the regime\u2019s victory there, it probably would not have taken place if Turkey had not withdrawn some of its rebel proxies to focus on fighting the Kurds. Aleppo may have helped the regime\u2019s morale, but the war is likely to grind on for years, sustained and manipulated by outside powers. Assad needs them: His army has been decimated by war and desertions. That may help explain his use of chemical weapons in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in early April, which prompted the Trump administration\u2019s slap-on-the-wrist missile strike. With his manpower running out, Assad cares more about reinforcing his rule \u2014 at any cost \u2014 than rehabilitating his reputation in the West, which might have provided loans to help rebuild his shattered country.All the same, Aleppo was a turning point, and in some ways an emblem of the wider war. Its fall appears to have persuaded many ordinary Syrians that the regime, for all its appalling cruelty and corruption, is their best shot at something close to normality. This is almost certainly true for the Trump administration too. President Trump may call Assad an \u201canimal\u201d and hint at more airstrikes, but he cannot unseat him, because he knows that the alternative is not the kinder, gentler place once dreamed of by opposition activists. It is anarchy, where the warlords rule not from the presidential palace but from every town and every street.Everything was gone. Even the copper wiring had been stripped out. The walls were still there, but on the far side some rooms had collapsed into the courtyard after heavy shelling. \u201cYou remember the painting that was here?\u201d Freddy asked. I did. It was of a woman in Renaissance dress, the wife of the first Venetian consul in Aleppo. (Aleppo still has honorary consulships for many European countries.) The painting was memorable because it was painted in the same room where it hung; you could recognize the other objects and the shape of the wall. Freddy explained that the painting had turned up in Turkey, like much of what the rebels had stolen across Aleppo. An Istanbul antiques dealer told them that he would sell it back to them for $20,000. When they protested that it was stolen, Freddy told me, the dealer said dismissively, \u201cI get things from Syria every day.\u201dNow parts of the city were literally unrecognizable. In al-Hatab Square, once one of the prettier spots in the Old City, I found only a giant, uneven mound of rubble and earth that rose 15 feet above the street, with grass growing in it. I almost stepped on an unexploded Turkish gas bomb surrounded by yellow spring flowers. On the square\u2019s edges, half the buildings were destroyed. It was hard to believe this was once an orderly urban setting, lined with restaurants and hotels. The last time I was in Aleppo, in late 2010, I stayed at a beautiful old boutique hotel near the square, the Beit Wakil. I remember the owner taking me down into a dark, earthen-walled subbasement to show me a network of tunnels built centuries earlier. You could travel all the way to the citadel \u2014 the great medieval palace that towers over the Old City \u2014 without going aboveground, he said. They were built during the 17th century, when intermittent wars often made streets too treacherous to walk. \u201cPerhaps we will need them again,\u201d he said.One tragedy of Aleppo is that this rift between rich and poor was slowly mending in the years just before the 2011 uprisings. An economic renaissance was underway, fueled by thousands of small factories on the city\u2019s outskirts. The workers were mostly from eastern Aleppo, and the owners from the west. A trade deal with Turkey, whose border is just 30 miles to the north, brought new business and tourists and optimism. I remember sitting at cafe table with two Turkish traders just outside the citadel in late 2009. Tourists thronged all around us, and the two men talked excitedly about how new joint ventures were melting the animosity between their country and Syria. \u201cErdogan and Assad, they are like real friends,\u201d one of them said, referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.This kind of optimism was one reason the revolution took so long to reach Aleppo. All through 2011, as the rest of Syria erupted in protest, its largest city was quiet. But by 2012, in the villages just beyond the city\u2019s edges, weaponry was flowing in from across the Turkish border and battalions were being formed. \u201cThe countryside was boiling,\u201d I was told by Adnan Hadad, an opposition activist who was there at the time and belonged to the Revolutionary Military Council in Aleppo, a group led by Syrian military officers who defected. The council was eager for more European and American recognition and sensitive to Western calls for the preservation of most of Syria\u2019s state institutions. But local rural people tended to side with a more Islamist and less patient group called Liwa al-Tawheed. Tawheed\u2019s members \u201cconsidered themselves more authentic\u201d and had begun getting their own funding from Persian Gulf donors, Hadad told me. In the spring of 2012, Tawheed\u2019s members began pushing for a military takeover of Aleppo, accusing the council of excessive caution and even secret deals with the regime. The council resisted, saying they should move only when it was clear that the city\u2019s people wanted them to. In July, Tawheed took matters into its own hands. Armed insurgents flooded eastern and southwestern parts of the city, taking over civilian houses as well as police stations in the name of the revolution. Hadad considered the move a \u201cfatal mistake,\u201d he told me, and resigned from the military council.By then, eastern Aleppo had become a rebel stronghold. In early 2013, elections for provincial councils took place, giving the rebels a civilian veneer. But the councils, initially funded by the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, were soon under pressure from the Nusra Front, the Syrian Qaeda affiliate, and other hard-line groups. Later, ISIS forces captured parts of the city and forced residents to live by their rigid code. In theory, Aleppo was an embattled showplace for the Syrian revolution\u2019s aspirations. In fact, most civilians were dependent on a patchwork of armed rebel factions for food and protection. The constant pressure of war left almost no room for a real economy, and many of the city\u2019s factories had been repurposed by the rebels as military bases.Now Aleppo\u2019s great economic engine lies in ruins. One afternoon, a 45-year-old factory owner named Ghassan Nasi took me to the industrial area just west of Aleppo called Layramoon. The sounds of the city dissipated as we drove west, and when the car stopped, there was an eerie silence. An entire district that once hummed with 1,000 small factories was now abandoned, most of its buildings shattered and burned. \u201cIt is a 100 percent loss here,\u201d Nasi said. We walked down a dusty street to his factory, a textile and dyeing house that employed 130 people who worked 24 hours a day in three shifts. The door still had its metal filigree gate and marble steps. \u201cThis is where workers stamped in and out,\u201d he said.Inside, the huge factory floor was burned black and strewn with rubble. The rebels had used it to make weapons, he said. His old office had been used to house prisoners. Nasi told me quietly that he collapsed to his knees upon seeing it again last summer. \u201cI lost $10 million in machinery, $4 million in land,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we rebuild, the machinery is gone, and with the sanctions, we cannot buy new machinery.\u201d On top of that, there is inflation: The American dollar was worth 47 Syrian pounds before the crisis, and now it trades unofficially at about 520. And Turkey \u2014 where much of the Aleppo factories\u2019 machinery was transported and sold, often with the collusion of Syrian owners who wanted to avoid losing everything \u2014 now sells similar textiles for less. Reviving Syrian industry, and the social glue it might once have provided, is next to impossible.I asked Nasi what had become of his workers. He said about 70 percent of them joined the rebels. He didn\u2019t seem bitter or surprised about this. Some lived nearby, so when the area was divided, they had little choice. As for the others, they were poor and ill educated and religious, and the rebels promised them a lot. \u201cThe average salary for workers was about a hundred dollars a week,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rebels paid more.\u201d\u201cI was very scared of both sides,\u201d Yasser told me later. \u201cIf I went to one side, the other would kill me.\u201d He lay there, his limbs going numb, too frightened to move or speak for more than four hours.I met Yasser in March in Sha\u2019ar, the most devastated neighborhood in eastern Aleppo. He was short and solidly built, with a snub nose and a gruff manner. He was selling tomatoes and cucumbers from a stand, on a block where many buildings were in ruins. Across the street was a fruit stand, and next to it, a loud generator, set up by the government to supply electricity. Surprising numbers of people walked the streets. This place had been almost completely empty a few weeks earlier, but now that Russian mine-clearing teams had been through and the rubble was mostly pushed aside, Sha\u2019ar\u2019s residents were returning to their homes. (More than 100,000 went back to eastern Aleppo between January and March, according to the International Organization for Migration.) Yasser said he was one of the first people to come back, right after what he \u2014 like everyone else I met \u2014 called the liberation. It was a gesture of defiance, aimed at the rebels. \u201cWhat we lost, we will get it back,\u201d he said. He wore military fatigues, and he told me he re-enlisted in the military after he got out of the hospital in 2013. \u201cMy blood type is O-Assad,\u201d he said.Later, Yasser showed me the place where he was wounded. It was the first time he\u2019d been back since it happened, and the block had changed, like most of eastern Aleppo. \u201cThere was a checkpoint here, there were sandbags there,\u201d he said. He pointed out the first-floor window where an old man had talked to him through curtains as he lay on the street. He showed me the building where he thought the sniper had been hiding, about 100 yards away. He explained how his ordeal had ended: An airstrike hit the building, and the sniper vanished. A man on a motorbike rescued Yasser, carrying him to a house, where someone cleaned his wounds. Later, he was taken to a hospital, where a doctor told him that his mother was dead. The doctor put a needle in his arm and told him to count to three, and he blacked out.I found Yasser\u2019s story credible, and his uncle later backed it up. But as I stood on the street with him, I found myself wondering: Did he really know who shot him? Bullets were coming from each side. As he lay there bleeding, whom was he more frightened of \u2014 the rebels or the regime? Yasser clearly knew how his government is portrayed in the West and seemed defensive about it. He told me a rebel group tried to blame the regime for his mother\u2019s death. Later, he said, the same group admitted its guilt and offered blood money, which the family refused to take. This seemed less plausible. He walked me down the street to his uncle\u2019s house, where he said we would hear another story about what the rebels had done.Yasser\u2019s uncle was a big, heavyset man with a jowly face and a look of weary resignation in his eyes. He welcomed us into his tiny apartment, where he offered me a stool and sat down on his old brass bed. He sighed and apologized for being unable to offer us tea. Then he showed us his scarred arm and told us the story of how his family was devastated in January 2013. He was driving his pregnant daughter to the hospital when machine-gun fire riddled the car, killing his wife instantly and wounding everyone else. He told me rebels from the Free Syrian Army pulled them from the car and rushed them to a nearby hospital. I asked who fired on them. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.There was a silence. Until that moment, I had not heard anyone miss an opportunity to blame the rebels. With my government minder looking on, Yasser began asking where the gunfire had come from. Wasn\u2019t it from a tall building nearby? Weren\u2019t the rebels in that building? The uncle shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said again. I had the impression that he was profoundly depressed and past caring about what he was supposed to say. Yasser kept pressing. Eventually, the uncle caved in and said, Sure, it was probably the rebels. \u201cMy wife died a martyr,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the F.S.A., I cannot say, because they helped me and my wife. I cannot say how they are with other people.\u201d And then quietly, he began to cry.On my second day in the city, I went to see the Aleppo Eye Hospital, a sprawling compound that the rebels had used as a military headquarters. As we walked through the burned and shattered building, my government minder and the soldiers guarding the place kept picking up markers of the rebels\u2019 Islamist leanings. They weren\u2019t hard to find. A fire-blackened car out front still had the Qaeda logo on its hood. Inside, the rebels had put up paper signs to show how they used the rooms: a room where Shariah rulings were handed out by a religious sheikh, a document about Islamic punishments. There was a prison too, and I later met a woman who seems to have been kept there. She had been captured in a rural village, and the rebels killed her husband and then moved her from place to place, intending to trade her for their own prisoners. There were female jailers who beat and cursed her and called her an infidel. She told me she was given a bottle of water to wash herself with once every 10 to 15 days. During the final battle for Aleppo, she often heard the sounds of bombs and mortars exploding nearby, and her jailers would taunt her, saying Assad\u2019s bombs will kill you.As I walked through those ruins, it was clear enough that the rebels who ruled eastern Aleppo had done some awful things there. Yet the whole hospital tour was designed, at least in part, to mitigate or obscure a very uncomfortable fact. The Assad regime repeatedly and deliberately bombed hospitals in the rebel zone, even when there was no reason to suspect that fighters were based there. No one would discuss this with me during my time in Aleppo, even when I did not have the minder with me. Instead, I had to speak to people who fled eastern Aleppo under the terms of the deal to evacuate the city in December, when the regime recaptured it. They were living in Idlib province, to the southwest, which is held by rebels, and I spoke to them by Skype. One was a young man who worked as a nurse at the Omar bin Abdul Aziz Hospital throughout 2016. He told me that the hospital was rendered inoperable 15 times by regime airstrikes. Each time, engineers and doctors would rehabilitate it, only to see it damaged again. When the regime soldiers got too close, they moved to another hospital, called Al Quds. It was so crowded that they sometimes tended the wounded in the street outside.Stories like this have been amply documented and held up as evidence that the Assad regime is guilty of war crimes on a wide scale. A nongovernmental organization in Europe has been working for years to gather documents that would tie the Syrian leadership to these crimes in a Nuremberg-style trial. That prospect is remote, but there are signs that Assad, too, may be worried about whose eyes are watching him. This month, the State Department released satellite photographs suggesting that the regime is burning the bodies of executed prisoners in a crematory at the Sednaya prison complex, north of Damascus, in an alleged effort to hide evidence. The Syrian regime called these charges a \u201cnew Hollywood plot.\u201dIt is impossible to live in government-controlled Syria without noticing that there are almost no young men on the street. They are in the army, or they are dead. Veterans must carry their military papers with them or risk on-the-spot re-enlistment. At one checkpoint, government soldiers tried to grab the young Spanish photographer I was working with, who is easily mistaken for a Syrian; they wanted to recruit him. In Latakia, a beach town in the regime\u2019s northwestern heartland, I met a 53-year-old businessman named Munzer Nasser, who commands a militia composed almost entirely of older men; there are no young men left in his village. One of its members, he told me, is a 65-year-old whose three sons have all been killed in the war. Behind the Assad regime\u2019s atrocities lies a fear of demographic exhaustion. Its rebel opponents have no such worries: They can draw on a vast well of Islamist sympathizers across the Arab world.These facts translate into a genuine gratitude \u2014 in regime-controlled areas \u2014 toward Russia, whose military intervention in late 2015 may have forestalled a total collapse. Many Syrians say they feel reassured by the sight of Russian soldiers, because they (unlike the army and its allied militias) are not likely to loot or steal. Some of my contacts in regime-controlled areas are even learning Russian. In Latakia, some people told me that their city might have been destroyed if not for the Russians. The city has long been one of Syria\u2019s safe zones, well defended by the army and its militias; there are tent cities full of people who have fled other parts of the country, including thousands from Aleppo. But in the summer of 2015, the rebels were closing in on the Latakia city limits, and mortars were falling downtown. If the rebels had captured the area \u2014 where Alawites are the majority \u2014 a result would almost certainly have been sectarian mass murder. Many people in the region would have blamed the United States, which armed some of the rebels operating in the area. In this sense, the Russian intervention was a lucky thing for the Obama administration too. Andrew Exum, who worked in the Pentagon at the time, told me that the military drew up contingency plans for a rapid collapse of the regime. The planning sessions were talked about as \u201ccatastrophic success.\u201dYet Assad\u2019s popularity is due not only to his role as the guarantor of a secular order. He has also cannily positioned himself as a unique guardian against his own regime. Just before I arrived in Aleppo in March, a high-ranking Republican Guard commander in the city issued a public order declaring a crackdown on \u201cacts of looting, robbery and assaults on public property and on the freedoms of citizens and their private property.\u201d The order was a belated recognition of what had been going on for months: an orgy of looting by the various paramilitary groups that work alongside the Syrian Army, and even by elements of the army itself.The reporter, an Aleppan named Rida al-Basha, described the neighborhoods where this had taken place and named the militias, including the notorious Tiger Forces, whose leaders include well-known thugs. At the end of the interview, Basha said that he had pleaded with the city government and other journalists to expose these crimes, but that everyone was too frightened. After the report, Basha repeatedly said he was threatened with death, and he is said to have fled the country.Late last year, Iran abruptly suspended oil deliveries, which have become a lifeline for Syria. Iran acted because it was angry about the amount of its fuel that was being diverted and sold to rebels by regime-connected middlemen, I was told by a Syrian who has close ties to Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s ally. The suspension created a serious fuel crisis in winter. Iran resumed its supplies in mid-February, but Tehran has little choice: It needs Assad as much as he needs it. There are reports of similar tensions with the Russians, who are more interested in brokering an end to the fighting than Assad is. The Syrian businessman put it like this: \u201cBashar is like a man with two false legs \u2014 one is Russia and one is Iran. He keeps hopping from one leg to the other, because the ground he is standing on is very hot.\u201dAll this may sound awfully precarious for Assad. But in a sense, it is just a more extreme form of the game Assad and his father have played for decades. The Assad regime arose after an unstable period during the 1950s and \u201960s, when Syria was shaken by coups and countercoups. Hafez al-Assad, Bashar\u2019s father, triumphed in part by managing a constellation of rivals who hated one another but were all dependent on him. They knew that without him at the center, chaos would return, and that would be bad for business. This is truer than ever today. And it has a secondary effect, not unimportant: Many ordinary people now see Assad as their only hedge against a far more toxic kind of chaos.My Syrian businessman friend told me that he twice gathered about a dozen people for dinner and offered them a hypothetical in strict confidence. It is up to you to name the next president of Syria, he said. Whom would you choose? The guests were all Syrians, and none supported the regime. To his surprise, almost all of them named Assad. When he asked why, the same answer came back again and again: Assad is the only one who can protect us against his own devils.Anas Joudeh, the Damascus lawyer, told me that the absence of this kind of wisdom is precisely what doomed Syria. For years, he said, he and his friends cast around looking for someone to blame for the failure of the 2011 revolution. \u201cWe often asked, If only this, or if only that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I feel that what happened was destiny. Because there are no political or social forces in Syria. The regime emptied them out. So when the regime looked to make a deal in 2011, there was no one there.\u201d I took Joudeh to be saying that the regime might have been willing to share power, in some limited way, if the opposition had been more organized, more conciliatory. Perhaps it is na\u00efve to suggest that the regime could have offered genuine reforms of its own accord. Police states are not known for voluntarily giving up power in the interest of building a better future. Assad has spoken the language of reform ever since he inherited his role from his father in 2000, and he has never followed through on any of it. Still, there is one story that has haunted me.On March 30, 2011, Assad delivered a televised speech to Syria\u2019s rubber-stamp Parliament that is widely viewed in retrospect as a crucial step in the country\u2019s descent into war. He had kept silent during the previous two weeks of protest and violence. Some of his advisers and proxies had hinted, in the days beforehand, that he would make historic proposals, offering a hand to the protesters and paving the way for genuine national reconciliation. Much of the region tuned in as Assad walked up a red carpet into the Parliament building past a cheering crowd. But his speech quickly turned into a familiar, embarrassing spectacle, with lawmakers chanting his name and interrupting his speech with fawning accolades. Assad delivered a hard-line speech deriding the protesters as dupes of a foreign-backed plot to destroy the country. He closed on an ominous note, saying: \u201cThere is no compromise or middle way in this. What is at stake is the homeland, and there is a huge conspiracy. ... We have never hesitated in defending our causes, interests and principles, and if we are forced into a battle, so be it.\u201dOne former regime official told me that he recalls watching the speech with a sense of shock and dismay. He and other high-ranking officials had heard in advance the details of what the speech was supposed to say. It had been drafted, they were told, by Vice President Farouk al-Shara, and it emphasized reconciliation with the protesters. Shara had received input from several other top officials with similar inclinations. This version of the speech even had the support of Hezbollah\u2019s leaders, who believed that genuine gestures of compromise could head off a war, the former official said. Other people close to the regime have echoed this account, though there are analysts who are skeptical; it\u2019s almost impossible to be sure about what happens in Assad\u2019s secretive inner circle.What is certain is that Assad did not deliver the speech that was expected. Instead, the former official said, he scrapped it at the last minute in favor of a much more aggressive text. \u201cWhen I heard the speech, my feeling was \u2014 we are in for a long fight,\u201d the former official told me. \u201cI was in my office. We looked around at each other and did not say a word.\u201d He remains convinced that if Assad had given the other speech, the past six years would have unrolled very differently, and oceans of blood might have been spared.In my time in Syria, I met one person who seemed to evade both of these traps. I hesitate to use the word \u201chero,\u201d because he would violently reject it. But he held onto a dogged civic idealism that was divorced from hope of any kind. In a sense, he was the inverse of Abu Sami, the professor who shut himself off from the war inside his home. He was a 57-year-old engineer named Tarif Attora, who appeared to be working himself to death running a group called the Aleppo People\u2019s Initiative. He and his teams repair water pipes and electricity lines and supply food and medical aid to people in need. They do this in both regime and rebel areas, unlike the White Helmets, the rescue group that was lionized in an Academy Award-winning documentary. He is the only person I know who has the unreserved admiration of both rebel leaders and die-hard regime loyalists.I met Attora in the initiative\u2019s office, where he sat at a battered desk with a vast map of the city \u2014 east and west \u2014 on the wall behind him. The desk was covered with stacked files and old coffee mugs, and he interrupted our talk several times to bark instructions to site managers. (\u201cDon\u2019t strain the lines. You\u2019re getting 50. It should be 25 to 30.\u201d) He has steel-gray hair that is cut short and flat on the top of his head, and his face \u2014 stark, creased with vertical lines, square-jawed \u2014 looks a bit like Albert Camus\u2019s might have if he lived a decade longer.The initiative started in July 2012, when Attora gathered roughly 30 engineers and other professionals \u2014 all Aleppo residents \u2014 to talk about how they could help protect the city. Some were with the opposition, some were not, and there were arguments. They agreed on one thing: the need to keep the lights on and the water running. So they asked the authorities for permission and began reaching out to all the rebel groups. Soon they had hundreds of volunteers working with them and repair crews going everywhere, even the front lines. The state water company supplied pipes and materials, but apart from that, the initiative is entirely self-funding, Attora said. Six of its members have been killed. Many others have been wounded, including Attora.He told me several harrowing stories about his work in what he called \u201chot zones.\u201d Twice he came close to being killed, and his back is now broken in two places. Jihadi groups were in control of Aleppo\u2019s main power plant for more than a year, so he ended up dealing with them a lot. Once, he saw something that left him traumatized for months. He asked me not to report the details, because it might anger the people involved and limit his ability to work with them. Despite the trauma \u2014 which still haunts him \u2014 he did not want to jeopardize his ability \u201cto continue working in all areas,\u201d he said.I asked Attora why he does it, and he hesitated. He seemed uncomfortable dealing with abstractions. \u201cFreedom doesn\u2019t come from destroying the country,\u201d he said as he put out what must have been his 10th cigarette since our conversation started and lit another. \u201cLook, people consider me opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the way I see opposition \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean I must destroy my country and put us back 100 years. That kind of opposition is a betrayal of the country, a betrayal of the ideals I\u2019ve grown up with.\u201dHe seemed unsatisfied with his words, and he glanced around the room, as if he were looking for an excuse to stop talking and get back to his engineers. It was getting dark outside. \u201cWe all served the politics of other countries in our own land, whether we knew it or not,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has to wake up. To be brave, to admit they\u2019ve made mistakes, to come back to the right way.\u201dI stood up to shake Attora\u2019s hand and say goodbye. His face cracked into a smile, and the phone rang. He picked it up, and instantly he was at home again, supervising repairs on a power line that would probably be blown up again tomorrow.A picture caption on May 28 with an article about Syria referred incorrectly to the ruins shown in Aleppo.

{"Headline": "In Tumult of Trump, Jon Corzine Seeks a Wall Street Comeback", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byJon S. Corzine is a 6-foot-2 bear of a man who has spent decades roaming expansive halls of power. He held the top job at the old Goldman Sachs office tower, a concrete pinnacle of American capitalism. And after that, he had the run of the governor\u2019s mansion in New Jersey \u2014 all 18,000 square feet of it.On a recent afternoon, however, he squeezed into a 100-square-foot office in the Flatiron district of Manhattan \u2014 no nameplate on the door \u2014 where a pair of Bloomberg terminals consumed much of the space. His eyes fixed on one, Mr. Corzine scribbled notes about his trades on a yellow legal pad as a computer chimed an imitation closing bell.In the final seconds of trading, Mr. Corzine watched as a tiny sliver of his day\u2019s profits slipped away, prompting him to utter a profanity or two and grumble about not ending the afternoon on more of \u201ca high note.\u201dNow, here in his cramped office, Mr. Corzine is plotting his next and possibly final act: starting a hedge fund. And not just any hedge fund, but one designed to take advantage of the turmoil in the Trump era.If the third time\u2019s the charm, few comebacks will have had the operatic extremes of Mr. Corzine\u2019s past decade. It is a period that includes not only MF Global\u2019s demise but also his own near-death experience in a car accident and, later, the death of his youngest son.In his first interview since the MF Global meltdown began, Mr. Corzine detailed his plans for a new hedge fund, saying that he will seek to anticipate what often seems unpredictable: how the Trump administration and other world leaders will enact policy and, in turn, move markets.\u201cI think I can read between the lines more than a lot of people can on these issues,\u201d he said last month, on the eve of a trip to raise money for his fund with wealthy investors.In the first few weeks of marketing, Mr. Corzine has secured commitments and indications of interest in the tens of millions of dollars, according to a colleague who is helping him reach an initial goal of roughly $150 million. At a time when the stars of the hedge fund world can raise billions of dollars in a matter of weeks, Mr. Corzine\u2019s financial ambition is modest. The real test will come, he said, if after several months the fund can demonstrate healthy returns and expand to a broader base of investors.Wearing his trademark sweater and beard, Mr. Corzine, now 70, added, \u201cAnd, you know, I am competitive.\u201dThat competitive streak may stoke a romance with risk that has trailed Mr. Corzine\u2019s career from Wall Street to Washington (and Trenton) and back again. A friend who works on Wall Street acknowledged that Mr. Corzine, even when placing a prudent bet, sometimes has trouble taking his foot off the gas \u2014 Exhibit A being MF Global.Mr. Corzine also spoke publicly for the first time about the death of his son Jeffrey, who was by his side during his time at MF Global and who invested his own money in the firm. Jeffrey\u2019s death in 2014 led Mr. Corzine to name the hedge fund JDC/JSC Opportunity Fund, using his son\u2019s initials and his own as he resumes his trading career.\u201cHe is a legendary trader who has spent his life deeply interested and involved in markets,\u201d Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary who worked with Mr. Corzine atop Goldman in the late 1990s, said in an interview.While MF Global investors might view some of Mr. Corzine\u2019s trades as dangerous, his friends credit his risk-taking with scoring some of his life\u2019s surprising victories: walking onto the basketball team at the University of Illinois having come from a tiny farming town, winning a Senate seat when he had never held even local office, and then voting against the Iraq war long before public opinion was on his side.Soon after MF Global imploded in the fall of 2011, Mr. Corzine was walking down Fifth Avenue when, he said, a stranger unleashed an expletive-filled assault. These days, venturing outside is no longer perilous.That appearance coincides with Mr. Corzine\u2019s fund-raising tour. And while it\u2019s early days yet, there are signs his pitch is resonating with some investors.After securing commitments from family and friends, he recently returned from a trip to the Middle East, where he met with a number of wealthy investors. He also plans to visit Latin America and Hong Kong.When the fund-raising concludes, Mr. Corzine hopes to have collected just shy of $150 million, the amount at which private funds must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That sum will include several million dollars of his own money.In addition to trading, Mr. Corzine will help clients decipher the inner workings of Washington, particularly for investors feeling bewildered in the age of Trump. Sure, he has not worked in Washington in a dozen years. But he says he has a social network encompassing Goldmanites (Lloyd C. Blankfein, the current chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Cohn, for example) and a younger crew of Wall Street insiders whom he recruited to MF Global, including Omeed Malik, a Bank of America executive who oversees a unit that helps hedge funds open their doors.Mr. Corzine is joining the business at a shaky time. Some major investment firms, including Fortress Investment Group, have shut down funds, while another notable trip-up came from Marc Mezvinsky, Hillary Clinton\u2019s son-in-law, who closed his fund last year after a failed bet on an economic revival in Greece.But others are raking in money, and Mr. Corzine argues that this moment provides him a leg up. He can interpret a poll better than your average trader, he said, and scan the news media knowing \u201cwhich reporters are full of\u201d it, he added, using an expletive.If all goes according to plan, Mr. Corzine expects to open his fund in the fall. He hopes to hire a half-dozen employees, up from the current two: Sean Roberts, a trader and investment professional he first hired at MF Global, and Nancy Dunlap, his longtime lawyer.The fund will hire at least one more lawyer, he said, because \u201cI can\u2019t afford a reputational issue.\u201dMr. Corzine said he was not stamped as a risk-taker at Goldman Sachs or on Capitol Hill. He traces the trait much earlier, to his hometown, Willey Station, Ill., population 40, where every year his father would plant corn and soybeans hoping they would sprout and praying that the weather would not destroy them.\u201cI grew up with risk,\u201d Mr. Corzine said.Yet his father avoided financial risk, refusing to ever use a credit card, scarred by his own parents losing a fortune in the Great Depression. And his father stuck to farming, frustrating a young Mr. Corzine, who had hoped his father would venture into local politics.Years later, after a stint in the Marine Corps Reserves and graduation from the University of Chicago\u2019s business school, Mr. Corzine learned risk-taking for himself Wall Street-style.In 1976, Goldman hired him for an entry-level job. Within a few years, he took over the government bond trading division and ascended to the top of Goldman in 1994, as senior partner. He soon set the firm on a path to becoming a public company.That process unfolded in fits and starts as Mr. Corzine faced opposition from some partners. He won overwhelmingly, but after a number of other disagreements with fellow managers, what happened next was cutthroat even by Wall Street standards. He returned from a family ski trip to learn that he had been ousted.In an interview, Mr. Corzine acknowledged meeting the Mellon bank chief, and said he had a duty to explore other options before the I.P.O. He paused, and then added: \u201cMaybe they\u2019re right. Maybe I should have told people I was going to do that.\u201dIt did not take long to move on. Within months, he was running in New Jersey for the United States Senate.After dropping about $60 million of his own money on the race \u2014 along with some cash from Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, now Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law \u2014 Mr. Corzine cruised to victory.In the Senate, he helped lead an effort to provide a tax holiday for the families of 9/11 victims, and was one of only 23 senators to vote against the Iraq war. During that period, he also sought a divorce from his wife of 33 years, whom he met in the second grade.Mr. Corzine was dating a New Jersey union leader at the time, and although the relationship ended, the romance raised eyebrows as his ambitions were expanding: Mr. Corzine planned a run for New Jersey governor.He prevailed at the polls, but a little over a year later, he nearly died. Rushing to a meeting, Mr. Corzine\u2019s driver was traveling 91 miles an hour when he lost control of the sport utility vehicle. Mr. Corzine, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was induced into a coma.\u201cIt happened like this,\u201d Mr. Corzine recalled, snapping his finger.A month after waking up, he was back working on his liberal agenda. Mr. Corzine eventually won early childhood education for underprivileged children. He established paid family leave. And he abolished the death penalty, the first state in a generation to do so.Even in deep blue New Jersey, those changes were not enough to secure him a second term. As he has committed to memory, \u201cI lost by 3.61\u201d points.Ms. Elghanayan advised Mr. Corzine to \u201cwait, don\u2019t do anything\u201d after the campaign loss. It was advice that Mr. Corzine declined to follow.In an interview, he said he had chosen between offers at the prominent hedge fund D. E. Shaw and the second-tier brokerage firm MF Global. D. E. Shaw offered more money and prestige. MF Global offered the chairman and chief executive roles. He chose MF Global.By the time he arrived, the firm had recorded three consecutive years of losses, and Mr. Corzine concluded that a bolder approach was needed. He became one of the firm\u2019s most profitable traders of its own money, and convened a weekly meeting with other traders to solicit \u201cbest ideas.\u201dOne idea was to buy European government debt at a time when some countries with the euro currency were experiencing a crisis, a trade that was well underway before Mr. Corzine arrived. He saw an opportunity to expand the firm\u2019s use of a technique that would produce steady returns from the trade while the European Union effectively pledged to backstop the eurozone sovereign debt. Just in case, Mr. Corzine had an insurance policy, taking a short position against the euro, a fact he now wishes he had trumpeted louder to investors.The investment was paying off, helping the firm return to profitability. But Mr. Corzine\u2019s strategy had its critics. One of MF Global\u2019s risk officers questioned the trade, and so did regulators.\u201cHistory has proven that the trade was entirely correct,\u201d said David Gelber, an MF Global board member who until now had not spoken publicly about the firm\u2019s collapse. \u201cBut I think we were too introverted. We knew it to be safe, but we didn\u2019t appreciate the reaction of the outside world to the size of these positions.\u201dInvestors were on edge.In October 2011, Mr. Corzine said, the firm\u2019s auditors forced it to write down the value of an unrelated future tax benefit. That caused a huge quarterly loss, an oft-ignored explanation for the firm\u2019s decline. Amid confusion at the time, investors generally conflated that loss with the eurozone sovereign debt trade.Mr. Corzine called his decision not to take the write-down earlier his \u201csingle greatest mistake\u201d at the firm.But the final blow arguably came that same week in late October from the rating agencies, when Moody\u2019s cut its assessments of MF Global twice in a matter of days, citing the European trade and \u201cincreased risk appetite.\u201d This prompted a run on the firm.Mr. Corzine argued that Moody\u2019s was well aware of the European trade. But he also acknowledged that he had overlooked and failed to communicate with the analyst Moody\u2019s had recently assigned to MF Global, leading him to wonder now whether \u201cthat\u2019s one of my mistakes.\u201dThose next few days, Mr. Corzine worked through each night and slept on his office floor. Sensing things were improving, he went home to shower in the predawn hours of Oct. 28 when the phone rang with bad news: The firm had overdrawn a JPMorgan Chase bank account.Mr. Corzine returned to work and phoned a back-office employee who handled wire transfers. He told her to meet JPMorgan\u2019s demands, declaring that it was \u201cthe most important thing\u201d to do because otherwise the bank would halt business with MF Global, court records show.She complied. But in doing so, she transferred customer money to JPMorgan, not MF Global\u2019s own money, violating a cardinal rule of the brokerage industry. It was one of several wire transfers to a bank or clearinghouse that included customer money.Mr. Corzine, who later hired the defense attorney Andrew Levander, said he was unaware that the money belonged to customers, citing an email he received at the time indicating that it was the firm\u2019s.As that problem unfolded, Mr. Corzine had another pressing assignment: selling the firm and its various holdings.By Oct. 30, Interactive Brokers was planning to buy the firm, while Mr. Corzine met with Mr. Icahn, the billionaire investor, who was interested in the euro positions. Mr. Icahn promised to make a decision by morning, Mr. Corzine recalled.Both deals fell apart (investors who later bought the euro positions reaped a huge profit) when the firm discovered a roughly $1 billion shortfall in its customers\u2019 assets. MF Global went out of business.\u201cThe MF Global episode provided a very stark example of a failure to supervise a broker dealer,\u201d said Christopher Whalen, the chairman of Whalen Global Advisors and a longtime Wall Street analyst. \u201cWall Street is filled with examples of people who are really smart and have great skills as bankers and traders but maybe are not the right people to run an enterprise.\u201dWhen Mr. Corzine turned 70 on New Year\u2019s Day, he took his children and grandchildren to the Caribbean for a celebration. The birthday was not the only significant event that week.Days later, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced that Mr. Corzine had agreed to pay $5 million to settle accusations that he had failed to supervise MF Global. A criminal investigation fizzled years earlier, and the customer money was long since recovered and returned.With all of that behind him, Mr. Corzine was free to start a hedge fund, a business that need not operate under the gaze of public shareholders or rating agencies.Although the settlement imposed a lifetime prohibition from registering with the trading commission \u2014 effectively preventing his fund from trading more than a small amount of other people\u2019s money in the futures industry \u2014 stocks, bonds and most currencies are fair game. And that could leave plenty of room, he says, for the Trump trade.Mr. Corzine worries that the administration will make \u201ca serious foreign policy mistake,\u201d he said, which would be \u201chorrible for markets.\u201d He said that he planned to place a major bet that the market would fall but added that, as an American, \u201cI\u2019m hoping that I\u2019m wasting money.\u201dHis thesis is not solely that the Trump presidency will fail, but also that, with policies like tax reform, \u201cthe functional element of Washington may create opportunities, too.\u201dThe fund, he said, will help him expand philanthropic efforts at a time when his personal fortune is a fraction of what it once was. Mr. Corzine\u2019s net worth has shrunk to less than $40 million today from about $500 million at its height, friends say. He forfeited money in the divorce and spent well over $100 million funding his own political campaigns and many millions more on legal bills, expenses and charity, including donations to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.\u201cUntil you\u2019ve lost a child, it\u2019s impossible to understand how deeply someone who\u2019s suffered that loss will go to save other children from a similar tragedy,\u201d said Kevin Ryan, the head of Covenant House, who was the children and families commissioner in New Jersey under Mr. Corzine. \u201cI think the loss of Jeff fuels and haunts and inspires Jon.\u201dNow that he is focusing on opening his new fund, Mr. Corzine wakes up at 4 a.m. for the opening of European markets and lands in the office by the 9:30 a.m. opening bell in New York.\u201cThere are some people who look forward to using the blessing of what happens with the 70-plus life,\u201d he said, by \u201ccatching up on things that they weren\u2019t able to do. I want to do that in a context where I feel like I\u2019m still contributing.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Markets Swing Upward, Then Settle, in Wake of French Election", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Markets breathed a sigh of relief on Monday after Emmanuel Macron secured the French presidency in the second round of elections, but investor enthusiasm quickly waned as the focus shifted to the scale of the challenge facing him.The euro, which strengthened against the dollar after results were announced, pared its gains in the European morning and was down 0.32 percent to $1.0954 by early afternoon.The CAC 40, the benchmark stock index for France, had inched down 0.86 percent by early afternoon, while indexes across Europe, including Germany\u2019s DAX and the Euro Stoxx 50, were all a little lower.The yield on French government bonds fell, meaning that investors saw the country\u2019s debt as being less risky, reducing France\u2019s borrowing costs.Mr. Macron comfortably defeated his far-right rival Marine Le Pen on Sunday, but analysts said markets were already looking ahead to French parliamentary elections next month. Mr. Macron faces a sizable challenge in obtaining a legislative majority that could enable him to keep campaign promises.Opinion polls had indicated a Macron victory, helping to bolster investor enthusiasm toward the end of last week, so the market\u2019s reaction to the results was limited, according to J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, the chief economist at Commerzbank.\u201cThe biggest uncertainty was before the first round of the elections\u201d in April, when it was unclear whether Mr. Macron would make it to the final round, Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said.\u201cNow there is residual uncertainty,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Macron was \u201cunlikely to implement the tough necessary reforms that France needs.\u201dInvestors were also looking ahead to other elections in Europe, he said, seeing particular risks in parliamentary races in Italy next year.The muted reaction in European markets came after indexes in Asia climbed sharply in the hours after the polls closed in France.The Nikkei 225 share index in Japan and other markets in the region were also reacting to a strong jobs report in the United States on Friday, which suggested the global economy was on solid footing even as it reinforced the case for the Federal Reserve to continue building on recent interest rate increases.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why There Is No \u2018Trump Slump\u2019 on Wall Street", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter a brief stumble, the stock market returned to its upward march last week and hit another high. This optimism has left many people confused, even infuriated. Why isn\u2019t Wall Street being affected by all the crazy news \u2014 including rumors of impeachment \u2014 coming out of Washington? Where is the Trump Slump?So far, there isn\u2019t one, and that\u2019s good news for investors but also even for ideological opponents of the president. I\u2019ve examined stock markets in countries around the world, looking at data over the past three decades. My research shows that a country\u2019s stock market often outperforms its peers when a new leader comes to power in emerging countries.But there is no such positive effect in developed countries. Countries like the United States have structural guardrails in place, like strong independent courts, central banks and other checks on power, that make it more difficult for a single leader to change the nation\u2019s direction.Compare political scandals, for example. In Brazil, the market is struggling to recover after falling nearly 15 percent in dollar value on May 18 perhaps in response to the blockbuster news of a cover-up that could cost the president his job.In the United States, the stock market fell during the Watergate scandal but for reasons that had little to do with Richard Nixon and much to do with the stagnant economy and inflation. And stock prices rose steadily during the investigations and impeachment of Bill Clinton, until the 1998 collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management threatened to trigger a global financial crisis. The same holds for other political scandals, like Teapot Dome and Iran-contra.It is a mistake, then, to view the markets through an ideologically colored lens.The data is decidedly more mixed on whether the United States market does better under a Republican or a Democratic administration. If anything, the market over time seems less and less inclined to care which party is in power.I know plenty of right-wing ideologues who, convinced that President Barack Obama was leading America to ruin, missed out on the market\u2019s long bull run. Similarly many Democrats now think President Trump is taking the country down and assume that stock prices will follow.The stock market is best understood not as a presidential poll but as a barometer of the nation\u2019s current economic mood, and it remains buoyant now for reasons unconnected to the White House.For a few weeks after President Trump\u2019s victory, Wall Street was indeed buzzing over how his plans to cut taxes and red tape would stir \u201canimal spirits\u201d and promote American business, albeit at the expense of foreign rivals. Money was coming back to the United States, driving up the value of the dollar. Six months later, the main reason for the market\u2019s continued rise has more to do with global rather than local factors. The \u201cTrump bump\u201d is long gone.Global growth has picked up over the past few months, and the worst fears that caused a short-term slump in Wall Street last year \u2014 like a possible breakup of the European Union after Brexit or a financial crisis in China \u2014 have not materialized. The American economy continues to grow at a steady clip of around 2 percent, while the economies of Europe and Japan are now stronger than at any time since the crisis of 2008.The American stock market reflects those trends. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of \u201cglobalists,\u201d the more internationally oriented companies have outperformed their domestic peers significantly since Inauguration Day. The global forces lifting the United States market have in the meantime been lifting foreign stock markets even faster this year.Similarly, the American dollar has given up all the gains it recorded in the immediate aftermath of the November election, and the Mexican peso has clawed back most of the losses it incurred when the markets were taking President Trump\u2019s threats against the North American Free Trade Agreement more seriously.On Wall Street today, the chatter about Trumponomics is fading, because many people no longer expect him to accomplish much, for better or worse, whether pushing tax reform or triggering trade wars. Some analysts still worry about how a tax-cut plan based on unrealistic growth assumptions could further bloat the budget deficit, or how limiting immigration could undermine the economy.But those story lines are expected to play out at a glacial pace, well outside the market\u2019s forecast horizon, which is measurable in months, not years. Corporate profits have started to revive in recent months based on a recovering global economy. As long as that continues and the cost of money remains close to zero, courtesy of the Fed, the default path for the market is up.None of this is to suggest that there are no risks to the bull market, now in its ninth year. Stocks in the United States have seldom risen for so long without a major setback and have never been more expensively valued, outside the tech boom of the late 1990s. History shows that bull runs tend to last until the next recession starts, so the question is where the next downturn comes from.If emerging inflation pressures prompt the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly, the economy could stumble and take the market with it. More significantly, there are still threats to the world economy, including China\u2019s debt bubble. If it bursts, it could cause the next global recession, hitting the American market hard.So there is much to worry about in the markets, but it is important to worry about the right things. The cloud of scandal around the White House is not high on the list. Mr. Trump\u2019s mercurial ways may be a source of great concern or indifference, depending on your ideological leanings. But Wall Street doesn\u2019t seem to care one way or other.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Insider-Trading Case Ensnares Hedge Fund", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byFor hedge funds, information is a valuable currency. A scrap of insight about a coming change in government policy can be as precious as any market data, potentially making the difference between a profit or loss on a trade.As a result, political intelligence firms have proliferated inside the Beltway. But among the firms that traffic in information between Washington and Wall Street, one political insider\u2019s tips to a New York hedge fund crossed a bright line, the authorities said on Wednesday.The Washington consultant, David Blaszczak, and four other men were charged in an insider-trading scheme, accused of using confidential information about government financing to trade shares in the health care companies that would be affected by the changes.Three current and former partners at Deerfield Management, a health care hedge fund firm, paid Mr. Blaszczak to provide inside information about policy decisions at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, leading to millions of dollars in illegal profits, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and securities regulators said.While federal prosecutors have been investigating the case for more than a year, it is the most prominent insider-trading case to be filed by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan since its chief, Preet Bharara, was fired by President Trump in March. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spend more than $1 trillion a year on health care programs for the elderly, disabled and lower income families and are major buyers of medical instruments, drugs and medical services.Mr. Blaszczak, a former employee at the agency and founder of Precipio Health Strategies, was accused of pumping a friend at the agency for market-moving information that he passed to his clients at Deerfield, an unsealed indictment said.In his interactions with the hedge fund partners, Mr. Blaszczak bragged about his access to the inside information. In an email message, he said his analysis differed from that of one of his competitors because that competitor \u201cdoesn\u2019t know anyone at cms. His guesses are just wild random guesses,\u201d according to a separate complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The information involved tips about potential changes in government policy and regulations for things such as radiation therapy and kidney dialysis and how these policies would affect publicly traded companies.Two of the partners, Rob Olan and Ted Huber, were named in the indictment on Wednesday. Jordan Fogel, who worked at Deerfield from 2006 until last year, was charged separately and pleaded guilty this month.Federal prosecutors in New York contend the scheme generated $3.5 million in illegal profits. The S.E.C. said the information led to $3.9 million in illegal profits.\u201cDeerfield is committed to maintaining a strict culture of compliance and the highest ethical standards,\u201d Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Deerfield said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are cooperating fully with the government\u2019s investigation.\u201dMr. Huber\u2019s biography described him as a partner who \u201cprovides extensive research and analysis on individual companies operating in the health care industry.\u201dBarry Berke, his lawyer, said in a statement that Mr. Huber denied wrongdoing and that \u201chis research was based on detailed and rigorous analysis as well as the type of information regularly and properly relied upon by institutional investors in evaluating health care and medical companies.\u201dA biography for Mr. Olan on Deerfield\u2019s website described him as a \u201cpartner on the devices team at Deerfield since 2002.\u201dDavid Esseks, Mr. Olan\u2019s lawyer, said, \u201cRob Olan is an innocent man and looks forward to clearing his name at trial.\u201dMarc Mukasey, a lawyer for Mr. Fogel, said his client was \u201cresolving this issue and looking forward to the future.\u201dMr. Blaszczak used a friend and former colleague, Christopher Worrall, a senior staff member at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as his insider. Mr. Worrall would communicate \u201cmaterial, nonpublic information\u201d about the agency\u2019s rate decisions through text messages, telephone calls and meetings, including some at the agency\u2019s offices, the S.E.C. said.Mr. Blaszczak would pass the information to his hedge fund clients, sometimes within minutes of the communications, prosecutors said.In email exchanges made public by federal prosecutors, Mr. Blaszczak and Mr. Worrall would exchange banter with clients about how much money they could make by collaborating. In one email exchange in 2014, Mr. Blaszczak told Mr. Worrall that they would \u201ckill it working together.\u201dMr. Worrall responded: \u201cYou\u2019re like a drunk whore to me. Hard to resist. Lol. Let\u2019s talk.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Worrall, who was also charged, declined to comment. Mr. Blaszczak\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Blaszczak was paid $193,000 for his information over a year and a half, according to the S.E.C. Federal prosecutors said Mr. Blaszczak was paid $263,000 in consulting fees between 2012 and 2014.His name surfaced this year in the trial of Stefan Lumiere, a former Visium Capital Management employee, in a securities fraud trial. Christopher Plaford, a witness at the trial, testified that Mr. Blaszczak had provided him with confidential information that he used to make trades in two stocks.\u201cAs the second political intelligence case brought by the S.E.C. and D.O.J., this case underscores the government\u2019s focus on political intelligence firms and the need for investment professionals to closely monitor the sources of information that potentially emanates from government agencies,\u201d said Antonia Apps, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw several big insider-trading cases and is now a partner at the law firm Milbank.In the latest case, Mr. Worrall gave information to Mr. Blaszczak because of their friendship and in exchange for future employment or business opportunities, the S.E.C. said. The agency cited one example, in September 2011, when Mr. Blaszczak introduced his friend to a private health care policy firm, where Mr. Worrall then interviewed for a job. He did not take the job but used it as leverage to get a $10,000 raise.In the communications cited by authorities, some of the men appeared to be aware that their success in milking inside tips to make money could be their undoing.In one email exchange on July 1, 2013, Mr. Fogel and an unidentified co-conspirator discussed a trading strategy based on information from Mr. Blaszczak about Fresenius, a company that provides kidney dialysis, before an announcement. The unnamed person sounded a note of caution and urged the hedge fund managers not to \u201cget too greedy\u201d in acting on the information.One day later, Mr. Fogel credited Mr. Blaszczak for the insight, adding, \u201cWish we didn\u2019t wuss out but will still make a couple million on it.\u201dMr. Fogel suggested Mr. Blaszczak get paid more for his insights: \u201cLets not get crazy but still. Way more valuable than the other dc clowns put together I think.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Viewers Drift Online, Advertisers Hold Fast to Broadcast TV", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byTV ratings are collapsing. Media stocks are falling. Cord cutting is accelerating.There has been no shortage of bad headlines for television networks over the last few months, as investors grow concerned over dropping viewership and as people increasingly find new ways to entertain themselves.Yet while audience attention has drifted toward platforms like Netflix, Facebook and YouTube, there is one group of stubborn holdouts who are not ready to give up on broadcast television: advertisers.This week, as ad buyers cram into New York institutions like Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall to watch the broadcast networks talk up a new TV season, they will again prepare to spend as much as $9 billion to be a part of it. Though the market may be cooling this year, a significant drop is not expected.A reasonable person might ask how, in 2017, is that remotely possible?\u201cIt will continue to move forward this way as long as it works,\u201d said Lyle Schwartz, the president of investment for North America at GroupM, the ad buying arm of the advertising conglomerate WPP.But isn\u2019t buying a 30-second spot on television a little, well, out of date?As a media analyst at Pivotal Research, Brian Wieser, put it, advertising on TV is \u201cas archaic as water flowing through pipes.\u201d\u201cYou could set up a drone to take water from a reservoir and use fascinating technology and cutting-edge approaches to deliver it, but there\u2019s a good reason we use these systems,\u201d he said.In interviews, ad buyers and television executives pointed to a variety of reasons that advertisers remain attracted to ABC, NBC, Fox and CBS. Ratings aside, television still reaches more people and provides a reliable way for an ad to be seen on a full screen with sound. There is a limited amount of inventory, in contrast to the endless reach of the web, and marketers know rates will spike if they wait to buy airtime.It also does not hurt that Facebook and YouTube have had trouble in recent months with ads showing up next to objectionable content.\u201cSales directors at the networks are going to say, \u2018We have premium content that is professionally produced, and it\u2019s been vetted and won\u2019t be an issue for your brand to be associated with it,\u2019\u201d said Brad Adgate, a veteran media analyst. \u201cWith Google and Facebook, you\u2019ve seen stuff where they\u2019ve had to say that they have to do a better job.\u201dStill, there are serious questions about how sustainable all of this is. Trend lines certainly suggest things could go in the other direction. Networks are having trouble showing how many people are watching their content across a wide variety of platforms, audiences are growing accustomed to platforms where they can watch shows without commercials, and marketers are eager to find better ways to target potential customers.And at present, broadcast television is holding an edge thanks to an older audience. The median age for scripted TV\u2019s No. 1 show, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d and one of its top reality shows, \u201cThe Voice,\u201d is 55. Among 18- to 49-year-olds, ratings in broadcast television fell by 11 percent this season.\u201cIf you just look at where the business is going, we\u2019re in a transitional phase now where to a large degree, boomers are keeping television as we define it today afloat,\u201d said Kevin Reilly, the chief creative officer of Turner Entertainment.Advertisers are aware that this may not last forever.GroupM predicted that digital platforms would be taking a growing share of new advertising dollars. Still, even though digital players are surging, television remains the established elder statesman for advertisers. GroupM noted that television accounted for 42 percent of advertising investments last year, compared with 31 percent for digital.The sophistication of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s ability to target ads is no small matter, though, and TV networks have been scrambling to find ways to compete in that arena.Digital companies are capable of targeting audiences so narrow that they can pinpoint, say, Idaho residents in long-distance relationships who are contemplating buying a minivan. (Facebook\u2019s ads manager says that description matches 3,100 people.)As attractive as that slicing and dicing can be, television appears to have an advantage in terms of the actual commercial time it can offer marketers.\u201cIt\u2019s great if I can target someone I know is a truck driver who searched for the word \u2018truck\u2019 who visited my site a lot, but where do I get them to watch my ad?\u201d asked Joe Marchese, the newly named head of ad sales for Fox Networks Group. \u201cWho\u2019s going to make him or her watch it?\u201dAnd television still offers an enormous audience.\u201cThe number of minutes we show commercials is way more than YouTube or Facebook on a video basis \u2014 many multiples more,\u201d Mr. Marchese said.Rishad Tobaccowala, chief strategist for the Publicis Groupe, one of the world\u2019s largest advertising companies, said the millions who saw commercials on a hit show like \u201cThis Is Us\u201d could also be more valuable.\u201cIf you basically put that same advertising, say a million dollars, within Facebook and Google, the reality of it is that people are going to see those things in a very splintered fashion,\u201d he said.The so-called upfront season offers advertisers a chance to buy the bulk of their ads before marquee shows return in September. This creates a level of competition that advertisers cannot help but participate in.It also fosters a power dynamic that probably sounds foreign to a generation of consumers who tend to see automatically placed ads on YouTube content that could have been made a day earlier by anyone.\u201cWhat the networks do say is: \u2018Great, I\u2019m going to invite all my potential clients and clients to a room at the same time on the same day where I\u2019m going to show my shows that I may or may not actually put up this fall and may not keep for two episodes,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads. \u201c\u2018And I\u2019m going to make you sit next to your competitors and basically say here\u2019s the price of it, and if you don\u2019t pay this price now, it\u2019s going to cost you 30 percent more in six months.\u2019\u201dMass marketers aiming to drive people to, say, their stores or car dealerships rely on long-held TV plans to align with their product launches, and pulling out could be both expensive and risky.\u201cThe reason it\u2019s priced high and reason you have to buy in advance is because your competitors might buy it out,\u201d Mr. Morgan continued. It\u2019s like the Cold War but for brands, he said, adding, \u201cIf they have a bunch of missiles, you need a bunch more missiles.\u201dAnd so, for a week in mid-May, the networks still have the upper hand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As \u2018Brexit\u2019 Tensions Rise, E.U. Proposal Targets London Finance", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byEuropean Union officials fired an opening salvo on Thursday in a \u201cBrexit\u201d-related dispute that could threaten London\u2019s status as the undisputed financial capital of Europe and affect hundreds of trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of financial products.In the course of a series of proposed technical changes, the European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation bloc, hinted that it may seek a more centralized role in supervising the complex financial contracts known as derivatives when they are denominated in euros. It also suggested that it could institute requirements that clearing houses, which act as middlemen in derivatives transactions, be located within the European Union.Those rules, if enacted, could force clearing houses for derivatives to be regulated by European authorities even after Britain leaves the bloc, or to relocate part of their operations in order to avoid losing business to competitors.\u201cOf course, in the context of Brexit, we see that the situation is changing,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice president of the European Commission, said in a briefing announcing the proposals. Enhanced supervision of such markets had been in the pipeline for several years, he said, but Brexit made the proposals more urgent.The negotiations over the financial sector are particularly vital for London \u2014 the ability to serve Europe-based clients from London in the so-called single market has been a main driver of growth for Britain\u2019s financial industry. Once the country leaves the bloc, that access will no longer be guaranteed: It will depend on the outcome of the talks.One important question for financial companies has been the extent to which they will be able to clear and settle transactions in euros, including derivatives, outside the European Union.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Derivatives are financial contracts linked to the future value of assets between two persons or companies. Usually tied to currency or interest rate fluctuations, they are designed to reduce risks for a company or individual holding the underlying asset and are often negotiated privately, rather than traded on an exchange as stocks are.But on Thursday, the European Commission offered a series of proposed technical changes related to the reporting of derivatives transactions. In briefing documents, it said that it would be necessary for firms that \u201cplay a key systemic role for E.U. financial markets\u201d to be subject to \u201csafeguards provided by the E.U. legal framework. This includes, where necessary, enhanced supervision at the E.U. level and/or location requirements.\u201dIt said it would present \u201cfurther legislative proposals\u201d in June to ensure financial stability and the safety and soundness of clearing houses.The biggest impact could be felt by LCH.Clearnet, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group and is the largest of the so-called central counterparties clearing euro derivatives in London. Central counterparties have had an increasingly important role since the financial crisis, acting as a backstop and guaranteeing derivative contracts even if one side in the transaction defaults.Amid the uncertainty of the Brexit negotiations, banks and other financial firms with large operations in London have been making contingency plans to guarantee they can still serve clients based on the Continent.Standard Chartered, which is based in Britain but generates much of its income in Asia, said on Wednesday that it was in discussions with regulators in Germany to open a subsidiary in Frankfurt, and HSBC has said it may move as many as 1,000 jobs to Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steven Cohen Makes a Comeback at Premier Hedge Fund Conference", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 The billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen may be barred from managing outside money until next year, but he has already hinted that he plans to get back into the hedge game.The most telling sign yet? Mr. Cohen\u2019s unexpected appearance at a Las Vegas hedge fund conference this week.Mr. Cohen was seen late Thursday night playing craps at a table in the casino of the Bellagio Las Vegas, one of the city\u2019s most extravagant hotels. Mr. Cohen, 60, was rolling the dice with Ilana Weinstein, a sister of the hedge fund manager Boaz Weinstein, at a table with a maximum bet of $5,000.Boaz Weinstein and his sister were featured speakers this week at the annual SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, known as SALT \u2014 a lavish multiday hedge fund conference that draws a slew of prominent money managers and politicians. This year\u2019s featured guest was Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president.Mr. Cohen\u2019s appearance at SALT \u2014 where he also dined privately with a small group of conference speakers, including the prominent short-seller Jim Chanos, the activist investor William A. Ackman and Mr. Biden \u2014 was a surprise, given that he was not featured in publicity for the event.Mr. Cohen last attended in 2011, when he was interviewed onstage by the conference\u2019s founder, Anthony Scaramucci. Two years later, Mr. Cohen\u2019s highly successful SAC Capital Advisors was indicted in the biggest securities fraud case ever brought against a hedge fund.On Thursday morning, Mr. Cohen was a featured speaker at an event for veterans at the Bellagio. In recent years, he has become a major benefactor to organizations helping wounded veterans.Later, Mr. Cohen went to see Duran Duran play a private concert for conference attendees.That Mr. Cohen attended other SALT events has renewed speculation that a small investment firm he established last year \u2014 Stamford Harbor Capital \u2014 will begin raising money from outside investors next year once a two-year ban he agreed to with the Securities and Exchange Commission expires in January.Mr. Cohen agreed to the prohibition, which barred him from managing money for outside investors, to settle accusations of an administrative failure to supervise brought by the regulatory agency.But the man viewed by many as one of the most successful stock traders of his generation was never charged by either prosecutors or regulators with insider trading. And his longtime prosecutorial nemesis, Preet Bharara, who once called SAC Capital a \u201cmagnet for market cheaters,\u201d is no longer the United States attorney in Manhattan.Representatives for Mr. Cohen, who now oversees a $12 billion private investment firm called Point72 Asset Management, declined to comment on Mr. Cohen\u2019s intentions for Stamford Harbor.Mr. Cohen is not allowed to raise money while the industry ban is in place. But there\u2019s nothing to stop him from mingling with potential investors \u2014 at conferences or in the casinos.There were no obvious marketing people with Mr. Cohen at SALT, and he did not appear to come with much of an entourage.But someone associated with Mr. Cohen was handing out invitations to a fund-raiser he will hold on Tuesday in Manhattan for Bo Dietl, the former New York police detective and media personality who is planning to run for mayor. Tickets for the event cost $4,950.Mr. Cohen, who is also widely known as a prodigious art collector, gave $1 million to President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.And Mr. Cohen has become increasingly active in raising and donating money for aiding injured veterans of the armed services. Last year, he committed $325 million to a program to help veterans who had suffered traumatic brain injuries through his Cohen Veterans Network, an organization he set up.His network runs a number of clinics across the United States to provide mental health care to veterans. He became interested in helping veterans because one of his sons served as a Marine after graduating from college and did a tour of duty in Afghanistan.Mr. Cohen\u2019s Point72, which is run as a family office to manage his personal fortune, functions much as SAC did. It employs nearly 1,000 employees in SAC\u2019s former office center in Stamford, Conn., and it has teams of portfolio managers trading mostly stocks and bonds.He wound down SAC around the same time a federal judge accepted the firm\u2019s guilty plea in 2014. In settling with federal prosecutors and the S.E.C., the hedge fund paid $1.8 billion in fines and restitution.Still, there are reminders of the bad days for Mr. Cohen.A federal appellate court recently heard arguments in a bid by a former SAC portfolio manager, Mathew Martoma, who is now serving a nine-year prison term after being convicted in 2014, to win a new criminal trial. Mr. Martoma was convicted in one of the biggest insider trading cases ever \u2014 a trial in which Mr. Cohen\u2019s name frequently came up during testimony.Last month, a New Jersey appellate court reinstated an 11-year-old lawsuit against Mr. Cohen\u2019s former firm, which involves allegations that SAC conspired with other hedge funds to drive down the price of shares of Fairfax Financial, a large Canadian insurer. Fairfax is seeking billions of dollars in damages, claiming it was the target of a long-running scheme by hedge funds seeking to profit from a sharp decline in the company\u2019s stock price.And then there is \u201cBillions,\u201d the drama on the cable network Showtime that depicts a billionaire hedge fund manager doing battle with a federal prosecutor who is on a Captain Ahab-like quest to get his white whale.Behind the scenes, the machinery for Mr. Cohen\u2019s upstart hedge-fund-in-waiting quietly churns away.He has selected one of his longtime employees, Perry Boyle, to run the new firm. Mr. Boyle runs Stamford Harbor in a building on the other side of the parking lot from Point72\u2019s headquarters in Stamford.Stamford Harbor currently manages $105 million of Mr. Cohen\u2019s money; according to regulatory filings, he owns more than 25 percent of the new firm \u201cthrough intermediate entities.\u201dAt the Bellagio craps table, Mr. Cohen played for about 15 minutes before walking away \u2014 mostly likely to get away from the gaggle of onlookers who were beginning to gather.Mr. Cohen left without speaking, but two women walked up to him and asked if he had won. A reporter could not hear his answer.He was still wearing a purple glow stick around his neck, a souvenir from the Duran Duran concert he attended earlier in the evening.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Las Vegas, and Matthew Goldstein from New York.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Las Vegas, and Matthew Goldstein from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Exxon Mobil Shareholders Demand Accounting of Climate Change Policy Risks", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byA majority of Exxon Mobil\u2019s shareholders, in a reversal, have voted in favor of more open and detailed analyses of the risks posed to its business by policies aimed at stemming climate change.Those policies include the goal of the Paris climate agreement to restrict global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.Preliminary results announced at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday put the results at 62.3 percent in favor, up from the 38 percent a similar resolution garnered last year.The resolution, which the company\u2019s directors opposed, is nonbinding. But Darren W. Woods, the chief executive, said the board would consider the result because it reflected the view of a majority of shareholders.Investors and groups concerned about climate change submitted similar proposals in the last few years, but Exxon resisted.Increasingly, though, Wall Street and large investors, including fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, two of Exxon\u2019s largest investors, have signaled concerns about the risks to companies whose assets were based in fossil fuels that could lose significant value as climate policies and market forces reduce demand.Exxon would not say how specific funds voted their shares on Wednesday, and Vanguard would not disclose its own vote. A person briefed on BlackRock\u2019s decision said the fund voted with the majority on the proposal.BlackRock voted for a similar proposal earlier this year at Occidental Petroleum, the first time it had opposed company management on such a measure.Three years ago, a group of investors withdrew a similar resolution after Exxon agreed to report details of the risks that stricter limits on carbon emissions would place on its business, becoming the first oil and gas producer to do so. But that report lacked the detail that the resolution\u2019s proponents were seeking.This year, the resolution was led by the New York State Pension Fund and the Church of England investment fund and included dozens of backers like the New York City Retirement Systems.\u201cThe burden is now on Exxon Mobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously,\u201d said Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller and trustee of the state\u2019s Common Retirement Fund.Mr. Woods said before the vote that Exxon Mobil believed the risks of climate change were serious and warranted action. But he expressed confidence in the company\u2019s reporting on its long-term financial viability, which indicates that even assuming the 2-degree goal of the accord is met, demand for oil and gas would remain high.\u201cIt is a global challenge that requires global participation, and we think the advantage of the Paris framework is that it engages and involves communities and countries all around the world irrespective of their economic development,\u201d he said.Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buy? Sell? Politics May Move the Market, but Rarely for Long", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseIn a period of otherwise extended market calm, geopolitics have been driving periodic bouts of volatility. Even small investors have been making bets on the impact politics can have on stocks and other asset classes. After last week\u2019s sell-off, I got a wave of questions from people asking whether Mr. Trump might be impeached and if they should sell stocks.I obviously can\u2019t answer the first question. As for selling stocks, my answer, as it has been consistently since the election, is \u201cno,\u201d at least not because of the troubles swirling around the president.Consider what has happened in the days since the headline-making news. By the middle of this week, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index had recovered virtually everything it lost after the Trump-Russia news broke, and on Thursday it closed at a new high.Brazil\u2019s Bovespa index regained much of the ground it lost last week and was in positive territory for the year to date.Within a month of Brexit, European stocks had recovered nearly all their losses. This year European stock markets have been notching new highs.Even some of Wall Street\u2019s most famous and successful investors have been struggling this year to turn political upheaval into market gains. Paulson & Company and Soros Fund Management, two of the best-known global macro hedge funds, which make bets on geopolitical events, lost billions last year according to an annual hedge fund ranking compiled by LCH Investments. Paul Tudor Jones\u2019s Tudor Investment, another macro fund, was flat, and Mr. Jones recently told investors he\u2019s taking on more risk and shifting to more quantitative strategies in an effort to enhance performance.A macro hedge fund index compiled by Hedge Fund Research is down nearly 1 percent since Jan. 1 and over 4 percent for the last 12 months, one of the worst performing hedge fund indexes. Meanwhile, the S.&P. 500 gained almost 10 percent in 2016 and is up more than 7 percent this year.By and large, \u201cinvestors should tune out political events,\u201d said James B. Stack, president of InvesTech Research and Stack Financial Management, who has done a study of what he calls \u201ccrisis events\u201d and their effect on markets. \u201cHistorically speaking, and as a seasoned investor, I\u2019d say investors should just ignore geopolitical events like Brexit or whatever is happening in Brazil.\u201dThe problem, Mr. Stack\u2019s research has found, is that \u201cgeopolitical events may be widely feared, and there will often be a knee-jerk market reaction when they\u2019re unexpected, but seldom do they have a lasting impact. Underlying economic trends and monetary policy are far more important.\u201dMarkus Schomer, chief economist at the asset manager PineBridge Investments, made a similar point. As fundamental investors with longer time horizons, \u201cwe try not to be distracted by the political noise,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling even our traders with shorter time horizons that what we\u2019re seeing doesn\u2019t really affect the economy or monetary policy, which is more important for markets than anything else.\u201dMr. Stack noted that stocks declined sharply after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But the bear market and recession that followed the technology bubble that exploded in 2000 were already well underway by then. September 2001 turned out to be an unusually bad time to sell stocks: By New Year\u2019s Day 2002, little more than three months after the post-9/11 low reached on Sept. 21, the S.&P. 500 had gained close to 20 percent.A more recent example was the showdown over the federal debt ceiling in 2011, when Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded United States government securities for the first time amid fears the government might default on its debt. \u201cStocks dropped 15 percent in less than two months and we were on the brink of a bear market,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cOnce the crisis was resolved, stocks came roaring back,\u201d and had regained all their losses by year-end.Of 11 major geopolitical events examined by Mr. Stack\u2019s firm, only two \u2014 the Nazi invasion of France in May 1940, and Japan\u2019s bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 \u2014 led to market losses over one-week, three-month and one-year periods (and in the case of Pearl Harbor, the one-year decline was less than 1 percent).President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination had no discernible impact: Stocks were up more than 20 percent a year later.As geopolitical crises go, those were pretty big shocks to markets and investor psychology. So far, nothing in the Trump administration has come close. Still, expectations that Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress would succeed in enacting business- and shareholder-friendly tax and regulatory changes are part of what has driven recent market gains.Mr. Stack noted that measures of confidence among small businesses, chief executives and consumers are at or near record levels. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that expectations have accelerated since the election,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the question is whether political turmoil will turn those expectations upside down,\u201d leading to a loss of confidence and lower consumer spending. That could happen, but so far, \u201cwe\u2019re not seeing any evidence of that,\u201d he said.He said comparisons to the Watergate-era bear market of 1973-74 were off base, because then the country was in recession, the Arab oil crisis sent gasoline prices surging, inflation was raging and interest rates hit record highs. Arguably, President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s abandonment of the gold standard and the transition to market-determined currency exchange rates had more to do with plunging stock prices than his crumbling presidency.Mr. Schomer said a failure to act upon many of Mr. Trump\u2019s spending and tax proposals might not be such a bad thing for markets, given that the United States economy is already at or close to full employment and doesn\u2019t need additional stimulus. \u201cAt the end of the day, the only reason we\u2019ll have a recession is if the Fed is forced to raise interest rates too quickly, unless we have a massive crisis, which I don\u2019t see happening,\u201d he said.If anything, history suggests that long-term investors should buy stocks after markets fall on bad geopolitical news, not sell. But that\u2019s not to say this time won\u2019t prove to be an exception, or that markets won\u2019t correct for other reasons.Whatever happens with President Trump, the United States is in the ninth year of the second-longest bull market since World War II; none have made it past 10 years. Valuations are getting stretched. Sooner or later, there will be another correction, and eventually a bear market.Nonetheless, Mr. Schomer says he sees no imminent end to the bull market. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to see a 25 percent surge this year, but this economic cycle is so slow and steady with so few imbalances, we could end up with 8 to 10 percent gains the next few years and a much greater degree of overvaluation.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Stack said: \u201cWe still believe this market will hit new highs in 2017, but the low volatility and the high valuations suggest this is not a low-risk market. It\u2019s not a market in which you should be investing large sums of new capital.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Strapped Pension Funds, and the Hefty Investment Fees They Pay", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byFair GameWhere are the pensioners\u2019 yachts?We\u2019re talking about the fees charged by hedge funds and private equity firms to invest pension fund money \u2014 fees that enrich the wealthy but imperil workers, retirees and taxpayers.State and local pensions oversee $3.6 trillion in investments meant to benefit former teachers, firefighters, police officers and other workers. These people rely on their pensions for a comfortable retirement.That is a mighty deep hole. And many pension fund trustees have responded by increasing their allocation to so-called alternative investments, such as in hedge funds and private equity, rather than sticking to lower-cost vehicles that invest in stocks and bonds. They seem to think that swinging for the fences with the more exotic strategies will close the yawning gap.These investments beat the market, sometimes. But their enormous fees \u2014 as much as 2 percent in management fees and 20 percent of any gains \u2014 must always be paid. And these costs push pension funds deeper into the hole.Meanwhile, the fund incurred almost $750 million in direct investment expenses in fiscal 2016, up 7.6 percent from the previous year.\u201cStates that tend to be in more financial difficulty tend to have higher-risk portfolios,\u201d said Bill Bergman, director of research at Truth in Accounting, who is a former economist and financial market policy analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. \u201cIn Illinois, the defense is that in the long run, these investments will be good for us. But they are expensive, opaque and risky.\u201dReturns on these vehicles do not always match their promise. \u201cFunds with recent and rapid entries into alternative markets \u2014 including significant allocations to hedge funds \u2014 were among those with the weakest 10-year yields,\u201d Pew noted.The dozen funds included in the analysis held almost $800 billion in assets. If fees on their alternative investments had been halved over the last five fiscal years, the 12 funds would have saved $3.7 billion annually and $18.5 billion over the period. Going forward, that reduced-fee structure would save the average pension fund an additional $1.8 billion over five years and almost $8 billion after 15 years.The report urges pension fund overseers to work to reduce the fees they pay and adopt policies requiring a full accounting and disclosure of all fees by alternative investment managers.\u201cThis report provides a blueprint for retirement security that fuels economic growth and creates good jobs,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the A.F.T. \u201cBy calling out these pernicious practices and working closely with pension trustees and legislative allies, we\u2019ve begun to see fees cut and fee structures for hedge fund and private equity managers exposed.\u201dWhile some large pension funds have started to cut back on alternative investments, most continue to believe in them.\u201cIn the last 16 years, our fees have gone from $50 million to over $600 million,\u201d Mr. Folwell said in an interview. Meanwhile, assets under management grew by only 33 percent over that time.\u201cWhen I applied for this job, I said I was going to cut Wall Street fees by $100 million,\u201d Mr. Folwell said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to reduce complexity and build value for our participants.\u201dSince entering office three months ago, Mr. Folwell said he had telephoned all of the pension\u2019s investment managers \u2014 roughly 175 \u2014 to make sure they had the state\u2019s interests at heart.\u201cWe asked them: \u2018Who are you? Where are you? How good are you? And how much are we paying you?\u2019\u201d Mr. Folwell said.Not everyone made the grade: Mr. Folwell said he had fired nine managers so far. He has also extracted more than $30 million in fee reductions from some managers who remain.Mr. Folwell is also examining how his fund\u2019s assets are valued. Many alternative investments are illiquid and difficult to assess; because a fund\u2019s fees are based on these valuations, it is imperative that they are not overstated, he said.Mr. Folwell has an unusual background. For three years, he was North Carolina\u2019s assistant secretary of commerce, and before that he spent eight years in its House of Representatives. Before he got his master\u2019s degree in accounting, he was a trash collector and motorcycle mechanic.\u201cI\u2019m the keeper of the public purse,\u201d he said. \u201cMy loyalty is to the purse and whoever has money inside the purse.\u201dAlas, Mr. Folwell is rare among public pension overseers, many of whom seem to be wowed by the wizards of Wall Street.\u201cOur history teaches us that well-entrenched special interest groups have a tendency to dominate public policy for their own benefit at the expense of the rest of us,\u201d said Mr. Bergman of Truth in Accounting. \u201cThat appears to be the current state of affairs in public pension funds.\u201dMr. Bergman said he believes one problem with the current system is that many overseers have a duty only to the fund\u2019s beneficiaries. While that might seem appropriate, it can encourage these fiduciaries to make riskier bets in the hopes of generating better returns.\u201cIf your benefits are guaranteed, as they are in Illinois,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have the incentive to take more risk, in part because the insiders and beneficiaries have all the upside and don\u2019t get the downside.\u201dBecause that downside ultimately falls to the taxpayers, Mr. Bergman said, pension fund trustees should also have a duty to them.\u201cWe need fundamental changes in fiduciary duties in public pension funds,\u201d he said, \u201cto align the incentives more closely not just with beneficiaries but with taxpayers as well.\u201d A good idea.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Succession, ValueAct Hedge Fund Practices What It Preaches", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsJeffrey W. Ubben has long been a different kind of activist investor. Mr. Ubben, a founder of ValueAct Capital, largely avoids the limelight and mostly works with companies behind the scenes to improve performance, often focusing heavily on corporate governance.Now Mr. Ubben is practicing what he preaches by putting into effect his own orderly succession.In passing control of the firm\u2019s $16 billion portfolio to his longtime deputy, Mason Morfit, Mr. Ubben is promoting a degree of continuity that is rare in the hedge fund world. Mr. Morfit was one of his first hires after ValueAct\u2019s founding in 2000, and he has played a major role in some of its most prominent investments, including holding board seats at Microsoft and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.Having learned the ropes over nearly two decades, Mr. Morfit is positioned to continue the kind of constructive activism that has produced annualized returns of 15 percent a year. Mr. Ubben will remain chief executive, where one main challenge will be to support his new chief investment officer without stepping on his toes.Mr. Morfit has his work cut out for him. Despite rising equity markets and signs that individual stocks are once again being traded on their merits rather than en masse \u2014 an environment that stock pickers hope will favor their approach over index investments \u2014 the typical hedge fund has failed to perform remotely well enough to justify the industry\u2019s high fees. The HFR Global Hedge Fund index is up a little over 2 percent so far this year, trailing the 7 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.At a Reuters forum on activism in February, Mr. Ubben said ValueAct had been selling holdings and building a $3 billion cash position because it regarded stocks as too expensive.Other hedge funds face similar challenges, but few have handled succession as deftly as ValueAct. Ray Dalio has shaken up management at Bridgewater Associates twice in the past year, while Eric Mindich never groomed a successor at Eton Park before pulling the plug on the multistrategy firm in March, for example.Fund founders looking to preserve their legacy can learn from Mr. Ubben\u2019s example.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Price Amazon Is Content to Keep High: $1,000 a Share", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 On Monday, Amazon.com\u2019s share price briefly crossed the $1,000 mark for the first time in its 20-year history as a publicly traded company.Cracking the arbitrary threshold of a four-digit stock price is a reminder of just how heavy Amazon has become.It is now the fourth most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The top five, Apple, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, have emerged as the dominant forces in technology. Amazon\u2019s shares are up almost 33 percent for the year and up 368 percent over five years.Crossing the $1,000 mark, said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify ETFs, which includes a fund that holds Amazon shares, \u201cspeaks to the triumph of e-commerce and the vision of Jeff Bezos.\u201dThe investor optimism about Amazon is, in many respects, unchanged from when it went public in 1997.Amazon remains a long-term play based on a wager that online shopping will replace a healthy chunk of traditional retail over time. Even with all of Amazon\u2019s staggering growth \u2014 $136 billion in revenue last year, compared with $148 million in 1997 \u2014 e-commerce still represents only around 10 percent of total retail spending in the United States, the company\u2019s most mature market.That leaves Amazon \u2014 which accounted for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the United States last year, according to Slice Intelligence \u2014 with a lot of room to grow. Some analysts say its gains could be especially large in the coming years as more physical retailers close stores and file for bankruptcy.\u201cFor any stock analyst trying to find growth and return on investment in the retail sector today, they\u2019re clearly putting money into Amazon because that\u2019s where they anticipate the growth coming from,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2, a retail research firm.Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. The stock closed at $996.70 on Tuesday, up 0.09 percent.Amazon has also given investors reason to believe it is not content to remain simply an e-commerce giant. Through its Amazon Web Services business, it is now the largest provider of cloud computing services in the world. It stands to benefit for many years as hundreds of billions of dollars in information technology spending shifts from traditional purchases of hardware and software to effectively renting them in the data centers.Because profit margins in cloud computing are wider than those in the retail business, Amazon, which had only a passing familiarity with profits over most of its life, is now consistently in the black.After an embarrassing smartphone venture, Amazon demonstrated that it, too, could stay ahead of important changes in consumer technology with the invention of Echo, a voice-activated speaker powered by an artificially intelligent assistant called Alexa. Although the company says little about sales of the devices, other than that tens of millions have been sold, Alexa appears to be emerging as a significant new technology platform, and Amazon\u2019s strategy is being widely imitated by rivals.One of those rivals, Alphabet, is not too far behind Amazon in chasing the $1,000 a share milestone (the market capitalization of Alphabet, which is far more profitable than Amazon, is still about $200 billion higher than that of the internet retailer).The most powerful technology companies are becoming even more powerful. Of course, that is no guarantee of staying power. Apple and Microsoft, much older than Amazon, each lost its way for a time. And tech pioneers like Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies two years ago, and IBM have struggled to adapt to technology changes.Amazon is known for being ruthlessly competitive on prices for products it sells on its website, but that does not extend to its share price. Last week at the company\u2019s annual investor meeting in Seattle, a woman who said she was a longtime Amazon shareholder beseeched Mr. Bezos to split the company\u2019s stock to help make it more accessible to less wealthy investors.Mr. Bezos said Amazon considered such possibilities from time to time but had no plans for a split.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tales of \u2018Flippers\u2019 Led to a Housing Bubble", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThere is still no consensus on why the last housing boom and bust happened. That is troubling, because that violent housing cycle helped to produce the Great Recession and financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. We need to understand it all if we are going to be able to avoid ordeals like that in the future.But the explanations for what happened in housing are not, I think, to be found in the conventional data favored by economists but rather in sociologically important narratives \u2014 like tales of getting rich through \u201cflipping\u201d houses and shares of initial public offerings \u2014 that constitute the shifting mentality of the era.Consider the data for a moment. It shows us that extreme changes took place but doesn\u2019t tell us why.Instead, during the 1997 to 2005 boom there were multitudes of narratives about smart investors who were bold enough to take a position in the market. To single out one strand, recall the stories of flippers who would buy a house, fix it up, and resell it within months at a huge profit. These stories appear to have been broadly exciting to people who didn\u2019t flip houses themselves but who appear to have begun to think that stretching a little and buying a house with a large mortgage would make them wise investors.It can take a long time for narratives like this to grip the popular imagination. Flipping was \u201ca thing\u201d in the condominium conversion boom of the 1970s and \u201980s. The idea then was this: Big-time converters with deep pockets would buy apartment buildings and convert the rental apartments to owner-occupied condos, selling units to diverse individuals, some of them flippers. For public relations purposes, converters would offer to sell at reduced prices to renters already living in a building, and typically to some outsiders, too.This generated buzz. When renters and speculators flipped their purchase contracts at a big profit, sometimes using borrowed money for down payments to flip multiple units without actually even closing on the condos, it was thrilling. It seemed that anyone with energy and initiative could get rich doing this.Some people eager to make quick profits bought Donald J. Trump\u2019s well-timed 2004 book, \u201cTrump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life,\u201d written with Meredith McIver. Some enrolled in the less well-timed Trump University, which emphasized real estate investment in 2005, at the very end of the housing boom; it shut down, amid lawsuits and recrimination, in 2010.The promoters of condo conversions and I.P.O.s were onto something. By giving discounts to buyers who would make a high return, they captivated the nation with tales of people who had no advanced degrees or hefty r\u00e9sum\u00e9s but made fortunes anyway.The public fascination with speculating in housing has been held in check by regulators empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, but that restraint is tenuous with the election as president of a real estate promoter intent on reducing regulators\u2019 power. These narratives are still potent and could easily spur further spirals in the housing market.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

So Fiffer went on to train at two London restaurants (Moro and Nopi), and Sperling moved to New York to work with chefs and consult on the then-burgeoning food hall trend.

{"Headline": "Chinese Merchants Thrive in Senegal, Where People \u2018Needed Stuff\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byDakar JournalDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 Fresh out of college and frustrated by the paucity of job prospects at home, Cao Qihan, 23, did what generations of ambitious Chinese had done before him: He rolled the dice and ventured to a far-off, utterly unfamiliar land, where people speak languages he doesn\u2019t understand.Mr. Cao had relatives in Dakar, the capital, but little idea of what to expect.\u201cWe Chinese think Africa is uncivilized and dangerous, but it\u2019s turned out to not be so bad,\u201d he said just weeks after his arrival, as he stuffed dumplings at his family\u2019s restaurant in Dakar\u2019s expanding Chinatown. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stay awhile.\u201dThese days, more than 200 Chinese-owned shops line Boulevard du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle, a gritty thoroughfare that slices through the middle-class neighborhood of Centenaire and ends at the city\u2019s imposing Grand Mosque.The cramped shops heave with rhinestone-slathered jewelry, stacks of plastic kitchenware and women\u2019s shoes adorned with bows and bling. Everything is made in China and few items sell for more than $5.Unlike vibrant Chinatowns the world over, Dakar\u2019s Chinese enclave is a charmless, rough-and-tumble affair that offers little appeal to those not in the market for wholesale goods. There are no Buddhist temples and few restaurants, and most of the day its sidewalks have a decidedly languid feel.Most shopkeepers are originally from Henan, a poor, densely settled central province whose population of 94 million rivals that of Egypt.Within China, migrants from Henan are often regarded with distrust, victims of discrimination based on a vague but commonly held notion that they are prone to criminality. Many toil in the most menial of jobs, working as truck drivers, farmers or laborers.A pioneer of sorts, Mr. Zhu arrived here 17 years ago from Henan to set up a trade show for Chinese products. He never left.\u201cI realized that China had lots of stuff and the people here needed stuff, so it was a good match,\u201d he said.Mr. Zhu opened a shop selling artificial flowers and unintentionally became the nucleus of a growing Chinese presence in Dakar that has come to dominate the wholesale trade in low-cost consumer goods.For strivers seeking opportunity abroad, Senegal seldom makes the list of choice destinations, but the ease of obtaining a visa often trumps the misgivings that many Chinese have about Africa.New arrivals usually start off working for a wholesaler they know from home and then set off on their own as soon as they have saved enough for their first batch of goods.Life is seldom easy. The hours are long, the profits thin and the loneliness unrelenting. Men often come on their own, but even married couples tend to leave children back home to be raised by grandparents.On a recent afternoon, as the midday heat thinned the sidewalk crowds to a trickle, bored shopkeepers watched Chinese films on their phones while their Senegalese workers dusted the shelves and chatted with one another in Wolof, the lingua franca, which few Chinese understand.My query about life in Senegal uncorked a torrent of complaints from the bosses: too many competitors, too few customers and rising prices for the merchandise bought during annual buying trips to China.Wang Xu, 34, who sells brightly colored bangles with his younger brother, attributed slow sales to the growing glut of entrepreneurs from China. \u201cTo make matters worse, Senegalese have less and less money to spend,\u201d he said.There was also grumbling about pilfered merchandise \u2014 and the indifference of the local police \u2014 but mostly a longing for home and those left behind. Again and again, the phrase \u201cchi ku\u201d was offered up, a well-worn expression of Chinese forbearance that means to eat bitterness.\u201cMy son is growing up without a father,\u201d Mr. Wang said flatly, lighting another cigarette, part of his two-pack-a-day habit.For Senegalese, the arrival of Chinese wholesalers has been a mixed blessing. The low-end merchandise they import sustains countless peddlers, many of whom fan out into the countryside and even to other countries in West Africa. Less pleased are the Senegalese traders who used to travel to China to buy the same goods but have been squeezed out.Jean Noel Faye, 38, who hawks women\u2019s shoes at a ramshackle outdoor market in Dakar, said he had little sympathy for the well-to-do Senegalese merchants who complain about the Chinese and their rock-bottom prices.\u201cWithout the Chinese, we would have nothing to sell,\u201d said Mr. Faye, who earns about 80 cents on every pair. \u201cThose who have negative impressions of the Chinese are already rich.\u201dOrdinary Senegalese do have legitimate complaints: about shoddy electronics, tainted medicines and the Chinese trawlers that compete with local fishermen for plummeting fish stocks.Residents who work in Chinese-owned shops gripe about low pay and what might be charitably described as a yawning culture gap. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have anything in common with the Chinese,\u201d one shop assistant said, emphasizing the lack of a shared language. \u201cTheir only reason to come to Senegal is to make money.\u201dBut expressions of gratitude are more common, a sentiment bolstered by the cornucopia of Chinese-backed projects that have improved life in this dog-eared, traffic-clogged city. There are miles of new and refurbished roads, a sumptuous national theater and clusters of gleaming exercise equipment that draw multitudes of fitness-crazed Senegalese to a seaside promenade at dusk.The two communities, though, live in separate worlds. Mr. Zhu, the pioneering wholesaler of synthetic flowers, said he knew of only two mixed marriages during all his years in Senegal. At Jade Sea, Blue Sky, the Chinese restaurant that employs Mr. Cao, the newly arrived migrant, Senegalese patrons are a rarity.During lunch one recent afternoon, the restaurant\u2019s private dining rooms were packed: one with young engineers helping to build the city\u2019s new airport expressway, another with toughened Fujianese merchants riding out a bout of political instability in nearby Gambia. A third room was occupied by Wu Haohong, a recently arrived businessman with a nervous laugh and an ample belly.Briskly working his way through a box of blue-tipped Chinese cigarettes, Mr. Wu extolled the opportunities of Africa but said migrants from China sometimes chose the wrong place to settle down. He knows from experience: He spent seven years in Angola but left after being robbed at gunpoint one too many times.\u201cEven the police in Angola are bandits,\u201d he said, explaining why he abandoned his building supply business and moved to Senegal, opening a karaoke parlor catering to single Chinese men \u2014 and staffed by young Chinese women in crop tops who provide furtive, short-term companionship.\u201cThe truth is that chaotic places can be good for business because it thins out the competition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everyone has their limits.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Weirdly Calm. Here\u2019s a Theory of Why.", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsWhen Donald J. Trump won the presidency in November, one bet seemed like a sure thing: We were in for a volatile few years. And in Washington, that forecast has come true. This unconventional presidency is creating an avalanche of uncertainty in areas including global trade, taxes and health care.But on Wall Street, these are the quietest of times. Prices for stocks and many other assets are less volatile than at any time since before the global financial crisis a decade ago, and volatility is, by some measures, near record lows.Consider this: In 2015, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index moved by more than 1 percent on 29 percent of trading days. Last year that fell to 19 percent. So far in 2017, there has been a 1 percent or greater swing in the market in only three trading sessions, or 3.5 percent.This sense of calm would be notable in any event, but the contrast with the sheer variance in the policy world makes it particularly unusual. In a single week, the Trump administration might flirt with exiting the North American Free Trade Agreement, roll out an outline for a multitrillion dollar tax cut and push legislation that would overhaul the health care sector, one-sixth of the United States economy.But while they do a good job of indicating why indexes like the Vix are so low, these technical explanations are less effective at explaining why the actual fluctuations in markets have been so subdued \u2014 realized volatility, to use the traders\u2019 term, as opposed to expected volatility.Something is causing the shares of the most widely owned companies to jump around less than they almost always have in the past. And they also don\u2019t do a great job of explaining why many other markets have also become less volatile than in the recent past, including international stocks, currencies and bonds.Dating to the 2008 financial crisis, markets have swung on every hint of news out of world capitals \u2014 Washington, especially, but also Berlin and Tokyo and Beijing \u2014 because the very future of the global economy seemed to hang in the balance. From the financial crisis to the eurozone crisis to the efforts by Japan to reflate its economy to the effort by China to deleverage its economy, the policies set by central banks and national governments were the prime mover of investor sentiment and the global outlook.Those days are over, at least for the moment. In normal times, markets are driven much less by what governments do and much more by, well, the economic fundamentals. How many people are working, with what level of productivity and savings levels, and what are the resulting economic growth rates, levels of corporate profitability, and interest rates?After all, the assets of those major companies \u2014 Exxon Mobil\u2019s oil rigs and Google\u2019s search algorithm and all the rest \u2014 don\u2019t really change from day to day. All that changes is investor perception about what kind of cash those assets will generate in the future. Isn\u2019t it actually fairly rare that a piece of news should change the fundamental outlook by that much?What makes this moment unusual is that there really are policy choices in play that could have hugely distortive effects on those fundamentals: what happens to trade policy, taxes and health care in the United States; what terms Britain achieves in its exit from the European Union; even whether the E.U. as we know it survives.But if the last few years have taught investors anything, it is that those with a hair-trigger reaction to political news stand to lose, while those who bet on a continued steady and unexceptional expansion will win.You see a bit of that in how subsequent conflicts over United States fiscal policy during the Obama years generated less market volatility. The debt ceiling standoff of 2011 generated huge market swings as traders bet on the risk of a default; the standoffs over the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d at the end of 2012 and a government shutdown in October 2013 caused mere murmurs.Investors learned a lesson that it\u2019s easy to overreact to political developments, and the same seems to have happened globally in the last several months.The risk, of course, is that this generates complacency.Low volatility could make banks, hedge funds and other institutions more comfortable taking on extra leverage, paradoxically making the financial system less stable and more subject to large swings over time.And perhaps most worrisome, sometimes big financial market moves are the mechanism by which policy makers receive the signal that they\u2019re doing the wrong thing. We saw that again and again in the global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis, when it was big market swings that got governments\u2019 attention.So the biggest risk of this period of ultralow volatility is that by looking past the latest headlines out of world capitals, investors won\u2019t send the signals that might prevent political leaders from making a mistake in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Moves to Stabilize Currency, Despite Promise to Loosen Control", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byLate Friday afternoon, however, the Chinese government said, in effect, \u201cnever mind.\u201dBut a move with the currency, the renminbi, would signal that China was retreating from promises it made to the world in recent years to open up its financial system \u2014 and many economists say China needs to do that if it wants to continue to grow at a healthy, sustainable pace.The China Foreign Exchange Trade System, which is controlled by the central bank, said it might change the way it sets a value each morning around which the country\u2019s currency is allowed to fluctuate through the day.On Friday, the government said it was considering introducing a \u201ccountercyclical variable.\u201d A better name might be \u201cfudge factor.\u201d It means that the government would no longer have to follow the previous day\u2019s closing price in setting that day\u2019s benchmark.China does not disclose much about the inner workings of its currency, but some variation of the policy may already be in place. The currency has already settled into trading range at or just below 6.9 to the United States dollar, just below the psychologically important level of 7 to the dollar.Many Wall Street analysts say the currency should be a bit weaker, though they disagree on the degree. More broadly, many say the renminbi is now closer to its true value than it was in earlier years, when Beijing faced deep pressure from the United States and others to more fairly value the currency.China\u2019s financial regulators generally do not announce they are considering a shift in something as essential as the value of the currency unless they have already approved it, so the announcement on Friday was widely viewed as a signal to financial institutions, corporations and investors that change was on the way.For economists and investors, the change would probably bring stability to the currency, at least in the short term. Among the losers, assuming China kept the currency at current rates, would be Chinese manufacturers, who benefit in foreign markets when the currency weakens.The Chinese government contended that the winners would be Chinese companies and households. Their assets are less likely to rise and fall quickly with ups and downs in financial markets.The currency rule change could also reassure the public that the government was firmly in control. In recent weeks, Chinese efforts to rein in some frothy lending caused turbulence in China\u2019s financial markets. President Xi Jinping recently urged the country\u2019s financial regulators to focus on stability.The Trump administration would most likely also be pleased, because although the rule change would amount to Chinese currency manipulation, it would keep China\u2019s currency from weakening. If the renminbi weakened further, it could help Chinese exporters at the expense of American manufacturers.But the change marks a big step back from China\u2019s goal of turning the renminbi into an international currency like the dollar and the euro. Global investors want their currencies to move predictably along with financial markets, not based on decisions made behind closed doors.More broadly, it signals that China is not in a hurry to lower its financial barriers with the rest of the world. Those barriers create long-term imbalances that could rattle the global economy if they became severe enough.But the fund most likely would not publicly chastise China if it changed its currency rules. The organization\u2019s general stance has been that China is now such a large player in the world economy, and particularly in global trade, that to ignore its currency would be a mistake.Advertisement"}
