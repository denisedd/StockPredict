{"Headline": "Going Beyond Bad Trump", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byDon\u2019t let Montana ruin your weekend.Granted, it was a lousy way to get into a Memorial Day celebration. We\u2019re supposed to be thinking about good times and a change in the seasons. Then Montana gives its sole House seat to a Donald Trump supporter who had just assaulted a reporter for having the temerity to ask a question about health care legislation.\u201cGreat win in Montana,\u201d said Trump. This was shortly after the president\u2019s disastrous appearance at a NATO meeting in which he behaved like the unpopular rich kid whose idea of making small talk is telling people how much his shoes cost.But about that election. We\u2019re going to come up with a useful explanation, and then start grilling with a peaceful heart.The story began with the incumbent congressman, Ryan Zinke, being appointed secretary of the interior. You will remember that Zinke was the cabinet member who rode to his new job on a horse named Tonto. In the list of bizarre things done by Trump appointees, this did not even make the top 100.So the seat was open, and the Republicans nominated Greg Gianforte, a very rich and unlovable software mogul who had lost the governor\u2019s race to a Democrat last year while Trump was carrying the state by 20 points. The Democrats chose Rob Quist, a country music singer.Quist appeared to be a nice guy, but he wasn\u2019t the perfect pick \u2014 there was a history of unpaid taxes, and some voters found it unnerving that he performed regularly with his daughter at a nudist resort. Also, he got precious little help from the national Democrats, who had doubts about his ability to win.But Quist got backing from Trump-weary Americans around the country, who donated $6 million to his race. Hope twitched.Then on election eve Gianforte assaulted Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian, while screaming that he was \u201csick and tired of you guys.\u201d It was the kind of hysterical response you might anticipate if a gang of journalists were surrounding him, yelling, \u201cWhat about that pole dancer?\u201d But Jacobs just wanted to know Gianforte\u2019s ever-evolving position on the Republican health care bill.Still, what happened with this one? You\u2019ve got a thug of a candidate who\u2019s now facing a misdemeanor assault charge, attached to a president who\u2019s on track to inspire more investigations than the entire \u201cLaw & Order\u201d franchise.And it\u2019s not as if Democrats can\u2019t win elections in Montana \u2014 right now there\u2019s a Democratic governor and one senator from each party. (Because the voters are so open-minded, we will not mention that Montana has exactly the same number of senators as California, which has 38 times as many people.)The answer is that when it comes to the House of Representatives, Montana goes for the party, not the person. And that makes a certain sense \u2014 the House is a super-partisan place where generally the most individuals can do is bring home some pork and maybe torture their leadership.The current Republican Party is obviously, um, flawed. But the state hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the House since 1994 and it\u2019s going to require something large to turn things around.The message of Montana is that right now, Republican-leaning voters need to hear a real Democratic message. The party\u2019s great at complaining, but not very clear on how it wants to fix Obamacare or make college affordable or transform the economy beyond raising the minimum wage.It\u2019s all well and good \u2014 and really very satisfying \u2014 to harp constantly about the terribleness of Donald Trump. But people need to see the Democratic line on the ballot and think of something more than Not as Dreadful.Then comes the great turnaround. Looking forward. Meanwhile, have a hot dog on me.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Theresa May, Borrowing from Labour, Vows to Extend Protections for Workers", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byBut with an election looming, Mrs. May is promoting some strikingly centrist social and economic policies, reaching out across the political divide to traditional supporters of the opposition Labour Party, many of whose incomes were squeezed after the financial crash.On Monday Mrs. May promised that, if elected, her Conservative Party would extend protections for workers in the \u201cgig economy,\u201d increase minimum pay levels and ensure a year\u2019s unpaid leave for those who care for a sick relative.\u201cMy plan will deliver a fairer deal for all workers, by extending rights and protections,\u201d said Mrs. May, using language more normally associated with the Labour Party. She also promised to force employers to publish data on racial pay disparities and to accept some form of employee representation on company boards.This is not the first time Mrs. May has entered political territory traditionally occupied by her rivals, who trail her badly in the opinion polls. The Conservatives, or Tories, had already copied Labour\u2019s plans from the 2015 general election to cap energy costs.Mrs. May\u2019s emerging credo seems to combine interventionist instincts on some economic and social issues with a hard-line stance on cutting immigration and withdrawing from the European Union, known as Brexit.\u201cWe are seeing a willingness to think of intervention that would have been seen as anathema by hard-core Thatcherites,\u201d said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. He was referring to supporters of Margaret Thatcher, the former Conservative prime minister, whose free market philosophy inspired privatization and deregulation in the 1980s.But Mrs. May \u201chas not overnight become a continental Christian Democrat,\u201d Mr. Bale added, noting that \u201chers is maybe more the view that, economically, things have got a little out of kilter and that the vote for Brexit was a reflection of that.\u201dStagnating wages among low earners and resentment at rising immigration were thought to be the principal driving force behind last year\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Mrs. May seems now to be addressing those pro-Brexit voters, many of whom once supported the Labour Party, while also trying to occupy some of the ground in the political center vacated by Labour\u2019s shift to the left.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has accused her of taking working people \u201cfor fools,\u201d while Mrs. May\u2019s critics noted that the Conservatives have resisted European Union legislation protecting workers\u2019 rights, arguing that such employment laws stifle the economy.On Monday, however, Mrs. May promised to keep workplace rights that are currently guaranteed by European Union law.Britons are due to vote on June 8 and Mrs. May\u2019s main election strategy is to argue that she is better placed than her less popular Labour rival, Mr. Corbyn, to provide the \u201cstrong and stable leadership\u201d which has become her mantra. Mrs. May last month unexpectedly called for the early election, seeking a mandate from voters as difficult negotiations over Brexit are about to begin.Even when the Conservative Party publishes its election manifesto, which is expected later in the week, a comprehensive political philosophy \u2014 or embryonic \u201cMayism\u201d \u2014 might not emerge.Mrs. May remains ideologically enigmatic because she served for six years as Home Secretary, dealing with police, immigration and other internal security issues and making few policy pronouncements outside that area.\u201cIt is difficult to know where Nick Timothy ends and Theresa May begins, because Theresa May has never given anything much away,\u201d Mr. Bale said, \u201cso people make the assumption there is someone else behind it.\u201dHowever, Mr. Bale believes that Mrs. May\u2019s political outreach extends only so far. \u201cShe is still, in essence, a Conservative,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think this is as huge a departure as the Tory spinners would like us to think.\u201dThe latest proposals on workers\u2019 rights, he added, \u201care an attractive garnish on what is still a fairly conventional pitch by the Conservatives about being more competent to run the economy and keeping taxes low.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Businesses Hope Macron\u2019s Victory Will Ignite an Economic Revival", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byTROYES, France \u2014 As the results of France\u2019s presidential election rolled in on Sunday, Fran\u00e7oise Horiot watched with relief, optimistic about the prospects for her small aviation business.\u201cMacron has so much to do, both at the national and European level,\u201d said Mrs. Horiot, 69, who runs Entreprise Troyes Aviation, which employs 15 people in this industrial and agricultural region in central France. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll have the power to improve the economy.\u201dHe may not.During the campaign, Mr. Macron promised to swiftly pass measures to lower France\u2019s high unemployment rate and revive growth, which has remained stagnant in the wake of Europe\u2019s financial crisis. A priority for the more than three million small and medium businesses that form the backbone of the economy is a revision of the nation\u2019s 3,300-page labor code, which they say makes it difficult to lay off employees and discourages them from hiring new workers.But Mr. Macron, like many of his predecessors, will face political and social hurdles to change.His new party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche \u2014 Republic on the Move \u2014 must secure a parliamentary majority in legislative elections next month, or face years of possible political gridlock. French trade unions have also vowed nationwide protests to stop him from pushing France toward a less protected labor market, which they warn would fuel precariousness and nourish the populism that lifted Ms. Le Pen.At least half of the battle may be simply persuading the French people \u2014 and French businesses, investors and workers \u2014 to feel more optimistic about the future after a long malaise.\u201cThe best case is it takes some time, but he manages to implement at least half of what\u2019s needed to stop decreasing competitiveness and change the trajectory of France,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Co. France, a business consultancy.\u201cIf he accomplishes that, then employment picks up, confidence is rebuilt, new investment comes in, and we shift from a vicious cycle to a virtuous one,\u201d Mr. Marchal added. If not, \u201cthen the economic situation is going to be a major issue, both for France and for Europe.\u201dThe Aube region of central France, of which Troyes is the de facto capital, has grappled with economic uncertainty for years. Unemployment has lingered around 13 percent, higher than the national average, as jobs were lost over the decades.Layoffs recently swept through a nearby Michelin tire factory. Textile manufacturers once implanted in the region closed amid cheap global competition.The breakdown of the votes belied the economic weakness. Mr. Macron won 54 percent of votes in the region in Sunday\u2019s election. But Ms. Le Pen, who campaigned hard among disaffected workers, had 46 percent of the vote, more than 11 points above the national average.Mr. Macron\u2019s platform plays well to businesses around Troyes, a town of 60,000 lined with 16th-century timbered houses and a phalanx of cafes and small shops. A handful of factories that have weathered global competition and the downturn dot the lush landscape on Troyes\u2019s outskirts.Mr. Macron says he wants to lower the taxes employers pay to fund France\u2019s social welfare system, and to cut employee taxes to increase take-home pay. He proposes investing more than 15 million euros in retraining laid-off workers, and allowing company-level agreements on issues that are now decided by industrywide labor negotiations, such as working hours. And he vows to reduce the administrative burden on small businesses, which must negotiate a thicket of regulations.\u201cHe acted like a businessman in his campaign,\u201d said Didier Duchene, the president of the Medef employers association for Aube and founder of CMD2, a metalworking company on the outskirts of Troyes that specializes in making ornate iron grills and industrial doors. \u201cHe understands business, and he\u2019s got a strategic plan.\u201dMr. Duchene employs about 30 workers on full-time contracts in his iron workshop \u2014 many of them longtime employees with artisanal experience. When a big order comes in, he may need to hire 20 more, but only until the job is done. Because it is costly and complex to downsize, he must negotiate an expensive exit for employees, or consider taking additional people on short-term contracts.\u201cI\u2019m always having to calculate: If I hire more people for a job, how much would it cost to downsize?\u201d he said.For workers who think they might be caught at the wrong end of Mr. Macron\u2019s policies, a sense of wariness lingers.Antoine Dion, 23, said he had little hope that Mr. Macron would improve conditions for people like him who have had trouble finding a steady job. He moved to Troyes two months ago from Paris, where he could not find regular work, and was looking for jobs as a plumber, a salesman or anything that would bring a secure paycheck.\u201cMacron is going to set up harmful policies for employment, and he wants to move jobs offshore, to cheaper countries,\u201d Mr. Dion said. \u201cWith Macron, everybody will be able to hire and fire easily \u2014 those are the ultraliberal values we are forced to adopt.\u201dUnemployment has been stuck around 10 percent for more than four years as the economy failed to rebound from the European financial crisis as quickly as Germany and other countries. Around a quarter of young people are jobless, and the vast majority of new contracts are temporary or precarious, fueling an acute sense of inequality.Yet at the unemployment office in Troyes, scores of other job seekers who have long been looking for work expressed hope.\u201cMacron talks about economic reforms and investing more in job training,\u201d said Damien Coffinet, 28, who was fired from his job as an insurance salesman two months ago and came to see if he could receive retraining to become a plumber or electrician. \u201cThe changes won\u2019t come easy, but I see a rosier future.\u201dThe problems are entrenched. Companies say they grapple with high costs, whether from taxes used to fund the social safety net or from navigating complex regulations.Denis Arnoult, the president of France Teinture, a fabric dye maker that employs 100 workers in Troyes on a seven-acre site, said the labor code created administrative burdens, time better spent dealing with clients.While business slumped after the European financial crisis, it has picked up since a French fashion label, Le Coq Sportif, started placing orders. But Mr. Arnoult faces hurdles hiring new workers, partly because of social taxes that are among the highest in Europe.In addition, state-run job placement programs do not provide adequate retraining to adapt potential employees to his needs. Even as he has tried to cut costs, he has had to fund in-house training.\u201cThe costs on business are just too high,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have more economic dynamism, these need to come down.\u201dSome of the pressures come from outside France, complicating Mr. Macron\u2019s economic puzzle.Mrs. Horiot\u2019s business relies on orders from around the European Union, so she grapples with extra layers of European bureaucracy and regulations imposed by Brussels.Too many European Union rules also make it hard for her mechanics to do their job, she says. When they repair the hood of a small plane, it adds an hour just to check off all of the safety requirements.\u201cWe have to go through the same process as a giant like Airbus, but we\u2019re a small company,\u201d she said. \u201cThe labor code and E.U. regulations are not adapted for small companies.\u201dHer worry was that Mr. Macron might be blocked from delivering on many promises, especially if he faces opposition in Parliament or if unions call for protests.If he cannot follow through, the risks may be bigger than continued economic stagnation, Mr. Arnoult of France Teinture said.\u201cWe are at a turning point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Macron doesn\u2019t succeed, we\u2019ll have more populism when the next presidential election comes around.\u201dElian Peltier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Funding and Stand by Climate Pact", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s top diplomat on Tuesday urged the Trump administration not to cut funding to the United Nations, nor to withdraw from a global accord intended to combat climate change.In urging the United States to remain committed to the Paris climate deal, the diplomat, Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, took pains to note that each country would be free to choose how to meet limits on its carbon emissions.\u201cI am sure there is room for the U.S. administration to find its own path, sticking to the rules that the world has agreed together,\u201d Ms. Mogherini said.Speaking in a United Nations Security Council meeting, Ms. Mogherini also bluntly advised the White House to continue to fund United Nations agencies that provide humanitarian aid, including to refugees.\u201cLet me be very clear, and speak directly to our American friends,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is essential for us that we all keep investing in these U.N. agencies. They are as important to global peace as defense spending \u2014 and sometimes even more.\u201dHer office reinforced that message with a message on Twitter.The Trump administration has proposed radical cuts to its diplomatic and aid budgets, including to the United Nations, though its ambassador to the world body, Nikki R. Haley, has said she favors making the United Nations become more efficient rather than cutting the budget with what she calls a \u201cslash and burn approach.\u201dThe United States is the largest single contributor to the United Nations\u2019 core operating budget of $5.4 billion. The American share of 22 percent is set by an international agreement and is based on the size of the American economy.Ms. Mogherini\u2019s remarks came just before her first one-on-one meeting with Ms. Haley.Ms. Haley did not directly address Ms. Mogherini\u2019s remarks in the Security Council. But there were some signs of discord, as Ms. Haley leaned on Europe to do more to rein in Iran\u2019s nuclear and regional ambitions.Ms. Mogherini played a central role in negotiating the nuclear deal between Iran and several major powers and called it \u201ca milestone for nonproliferation.\u201d The Trump administration has said it wants to revisit the deal, and Ms. Haley has repeatedly called on countries to stem Iran\u2019s efforts to expand its ballistic missile program and its influence in the Middle East. Although the United States has said that a recent Iranian missile test violated a Security Council resolution, arms control experts have said it was not prohibited under the nuclear accord.\u201cThe European Union can and should do more to underscore to Iran that its destabilizing actions in the region, including support for extremist and terrorist groups, must cease,\u201d Ms. Haley said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Trump \u2018Do a Big Number\u2019 on the Big Banks?", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byDealBookFor a brief moment, Wall Street stopped on Monday, as if time was suspended in an alternative reality.President Trump, for the first time as resident of the White House, said aloud that he was considering breaking up the nation\u2019s biggest banks. Of course, he had said it on the campaign trail, but this seemed different.\u201cI\u2019m looking at that right now,\u201d Mr. Trump told Bloomberg News during an interview in the Oval Office. \u201cThere\u2019s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we\u2019re going to look at that.\u201dThe headline ricocheted around the email boxes of senior bank executives across the industry. At the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles, where Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had just finished speaking \u2014 and didn\u2019t mention breaking up the banks \u2014 the hallways quickly buzzed about the comment, according to participants, as their phones lit up. Shares of bank stocks dived lower within seconds of the headline, only to recover quickly.Before Monday\u2019s musings, Mr. Trump\u2019s thoughts on the matter had felt like a theoretical exercise, those who have met with him say.What would be surprising, however, is if Mr. Trump made it a reality. It would be one thing for him to \u201cdo a big number\u201d on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 law that imposed stricter regulations on banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis \u2014 he has repeatedly stated that he wants to pare it back, repealing parts of the law. But it would be a much more seismic shift to bring back Glass-Steagall, which would be the equivalent of doing \u201ca big number\u201d on the banks themselves. The biggest names in banking would presumably face the choice of having to shed either their commercial banking arm or their investment banking division.When Mr. Trump met with business executives in February at the White House, he turned to Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, an unabashed defender of big banks, for advice. JPMorgan Chase would not exist in its current form were it not for the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall.\u201cThere\u2019s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you\u2019re going to tell me about it,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time, to the consternation of proponents of more banking regulation.Viewed through the prism of goosing the economy and creating jobs \u2014 as Mr. Trump has pledged his efforts should be viewed \u2014 it\u2019s hard to see how breaking up the biggest banks would help, especially in the short term. Indeed, it would most likely have the opposite effect.Mr. Trump\u2019s chief complaint about Wall Street is that he doesn\u2019t think lenders are extending enough money. \u201cI have so many people, friends of mine, that had nice businesses. They can\u2019t borrow money,\u201d he famously said. \u201cThey just can\u2019t get any money because the banks just won\u2019t let them borrow, because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.\u201dGiven that commercial lending is at a record, according to the Federal Reserve, that\u2019s a hard statement to square.But let\u2019s be generous and assume for a moment that he is right. What is undoubtedly true is that big banks would probably be even more conservative with their loan books during whatever transition would be required to comply with a new version of Glass-Steagall. Such a law would inject as much uncertainty into the economy as Dodd-Frank did initially, when banks were sorting out how they would comply. The process did throw some big banks\u2019 lending into a state of paralysis.And while proponents of ending too-big-to-fail love to point to the repeal of Glass-Steagall as the culprit, by now that meme should have resolved itself.\u201cI don\u2019t think that Glass-Steagall was a cause of the crisis,\u201d Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who has no horse in this race, told me matter-of-factly.Indeed, he said, he would be worried if the law were brought back, because it would hamstring the government if it ever needed to intervene in a crisis similar to what happened in 2008. \u201cIf Glass-Steagall had been in effect, we couldn\u2019t have had some of the failing firms taken over,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cJPMorgan took over Bear Stearns, and so on.\u201dOn the other hand, Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve and a former Treasury staff member who oversaw the bailouts of the banks, has been on a campaign to break up the biggest banks, concerned that they still pose too much of a risk to taxpayers if they were to fail.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments came on the same day that he and his team spoke with about 100 community bankers led by Cam Fine, president and chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America. One issue they discussed was the idea of a two-tiered system of regulations, one for big banks and another for community banks. Whether that construct is now being interpreted as a new version of Glass-Steagall or a breakup of the banks remains an open question.But let\u2019s be clear: If Mr. Trump were to try to bring back what he described on the campaign trail as Glass-Steagall, it wouldn\u2019t be to prevent the next crisis. He would have to be convinced that bringing back the law would stoke the economy. And that\u2019s an even scarier prospect, because it means firms like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, which have been forced to reduce the risk they take, would ultimately be less regulated.There are a lot of good reasons to reform Dodd-Frank. And there are lots of good ways to make regulations less onerous to the nation\u2019s smaller banks, which complain they are drowning in legal and compliance bills; giving them some relief could indeed open the loan spigot even more. But both of those measures would be very different from bringing back Glass-Steagall.Whether Mr. Trump\u2019s talk translates into action on this front remains to be seen. The prevailing view seems to be: \u201cBe prepared for more headline risk for big banks as lawmakers keep piling on the anti-Wall Street rhetoric \u2014 most of it will be substantively meaningless,\u201d according to Ian Katz of Capital Alpha, whose comments were highlighted by Ben White of Politico.Of course, with President Trump, the prevailing view could change in an instant.Advertisement"}

To maintain that alliance, Saudi leaders have studiously ignored Mr. Trump\u2019s negative statements about Islam while emphasizing what their kingdom provides, including intelligence cooperation and billions of dollars in arms purchases.Mr. Trump has not always returned the love.While such comments made some Saudis uncomfortable, they took heart from his ordering the strike in Syria \u2014 a step that Mr. Obama had declined to take \u2014 and they hope his tough talk on Iran will lead to action.It remains unclear whether the visit will result in concrete initiatives or will remain symbolic. But some caution that what Mr. Trump will ultimately give Persian Gulf states may fall short of the expectations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Turmoil Is High, but Wall Street\u2019s Fear Gauge Is Very Low", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byIt has become one of the knottier puzzles on Wall Street.As political risks have increased at home and abroad, complacency among investors has rarely been so widespread.This trend, which began soon after President Trump\u2019s victory in November, culminated on Monday, when the VIX index, known widely as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, dipped briefly below 10 \u2014 the first time it had done so in more than 10 years, in the months before the financial crisis.The VIX measures investor expectations that stock markets will move sharply up or down.On Tuesday, the VIX turned up, to close at about 10.6 \u2014 but still sharply lower than its historical average of roughly 20. At current levels, the VIX reflects a striking sense among investors that the persistent rise in stocks would continue, regardless of election fears in Europe and concerns here that Mr. Trump might not deliver on his ambitious economic agenda.\u201cThe pricing of risk is at near historic lows, and the pricing of the stock market is at near historic highs,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock and derivatives specialist at the investment bank UBS. \u201cAnd all of this at a time when political risk is very elevated \u2014 at home and abroad.\u201dSince the VIX reached a recent peak of 22 in the days before the election in November, it has fallen sharply as equity markets have rallied in the belief that the president\u2019s promises to slash regulations, cut taxes and spend money on infrastructure would buoy the economy.The gauge generally moves in the opposite direction of the stock market. So with the major stock indexes having hit highs, it would make sense that the VIX would reach these unusual lows.But what is less clear is why investors have been so willing to ignore so many outcomes that would send stocks reeling.This means that even as Mr. Trump has difficulties in getting his bills passed, investors are not abandoning the stock market, but are switching out of stocks tied directly to a Trump recovery, for example, banks and industrial companies.The net effect of this rotation is a stock market that goes up and a VIX that goes down.\u201cThere has been this epic disconnect between soft and hard economic data,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cAnd investors are just not willing to sell out of their stocks right now.\u201dRussell Rhoads, the director of education at the VIX\u2019s home, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, calls the high level of faith investors have shown in the president\u2019s promise to reinvigorate the economy the Trump put.Now, Mr. Rhoads says, investors are making a similar wager on Mr. Trump.\u201cWe used to have the Greenspan put, maybe it is the Trump put now,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said, citing a propensity of investors to stay in the market despite political ups and downs. \u201cHe is so business-friendly \u2014 there is a view that whatever happens he will do things that spur economic growth.\u201dUnlike a stock index like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the VIX is not driven by stock prices but by the prices of options to buy or sell the S.&P. For that reason, it is a forward-looking indicator \u2014 30 days to be precise \u2014 that measures how volatile traders think the market will be before the option expires.One reason for the gauge\u2019s recent equanimity, Mr. Rhoads said, is that even when investors purchase options to sell the S.&P. index at a certain level (betting that the market will fall) to insure against a sell-off, they are at the same time keeping their broad exposure to stocks.It is this tricky balancing act that has kept the VIX at these low levels.Mr. Rhoads, a student of financial market history, noted that the index is what is known as \u201ca means reverting vehicle.\u201d This means that even if it stays at these low levels for a while, the index will spike up when the next bout of fear hits the market.\u201cIt\u2019s like a rubber band that stretches and stretches until it pops,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said. \u201cEveryone might be too confident right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron Challenges Putin on Syria and Gay Rights", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byVERSAILLES, France \u2014 France\u2019s newly elected president, Emmanuel Macron, came out of his first meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday with a message of stark challenge, promising French military reprisals for any use of chemical weapons by Russia\u2019s allies in Syria and saying he would closely monitor the curtailing of civil rights for gay people in Chechnya.Against the gilded backdrop of the Palace of Versailles, Mr. Macron and Mr. Putin pledged to work with each other to fight terrorism. But their body language was at times tense, and the sometimes confrontational tone of the meeting was made clear in Mr. Macron\u2019s comments afterward during a joint news conference, where he signaled his intent to play a forceful role on the global stage and not be cowed by other world leaders.With Mr. Putin standing beside him, he accused two news organizations with ties to Russia of acting as \u201corgans of influence\u201d rather than as true outlets for journalism. And he publicly warned the Russian leader that the use of chemical weapons was a \u201cred line\u201d for France. \u201cThe use of chemical weapons by anyone will be the object of reprisals and immediate retaliation on the part of France,\u201d he said.Mr. Putin has strongly backed President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, whose forces have been accused of using chemical weapons as recently as April. The Russian president did not respond directly to Mr. Macron\u2019s implicit challenge.The visit by Mr. Putin, at Mr. Macron\u2019s invitation, was described as a working meeting timed to coincide with the opening of a show at the Grand Trianon, a chateau within the Versailles complex. The exhibition celebrates the ties between Russia and France forged 300 years ago by Peter the Great when he visited France after encouraging diplomatic ties between the two countries.Mr. Macron made a point of opening the news conference by summarizing the long cultural ties between the two countries in literature, culture and philosophy and by noting that \u201cno essential issue can be handled today without talking with Russia.\u201dThe meeting was Mr. Macron\u2019s first with the Russian leader, and he appeared intent on introducing himself as a new factor for Russia to take into consideration on the European stage. It was also a chance for Mr. Macron to show France and the rest of Europe what kinds of issues will matter to him in international relations.For his part, Mr. Putin appeared to want to re-establish the relatively warm relations the two countries have had in the past and to use the meeting as an opportunity to underscore Russia\u2019s position in a number of policy areas. Not least of those is its demand for lifting European economic sanctions against Russia that were put in place after the annexation of Crimea and meddling in Ukraine.Responding to a question about sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, Mr. Putin answered, \u201cThese sanctions do not contribute at all to settling the crisis in Ukraine.\u201d\u201cOnly the abolition of all restrictions, a free market and free competition unburdened by political considerations can help develop the world economy,\u201d he said, urging \u201can end to all limitations on international exchanges.\u201dDespite the sometimes tough tone of the news conference, Mr. Macron received Mr. Putin with all the usual formalities: When Mr. Putin opened the door of his black limousine in the vast Versailles courtyard, as the formally dressed French Republican guard \u2014 in gold-braid decorated uniforms \u2014 stood at attention, Mr. Macron came down the red carpet to the car to greet him.Helicopters hovered overhead, a reminder of the high security around the event.The two leaders exchanged a businesslike handshake and had serious expressions as they sat down to talk. Much of Mr. Macron\u2019s account of their conversation \u2014 putting aside their lengthy comments on Peter the Great\u2019s visit to Versailles in 1717 \u2014 suggested that he had stuck to his stated plan of pushing the Russians in areas where Mr. Putin\u2019s policies are at odds with those of European Union countries.Mr. Macron had plenty of reasons for personal animus toward Russia. Reports by cybersecurity firms found that groups tied to Russia had targeted his campaign in a hacking attack, and rumors about him were disseminated by Russian-allied news outlets.He chose to put the issue behind him, saying it had already been discussed and he was not in the habit of revisiting topics.Mr. Putin quashed the issue even more emphatically. \u201cFor what is called Russian interference in the elections of this or that country, it was not a question that we took up: The French president did not manifest any interest, and me, even less,\u201d he said.Asked about why they did not have access to his campaign headquarters after the first round, Mr. Macron responded: \u201cWhen press organs sow defamatory untruths, they are no longer journalists. They are organs of influence.\u201dHe added, \u201cRussia Today and Sputnik have been organs of influence during this campaign, which on many occasions produced untruths about me and my campaign, and so I determined that they had no place, I confirm it, in my headquarters.\u201dRussia Today\u2019s editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, responded by saying, \u201cIt is disappointing that what started as a rather productive conversation between the leaders of the two countries turned into another opportunity for President Macron to levy baseless accusations against RT.\u201dShe added, \u201cBy labeling any news reporting he disagrees with as fake news, President Macron sets a dangerous precedent that threatens both freedom of speech and journalism at large.\u201dOn human rights, Mr. Macron said he had raised the troubles facing gay and transgender people in Chechnya as well as those of nongovernmental organizations.Mr. Macron said Mr. Putin had told him he had taken measures to \u201cestablish the complete truth on the activities of local authorities\u201d in Chechnya, but he did not specify what those measures were. Chechnya is under the control of a pro-Kremlin leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov.\u201cAs for me, I will be constantly vigilant on these issues, which are in keeping with our values,\u201d Mr. Macron said.Although he did not dispute Mr. Macron\u2019s characterization, Mr. Putin did not mention gay people during the news conference.Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting from Paris, and Ivan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is China the World\u2019s New Colonial Power?", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "The Money IssueThe rising superpower has built up enormous holdings in poor, resource-rich African countries \u2014 but its business partners there aren\u2019t always thrilled.Supported byDylan Teng, a boyish 29-year-old engineer with a brush cut and wire-rimmed glasses, is among the last to arrive. Just as he has done nearly every day since landing in Namibia three and a half years ago, Teng joins the others in wolfing down a breakfast of steamed buns and rice porridge. He picks up a packed lunch prepared by a company chef and at precisely 6 o\u2019clock, with stars still glimmering overhead, he boards a bus emblazoned with the letters C.G.N. \u2014 China General Nuclear, a state-owned behemoth that owns the biggest Chinese project in all of Africa.An hour later, as the sun clears the horizon, the bus winds through a craggy moonscape and descends to the Husab Uranium Mine, a $4.6 billion investment that is the second-largest uranium mine in the world. Teng has made this trip nearly a thousand times, but Husab always seems like a mirage: a virtual city stretching seven miles across the desert floor, from two vast open pits being gouged out of the rocky substratum to a processing plant that, on the last working day of 2016, produced its first drums of U\u2083O\u2088, the yellowcake that can be used to generate nuclear power (and also to make weapons). \u201cWe had a big ceremony that day,\u201d Teng says.One of the few university graduates from his village in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan Province, Teng is keenly aware of Husab\u2019s significance. It is not simply a lifeline for Namibia\u2019s struggling economy, one that the country estimates will increase its gross domestic product by 5 percent when the mine reaches full production next year. The uranium itself, almost all of which will go to China, will also help turn Teng\u2019s homeland into a world leader in nuclear energy and reduce its dependence on coal. In Beijing, where he worked before coming here, Teng lived under the gray blanket of coal-generated pollution that hangs over much of eastern China. Now he is working for the future \u2014 his own and his country\u2019s \u2014 under an endless African sky of cobalt blue. \u201cI never imagined,\u201d he says, \u201cI would end up halfway around the world.\u201dJust north of Swakopmund, a Chinese telemetry station sprouts from the desert floor, its radar dishes pointing skyward to track satellites and space missions. Twenty-five miles south, in Walvis Bay, a state-owned Chinese company is building an artificial peninsula the size of 40 baseball fields as part of a vast port expansion. Other Chinese projects nearby include new highways, a shopping mall, a granite factory and a $400 million fuel depot. Chinese trade flows through the port: shipping containers filled with cement, clothing and machinery coming in; tiles, minerals and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 illegal timber and endangered wildlife heading out to China. The activity is so frenzied that rumors of a proposed naval base in Walvis Bay, though vehemently denied by Chinese officials, do not strike locals as implausible.Still, for a nation like Namibia, China\u2019s pitches can be irresistible partly because they\u2019re rooted in historical solidarity. Beijing backed the black nationalist movement\u2019s liberation struggle against apartheid and its white South African overlords. Sam Nujoma, the leader of the South West Africa People\u2019s Organization (Swapo), visited Beijing in search of guns and funds in the early 1960s. When Namibia finally claimed independence in early 1990, with Nujoma as president, China became one of its first diplomatic allies, pronouncing the two countries \u201call-weather friends.\u201d (Beijing was also desperate for allies to break its diplomatic isolation after its violent crackdown on the 1989 democracy movement.)In addition to offering its own history as a model for climbing out of poverty, China provides no-strings financing that, unlike Western aid, is not conditional on such fine points as human rights, clean governance or fiscal restraint. \u201cWe welcomed China very much because, for the first time, it gave us a real alternative to a Western-driven agenda, whether it was South Africa or the Western world,\u201d Calle Schlettwein, Namibia\u2019s minister of finance, told me. \u201cThe Chinese say, \u2018We want you to be masters of your own destiny, so tell us what you want.\u2019\u2009\u201d But they have their conditions, too, he says. \u201cThey want de facto total control over everything, so it\u2019s difficult to bring about a situation that is truly beneficial.\u201dChina\u2019s leaders insist that its influence is entirely benign, a global exercise in what they call \u201cwin-win cooperation.\u201d And indeed, many of the projects Chinese companies are pursuing \u2014 roads and railways, ports and pipelines, mines and telecom networks \u2014 might never be built without them. China\u2019s investment in the Husab uranium mine, in which C.G.N. subsidiaries hold a 90 percent stake and the Namibian government owns 10 percent, is doing its part to stave off a recession. \u201cWe helped Namibia gain its political liberation,\u201d Xia Lili, a former Chinese diplomat who now works as an executive at a Chinese company in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, says. \u201cNow we\u2019re helping it fight for economic emancipation.\u201dFor some Namibians, however, the flood of Chinese loans and investments doesn\u2019t look so much like freedom as it does a new form of colonialism. The infrastructure is welcome, but as projects made possible by loans \u2014 financed by the Chinese \u2014 they have saddled the economy with debt and done little to alleviate the nearly 30 percent unemployment rate. Over the last few months, moreover, a series of scandals involving Chinese nationals \u2014 including tax evasion, money-laundering and poaching endangered wildlife \u2014 has soured locals on a foreign presence that can seem largely extractive: pulling uranium, timber, rhino horns and profits out the country without benefiting a population that, because of apartheid\u2019s legacy, ranks among the most unequal economically in the world. In January, a Windhoek newspaper captured the rising sentiment with an illustration on its front page of a golden dragon devouring the Namibian flag. The headline: \u201cFeeding Namibia to the Chinese.\u201dThe question of how China is changing the world is often framed as a binary proposition: Is China the savior for developing nations, the only world power investing in their future \u2014 or is this the dawn of a new colonial era? The question itself, however, is misleading. In Namibia, as in much of the rest of the world, the narratives live uncomfortably side by side, impossible to disentangle. \u201cYou can argue that China is the best thing to happen to Africa \u2014 or the worst,\u201d says Eric Olander, the co-host of the weekly \u201cChina in Africa Podcast.\u201d \u201cThe beauty is in the complexity.\u201dThe couple\u2019s restaurant is in Walvis Bay, a port surrounded on three sides by the Namib Desert, which some consider the oldest in the world. James and Rose are part of the early wave of Chinese immigrants who landed in Africa 20 years ago and never left. The Chinese diaspora has a long history of finding a foothold, and then thriving, in some of the world\u2019s most remote places: I\u2019ve bumped into Chinese merchants everywhere from the Arctic tundra of Siberia to mining towns in the Andes. In Africa, entrepreneurs like James and Rose found a new frontier with the space, freedom and opportunities that many early settlers saw in the American West. \u201cMy husband came to look at business here, and he fell in love with the wide-open spaces,\u201d Rose told me. \u201cBut we\u2019re still Chinese first and foremost.\u201dLike many Chinese immigrants around the world, the couple began by opening a small mom-and-pop shop, filling the shelves with cheap clothes, shoes and bags shipped by container from China. Their store, James and Rose, still stands at a central intersection of Walvis Bay, even as their ventures have expanded to include a hotel, a restaurant, a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a trading company. Today there are such Chinese-run stores in nearly every town in Namibia \u2014 and thousands more across Africa.On a recent Sunday in Windhoek\u2019s Chinatown, where dozens of shops occupy a series of long warehouses in the city\u2019s industrial district, Namibian families strolled the lanes, haggling over everything from knockoff Nikes and plastic children\u2019s toys to solar panels and secondhand mobile phones. One man told me he liked the low prices, even as he complained about the goods\u2019 poor quality \u2014 and the harm they did to the local garment industry. Wu Qiaoxia, a Chinese entrepreneur whose real estate business began with a simple store in the northern town of Oshakati, waves off such criticism. \u201cMany Namibian children didn\u2019t even have shoes before we got here,\u201d Wu says. \u201cThe people here needed everything, and we sold it to them, cheaply.\u201dOne of the most influential Chinese immigrants in Namibia, Jack Huang, parlayed a small textile business into a mining, real estate and trade conglomerate. A backslapping 49-year-old native of Nantong, a city located about two hours northwest of Shanghai, Huang moved to Namibia nearly two decades ago. Early on, he helped transform Oshikango, a sleepy town on the Angolan border, into a raucous Chinese trading post anchored by his properties. Angolans made rich by a boom in oil production flooded in to buy things like stereos and S.U.V.s, paying with United States dollars or, at times, diamonds. The collapse of oil prices has turned Oshikango into a ghost town. But Huang, through his Sun Investment Group, has diversified into many lucrative businesses, including a mining venture that has identified other uranium deposits close to Husab.Huang\u2019s success has come, in part, from cultivating connections with Namibia\u2019s political elite. Swapo, the guerrilla-group-turned-political-party, has dominated Namibia\u2019s elections since its independence \u2014 the kind of stability that appeals to China\u2019s rulers and to entrepreneurs hoping to make long-lasting connections. Huang has referred to Sam Nujoma, Namibia\u2019s founding father, as \u201cmy special adviser.\u201d During the 2014 election campaign, Huang and the Swapo candidate Hage Geingob (then the prime minister, now the president) attended a gala dinner at which, according to local reporting, the Chinese businessman pledged Geingob\u2019s political party a donation of 1 million Namibian dollars \u2014 about $90,000. (Huang denies this.)Huang\u2019s friends prefer to emphasize how much he has given back to his host country through his charity, the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. (Huang was out of the country at the time of my visit, but he authorized two deputies to speak with me on his behalf.) Over the last seven years, Huang\u2019s charity has awarded more than $2 million in scholarships to Namibian students to attend medical school in China (in Nantong, naturally). Some critics, however, claim that a few recipients of Huang\u2019s philanthropy were not needy students but children of the ruling elite. Last year, moreover, the local media revealed that before Geingob was elected president in 2014, Huang was the owner of a majority stake in a real estate venture whose only other shareholders are Geingob\u2019s family trust and ex-wife. The men tried to distance themselves from each other in the press, and Geingob professed to have no operational control of the company. Still, Huang\u2019s friends worry about his courting of the powerful. \u201cI kept warning Jack,\u201d says one businessman who occasionally socializes with Huang. \u201c\u2009\u2018Don\u2019t get too close to the fire. You\u2019ll burn your fingers.\u2019\u2009\u201dSean Hao, a young telecommunications engineer in Windhoek, is part of that diaspora. Raised in a cave dwelling in central China\u2019s Shaanxi province, he wasn\u2019t expected to venture far beyond his village\u2019s orchard of jujube trees. But Hao was accepted by a university, a first for his family, and worked after graduation installing networks for a Chinese telecom giant. Renting a room for just $15 a month helped him squirrel away most of his $500 monthly salary, but his savings were hardly enough to buy the apartment he would need to marry. In a country where young men far outnumber women \u2014 a legacy of the government\u2019s restrictive family-planning policy \u2014 an apartment is seen as a prerequisite for attracting a wife and avoiding the fate of a \u201cbare branch\u201d (an unmarried person). But real estate seemed an impossible aspiration for a young man who grew up in a cave.When a headhunter told Hao about a job in Africa that would pay more than $6,000 a month, Hao figured it was a swindle. \u201cI thought this must be a case of human trafficking,\u201d he remembers, laughing. The offer was real, but the job was in Nigeria, which he thought was unsafe. So Hao instead signed a contract to work on building the telecom system in Angola for more than $5,000 a month, more than 10 times his previous salary. After a year in Africa, Hao put a down payment on an apartment in Xi\u2019an, a city in central China, and persuaded his girlfriend\u2019s parents that he was financially secure enough to marry their daughter. Hao and his wife soon had a baby girl, but his job in Africa meant that he saw her for only one month out of her first 15. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even recognize me,\u201d he said. His wife and daughter joined him in his new posting in Namibia, but they lasted one lonely year before going home, leaving Hao stuck between his longing to be with his family in China and the opportunity to make money in Namibia.On a warm Saturday night in late March, Hao joined a dozen Chinese colleagues under the thatched roofs of Joe\u2019s Beerhouse in Windhoek. Two of the men were headed back to China after finishing their short-term contracts, and the group was sending them off by knocking back pints of German-style lager. By the time I arrived at the bar, three men had already passed out, their heads planted on the table, and a few others were listing badly. Hao, the designated driver, had barely sipped any beer at all. Celebrating his colleagues\u2019 return to the motherland had put him in a contemplative mood. \u201cI\u2019d like to go home, too,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are no jobs in China that could pay me even close to what I\u2019m making now.\u201dIn Teng\u2019s first job after graduation \u2014 at the Beijing-based Uranium Resources Company, a C.G.N. subsidiary \u2014 he learned about the company\u2019s mining interests in Kazakhstan, Australia and Namibia. The rural kid knew nothing about these foreign lands. But soon he was flying off to the most distant of the three to work in one of China\u2019s largest and most strategic mines. And one where C.G.N. was fully in control.As a load-and-haul engineer at the Husab mine, Teng helps choreograph 26 gargantuan trucks whose wheels stand twice as tall as he does. So far, the trucks have hauled more than 100 million metric tons of rock out of Husab\u2019s open pits. As production increases this year, far more will be needed to process the 15 million pounds of uranium oxide that the mine aims to produce annually. \u201cThe pressure is always on to stockpile enough so the processing plant never runs out of rock,\u201d Teng says.To feed its hungry economy, China has worked frantically to secure enough resources to keep the juggernaut going. Besides oil and gas, which are a primary focus of its investments abroad, China\u2019s state-owned companies have gobbled up mines around the world: copper in Peru, nickel in Papua New Guinea, iron ore in Australia. In Africa, Chinese mining investments have increased 25-fold in just 10 years, from stakes in a handful of mines in 2006 to more than 120 in 2015.As its economy has slowed recently and commodity prices have plunged, China has sharply reduced some of its imports, causing a few boom areas, like Western Australia, to go bust. Chinese mines in Zambia (copper) and South Africa (iron ore) have been forced to close. It might seem something of a miracle, then, that Husab runs at all. With uranium prices at less than half their level before the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (and less than a quarter of what they were in 2007), Namibia\u2019s two other active uranium operations have stopped digging up rock and process only already-stockpiled material. But Husab forges ahead, hiring many of the hundreds of workers laid off at those other mines. As one Namibian engineer who landed a job there after spending six months unemployed told me, \u201cHusab was my salvation.\u201dThere is a simple reason that C.G.N. can afford to ramp up production at Husab: It is selling most of the uranium to itself, the Chinese state, so price is almost irrelevant. (Low prices, in fact, have enabled China both to stockpile uranium cheaply and to buy part of a struggling Namibian uranium mine, Langer-Heinrich.) An even bigger reason is China\u2019s ambition both to reduce its carbon emissions and to become a world leader in nuclear power.Nearly 88 percent of China\u2019s energy now comes from fossil fuels, only 1 percent from nuclear power. (Solar, wind and hydropower account for the remaining 11 percent.) To reach its clean-energy goals \u2014 and shed the ignominious title of world\u2019s biggest producer of greenhouse gases \u2014 China has put nuclear power back on an almost impossibly fast track. The country now has 37 nuclear reactors, with another 20 under construction, and it aims to have 110 reactors by 2030. (Beyond that, the goal is to become an exporter of nuclear-reactor technology. China has already built six reactors overseas, and last month, Swakop Uranium, a C.G.N. subsidiary, submitted a proposal to construct a reactor in Namibia.)This rate of growth, six new plants each year, would catapult China past the United States as the world\u2019s top nuclear power, but it also raises concerns. In January, an American consultant to C.G.N. pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to illegally recruit United States nuclear engineers to help accelerate the design and manufacture of C.G.N. reactor components. Critics at home and abroad also question whether China\u2019s safety standards can keep pace with the new reactors. One Chinese physicist, He Zuoxiu, even told The Guardian that the plan is \u201cinsane.\u201dC.G.N. did not allow me to visit the mine or interview its managers, claiming that they were too busy increasing production. To get a glimpse of the vast complex, I drove down a dusty back road to the highland plain where the Welwitschia mirabilis grow, near Husab\u2019s back gate. Before construction began at Husab in 2013, the company transplanted four rare Welwitschia specimens that would have been destroyed in the blasts \u2014 a symbolic gesture in a country that reveres the ancient plant. Since then, C.G.N. has seemed eager to dispel the uncaring reputation that Chinese state-owned companies have earned: It has made donations to drought victims, offered scholarships to local engineering students and, in a first for a Chinese company in Namibia, even invited a local labor union to set up shop at the mine site.Independent unions are essentially illegal in China. And the Metal and Allied Namibian Workers Union had waged a campaign against Chinese state-owned companies, accusing some of paying Namibian workers only one-third of the minimum wage and others of using armies of Chinese workers for unskilled jobs that by law should go to Namibians. So when C.G.N. invited the union\u2019s secretary general, Justina Jonas, to China for the mine\u2019s inaugural event, she was skeptical. \u201cThe Chinese will promise you heaven,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut the implementation can be hell.\u201d Jonas threatened not to go to China if Husab didn\u2019t sign a project labor agreement protecting workers\u2019 wages, hours and safety. Just days before the trip, C.G.N. signed the agreement, a first for a Chinese company.For all its public outreach, Husab still operates in a self-contained Chinese universe. Chinese managers often schedule key meetings for the weekend, when it\u2019s convenient for them to review and plan \u2014 but also when Namibian colleagues are not present, according to local employees. Local workers marvel at how, when a non-Chinese part breaks down, Chinese engineers will sometimes send the specs home so Chinese companies can reverse-engineer replacement parts at a fraction of the cost. This looks different from a Chinese perspective: Just as the mine offers young engineers an opportunity to hone their expertise in vital new jobs, it also gives Chinese companies a chance to show that they can make high-quality vehicles and equipment \u2014 at a third of the cost of top foreign brands. Husab still makes companies go through testing and bidding, but as one worker put it: \u201cWe have to help and support our brother companies. It\u2019s all part of the \u2018going out\u2019 policy.\u201dMining is hardly China\u2019s only interest in Namibia. The land is too arid to sustain the kinds of vast agricultural projects underway in Mozambique and Brazil. But China\u2019s state-owned construction companies are burning up their excess capacity building Namibian highways and ports, a Chinese embassy compound and a new military academy in Okahandja. Military relations are close, too. China trains Namibian officers \u2014 an echo of its 1960s assistance to Swapo \u2014 and supplies weapons. In April, the United States intervened to stop Namibia from paying $12 million to Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of a Chinese company on the American sanctions list for selling banned weapons to Iran, Syria and North Korea. It was a reminder that the United States is still in the background, warily watching China\u2019s incursion into Africa.Husab is a tangible, direct investment, but most Chinese projects in Namibia and around the world are financed by soft loans that carry risks. Last year, China established a new $60 billion fund to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, mostly with Chinese lending. The easy money is alluring, and the projects can be essential. But most of the loans stipulate that a Chinese state-owned company must take the lead, ensuring that the work, skills and profits are kept largely in the Chinese family. Countries like Namibia are left holding the debt. Schlettwein, the finance minister, told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think those are real investments, but opportunities latched onto by Chinese enterprises without really adding value to the Namibian economy.\u201dSuch criticism irritates Chinese business owners and diplomats, who point out that Chinese companies have invested more than $5 billion in Namibia and now employ more than 6,000 Namibians. \u201cWe\u2019re here to do business on an equal footing with the locals,\u201d says Xia Lili, the former diplomat who is deputy general manager of Jack Huang\u2019s Sun Investment Group and secretary general of the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. \u201cWe bring in money to establish mines and factories. Who benefits? The Namibians. Did the Western powers ever do this? Not nearly as much. So this talk of new colonialism is untrue.\u201dNamibia, though, is starting to push back. Last year the government pulled out of a $570 million loan agreement with a state-owned Chinese company to expand the Windhoek airport. Then in September, as sluggish growth and other foreign loans pushed Namibia\u2019s debt to over 40 percent of its G.D.P., the government suspended all new loan tenders. Schlettwein says the freeze was a prudent act of belt-tightening, not a move specifically targeting China. Nevertheless, he says: \u201cIt sends out a signal that Namibian interests are not to be trampled on indiscriminately. It sends a signal that our relationship must mature.\u201dThe pages were the same ones Brown hand-delivered to the Chinese Embassy two days before \u2014 and then sent to other diplomatic missions, media outlets and international organizations. Signed by 45 local environmental groups, including Brown\u2019s own Namibian Chamber of Environment, the letter blamed Chinese nationals for a sharp surge in the commercial poaching of wildlife in Namibia \u2014 and excoriated the embassy for doing little to stop it.Over the last two years, Namibia has lost nearly 200 elephants and endangered rhinos to poaching. In November, a Chinese smuggler was caught in the Johannesburg airport with 18 rhino horns \u2014 all from Namibia. Two months earlier, four Chinese men were sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to smuggle out 14 rhino horns in 2014. (Rhino-horn powder is an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to strengthen the immune system.) Brown had meant the letter to provoke a response, but this visit was unexpected.\u201cYou are abusing China\u2019s good nature,\u201d one of the diplomats said, in a raised voice, according to Brown. \u201cOnly a handful of Chinese have been involved in poaching.\u201d\u201cNo, Chinese demand is driving all of this,\u201d Brown replied. \u201cI think you are trying to strip all of our resources for China.\u201d\u2029When the yelling subsided, Brown says, he invited the men inside. Sitting in his conference room, they leafed through binders filled with photographs of slaughtered rhinos and elephants. \u201cThey got quieter and quieter,\u201d Brown recalls. A few days later, he met with the Chinese ambassador, who cautioned him against letting a few \u201crotten apples\u201d tarnish the entire Chinese community. Brown again insisted it was a more systemic problem. \u201cListen, we can ratchet up the pressure and make things even worse for you,\u201d he says he argued. \u201cOr we can come together to solve this problem.\u201d The ambassador, he says, agreed to join the antipoaching fight.One of the most troubling dimensions of China\u2019s global expansion is its reputation for pillaging and pilfering the natural world. China is not the only culprit in the $19 billion illegal wildlife trade. But its growing hunger for the rare, exotic and dubiously curative is devastating worldwide populations of rhinos and elephants, sharks and tigers \u2014 and spurring illegal timber operations in rain forests stretching from Congo to Cambodia. Huang Hongxiang, a former journalist from China who investigated ivory and rhino-horn poaching in Namibia, has started a Kenya-based nonprofit organization, China House, to help Chinese companies and communities engage in wildlife conservation as a form of corporate social responsibility. \u201cIn a lot of global environmental issues, Chinese are part of the problem,\u201d he says, \u201cso they have to be part of the solution.\u201dPoaching is a scourge in Damaraland, an arid region of rocky outcroppings in northwest Namibia. \u201cLocals are enticed into killing rhinos by the China market,\u201d my Namibian guide, Taffy, who tracks elephants and rhinos, told me. \u201cThe horns always seem to end up in Chinese hands.\u201d In the past, conservation issues were mostly championed by white Namibians. That is changing. \u201cBlacks used to think whites cared more about the animals than them,\u201d says Shinovene Immanuel, a reporter at The Namibian. \u201cBut now that poaching has gotten out of hand, everybody is upset.\u201dPublic anger is also rising over some Chinese business proposals that could do damage to the environment. One Chinese-owned company has sought to clear-cut part of Namibia\u2019s only pristine forest, in the Zambezi region, to create a tobacco plantation nearly double the size of Manhattan, despite the fact that the area\u2019s sandy soil is unsuitable. Another Chinese business wants to set up donkey abattoirs to meet China\u2019s soaring demand for donkey meat and skin (the latter is considered a curative in Chinese medicine). And a Namibia-based Chinese company filed a request last fall to capture killer whales, penguins, dolphins and sharks in Namibian waters \u2014 all to sell to aquatic theme parks in China. Local activists protested for weeks until the Chinese firm withdrew its proposal.Three months after Brown\u2019s letter provoked the indignant response, the Chinese Embassy hosted a much more diplomatic meeting of Namibian activists and some 60 Chinese business leaders. Besides trumpeting China\u2019s recent ban on all ivory sales \u2014 and airing an antipoaching video featuring the basketball star Yao Ming \u2014 the acting ambassador, Li Nan, denounced poaching and lectured Chinese nationals about obeying Namibian law. Li told me in an email that, at Brown\u2019s invitation, he will visit the rhinos\u2019 habitat in northern Namibia this month. The two countries, he said, are also working to form a joint law-enforcement task force to combat transnational wildlife criminals.Jack Huang also spoke out against poaching, but a different kind of dragnet was closing around him. On Feb. 1, the tycoon and four others (three of them Chinese) were arrested at Windhoek\u2019s international airport for their participation in a supposed tax-fraud scheme that netted nearly $300 million \u2014 the largest case in Namibian history. The arrests were part of a two-year investigation into more than 30 Chinese companies accused of concealing illegal earnings. While in custody, Huang reportedly tried to contact President Geingob, but his business partner refused to help. \u201cWhen my \u2018friend\u2019 was arrested and spent a night in jail, there was no interference or intervention,\u201d Geingob told a local paper later. \u201cThis is because in Namibia, we uphold the rule of law, the separation of powers, and pride ourselves on the total independence of our judiciary.\u201dHuang, the man with all the connections, now finds himself disconnected. In mid-February, soon after his release on $75,000 bail, he claimed that the tax-fraud case against him was based on outdated information. Xia, his deputy at Sun Investment, told me that Huang actually divested from Golden Phoenix, a company named in the case, more than eight years ago, but that the transaction had not been entered into the official computer system. When this trial is over, Huang may file lawsuits against those who attacked his businesses, Xia says. In the meantime, the gregarious entrepreneur will probably spend more time dining alone. When he invited an old friend out to dinner recently, he was gently rebuffed \u2014 the power broker was suddenly a pariah.Arresting a high-flying Chinese businessman may be a simple matter of law, but it is also one more sign of how the relationship between Namibia and China is being recalibrated. Li Nan wrote to me that he believes that the boisterous local press is \u201ctrying to whip up racist sentiments and hatred.\u201d The animosity in Namibia, though, is nowhere near the levels that have caused explosive riots at a Chinese coal mine in Zambia, including one in 2012 that left a Chinese manager dead, or that sparked unruly protests against Chinese traders in Kampala, Uganda, last month. (The rising resentment toward the Chinese in Uganda recalls another era, when the dictator Idi Amin expelled an earlier wave of immigrant merchants, from the Indian diaspora, in 1972.)Still, the new tensions between China and Namibia are laid bare at police checkpoints around the country, where Chinese nationals are routinely singled out for inspection. The police say this new policy has already exposed several cases of wildlife smuggling. Jack Huang\u2019s associate, Xia, was pulled over at the checkpoint on the airport road last month. The police frisked him, combed through his luggage and scoured his car. \u201cAll the while they were yelling, \u2018Rhino horn, rhino horn, where\u2019s the rhino horn?\u2019\u2009\u201d Xia recalls. \u201cI was shocked that this could happen in Namibia. This is a country that is supposed to be our all-weather friend.\u201dIt\u2019s a chilly Saturday in April \u2014 the antipodal winter is coming \u2014 and Teng has worked overtime again. He has missed one of the only diversions here: Saturday-afternoon basketball games at the local sports center. (China now has so many state-owned companies in Namibia that they stage an annual 15-team championship; China Harbour Engineering, the port builder in Walvis Bay, won this year.) Strolling on the Swakopmund waterfront, Teng was no longer clad in his khaki mining uniform. Wearing jeans and a Quiksilver T-shirt and cradling a cappuccino, he looked like any tourist gazing out over the crashing Atlantic surf. During his nearly four years here, Teng has not had too many chances to be a tourist, though he took advantage of a recent holiday to go on a wildlife tour in Etosha National Park.In their bubble at Husab, Teng and his colleagues are mostly insulated from the tensions between China and Namibia. These huge Chinese projects all over the developing world can seem like spaceships landing on distant planets. Chinese workers often have little incentive \u2014 or latitude \u2014 to venture out into the alien environment, especially when the state-owned mother ship provides food, lodging and transport. And the exhausting work can sap them of all curiosity about their surroundings. On a plane back to China in April, I sat next to a worker who had just spent two years in Equatorial Guinea \u2014 but had no idea where it was.The tech-savvy Teng, by contrast, can pinpoint his exact location on Google Earth, even though his routine is largely circumscribed by the 43-mile route between Husab and Swakopmund. Saving more in Namibia than he could back in China \u2014 thanks, in part, to all those free meals on Amathila Avenue \u2014 Teng has built a tidy nest egg. In 2014, when a C.G.N. delegation from China visited Husab, Teng chatted with one of the two women in the group. Online flirting ensued. In January, Teng stunned his Husab colleagues when he returned from a trip to China with a ring on his finger. He\u2019d married the visitor \u2014 mission accomplished \u2014 joining a handful of others who had done the same thing. Teng\u2019s other goal has not yet been achieved. He wants to see Husab reach its full potential next year, fueling China\u2019s continued rise. \u201cThis is an important thing for China, \u201d he says, \u201cand I want to be a part of it.\u201dThe Chinese migrants who have gone out into the world, the risk-takers who have found spots in Asia, Latin America and Africa, are as diverse as China itself: young and middle-aged, unschooled and highly educated, working for private companies and state-owned enterprises \u2014 and even for themselves. They are not a monolith. And yet, in these far-off places, they are connected to one another in a way that they never could be back home in a land of 1.4 billion people. It\u2019s not just the shared food, culture or language \u2014 or the solidarity that comes from being thrown together in a harsh environment. What binds these individuals together is an abiding belief that their presence overseas is making China better and stronger. This shared conviction, as much as the state that has nurtured it, is what makes China a colossus, a nation that can be seen by others, in the same instant, as a blessing and a curse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Saudi Arabia, Trump Reaches Out to Sunni Nations, at Iran\u2019s Expense", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisThat nation was Iran.Mr. Trump has presented the shift as a reinvestment in historical alliances with friendly nations in order to fight extremism and terrorism. But the juxtaposition of the election in Iran and the gathering in Saudi Arabia seemed to highlight a reality of the Middle East that presidents have long wrestled with: how to choose partners and seek American interests in a region torn by sectarian splits and competing agendas.\u201cWe are picking one side in this geopolitical struggle, and there is very little room for gray,\u201d said Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cSectarianism is a byproduct of this geopolitical rivalry, and we are inadvertently picking one side in this sectarian struggle.\u201dThe two scenes \u2014 dancing in the streets in Tehran and Sunni leaders gathered in an opulent hall in Riyadh \u2014 also pointed to a complicating reality in the Middle East: There is often a disconnect between the leaders and their people.In his remarks, Mr. Trump signaled his intention to end engagement with Iran, suggesting that it does not encourage change from inside the country.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s supporters also expect his victory, with 57 percent of the vote, to bolster his outreach efforts to the West and the pursuit of more foreign investment to lift Iran\u2019s ailing economy.\u201cBye-bye, Raisi,\u201d the crowds chanted during the street gatherings.\u201cHe faces a difficult task,\u201d Fazel Meybodi, a Shiite Muslim cleric from the city of Qum, said of Mr. Rouhani. \u201cNow he must provide more freedoms, break the hard-line monopoly on the state-run radio and television, and increase freedom of press.\u201dTo achieve all that, Mr. Rouhani must persuade the hard-line-dominated judiciary and security forces to change their outlook, Mr. Meybodi said. \u201cIf he fails to deliver on at least 70 percent of those promises, his future is dark,\u201d he added.For decades, Saudi Arabia and Iran have competed for religious leadership and political influence across the Muslim world and beyond.Saudi Arabia, the Sunni monarchy that controls Islam\u2019s holiest sites, sees itself as the natural leader of the Muslim world and has used its lavish oil wealth to spread its austere version of the faith.Iran, meanwhile, is the world\u2019s largest Shiite nation and is led by clerics who seek to export the ideology of political Islam that brought them to power in 1979.The cities Mr. Trump will visit and what events are planned.Each country accuses the other of sowing instability.Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of spreading an intolerant creed that fuels terrorism and threatens minorities. Saudi Arabia says Iran works through nonstate actors to weaken Arab nations.\u201cFrom Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds arms and trains terrorists, militias and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region,\u201d Mr. Trump told dozens of Muslim heads of state. \u201cIt is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this very room.\u201dThat pointed to a departure from the policies of Mr. Obama, who pushed Persian Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to move toward greater self-sufficiency in defense while pressing for the agreement to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program.Proponents of that approach hoped that engagement with Iran would lead to greater moderation among its leaders, paving the way for its eventual reintegration into the world system.But the nuclear deal angered gulf nations, who felt that it rewarded Iran for bad behavior while doing nothing to constrain its destabilizing activities in Arab countries.For them, Mr. Trump\u2019s return to America\u2019s traditional allies was a great relief.\u201cThe most important thing is that the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States is built on vision and numbers, not on slogans. They are building on shared interests,\u201d said Ghassan Charbel, the editor in chief of Asharq Al-Awsat, a Saudi-owned newspaper. \u201cIt shows that the majority in the Arab and Islamic worlds will be close to the United States if it chooses to engage.\u201dThe Arab nations hate Iran for using nonstate actors in Arab countries. Iran was fundamental in the creation of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party that now has Lebanon\u2019s strongest military force. More recently, Iran has sent military aid to help Mr. Assad fight rebels seeking his ouster, while also supporting militias in Iraq, Bahrain and Yemen.But there is a gap between Iran\u2019s older, ruling clerics and the ambitions of its people, as was made clear when Iranians came out in force to dance and protest in the streets this weekend, breaking Islamic rules and political taboos, in celebration of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s re-election.The election outcome was widely seen as evidence that Iran\u2019s society has changed radically. Influenced by satellite television, cheaper international travel, the internet, waves of migration to big cities and access to higher education, most of Iranian society now adheres to middle-class values.This collided with the anti-Western ideology and strict interpretation of Islam represented by Mr. Raisi and promoted by state organizations.Some used the election\u2019s success to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia.Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst, said of Mr. Trump, \u201cThis man just wants to sell American weapons and use Iran as an excuse.\u201dIn deepening the United States\u2019 alliance with gulf countries, Mr. Trump is bringing it closer to nations that share few cultural values with the United States and have sometimes acted against its interests.Saudi Arabia, for one, is a monarchy where citizens have few rights and the public practice of any religion other than Islam is banned. It has used its military and its oil wealth to protect the Sunni monarchy that rules over a Shiite majority in neighboring Bahrain and to prop up President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt.In adopting the gulf perspective on Iran, Mr. Trump could be assisting a strategy gulf leaders use when times get hard at home.\u201cIt is feeding into the gulf narrative, where they project a lot of their insecurities about domestic politics outward and onto the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d said Mr. Wehrey, the Carnegie fellow. \u201cBut is Iran the source of all evil in the region? No.\u201dOthers questioned the value of working with autocrats to fight terrorism.\u201cThe worldview that we are fighting against needs to be countered with liberal ideas, not Salafi ideas,\u201d said Mokhtar Awad, a research fellow in the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, referring to Saudi Arabia\u2019s conservative branch of Islam.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "William J. Baumol, 95, \u2018One of the Great Economists of His Generation,\u2019 Dies", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byProfessor Baumol, who taught for decades at both Princeton University and New York University, identified what has come to be known as Baumol\u2019s cost disease. This so-called affliction is actually a critically important economic insight that explains why the cost of services, like haircuts and college educations, rises faster than the cost of goods, like T-shirts.It was in 1965 that Professor Baumol began explaining how technological advances raise productivity and naturally push up wages as workers are able to produce more goods, from hammers to coffee cups, at lower cost.But those same increases in productivity, he found, do not apply to labor-intensive activities like concert performances, doctor examinations, college lectures, soccer matches and oil changes.For example, he said, it takes exactly the same number of people and the same amount of time to play a Beethoven string quartet today as it did in, say, 1817. Yet the musicians who spent years studying and practicing \u2014 and still have to eat and live somewhere while doing that \u2014 cannot be paid the same as their 19th-century counterparts. Their wages, too, will rise, even though they are no more productive than their predecessors were. As a result, their work eventually becomes increasingly expensive compared with more efficiently produced goods.There is no cure for the cost disease, Professor Baumol said, and he warned that the rising relative expense of health care, education and other essential services, including garbage collection and police patrols, would make them seem less and less affordable.\u201cWhat this says is that the quality of life 30 years from now could deteriorate,\u201d Professor Baumol said in 1983, \u201cbecause many of the services that we associate with quality of life will become relatively more expensive while mass-produced things become cheaper and cheaper.\u201dHis work influenced not only generations of economists but also policy makers, including the architects of the Clinton administration\u2019s health care initiative \u2014 even if his ideas were not always incorporated in the final product.\u201cCost increases are in the nature of the health care beast,\u201d he wrote in an essay in The New York Times in 1993. \u201cEfforts to alter this nature will be fruitless or harmful.\u201cThe real danger is that the nation, mistakenly thinking it must rein in runaway costs, will curtail valuable health services and render them inaccessible for the less affluent. Well-meaning reformers may take the same misstep in education, law enforcement and other handicraft services.\u201dHis insight about the low productivity growth in services also helped explain why overall growth in an economy increasingly dominated by services can stagnate.Professor Baumol did pioneering research \u2014 published in dozens of books, hundreds of papers and several congressional testimonies \u2014 on entrepreneurs, environmental policy, corporate finance, stock sales, the economics of Broadway theaters, inflation, and competition and monopolies, winning a wagon-full of awards and prizes along the way.William Jack Baumol was born in the South Bronx on Feb. 22, 1922, to Solomon and Lillian Baumol, immigrants from Eastern Europe. His interest in economics, he said, began in high school, after he started reading the works of Karl Marx. His parents, he said, instilled in him a strong social conscience.He served in the Army in World War II and got a job at the Agriculture Department, where he worked on allocating grain supplies to starving countries.He graduated from City College, where he met his future wife, Hilda Missel, and he enrolled in the London School of Economics in 1947 after initially being rejected. Less than six weeks after school started, he was hired to become a member of the faculty.He landed at Princeton in 1949 and remained there for the rest of his life as a researcher and eventually as a professor emeritus. He joined the faculty of N.Y.U. in 1971 and retired from there only in 2014.Art was Professor Baumol\u2019s other passion: He painted in oils and had a one-man show in New York. He braced himself against the possibility of negative reviews by declaring that he rejected the idea of set standards for aesthetic criticism. \u201cI like Mozart better than rock \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s because of the way I happened to have been educated.\u201dHe later began sculpting in wood before moving on to computer art.\u201cNobody ever explained to him the difference between work and play,\u201d Daniel Baumol said of his father. \u201cDuring a long trip, he would sit in the back of the car, oblivious to the world, and as we pulled in, he would announce, \u2018I just finished that article.\u2019\u201dPatrick Bolton, a professor of economics at Columbia, described Professor Baumol as \u201csomeone who could come to a big problem and bring an extremely simple analysis that really shaped the way people would think about it.\u201dAsked by the economist Alan Krueger in 2000 where his blockbuster ideas came from, Professor Baumol said he was always looking for a theory to explain any given human phenomenon, and if he were lucky, his speculation would turn out to be right.\u201cAnd sometimes I\u2019m very lucky,\u201d he continued, \u201cand I turn out to be totally wrong.

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Delays Decision on Leaving Climate Pact", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With top presidential aides stubbornly divided, the White House abruptly announced on Tuesday that President Trump would make no decision on the United States\u2019 future in the Paris climate change accord until June, after he returns from a meeting of the Group of 7 Western powers.The announcement by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, encouraged advocates of the landmark climate pact, who hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s fellow heads of state can pressure the president to remain in the accord, first at a NATO summit meeting in Brussels next week and then at the G-7 meeting in Taormina, Italy. Similar pressure was brought to bear by the leaders of Mexico and Canada when Mr. Trump threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 then reversed course.As Mr. Trump embarks on his first foreign trip since assuming office, heads of state are expected to point out to him that withdrawing from the deal is likely to affect his standing and credibility on the world stage as he seeks to press other elements of his foreign policy agenda, such as trade and military efforts to suppress the Islamic State.\u201cAll the European governments hope that President Trump will stay in the Paris Agreement, and the G-7 can be the moment where he can measure the diplomatic cost of the pulling out,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, the lead French climate negotiator of the 2015 accord. \u201cIt will be a fantastic opportunity to make that case.\u201dThe push has started. On Monday, when Mr. Trump called President-elect Emmanuel Macron of France to congratulate him on his victory, Mr. Macron told the president that enforcing and strengthening the Paris accord would be a top priority for him. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada have told Mr. Trump that they value upholding the Paris deal, and Ms. Tubiana and other climate diplomats say they expect that other G-7 leaders will telephone Mr. Trump to convey the same message before convening in Italy.\u201cOther world leaders are likely to press on the president not only the importance they place on climate change but also the impact that pulling out will have on the president\u2019s other foreign policy priorities,\u201d said Nigel Purvis, a climate negotiator in the Clinton and Bush administrations. \u201cAnd I think that will make an impression.\u201dOpponents of remaining in the Paris pact, including the heads of conservative advocacy groups with close ties to the Trump administration, agreed that the delay could give the pact\u2019s supporters an edge.\u201cI think the remain camp sees delay to their advantage,\u201d wrote Thomas J. Pyle, an adviser to the Trump transition and the president of the Institute for Energy Research, a group that promotes fossil fuels and opposes most climate change policy. \u201cIt also invites a sustained campaign by the greens, media, industry to exert additional resources and pressure. They have more resources to bring to bear.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s senior advisers have been locked in an impasse for weeks over whether or how to follow through on their boss\u2019s campaign pledge to pull the United States from the 195-nation accord, which was legally ratified last year.Urging the president to remain in the deal are the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who have proved to be among the president\u2019s most influential advisers. Ms. Trump has tried to give the administration some green credentials by meeting with climate activists such as former Vice President Al Gore and the movie star Leonardo DiCaprio.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson also favors remaining. Mr. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil chief executive, led the oil and gas giant when the accord was struck, and said even then that he favored it. As the nation\u2019s chief diplomat, he would have to absorb the world\u2019s displeasure if the United States exited the deal.On the other side of the divide is the president\u2019s senior strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who sees withdrawing from the global warming pact as the fulfillment of a key campaign promise. Most of the president\u2019s other senior advisers concur with Mr. Bannon, according to four people with direct knowledge of the discussions.Also pushing hard for the president to exit the deal is Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who will be responsible for carrying out Mr. Trump\u2019s climate change agenda, particularly his rollback of President Barack Obama\u2019s ambitious emissions regulations.Under the Paris agreement, every nation has formally submitted plans to lower planet-warming pollution. The Obama administration pledged that the United States would reduce its carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. However, that pledge depends on enactment of Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. regulations on coal-fired power plants, which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt plan to substantially weaken or eliminate.Mr. Pruitt has warned that remaining in the Paris deal would create a major legal obstacle to his efforts to dismantle the Obama climate change regulations, since an opponent could argue that the United States is obligated to keep the regulations in place to meet the terms of the pact.On Monday, a coalition of about 40 conservative advocacy groups, some of which directly advised the Trump campaign and transition, signed a letter to Mr. Trump supporting Mr. Pruitt\u2019s view. Many of the signers have a history of denying the established science of climate change and lobbying against climate change policy, such as the Heartland Institute, Americans for Tax Reform and the Heritage Foundation.\u201cFailing to withdraw from Paris exposes key parts of your deregulatory agenda to unnecessary legal risk,\u201d they wrote.But under the Paris deal, those numerical targets are not legally binding, and there are no sanctions for failing to meet them. The primary legal requirements of the deal are that countries put forth their emissions reductions targets, and later release reports verifying how they are meeting the targets. The Trump administration could stay in the deal and submit a less ambitious target that could be reached without new policies as the United States transitions to a cleaner economy.Officials close to Mr. Trump say the president understands that remaining in the pact could give him leverage in other discussions with countries adhering to it. Abandoning it could shred the political capital he is trying to build globally.Meanwhile, Mr. Obama made a pitch on Monday to remain in the deal. Speaking at a conference in Milan focused on climate change and sustainable food development, Mr. Obama said the United States should not \u201csit on the sidelines\u201d of the Paris Agreement.\u201cDuring the course of my presidency, I made climate change a top priority because I believe that of all the challenges that we face, this is the one that will define the contours of this century, more dramatically perhaps than any other,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Yale Graduate Students Are on a Hunger Strike", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byOn CampusNEW HAVEN, Conn. \u2014 Two weeks ago, Yale graduate student teachers began a hunger strike to pressure the school to negotiate with their union. Eight committed to fasting, planning only to stop if a doctor says their health is at risk of permanent damage. If a student has to stop fasting, another union member takes his or her spot. Four of the students have had nothing but water for 14 days.The measures these graduate student teachers are taking are dramatic. But their cause \u2014 a fight for decent, secure wages and comprehensive benefits \u2014 has implications for the entire labor market.It is not shocking that these teachers have turned to unions. What is shocking is how a lot of universities have responded.But Yale refused to acknowledge the union. Instead, it hired Proskauer Rose, a high-powered law firm that specializes in union-busting, to harass and intimidate the students. Lawyers forced students into a labor board hearing and badgered graduate teachers on the witness stand for hours, demeaning their knowledge and skills. The lawyers argued that for many of the courses they teach, these graduate students \u201chave no subject matter expertise\u201d and therefore don\u2019t qualify as professors. It would, of course, be very odd if such a prestigious school let inept graduates teach students whose families pay some $50,000 a year in tuition. That Yale would besmirch its own student teachers this way to keep from bargaining with them is appalling and detrimental to its educational mission.Despite the legal challenge, a regional panel of the labor board reaffirmed the right of Yale students to unionize, and following elections, Local 33 of the national union Unite Here became the teachers\u2019 certified bargaining agent. Yale still refuses to come to the table. The administration is stalling until President Trump appoints new members to the National Labor Relations Board, because the appointees will almost certainly be anti-union and more likely to overturn the current ruling.Yale is not alone in using high-priced consultants and law firms to block unionization of graduate students or adjunct faculty members. Harvard, Columbia, Duke, New York University, Emory and Barnard \u2014 to name a few elite schools \u2014 have all retained firms to undermine their nontenured teachers. The schools argue that graduate students are essentially apprentices, as they are training to become professors or perhaps museum and archive curators. But the National Labor Relations Board made clear that graduate students are also professional teachers and advisers, and are therefore employees as well as students.This has created a perpetual backlog of aspiring assistant professors, all competing for fewer jobs. It is not the case anymore that a graduate student teacher can scrape by on meager wages, taking on debt that will be paid off by a steady job in the future. More and more, contingent faculty members are stuck as just that.At Yale, graduate student teachers tried sending letters, gathering signatures for community petitions and holding rallies to bring the school to the bargaining table, without result. So, two weeks ago, union members erected a lofty shelter on Beinecke Plaza facing the offices of Yale\u2019s president, Peter Salovey. They furnished the area with sofas, chairs, tables, lamps, a bookcase, turf and picnic tables. The graduate students who are fasting take posts there each day, wrapped in blankets. Some use wheelchairs as they have become too weak to walk. At night they sleep inside the First and Summerfield Church.The university has demanded the students remove the structure. But for now, it still stands, transforming a gray plaza of marble and concrete into a communal space. Passers-by now stop to talk. Workers from other unions on campus offer support and solidarity. Ministers, imams and rabbis have all visited, as have politicians including New Haven\u2019s mayor, Toni Harp, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro and Senator Richard Blumenthal.The university is nothing if not a place that should foster critical inquiry and civic engagement. That so many schools have mimicked corporate America in preferring greater profits to fair wages for their employees \u2014 quashing democratic participation in university decisions \u2014 says a lot about the role the university now plays in society.Jennifer Klein, a history professor at Yale, is the author of \u201cCaring for America: Home Health Workers in the Shadow of the Welfare State.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Patient Resilience of Iran\u2019s Reformers", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt wasn\u2019t the first time Iranian voters expressed their preference for these values. They have done so repeatedly, overcoming every obstacle a repressive state can thrust in their way. The fact that such demands may not be met \u2014 and may even result in significant sacrifice for those who make them most vociferously \u2014 does not make them less meaningful, but more so.It\u2019s true that the Iranian system offers limited choice and the president has limited power. The regime has policed its boundaries and eliminated true challenges to the entrenched interests of its security apparatus and clerical elite. But that is precisely why Iranian voter behavior deserves attention. Because the vehicles that carry the popular will to the highest echelons of the Iranian regime are imperfect, the electorate and the politicians seeking its favor have learned, over the course of decades, to play a long game, wedging the system open with the force of their numbers and refusing to acquiesce silently in their exclusion. The patience and persistence of Iranian civic culture is the longer story of Iran\u2019s revolution, and one of the longest stories in the Middle East, having outlived many uprisings and protest movements.Mr. Rouhani, a pragmatic centrist when he came to the presidency in 2013, ran to his own left this year. Having concluded the historic nuclear agreement with world powers in 2015, he now emphasized priorities he\u2019d abandoned in his first term: rights, freedoms and the release of the opposition leaders held under house arrest since 2010. He directly challenged the abuses of the judiciary and the political overreach of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, with which he has vied for authority throughout his presidency. What he hadn\u2019t accomplished already, he claimed, he hadn\u2019t been permitted to do. Whether he will be permitted now is a legitimate question, as is the extent of his willingness to battle the judiciary and Revolutionary Guards. But meeting the voting public where it stood meant staking his political capital on the promise to try.The footage from Mr. Rouhani\u2019s rallies showed a sea of purple, his official campaign color, intermingled with just as much green, the color of the uprising the regime violently quashed in 2009. People held up pictures of that movement\u2019s leaders on their cellphones. Mr. Rouhani has inherited this constituency, and while his embrace of it was tepid in 2013, he seems more comfortable in the role today.There are as many possible reasons for Mr. Raisi\u2019s failure as there are for Mr. Rouhani\u2019s success. Among them is the fact that Iran has abundant experience with populism. There is a whiff of it in the country\u2019s post-revolutionary politics as a whole, whether from left, right or center. But the country has also had a very recent and well-remembered run with a president who made populism his calling card and then proceeded to drive the economy into the ground. Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s 2005 rhetoric was politically potent, but the memory of his two terms in office is potent, too.No election will produce wholesale change in a top-heavy, autocratic regime that has invested everything in its own survival. But the strength of Iran\u2019s evolving civic culture is that it no longer appears to expect this. Twenty years ago, when it first appeared on Iran\u2019s political scene, the reform movement made extravagant promises of democratic development. When President Mohammad Khatami and his idealistic coterie failed to materialize such change during their years in office, from 1997 to 2005, the public turned on them. Widespread voter apathy, cynicism and anger helped bring Mr. Ahmadinejad the presidency in 2005.This year, it is also something more. With the succession to 77-year-old Ayatollah Khamenei quite possibly on the line, the election sent a clear message to Iran\u2019s clerical leadership about the temperament and priorities of the country\u2019s people. Washington, for its part, isn\u2019t listening \u2014 perhaps because the populist authoritarian in the White House prefers the company of his own kind to a civic culture that refuses to surrender its dignity to dictatorship.Laura Secor is the author of \u201cChildren of Paradise: The Struggle for the Soul of Iran.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Announces $1 Billion Fund to Create U.S. Jobs in Manufacturing", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byOn Wednesday, Apple appeared to meet President Trump halfway.While it did not announce a new manufacturing facility with thousands of manufacturing jobs, Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, said it planned to dedicate resources to American job creation with a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the United States. The company said it would announce the first investment from its new fund later this month.In introducing the fund, Apple joined a growing list of companies that have said in recent months that they will add, promote or keep jobs \u2014 many of them related to manufacturing \u2014 in the United States.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.Some critics have suggested the Trump administration is too focused on manufacturing, as opposed to more quickly cultivating service occupations \u2014 in the leisure and hospitality or health care industries, for instance.But for the roughly two-thirds of Americans who lack a four-year college degree, manufacturing remains one of the few sectors that can deliver a middle-class income. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the typical factory worker earns more than $26 an hour, compared with $14 an hour for the average hotel and food services employee.Apple\u2019s focus with its new fund is on a slice of the industry known as advanced manufacturing. That is a catchall term, but typically it involves the production of high-value-added products in sectors like technology, aerospace, automobiles, sustainable energy and medical equipment. In some cases, that means making much smaller batches than mass-production-oriented assembly lines churn out, or using robotics and 3-D printing to create bespoke items.Mr. Cook\u2019s announcement of the new fund came midway through his interview with Jim Cramer of CNBC, when he was asked what he was doing to create jobs. Mr. Cook answered that Apple gave back in job creation and that the company had asked itself, \u201cHow can we get more people to do advanced manufacturing in the United States?\u201dMr. Cook did not address whether the fund was influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and statements on manufacturing.Asked by Mr. Cramer about working with the president, Mr. Cook said there were always issues to agree on and disagree on with any administration in any country. But \u201cyou look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don\u2019t,\u201d he said.Mr. Cook added that Apple would announce initiatives to support its current employees and add to their ranks, and to aid the software developers who make apps for Apple\u2019s phones, watches and computers.An Apple spokesman said he did not have anything to add beyond what Mr. Cook said during the interview.Katie Benner reported from San Francisco and Nelson D.

{"Headline": "Greening Your Summer Vacation", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayThe United Nations has proclaimed 2017 the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development with a goal of promoting positive change in travel with regard to social inclusion, environmental protection and economic equality.But what does that mean for the everyday traveler planning a summer vacation? Homework. While the United Nations has a roster of forums, talks and conferences on sustainable tourism this year, travelers themselves are left to sort the good practices from the bad, the indifferent or the downright cynical.Sustainability is a big-umbrella term that addresses the economy, communities and the environment. Here are three aspects to consider as you plan.The remedy isn\u2019t to stop traveling, which is a major economic driver, particularly in emerging countries, but \u201cto do it smarter,\u201d said Ms. Honey of Crest. \u201cLook for larger, more fuel-efficient engines. Try to travel on nonstops. Going down and coming up creates more emissions. And where there are alternatives like trains and buses, do those. Try not to do short-haul flights.\u201dCosts depend on the programs supported. At United, the nearly 10,000-mile round trip between Newark and Honolulu could recently be offset with a $14.78 donation to a wind farm, or $17.74 to help protect a forest in Peru.\u201cWhen it comes down to it, carbon offsetting is a creative way to drive funding toward great conservation projects that help the earth,\u201d said Ted Martens, the vice president of marketing and sustainability for Natural Habitat.\u201cThey\u2019re sort of like policemen for the sustainable tourism industry,\u201d Ms. Honey said.\u201cRecycling is the last thing you want to do and only if you haven\u2019t been able to avoid creating waste,\u201d said Hans Pfister, an owner of the Cayuga Collection, which bans plastic bottles and drinking straws from its properties. \u201cRemote places are not capable of dealing with plastic trash because they don\u2019t have the infrastructure.\u201dIncreasingly, green tourism operators are focusing on the human factor, or the impact on local people. Is the tour company staffed by locals? Is the hotel locally owned, and therefore keeping the money within the community rather than shipping it to a foreign headquarters? Do tourism businesses support environmental or educational projects? Do employees earn a living wage? Can travelers learn from the locals and vice versa?\u201cWe are used to talking about what your carbon footprint is, but what is your handprint?\u201d Mr. Pfister asked. \u201cYour handprint is spending two hours interacting with a community or buying art directly from the person producing it, not in a gift shop, which has a carved toucan made in China. Your handprint could be going on a local fishing tour and leaving a positive impression. It\u2019s all about creating relationships.\u201dOn the social side, eco-tourism operators hope travelers will return home not just with gorgeous photographs, but also with new waste-reduction practices, a zeal for conservation to share with friends and a determination to support organizations like the World Wildlife Fund.\u201cOur biggest opportunity is through this influence that we have with travelers and using these experiences to inspire them,\u201d said Mr. Martens of Natural Habitat Adventures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Iran, Heavy Voter Turnout Seen as a Plus for President Rouhani", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 Iranians lined up at polling places in such numbers on Friday that Iranian election officials extended the voting three separate times, first by two hours, then four hours and finally five hours.As Iran elects a new president, I drove 550 miles from its holiest city to the capital to see how people are divided.In Tehran, the capital, voters in more affluent northern neighborhoods appeared to be showing up in even larger numbers than in 2013, when urban middle-class Iranians across the country helped elect Mr. Rouhani. Voters in those neighborhoods said in interviews that they were attracted to his promises of greater freedom and wanted to block Mr. Raisi.To be victorious, Mr. Raisi would need a strong turnout from voters who live in less-affluent areas and who emphasize piety and ideology. In the city\u2019s poorer southern neighborhoods, there seemed to be less enthusiasm on Friday morning.As the voting took place on Friday, those themes seemed to be borne out.At work in a south Tehran car shop, Hamed Seyedi, 37, said he did not bother to vote. A former member of the basij, the voluntary paramilitary group that supports the hard-liners, he said life had become so hard, he saw no point in voting.\u201cThose people uptown, at least they gain something if Rouhani wins. Some freedoms,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for us down here it doesn\u2019t matter who wins. Our lives won\u2019t change.\u201dMr. Raisi has been trying to attract the votes of these Iranians, the have-nots who feel alienated by Mr. Rouhani and sometimes disappointed by the establishment. He emerged in the campaign as something of a populist, promising cash handouts and solutions to economic problems that seem near magical, his opponents say.But most polling stations in south Tehran were far from busy. At times, there seemed to be more officials than voters.\u201cMr. Rouhani has achieved nothing,\u201d he growled. \u201cWe will vote him out.\u201dState television showed long lines in cities cross the country, with smiling presenters lauding \u201cthe brave Iranian nation\u201d that had come out \u201cto show its enemies how strong it is.\u201dThe campaign had ended on a bitter note, with the two candidates trading fierce accusations in three live televised debates.Mr. Rouhani has promised economic growth and greater freedom of speech and of the press.Mr. Raisi, a former prosecutor who leads one of the wealthiest religious foundations in the Middle East, has vowed to fix the ailing economy, to give cash assistance to the poor, and to fight corruption. He has also criticized the nuclear deal, though he has pledged to retain it.The election emphasizes a split between those favoring overhauls and those who want to stick to the ideological precepts of the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Mr. Rouhani is seen as more outward-looking, favoring improved relations with other countries and opening up the largely state-run economy. Mr. Raisi favors a more populist, insular approach.\u201cI am voting for Raisi because he is a \u2018sayyid,\u2019 \u201d said Fazlolah Bahriye, using the honorific given to those believed to be descendants of the Prophet Muhammad. Mr. Bahriye, who said he thought he was in his early 70s (many in Iran are unsure of their birth date), then offered a diatribe against politicians, saying that they promised many things but never delivered.Other voters, especially younger ones, said they favored Mr. Rouhani. \u201cI want more freedom, a relaxation of the strict rules,\u201d said Muhammad Badijan, 19. He was wearing bright blue contact lenses that matched his shirt. \u201cI just want to live a normal life,\u201d he added.About 70 percent of Iran\u2019s population of 80 million lives in or near urban centers, a huge change compared with 40 years ago, when a majority lived in rural areas. Along with urbanization, the political preferences of many Iranians have shifted from a hard-line revolutionary agenda to more middle-class aspirations, such as a decent education, and transparency and accountability in governance. Nowadays, even many rural regions no longer necessarily support hard-line politicians.\u201cI called to friends across the country, in provincial cities, everywhere I\u2019m hearing the same thing: There are many more Rouhani supporters everywhere,\u201d said Nader Karimi Joni, a reformist journalist. \u201cThe trend is toward change,\u201d he added.The prospect of a hard-line president has energized many in the middle class to vote. Many middle-class Iranians want to prevent the election of a hard-line candidate like former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was not only disliked in the West but also back home, especially after the economy ran aground during his two terms.In the affluent neighborhood of Shahrak-e Gharb, in the west of Tehran, there were long lines of people waiting to cast their ballots. Almost everybody spoke of voting for Mr. Rouhani.\u201cI didn\u2019t vote four years ago, as I am not attracted to politics here, but I want to be sure that Mr. Raisi will not win,\u201d said Fariba Maleki, 65. She was sitting under a tree in the shade, waiting for her daughter \u2014 who was standing in line \u2014 to call her to come over and vote. \u201cIn the end, voting is better, as we have some influence in deciding the destiny of our country,\u201d she said.Three young men holding folding chairs said they had waited nearly three hours to cast votes. They gave their chairs to older voters who had also been waiting.\u201cIn Iran, we have an imaginary figure that children are afraid of,\u201d said one of the men, Ali Qazvini, 25. \u201cFor us, that is Mr. Raisi. So we are here to vote for Mr. Rouhani.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Kabul\u2019s case, the municipality has decided to accept that reality and paint the homes in bright colors.One of the fastest-growing cities in the world, Kabul has already expanded to more than five times its intended size. About 70 percent of the houses in the capital city of about five million are informal and unplanned. Many are in settlements, but there are also tall apartment buildings, as well as cafes, restaurants and shopping centers popping up all over town, giving Kabul a new look.For the Afghan authorities, the challenge is twofold: how to regulate the jumble of unplanned neighborhoods to create a presentable capital city, and how to plan for a future when, by 2060, one of every two Afghans is expected to be a city dweller.Kabul\u2019s population growth is part natural and part born of a long conflict. Hundreds of thousands of people from the countryside were forced by earlier wars to flee to Pakistan and Iran, where they were introduced to better standards of living. Now back in Afghanistan, they prefer to live in the capital rather than return to their home villages. The relentless recent fighting in the provinces has also forced people to take to Kabul.Drive into certain neighborhoods, and you will find them unrecognizable. Once, \u201cpoppy palaces\u201d that had dozens of rooms were hastily built to be rented out to military contractors at ridiculously expensive prices. Now, new, modest apartment buildings are being erected, catering to a more sustainable urban economy.For the informal dwellings up the mountains, like the ones in Joy Sheer, the Afghan government tries to provide at least basic security. Police checkpoints dot the neighborhood, and officers often make the steep climb multiple times a day to patrol and project a presence.Private businesses have stepped in to provide other basic needs like water. Shamsul Haq, a resident of Joy Sheer, said 80 percent of his neighbors were provided water by a private piping network. \u201cWe pay about $10 a month for every tap of water,\u201d Mr. Haq said.The Kabul municipality has had a drastic change in leadership over the past year, with the government appointing younger officials, many of them with graduate degrees from abroad. The new team is trying to standardize roads, increase parks and green areas, and improve trash collection. They also hope to take over the traffic department from the police to better integrate it into the city\u2019s services.Recently, the municipality decided the informal mountainside settlements needed a makeover. As a pilot project, the municipality is painting about 2,000 homes in the Joy Sheer area in shades of blue, green, yellow, white, pink and brown.Day in and day out, a group of about 10 painters mix lime and color in a barrel, swirl it and start spraying the walls.\u201cPeople are more interested in the blue and the green color,\u201d said Mohammed Gul, 47, one of the painters.While many of the residents have been supportive of the effort, it has also stirred some backlash among activists who say it is a type of whitewashing of the poverty that prevails in those neighborhoods.Musa Khan, a resident of Joy Sheer, said the government was better off focusing on paving paths to the homes high up the mountains or providing water to those houses whose residents still have to carry buckets on their backs.\u201cEvery day, children slip and fall down on their way to school and return home with broken arms or broken heads,\u201d Mr. Khan said.But Gul Jan, 50, who was transporting buckets of water on her back from the foot of the mountain in Joy Sheer, was less critical.\u201cWater is important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut color is also important.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why China\u2019s Growing Debt Load Worries the World", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byMoody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded its rating of China\u2019s sovereign debt one notch on Wednesday, citing concerns over growing debt in the country, which has the world\u2019s second-largest economy. In recent years, as China\u2019s stunning economic performance of past decades has become difficult to sustain, the country has used debt to fuel growth.Now, Moody\u2019s says, China will have to borrow more and more to maintain the levels of economic growth the government wants. The concerns Moody\u2019s raises will sound familiar to those who follow the Chinese economy closely. Expressed by one of the world\u2019s top credit ratings agencies, however, the misgivings will be harder to ignore.In short: China doesn\u2019t just have debt; it has a lot, and has accumulated it very fast.When it comes to pumping money into a financial system, China has made the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank look almost lackadaisical. It has expanded its broadly measured money supply by more than the rest of the world combined since the global financial crisis. Now it has 70 percent more money sloshing around its economy than the United States does, even though the American economy is bigger.China has accumulated its towering debt remarkably quickly. Goldman Sachs looked last year at how fast debt had accumulated relative to the size of the economy in 55 countries since 1960. It found that by the end of 2015, China was already in the top 2 percent of all credit expansions \u2014 and its debt shot up even higher last year. All of the other large expansions occurred in very small economies, some of which essentially lost control of their finances.The incredible part is that Goldman Sachs acknowledges that its calculations may underestimate the extent of China\u2019s debt buildup.That\u2019s because Goldman\u2019s calculations exclude what is often called shadow banking, a little-regulated, murky area of finance outside traditional banking channels in which China has also emerged as a world leader.Bank lending jumped 10 percent last year in China. But, over the same period, investments known as wealth management products, a speculative category of loans and other investments that banks keep off their balance sheets, zoomed up 30 percent.More than half of the bank debt in China consists of loans from state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises.The banks are not going to cut off lending to even the most debt-ridden state-owned enterprises. Already, economic growth is showing some signs of slowing after a strong start in the first three months of this year. Tighter lending policies could result in factories closing and in unemployment, as well as in defaults on previously issued loans.Chinese families and companies might start smuggling more money out of the country, further weakening the financial system. China has $3 trillion in foreign reserves to counter that, but even that large sum would not last forever.If China\u2019s residential real estate prices tumble, construction companies and developers may be unable to repay their debts, which could also hurt banks.It could accept a lower pace of economic growth, but that might risk fewer jobs for its vast work force.It could bail out the banking system, but that could lead its borrowers to believe that the government will always be there to rescue them.Or it could do nothing, and hope its debt does not weaken the economy further or create a broad financial crisis someday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Real Estate Boom Has Wall Street Wooing a Newspaper Publisher", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Wall Street has started a bidding war for Fairfax Media, an Australian company best known for the dowdy business of publishing newspapers. To understand why, look no further than Deanna McMath.\u201cThey\u2019re the only two sites I go to,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the papers. You don\u2019t pick up The Herald anymore on a Saturday to see what\u2019s for sale.\u201dAustralia\u2019s two biggest cities \u2014 Sydney and Melbourne \u2014 are having an extended, how-long-can-it-last surge in property prices, and for global investors, Fairfax\u2019s Domain offers a piece of the action.\u201cThey\u2019ve formed an investment thesis that real estate\u2019s just got a lot of value in it,\u201d Damien Tampling, a partner in Deloitte Australia\u2019s technology and media practice, said of the bidders for Fairfax.That has raised concerns that the intense focus on a real estate market that may or may not keep growing will put at risk Fairfax\u2019s most visible assets: major newspapers including The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, based in Melbourne. Staff members at those papers went on a weeklong strike this month over imminent job cuts, and they fear that both Fairfax bidders would further shrink print operations in order to invest in the company\u2019s digital real estate advertising arm.The bidding war also sets up another battle, between News Corporation, one of Australia\u2019s biggest media companies, and well-funded Wall Street investors bent on making money from Australians\u2019 fascination with property prices.Sensitive to the worries about what a deal might do to Australia\u2019s media landscape, TPG has pledged to nurture the newspapers. Hellman & Friedman officials have declined to comment. Fairfax owns community newspapers and has interests in online video, digital publishing and radio.Australia as a whole is grappling with a slowdown in demand for the iron ore, coal, milk and other resources it exports to China and elsewhere. As Australia\u2019s growth has slowed, its central bank has cut interest rates to help keep the economy humming.But Sydney and Melbourne stand as glaring exceptions, making the country something of a two-track economy. Those two cities are experiencing much stronger job creation and economic growth, and the low interest rates translate into cheaper mortgages for people there, making buying and selling a lot more attractive.As a result, both cities are experiencing a property boom. Until last year, when the overall Australian market slowed, Sydney and Melbourne regularly had double-digit annual growth in house prices. Elsewhere in the country, the growth was slower, or even negative.\u201cThe Australian housing market is going gangbusters,\u201d said Terry Rawnsley, an economist with SGS Economics and Planning. \u201cWages and profits are up in Sydney and Melbourne, so people have got more money in their pockets.\u201dThe listings business offers a way to cash in on the boom. Domain\u2019s digital revenue grew 15 percent in the six-month period that ended in December while Fairfax\u2019s overall revenue dropped almost 5 percent. Fairfax\u2019s revenue fell about 2 percent in its fiscal year that ended last June.Domain and Realestate.com.au enjoy a duopoly in selling ads for residential real estate, property agents say. Listings can cost 1,500 Australian dollars (about $1,100) per property, said Jonathan Hammond, an agent with Cobden & Hayson.\u201cIf you want to get the right price,\u201d Mr. Hammond said, \u201cyou need to get on those websites.\u201dBoth TPG and Hellman & Friedman have investments in property-listing firms outside Australia. Greg Ellis, who is leading Hellman & Friedman\u2019s Fairfax takeover effort, runs the firm\u2019s Scout24 listings company in Germany and is a former executive at the digital advertising company REA Group, which has News Corporation as its majority owner and in turn owns Realestate.com.au.REA said it was unfazed by looming competition with Wall Street money. \u201cIn this market, our competitors are local and global, private and public,\u201d Tracey Fellows, REA Group\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement, adding that Realestate.com.au had a sizable lead on the competition in monthly site visits.Both TPG and Hellman & Friedman face questions from lawmakers skeptical of the impact of a deal on Australia\u2019s media landscape. Speaking at a Senate hearing in Australia this month, Joel Thickins, the head of TPG Capital\u2019s Australia operations, said the firm would not be bidding $2.7 billion for Fairfax if it did not intend \u201cto grow the business and make it successful and sustainable over the long term.\u201d Hellman & Friedman executives are expected to testify as well, although the date has not been set.Outside the real estate business, Fairfax staff members worry about job cuts and diminished news coverage. Speaking before another Senate committee this month, Paul Murphy, chief executive of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Australia\u2019s national journalists\u2019 union, said, \u201cWe really are at a crossroads for public interest journalism in this country.\u201dIsabella Kwai contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

At a truck stop in Effingham, Ill., gruff-looking figures wearing camo hats and hundred-mile stares sat at a counter of the Iron Skillet Restaurant.Truck drivers are everywhere on our highways, undergirding the American economy, but most of us know little about their work and personal lives beyond musty stereotypes from the days of CB radio. Most truckers were quick to disabuse me of any notion that life on the open road holds romantic allure.\u201cEvery driver in here, we\u2019ve been to every state in the United States, but you never have the time to enjoy the things that you see,\u201d Ron Carrabis, 70, from Las Vegas, told me.A couple of truckers who are now college professors were helpful to me. Stephen V. Burks, an economist at the University of Minnesota at Morris, calculated that his pay as a union driver in 1979 would be the equivalent of $101,600 today. Since that era, trucking has been deregulated, and the Teamsters union has all but disappeared from the Interstates. As a result, truckers earn less than half of what they once did.Steve Viscelli, a trucker turned sociologist, who wrote \u201cThe Big Rig: Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream,\u201d described how the industry tries to keep drivers from quitting by enticing them to become independent contractors. In many cases it is a financial nightmare.It was Mr. Viscelli who steered me to Effingham, Ill., which he called \u201ctrucking central,\u201d in search of drivers to interview. The town, which I had not heard of before, is at a crossroads of two major Interstates. The truck stop where I spent two days, part of the Petro national chain, has parking for nearly 300 rigs. The eighteen-wheelers start rolling in for the night around 4 p.m.Besides interviews in the restaurant, I spoke to drivers fueling their trucks. I was surprised at how many traveled with dogs, companions for an often lonely job. I was also surprised at the diversity: Drivers were young and old; male and female; black, white and Hispanic.Ayisha Gomez, 39, from Riverside County, Calif. \u2014 who became a trucker because it was better than a minimum-wage job to help pay her daughter\u2019s college loans \u2014 made perhaps the strongest impression of all on me.\u201cThere are so many of us who are single mothers \u2014 and the work that\u2019s out there, we just can\u2019t support our families,\u201d she said.For some reason I had imagined that truckers stay in motels, but that would be an impossible luxury. Unlike reporters for The Times, which covered my stay at a Fairfield Inn ($99 a night) and my meals, truckers pay expenses on the road out of their own pockets.Many quickly pulled the curtains across their windshields and withdrew to their sleeper cabs for the night with engines running. Herb Cox, 50, from Atlanta, said the hardest thing on the road was getting enough rest: \u201cI challenge you to ask 100 of these guys, \u2018Did you get a good night\u2019s sleep last night?\u2019 \u201d A couple of Mr. Cox\u2019s front teeth were missing. He said he grinds them from stress, and they had broken off: \u201cI bit into a sandwich and they came out.\u201dIn the end, my editors and I decided to let the drivers speak for themselves, at some length, rather than snip their quotes and drop them into a conventional article. Their voices were down-to-earth, often poignant and as direct as an air horn blast.Advertisement"}

The plea bargain arose out of the giant graft investigation involving Petrobras, the national oil company.Joesley Batista, the chief executive of J&F Investments, which controls JBS, visited Mr. Temer at his official residence in Bras\u00edlia, the capital, on the evening of March 7.Mr. Temer told Mr. Batista that he would have to keep up the payments, the newspaper said. Then he told Mr. Batista to contact a lawmaker from Mr. Temer\u2019s party about a problem J&F was having at a power plant it owned. Another company executive was filmed handing over a first payment, about $143,000, to the lawmaker.In a statement, Mr. Temer confirmed the meeting in March but denied the accusations.\u201cPresident Michel Temer never solicited payments to obtain the silence of ex-deputy Eduardo Cunha,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe did not participate nor authorize any movement with the objective of avoiding a plea bargain or collaboration between the justice system\u201d and Mr. Cunha.An opposition lawmaker, Alessandro Molon, called for the president\u2019s impeachment. \u201cThey don\u2019t change anything, they don\u2019t learn anything \u2014 they keep asking for bribes,\u201d Mr. Molon told reporters. \u201cThey have to be removed, and Brazil has to have new elections.\u201dThe corruption investigation centered on Petrobras created a political crisis that led to Ms. Rousseff\u2019s downfall, and the scandals have since metastasized, ensnaring dozens of leading politicians and once-prominent business executives.A poll in April showed that 92 percent of Brazilians thought the country was on the wrong path, with Mr. Temer\u2019s own approval rating standing at just 4 percent.Paula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K., in Mourning, Asks if Manchester Bomber Could Have Been Stopped", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byMANCHESTER, England \u2014 The British authorities intensified their search on Thursday for possible accomplices of the Manchester bomber, as questions emerged about whether more could have been done to prevent the country\u2019s deadliest terrorist attack since 2005.The government has said that MI5, the domestic intelligence agency, was aware of Mr. Abedi \u2014 but only as a peripheral figure, and not someone whose behavior would have warranted immediate action.As the police conducted a series of house raids on Thursday in the Manchester area, the chief investigator said they were making headway in the investigation into the plot and had amassed important evidence. A man was arrested in the Moss Side area early Friday, according the police. Eight suspects were in custody. Two other people were released after being detained.\u201cI want to reassure people that the arrests that we have made are significant, and initial searches of premises have revealed items that we believe are very important to the investigation,\u201d Manchester\u2019s top police official, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, said at a news conference. \u201cThese searches will take several days to complete, as you would expect. Therefore, there will be some disruption. However, it is very important that we continue with these searches.\u201dOfficials in Turkey and Germany said on Thursday that Mr. Abedi had passed through airports in Istanbul and the German city of D\u00fcsseldorf this month on his way back to Britain from Libya.It did not appear that he had stayed very long or even left the airports in Turkey and Germany, but the German authorities were looking into a 2015 visit by Mr. Abedi to Frankfurt.France\u2019s interior minister said on Wednesday that Mr. Abedi had \u201cmost likely\u201d traveled to Syria, a stronghold of the Islamic State. But the Turkish authorities said they had no evidence that Mr. Abedi had passed through their country to travel to Syria.Since the attack, Mr. Abedi\u2019s older brother, Ismail, has been arrested in Britain, while his younger brother, Hashem, and father have been detained in Libya.A friend of the Abedi family, Salem Ammar, said in an interview that Mr. Abedi\u2019s father, Ramadan, had been so worried about his son\u2019s frame of mind in the months before the Manchester bombing that he pressured him to come to Libya, and briefly confiscated his passport.\u201cWe were all surprised that he managed to take his passport,\u201d Mr. Ammar said by telephone from Tripoli, the Libyan capital.Mr. Ammar said that Salman Abedi was distraught after a friend, Abdul Wahab Hafidah, was killed in May 2016 in what the authorities took to be an act of gang violence. Mr. Hafidah was close with Salman Abedi\u2019s brother Hashem.\u201cI was told his radicalization started in England shortly after the murder of Hafidah,\u201d Mr. Ammar said. \u201cSome of the kids there were very upset about it, and that is how it started.\u201dMr. Ammar said he was shocked because Mr. Abedi\u2019s father, an employee of the interior minister in Tripoli, \u201cis moderate and everyone knows that.\u201d He added, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe that his son grew up to be this person.\u201dRamadan Abedi, the father, fled Libya during the rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 1993 \u2014 the year before Salman was born, in Britain \u2014 but returned after Colonel Qaddafi was overthrown in 2011.In Manchester, Abdullah Muhsin Norris, the imam at a mosque where members of the Abedi family worshiped, said that Salman Abedi would sit around and read the Quran, avoiding other congregants. He was so quiet and withdrawn that he would have escaped notice, Mr. Norris said, but for the fact that Mr. Abedi twice committed minor infractions: lingering in the mosque after dawn prayers and wearing shoes while on his way to the mosque\u2019s lavatory.On one occasion, the young man responded angrily when chastised, telling the imam, \u201cDon\u2019t shout at me,\u201d according to Mr. Norris. He was \u201cacting like a child, and should know better,\u201d the imam recalled.The authorities are also looking into Mr. Abedi\u2019s relationships with several known militants, including Raphael Hostey, an Islamic State recruiter who was killed in a drone strike in Syria last year. Mr. Hostey\u2019s younger brother insisted on Thursday that his brother did not know Mr. Abedi, and then sped off on a moped.Hamed El-Said, a professor of international political economy at Manchester Metropolitan University who had a friend in common with the Abedi family, said he believed the young man had fallen under the sway of peers.\u201cThis is obviously another example of social radicalization with a small group of friends over the past two or three years \u2014 the question is where he met these people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is gullible, he is na\u00efve, he is disconnected, he\u2019s one of those individuals who, when you tell him something, might believe it. He would be the perfect mule for ISIS,\u201d he added, using an acronym for the Islamic State.As the authorities worked to piece together Mr. Abedi\u2019s past, Britain paused to grieve.Queen Elizabeth II visited teenagers at the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital who had been injured in the blast, and she described the attack as \u201cvery wicked.\u201dAt 11 a.m., much of the nation, from the Scottish Highlands to the City of London, observed a moment of silence to honor the victims.Mancunians, as Manchester\u2019s residents are known, filled St. Ann\u2019s Square in the city center for a memorial service. They laid flowers, stuffed toys and cards of condolence on a flowing makeshift altar.After the clock had tolled and the minute of silence had ended, someone in the back of the crowd began to sing \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back in Anger\u201d by the band Oasis, which was formed in Manchester.The group singalong was followed by rounds of applause and shouts of \u201cManchester, we love Manchester!\u201d People continued to stand together around the flowers for another 20 minutes or so after the vigil had ended.Reporting was contributed by Katrin Bennhold and Ceylan Yeginsu from Manchester, Sewell Chan and Steven Erlanger from London, Melissa Eddy and Suliman Ali Zway from Berlin, and Patrick Kingsley from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Republicans Move to Gut Bank Regulations", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans took a big step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, and they took a small step toward dismantling another of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature pieces of legislation, the Dodd-Frank Act.With only the support of Republicans, the House Financial Services Committee voted in favor of the Financial Choice Act, a bill that would gut central financial regulations created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The bill is expected to get a vote from the full House in the coming months. But, in its current form, it is not expected to pass in the Senate, where it would need support from Democrats to garner the necessary 60 votes.The Choice Act would exempt some financial institutions from capital and liquidity requirements, essentially excusing them from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act if they hold enough cash.It would replace the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which critics say reinforces the idea that some banks are too big to fail, with a new bankruptcy code provision intended for large financial institutions.It also would weaken the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the proposed law, the president could fire the agency\u2019s director at will.Republicans hailed the committee vote as a win for financial institutions. \u201cOur plan replaces Dodd-Frank\u2019s growth-strangling regulations on small banks and credit unions with reforms that expand access to capital so small businesses on Main Street can grow and create jobs,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.After a long markup section, the nearly 600-page bill passed, 34 to 26. The 19 amendments Democrats offered were rejected.They assailed the legislation as a giveaway to the banks. \u201cThe Wrong Choice Act is a deeply misguided measure that would bring harm to consumers, investors and our whole economy,\u201d said Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee. \u201cThe bill is rotten to the core and incredibly divisive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also dead on arrival in the Senate, and has no chance of becoming law.\u201dProgressive groups argued that the push to unravel Dodd-Frank was at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s populist campaign message that the economy was rigged in favor of corporate interests.\u201cIt is an enormous package of gifts for Wall Street and the worst actors in finance,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, who said the bill House Republicans passed would increase the likelihood of another financial crisis.The banking industry\u2019s top lobbyist, Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, cheered the committee\u2019s vote. \u201cThe thousands of pages of new regulations facing banks have become a tremendous driver of decisions to sell or merge,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the cost of complying with all the new rules, some community banks are having to choose between meeting those regulatory requirements and meeting the financial needs of their individual and business customers.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said at a Milken Institute conference in California this week that financial deregulation was one of his priorities. He assured the bankers in the audience that they would be pleased with his efforts.\u201cYou should all thank me for your bank stocks doing better,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Weak Inflation, Fed Is Likely to Raise Interest Rates in June", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A speech by a Federal Reserve governor Tuesday underscored a basic shift in Fed policy: The central bank now needs to be convinced that quarterly rate increases are a bad idea.After years in which any sign of economic weakness was reason enough for the Fed to maintain its stimulus campaign, the Fed is now willing to shrug off at least a little bad data. Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor, told the New York Association for Business Economics that the Fed should raise its benchmark interest rate \u201csoon,\u201d despite new evidence that inflation remains below the level the Fed desires.The comments by Ms. Brainard reinforced expectations that the Fed will raise rates in mid-June at its next meeting, particularly because she has been a consistent advocate of caution. If she is ready to raise rates, there is probably little internal opposition.\u201cOn balance, when assessing economic activity and its likely evolution, it would be reasonable to conclude that further removal of accommodation will likely be appropriate soon,\u201d Ms. Brainard said.But beyond June, Ms. Brainard added, she might reconsider the wisdom of additional rate increases if there is not evidence of stronger inflation. Fed officials have said they would like to raise rates at least once more in the second half of the year.The Fed has kept rates at low levels since the financial crisis to stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. It is gradually raising rates toward historically normal levels as the economy improves. Fed officials have said they hope to return rates to a neutral level by the end of the year.Ms. Brainard, who has carved out a reputation as the Fed official who takes the most active interest in the health of the global economy, also noted that the international outlook has brightened. \u201cFor the first time in many years, we are seeing signs of synchronized economic expansions at home and abroad,\u201d she said.Inflation remains the outstanding problem. The Fed aims to maintain moderate inflation, rather than price stability, because that lets the Fed cut interest rates more sharply during an economic downturn.Inflation also eases downward economic adjustments. Employers, for example, can cut costs by raising wages more slowly than inflation, which may be easier for workers to accept than an outright pay cut.The Fed also wants to avoid deflation, or price declines, because as things become cheaper each day, consumers and businesses postpone buying and economic activity shrinks more. Measures of inflation are imperfect, and prudence dictates maintaining some distance from zero.Analysts attribute some of the recent dip in inflation to a price war among providers of cellular service. But forecasters are now predicting that inflation may not reach 2 percent until next year, setting up 2017 as the latest in a long series of years that inflation was predicted to rebound and then failed to meet expectations.Ms. Brainard described this persistent sluggishness as something of a mystery, particularly given the Fed\u2019s view that the labor market is back to normal.\u201cThe puzzle today is why inflation appears to be slowing at a time when most forecasters place the economy at or near full employment,\u201d she said.She described the weakness as a \u201csource of concern,\u201d but given the overall strength of the economy, she said, it was not reason enough to delay a rate increase.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

For years they had avoided investing in India, put off by a creakingly slow legal system and a labyrinthine bureaucracy.But a new bankruptcy law and a move this month to give India\u2019s central bank expansive powers to tackle bad debt have excited investors both here and abroad who think investing in India\u2019s distressed market could produce double-digit returns.\u201cThe new bankruptcy laws have been given teeth, which finally makes Indian credit markets attractive to foreign investors,\u201d said Saleem Siddiqi, founder of Musst Investments, a family office in London. Mr. Siddiqi is creating an Indian merchant bank to invest in middle-market corporate loans.A test of the new approach came this month, when a tribunal in New Delhi dismissed an appeal by a steel company, Innoventive Industries, which was arguing, among other claims, that a state law allowed it to suspend its liability temporarily. The tribunal ruled that the country\u2019s new bankruptcy law prevailed.\u201cNow the first case is resolved, you will see an onslaught of deals from the big guys,\u201d says Ravi Chachra, managing partner of the Mumbai-based asset manager Eight Capital.The new bankruptcy law is aimed at cleaning up the nation\u2019s mountain of debt, making it easier to dissolve a company and recover money. In India, where parties can drag out bankruptcies for years, the law has an important feature requiring a bankruptcy to be completed within 180 days in the event of default.Mr. Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs partner, made a fortune buying into Japanese banks nearly 20 years ago, but struggled with some of the investments he made during the financial crisis.In India, Mr. Flowers noted, \u201cyou have a credit market which doesn\u2019t function very well because creditors can\u2019t collect on their debt and credit ends up in the wrong places.\u201d\u201cBorrowing costs are high and banks don\u2019t make money,\u201d he said. \u201cBad debt clogs the system.\u201dOne of the challenges investors like Mr. Flowers face is that so far, banks have been reluctant to swallow the big discounts that investors are demanding to acquire bad assets. Little more than $3 billion in nonperforming assets were sold to asset reconstruction companies in the 2016 fiscal year, according to a report from Credit Suisse.Some widely reported deals haven\u2019t materialized. The San Francisco-based asset manager Farallon Capital is no longer expected to acquire a 24 percent stake in the struggling Essar Steel.India\u2019s robust growth slowed recently as a result of the government\u2019s unexpected move last year to ban 86 percent of the nation\u2019s currency in an effort to root out \u201cblack money,\u201d currency on which taxes haven\u2019t been paid. The move has produced widespread shortages of cash. Economic growth is expected to face challenges as long as banks here are saddled with enormous bad debts.Long term, some foreign investors think the bankruptcy law change could have far-reaching ramifications for India\u2019s capital markets, the jet fuel of a soaring economy. Indian companies have historically relied on selling stocks or lining up bank loans to finance their activities. Corporate bonds represent a tiny fraction of capital-raising.\u201cFor the corporate bond market to develop in India, you need to have jurisprudence, you need to have recourse, you need to have laws, you need to have transparency,\u201d said Mr. Siddiqi of Musst Investments. \u201cThe way India deals with nonperforming loans will be a litmus test of that.\u201dIn addition to J. C. Flowers, other foreign players have set plans to participate in India\u2019s distressed-debt market.ICICI Bank of India and an affiliate of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management have agreed to work together in resolving debts in India \u201cin an effort to revitalize and turn around overleveraged borrowers.\u201d And Bain Capital and Piramal Enterprises, a diversified Indian company, have signed an accord to create a strategic partnership to invest in Indian restructurings.Both of the American firms are following in the footsteps of the restructuring investor Wilbur L. Ross, now the United States commerce secretary. Nearly a decade ago, Mr. Ross invested in the struggling Indian airline SpiceJet, helping turn around the company by installing new leadership before selling at a profit. It was among a handful of investments in India for Mr. Ross.In contrast with their solo forays into private equity, this time big foreign firms entering the distressed arena are largely choosing to team up with Indian firms.The Edelweiss Group, a Mumbai brokerage firm, signed an agreement last fall with Canada\u2019s second-biggest pension fund, Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec, for the Canadian fund to invest up to $700 million in distressed assets and private debt in India over four years. As part of the deal, Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t plans to take a 20 percent stake in Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company, which has about $5.4 billion in assets.In March, a Carlyle Group fund, which owned an 8.2 percent stake in Mr. Ramaswamy\u2019s brokerage firm, Edelweiss, sold its holding for about $130 million.Many foreign firms have been waiting for the first big test of the bankruptcy legislation.In 2016, ICICI began an insolvency proceeding against Innoventive, the first move by a bank to recover assets under the new law. Innoventive fought back, arguing that a special act by the state of Maharashtra, where the company is based, had resulted in suspension of the company\u2019s liabilities for a year, thus nullifying ICICI Bank\u2019s claim at the time.After a hearing, the National Company Law Tribunal, the body adjudicating cases under the new bankruptcy law, moved to admit the case. Undeterred, Innoventive challenged the constitutional validity of the new law.The recent ruling upholding the law does not guarantee clear sailing ahead, however.\u201cThere will be some teething problems,\u201d says Srini Sriniwasan, managing director at Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd., a unit of the Indian bank Kotak Mahindra.Still, he is optimistic about the efficacy of the new bankruptcy law. \u201cThe speed at which the insolvency code was introduced and implemented is remarkable by Indian standards, \u201d he said.Kotak has enjoyed a ringside seat while watching India\u2019s distressed market swell.The glass-walled building Mr. Sriniwasan sits in, in Mumbai\u2019s Bandra Kurla complex, was built by a finance company. It had been allotted the land in an auction more than a decade ago.When the firm failed, Kotak started buying some of the debt underlying the property from other public-sector banks.An auction was set to sell off the property, but before it could proceed, Kotak had acquired all the nonperforming loans \u2014 and in doing so, secured ownership of the property.Advertisement"}

The newspaper could not get the distribution company to pick up the phone; it suspected political interference.Eventually, 3,600 copies were returned, some of them stained and smudged. The cartoonists took to an outdoor book market in Sofia, where about 50 copies were sold in 10 minutes.For the second issue, the publishers decided to distribute the newspaper themselves, to independent bookstores and newsstands throughout the country. This time, the print run was 8,000, and only 76 copies were returned unsold.Stefka Veleva, 77, visited five newspaper kiosks before she could get her hands on a copy of the third issue, at a bookstore in central Sofia. \u201cI enjoy satire and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more critical voices in this country.\u201dMr. Nikolov marveled: \u201cPeople stop us on the street to congratulate us and tell us that they support us, or just give us a \u2018thumbs up\u2019 sign.\u201dGeorgi Lozanov, a media expert and associate professor at Sofia University, praised the newspaper\u2019s focus on images, saying that \u201cmessages delivered by caricature\u201d resonated strongly in \u201csocieties where traditional media fails to expose problems and deficiencies through deductive reasoning.\u201dBut keeping a new print publication afloat, even an inexpensively produced one, will be a challenge.\u201cThe only way to survive is to stay popular among the audience and to demonstrate their boldness of ideas, biting wit and talent with each upcoming issue,\u201d Mr. Lozanov said.Vesislava Antonova, a journalist who has been covering the media in Bulgaria since 2000, said that a move to online-only publication might be inevitable. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to escape the traps of the suppressed media market in Bulgaria,\u201d she said.Aside from economic survival, there is the question of censorship.\u201cThe government\u2019s allocation of E.U. funding to certain media outlets is conducted with a complete lack of transparency, in effect bribing editors to go easy on the government in their political reporting or refrain from covering certain problematic stories altogether,\u201d the group noted.In April 2016, Nova TV, one of the biggest private television channels in Bulgaria, terminated Mr. Nikolov\u2019s contract and removed his cartoons from its website after he depicted Mr. Borisov as a leader of a group of vigilantes \u201chunting\u201d for migrants along Bulgaria\u2019s border with Turkey.

{"Headline": "Immigrants Keep an Iowa Meatpacking Town Alive and Growing", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Waves of Asian, African and Latino newcomers have filled jobs at pork, egg and turkey plants where wages have fallen and work has grown more grueling.Supported bySTORM LAKE, Iowa \u2014 When Dan Smith first went to work at the pork processing plant in Storm Lake in 1980, pretty much the only way to nab that kind of union job was to have a father, an uncle or a brother already there. The pay, he recalled, was $16 an hour, with benefits \u2014 enough to own a home, a couple of cars, a camper and a boat, while your wife stayed home with the children.\u201cIt was the best-paying job you could get, 100 percent, if you were unskilled,\u201d said Mr. Smith, now 66, who followed his father through the plant gates.After nearly four decades at the plant, most of them as a forklift driver, Mr. Smith is retiring this month.The union is long gone, and so are most of the white faces of men who once labored in the broiling heat of the killing floor and the icy chill of the production lines. What hasn\u2019t changed much is Mr. Smith\u2019s hourly wage, which is still about $16 an hour, the same as when he started 37 years ago. Had his wages kept up with inflation, he would be earning about $47 an hour.The forces that have helped transform this snug lakeside town in northwestern Iowa and others like it during Mr. Smith\u2019s working life have created a complex swirl of economic successes and hardships, optimism and unease.Yet Storm Lake, hustled along by the relentless drive of manufacturers to cut labor costs and by the town\u2019s grit to survive, is still growing. However clumsily at times, this four-square-mile patch has absorbed successive waves of immigrants and refugees \u2014 from Asia, from Mexico and Central America, and from Africa.But if the newcomers have brought some of the economic dynamism that President Trump promised to restore to the struggling Midwest and South, they have also fed some of the anxieties and resentments that he stirred.Storm Lake, with a population of roughly 11,000, is in no way immune to the strains and tensions that an influx of poor, low-skilled and non-English-speaking immigrants and refugees can bring. But after decades of living and working together, the residents recognize that their future is a shared one.\u201cOther communities our size are shrinking and consolidating school districts,\u201d said Mark Prosser, the police chief. \u201cWe have schools bulging at the seams. There are expensive challenges, but which one do you want: a dying community or one that has growth?\u201dLess than a half-mile from the police station, the shelves at Valentina\u2019s Meat Market offer a still-life version of the town\u2019s inhabitants. A kaleidoscope of packages, jars and produce from nearly every continent is jammed in \u2014 side by side are purple yams from Laos, green plantains from Ecuador, mahogany-brown cassava from Nigeria, tan egg roll wrappers from Vietnam.\u201cA lot of different communities are living together,\u201d said Mr. Morelos, who aims to feed them all.His wife, Mayela, works from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the pork plant, earning $18 an hour, before handling the register at Valentina\u2019s until the early evening. Mr. Morelos often doesn\u2019t finish up before midnight, he said, and rarely takes a day off. He recently bought a 22-acre farm about five minutes outside of town where he is raising lambs and goats. Dedicated workers, he said, can live \u201ca good life.\u201dShared ambitions and a willingness to work hard command respect across cultures here.Mr. Smith, looking back on his decades at the plant, acknowledges that a supply of immigrants makes it easier for employers to pay less, but he doesn\u2019t begrudge them the work.\u201cI harbor no ill feelings for anybody who\u2019s trying to make a better life for themselves,\u201d he said, settling on the living room couch in his home, a corner house next to the railroad tracks, which he shares with his girlfriend. \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to make a buck for their family, like I am.\u201dMr. Smith remembers that it wasn\u2019t the arrival of foreign workers that initially drove down wages, but the plant owners.First was Hygrade Food Products Corporation, an old-style meatpacking house that introduced Ball Park Franks to the Detroit Tigers\u2019 stadium in 1957 and operated the Storm Lake plant when Mr. Smith went to work there. Faced with competition from new companies that had developed a faster, more efficient method of boxing beef and selling it to supermarket chains and fast-food outlets, Hygrade in 1981 asked its workers to take a pay cut of $3 an hour. When they refused, the plant closed.With vigorous support from town leaders, the upstart Iowa Beef Processors (later known as IBP) bought and reopened it a few months later \u2014 slashing wages by more than half and shunning the union.At that point, Mr. Smith returned to do night cleanup, earning $5.50 an hour with no benefits, but a vast majority of his former co-workers were turned away, he said, because the new owner did not want to hire union supporters. Instead, the company began actively recruiting in Mexico and in immigrant communities in Texas and California.\u201cThey learned real fast to keep a sharp knife and didn\u2019t complain if they had a sore arm,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Even if pay were raised to $20 or $25 an hour, Mr. Smith said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you could get white guys.\u201dThose who are hired can be dogged by a common negative stereotype. As one supervisor at the plant recalled, some of the Mexican workers on the line complained after he hired a white worker, saying: \u201cThis guy is not going to last as long. He\u2019s young and he\u2019s not going to work hard.\u201dBut Mr. Swenson at Iowa State is skeptical of employer complaints about labor shortages. For an industry that needs to be where the animals are, he said, the only answer is to \u201cpay workers enough to retain them or attract them.\u201dThat was the way it worked for Abel Saengchanpheng, who came to Storm Lake from Northern California in 1997, when he was 16, after relatives talked up the job opportunities there. Born in a Thai refugee camp after his family escaped from Laos, Mr. Saengchanpheng, now 36 and an American citizen, joined his parents at the plant after he finished high school. He has been there ever since, working his way up to general foreman in 2013, and he now oversees 300 production workers.With earnings that place him comfortably in Storm Lake\u2019s upper middle class, he owns two cars, a Subaru and a Honda, and a home.\u201cI was so blessed to get into Tyson,\u201d he said, sipping coffee at Grand Central Coffee Station. \u201cI remember looking at the first paycheck and thinking, \u2018There is free money going around.\u2019\u201dThe work, though, can feed drudgery as well as dreams.Blanca Martinez, who came from El Salvador with her husband (a naturalized citizen who lived in Storm Lake) and their daughter, now 5, has been at the turkey plant for two years. She earns $15.70 an hour cutting bone six days a week on the 6 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. shift.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard,\u201d Ms. Martinez, 37, a permanent resident, said in Spanish through an interpreter. \u201cI\u2019m still not used to the cold.\u201d At work, she wears three gloves on her left hand and two on her right \u2014 giving her cutting hand a little more flexibility.Speaking English would widen her options, Ms. Martinez said, but she has had no time for lessons since her husband received a diagnosis of cancer.The contrast between Storm Lake and many neighboring towns is both by accident and by design.\u201cThat was a proactive choice on the part of community leaders,\u201d said the Rev. Charles Valenti-Hein, the pastor at Lakeside Presbyterian Church, which sponsored the first group. Making room for other immigrants, he said, was \u201can extension of that initial act of hospitality, something we\u2019ve chosen.\u201dOther residents suggested that the proximity of a university, Buena Vista, with some minority faculty members and students, as well as the town\u2019s location as a central stopping point on sales routes, may have contributed to the openness.Yet the flood of Mexican recruits who were funneled to the IBP plant in the 1990s engendered suspicion and tensions. School overcrowding, a surge in uncompensated care at the hospitals and a new need for translators drained city coffers. Complaints about a rise in crime and drugs followed.\u201cThere was a collective holding of breath as the community started to change,\u201d said Mr. Prosser, the police chief since 1989 and a Catholic deacon. \u201cAt first, people born and raised here felt, \u2018We want it to go back to the way it was.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve had all sorts of problems over a period of 30 to 35 years,\u201d Mr. Prosser said. \u201cBut the pros so outweigh the cons, and the community as a whole understands that, and for the most part they\u2019ve embraced it.\u201dSome surrounding towns have embraced the model, while others have rejected it. Decades ago, the picturesque city of Spencer, about 40 miles north, spurned the overtures of a packing plant, with some residents saying at the time that they didn\u2019t want their town to turn into Storm Lake.Other Iowa towns, like Denison, have followed Storm Lake\u2019s lead, though the rapid transition has brought growing pains.The Rev. Timothy Friedrichsen the Roman Catholic pastor at St. Mary\u2019s Church in Storm Lake, served previously at a parish in Denison. \u201cI was aghast at the open hostility towards immigrants that cropped up pretty regularly,\u201d he said of Denison, where the Latino population doubled in less than a decade.\u201cThough some people still feel, \u2018This is not the Storm Lake I grew up in,\u2019\u201d he said, for most of the population, \u201cthere is a kind of comfortableness. This is who we are now.\u201dGraciela Vrieze, a Spanish-speaking civilian community-service officer with the local police department, said her 13-year-old son, an Iowa-born citizen, had come home from school asking if they were all going to be deported to Mexico. There are few reliable statistics on the number of foreign-born residents with fake or no documents; estimates run to the thousands. Several with documents also said they were postponing trips abroad, however, because of the fear that they may not be allowed to return.Most of the farm boys and farmers\u2019 daughters have left, said Mr. Cullen of The Storm Lake Times. \u201cSecond-generation immigrants want to stay with their families,\u201d he said from the cozy one-room newsroom. He jumped up from his chair to hunt among the stacks of newspapers for a recent edition that featured a scholarship student from El Salvador returning from college to Storm Lake to start a house-painting business. \u201cThose kids are our future.\u201dImmigrant parents who labor on the production lines say they want their children to go to college instead of taking their places at the plant. But the expectation is that those children will return home after graduating.Ms. Martinez, the worker at the turkey plant, does not have time to take English classes herself, but the future she envisions for her 5-year-old includes going to medical school, becoming a doctor and then coming home to work here in Storm Lake.An earlier version of this article misstated the previous role of the Rev. Timothy Friedrichsen, the Roman Catholic pastor in Storm Lake. He was associate vicar, not pastor, in Denison, Iowa. The article also misspelled the given name of a civilian community-service officer with the local police department.

{"Headline": "In Win for Environmentalists, Senate Keeps an Obama-Era Climate Change Rule", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a surprising victory for President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental legacy, the Senate voted on Wednesday to uphold an Obama-era climate change regulation to control the release of methane from oil and gas wells on public land.Senators voted 51 to 49 to block consideration of a resolution to repeal the 2016 Interior Department rule to curb emissions of methane, a powerful planet-warming greenhouse gas. Senators John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine, all Republicans who have expressed concern about climate change and backed legislation to tackle the issue, broke with their party to join Democrats and defeat the resolution.The vote also was the first, and probably the only, defeat of a stream of resolutions over the last four months \u2014 pursued through the once-obscure Congressional Review Act \u2014 to unwind regulations approved late in the Obama administration.It also could worsen the Trump administration\u2019s problems on Capitol Hill, where there are signs the president\u2019s grip on his party is loosening.\u201cPeople of America and people of the world can breathe a sigh of relief,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.In anticipation of Republican defections, President Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence to the Senate floor to break a tie vote. But with three members of his own party breaking away, Mr. Pence could do nothing.\u201cWe were surprised and thrilled to win on this,\u201d said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters, which, along with other environmental groups, has been lobbying Republicans for weeks to vote against the repeal of the methane rule. \u201cThis is clearly a huge win for our health and our climate.\u201dWhile Ms. Collins and Mr. Graham had publicly announced their opposition to the measure, Mr. McCain\u2019s vote was a surprise.Mr. McCain also was the target of significant lobbying on the climate issue. Last week, a group of retired generals from the liberal Vet Voice Foundation sent a letter to all senators, framing the rollback of the methane regulation as a national security threat. The group said the venting of the emissions from fuel wells could diminish the natural gas supply. Mr. McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has spoken of climate change and the energy supply as a national security issue.We\u2019ve tracked the major environmental policies and decisions the Trump administration and Congress have rolled back so far.Oil lobbyists pressed their case that the methane rule was onerous and duplicative, since many oil-producing states already have state-level methane regulations.On Tuesday, Gwen Lachelt, a county commissioner from La Plata County, Colo., which sits near the Four Corners where the state abuts New Mexico, Utah and Arizona, buttonholed Mr. McCain in a Senate elevator to tell him that county residents have suffered from methane pollution drifting over from New Mexico, and she noted that the same pollution could affect his state.\u201cI\u2019m not taking credit for swaying Senator McCain\u2019s vote, but I told him that right across the state line from my county are 35,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all share an airshed and the winds that bring methane pollution our way, and without this federal rule, I have no way as a county commissioner to protect the people in my county. In the Four Corners, we all live under the largest methane cloud.\u201dMr. McCain made a similar point in a statement on the reasons for his vote.\u201cImproving the control of methane emissions is an important public health and air quality issue, which is why some states are moving forward with their own regulations requiring greater investment in recapture technology,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI join the call for strong action to reduce pollution from venting, flaring and leaks associated with oil and gas production operations on public and Indian land.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. McCain did say he would support an effort by the Trump administration to rewrite the Obama rule. Had Congress repealed the Obama-era rule entirely, the administration would have been precluded from issuing any similar regulation under the terms of the Congressional Review Act.The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents smaller oil and gas producers, criticized the vote. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed the Senate wasn\u2019t able to stop President Obama\u2019s unworkable rule by a federal agency that does not have the congressionally granted authority to regulate air quality,\u201d said Barry Russell, the group\u2019s president.Oil-state Republican lawmakers vowed to push Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to act on his own.\u201cI call on Interior Secretary Zinke to withdraw the rule immediately,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. \u201cIf left in place, this regulation will only discourage energy production, job creation and economic opportunity across the West.\u201dThe failure of the effort to roll back the methane rule is a small but significant victory for environmentalists in the Trump era, as the president has pushed aggressively to dismantle most of his predecessor\u2019s environmental legacy.The methane rule was one of a suite of environmental regulations put in place by Mr. Obama as he sought to use his executive authority to tackle climate change across the economy. While methane vented from oil and gas wells accounts for only a small portion of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution, environmental advocates urged Mr. Obama to tackle the emissions, because methane is over 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the earth\u2019s atmosphere.Included in those rollbacks were regulations that would have limited the way coal mining companies could dump debris into streams after blowing up mountaintops to gain access to coal deposits, and a requirement for oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments in exchange for access to drilling or mining rights.An earlier version of this story misstated a figure in a quotation from Gwen Lachelt, a county commissioner in Colorado.

Over the next decade, it calls for slashing more than $800 billion from Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, while slicing $192 billion from nutritional assistance and $272 billion over all from welfare programs. And domestic programs outside of military and homeland security whose budgets are determined annually by Congress would also take a hit, their funding falling by $57 billion, or 10.6 percent.The plan would cut by more than $72 billion the disability benefits upon which millions of Americans rely. It would eliminate loan programs that subsidize college education for the poor and those who take jobs in government or nonprofit organizations.Government spending would be cut substantially. See how every budget item would be changed.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers portrayed the steep reductions as necessary to balance the nation\u2019s budget while sparing taxpayers from shouldering the burden of programs that do not work well.\u201cThis is, I think, the first time in a long time that an administration has written a budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the taxes,\u201d said Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to measure our success by how much money we spend, but by how many people we actually help,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said as he outlined the proposal at the White House on Monday before its formal presentation on Tuesday to Congress.Among its innovations: Mr. Trump proposes saving $40 billion over a decade by barring undocumented immigrants from collecting the Child Tax Credit and adding additional measures to ensure they cannot collect the Earned Income Tax Credit. He has also requested $19 billion over 10 years for a new program, spearheaded by his daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump, to provide six weeks of paid leave to new parents. The budget also includes a broad prohibition against money for entities that provide abortions, including Planned Parenthood, blocking them from receiving any federal health fundingThe president\u2019s absence, which his aides dismissed as a mere coincidence of the calendar, seemed to highlight the haphazard way in which his White House has approached its dealings with Congress. It is just as much a sign of Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for the policy detail and message discipline that is required to marshal support to enact politically challenging changes.The Trump administration on Tuesday released its 2018 budget, called \u201cA New Foundation for American Greatness.\u201d\u201cIf the president is distancing himself from the budget, why on earth would Republicans rally around tough choices that would have to be made?\u201d said Robert L. Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that promotes deficit reduction. \u201cIf you want to make the political case for the budget \u2014 and the budget is ultimately a political document \u2014 you really need the president to do it. So, it does seem bizarre that the president is out of the country.\u201dThe president\u2019s annual budget \u2014 more a message document than a practical set of marching orders even in the best of times \u2014 routinely faces challenges on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers jealously guard their prerogative to control federal spending and shape government programs. But Mr. Trump\u2019s wish list, in particular, faces long odds, with Democrats uniformly opposed and Republicans already showing themselves to be squeamish about some of the president\u2019s plans.\u201cIt probably is the most conservative budget that we\u2019ve had under Republican or Democrat administrations in decades,\u201d said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.But in a signal that some proposed cuts to domestic programs are likely to face resistance even from conservatives, Mr. Meadows said he could not stomach the idea of doing away with food assistance for older Americans.\u201cMeals on Wheels, even for some of us who are considered to be fiscal hawks, may be a bridge too far,\u201d Mr. Meadows said.Republicans balked at Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for money for the border wall in negotiations over a spending package enacted last month. Many were deeply conflicted over voting for a health care overhaul measure that included the Medicaid cuts contained in the budget to be presented on Tuesday. Now the president is proposing still deeper reductions to the federal health program for the poor, as well as drastically scaling back a broad array of social safety net programs that are certain to be unpopular with lawmakers.\u201cThe politics of this make no sense to me whatsoever, in the sense that the population that brought them to the dance are the populists out there in the Midwest and South who rely on these programs that he\u2019s talking about reducing,\u201d said G. William Hoagland, a former senior Republican congressional budget aide. Referring to Representative Paul D. Ryan, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see how Speaker Ryan gets anywhere close to 218 votes in the House of Representatives if this is the model. It\u2019s an exercise in futility.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Monday that the Medicaid cuts would \u201ccarry a staggering human cost\u201d and violate Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to address the opioid epidemic.\u201cBased on what we know about this budget, the good news \u2014 the only good news \u2014 is that it was likely to be roundly rejected by members of both parties here in the Senate, just as the last budget was,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor.The budget itself avoids some of the tough choices that would be required to enact Mr. Trump\u2019s fiscal vision. The huge tax cut was presented but without any detail about its elements or cost. Mr. Mulvaney said the tax plan would not add to the deficit, implying that its cost would be made up with other changes, such as eliminating deductions.To balance the budget, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget relies on growth he argues will be generated from the as-yet-unformed tax cut.The blueprint also steers clear of changing Social Security\u2019s retirement program or Medicare, steps that Mr. Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman who has backed entitlement cuts, said he had tried to persuade Mr. Trump to consider.\u201cHe said, \u2018I promised people on the campaign trail I would not touch their retirement and I would not touch Medicare,\u2019 and we don\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cI honestly was surprised that we could balance the budget without changing those programs, but we managed to do that.\u201dBut budget experts argued that was little more than fiction, and the plan could never deliver the results it claims to.\u201cThe central inconsistency is promoting a massive tax cut and spending increases in some areas and leaving the major entitlement programs alone,\u201d Mr. Bixby said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an economist to know that that doesn\u2019t add up, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s a great deal of concern about the negative fiscal impact that this budget will have.\u201dWhile past presidents have often launched a road show with stops around the country to promote the components of their inaugural budgets, Mr. Trump is spending the rest of the week overseas, leaving his staff to explain his plan while Republicans prepare their own response.\u201cThis budget is dead before arrival, so he might as well be out of town,\u201d said David A. Stockman, a former budget director under President Ronald Reagan.Mr. Stockman said both political parties had grown comfortable with running large annual budget deficits. \u201cThere\u2019s not a snowball\u2019s chance that most of this deep deficit reduction will even be considered in a serious way.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about President Trump\u2019s budget proposals, using information from Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, misstated a proposal to bar undocumented immigrants from receiving certain tax credits. A Social Security number is already required to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit. The proposal would impose this requirement for the Child Tax Credit, and the Child and Dependent Care Credit is not affected. The article also referred incorrectly to one effect on Social Security. The budget proposes cutting Social Security disability benefits, not reducing retirement benefits.Binyamin Appelbaum and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Unmask Corruption in Ghana", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAt Kwame Nkrumah Circle in central Accra, people form long lines each morning as they wait to pile into rickety minivans that take them to work. The minivans have been retrofitted to seat about 14 people, nearly double their original capacity. Crammed together like sardines in the 90-degree heat, the passengers angle for a breath of fresh air as they prepare for the long ride through Accra\u2019s congested streets.These uncomfortable journeys are typical for most of Accra\u2019s two million residents. So when the government announced that it would introduce a rapid bus transit system in 2015, Ghanaians were relieved. But it quickly became clear to us that what was billed as a measure to ease public discomfort was really a get-rich-quick scheme to reward the friends of John Mahama, the president at the time.Talk of the scandal dominated radio and TV stations for weeks. Frustrated by what looked like yet another instance of corruption, I and members of the CitizenGhana Movement, an advocacy group that focuses on accountability and good governance, sued the government for copies of the contract documents. In a landmark ruling, Justice Anthony Yeboah, a High Court judge, granted our request and established a precedent for the right to information.While this was an important victory, it only addressed the symptoms. The underlying problem is an opaque campaign finance system that allows anonymous donors to spend large sums on political parties, with the expectation that they will be rewarded if the party wins.In Ghana, the political costs of corruption are clear. Outrage at the bus-branding episode and other scandals contributed to the defeat of the National Democratic Congress during the 2016 elections. The newly elected president, Nana Akufo-Addo, ran on an anticorruption platform with the slogan \u201cArise for Change.\u201d But in the few months since his inauguration, it has become clear that in fact, not much has changed.It is only a matter of time until the cycle of corruption gets worse. One way to forestall this is to lift the lid on the financing of political parties. To identify whom the government is likely to repay, we need to know whom it owes.But the Electoral Commission of Ghana, which is tasked with collating and publishing these records, has repeatedly failed to enforce the law. In response, the CitizenGhana Movement, the Right to Information Coalition and I will file a lawsuit this week to compel the Electoral Commission to release those records.If we are successful, this will open the door to greater transparency. But it\u2019s only the first step toward reform. At present, ministers and the president are required to declare their assets. But these forms are not available to the public, which complicates efforts to prevent potential conflicts of interest. The government should publish an open and searchable register of political donations and politicians\u2019 assets. That would make it easier to follow the money and ensure that the government benefits all Ghanaians and not narrow special interests.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Disgraced and Re-elected Connecticut Mayor Eyes the Statehouse", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byBut these days, Mr. Ganim is cheered as he steps onto the field during a Bridgeport Bluefish baseball game to throw the ceremonial first pitch. The cafe across the street from his office offers a \u201cJoe Ganim omelet\u201d (\u201clight and lean,\u201d with egg whites, spinach, turkey and low-fat mozzarella). And on a recent afternoon, he climbed into an excavator to claw through a brick wall, bringing attention to a development meant to serve as a visible sign of improvement in a long-struggling city.\u201cI have somewhat of a colorful past,\u201d Mr. Ganim, who is weighing a run for governor, said, \u201cwhich may or may not be acceptable to everybody all of the time.\u201dDespite all this, Mr. Ganim has been able to flourish, forging an undeniable connection with the city, where he maintained a deep reservoir of support, even after his conviction.A bid for statewide office, though, would be a far different story, forcing Mr. Ganim to step outside his comfort zone, to parts of Connecticut where voters may not be as forgiving.Connecticut is one of 13 states with some form of public financing for political campaigns, and Mr. Ganim has applied for funding despite a law barring financial support for candidates who have been convicted of felonies related to public office. On Wednesday, a state commission issued a preliminary decision denying Mr. Ganim\u2019s request, citing the rule excluding convicted felons from public funding.Mr. Ganim had said he was willing to wage a legal fight, calling the law unconstitutional. \u201cIt\u2019s just blatantly unfair to the process \u2014 forget about the candidate,\u201d he said.Connecticut has become reliably Democratic and its politics tend to divide along demographic lines, between its wealthy, mostly white suburbs and its poorer cities with large minority populations. Hartford, the capital, is trying to stave off bankruptcy.Mr. Ganim has not been shy about aligning himself with the cities. He said he would urge the state to \u201cput our cities in a position to be the engines, to drive a better economy for all cities and towns for the state, or we\u2019re not going to get there.\u201dMr. Ganim, 57, was first elected mayor in 1991 as a 32-year-old newcomer to public office. His work to revitalize the city and help pull it back from the brink of bankruptcy attracted the attention of state Democratic Party leaders. In 1994, he mounted an unsuccessful campaign for governor.In 2015, he returned to the political stage with rallies blaring \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d and momentum fueled in part by the support of the city\u2019s police union and one of the F.B.I. agents involved in the investigation that sent him to prison. (The agent, Edward Adams, now works for the city.)Mr. Ganim has focused as mayor on trying to revive blighted or dormant spaces in the city. He operated the excavator at a development site in the city\u2019s East End that would contain a public library, housing and retail spaces, including a grocery store.Quality-of-life projects like this one have won over some in the city, including James Holloway, a city councilman who represents the area where the development is planned. He does not want Mr. Ganim to run for governor.\u201cWhen he first came in, he was dynamite,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cHe\u2019s only been here for a year and a half. If he stays a little longer, he will do better \u2014 I think so. If he wants to run, that\u2019s going to take away from him doing better for the city of Bridgeport.\u201dJohn Marshall Lee, an insurance agent and longtime Bridgeport resident who is active in community organizations, also voiced reservations about Mr. Ganim\u2019s bid for higher office, but for very different reasons. He contends that Mr. Ganim has fallen short on his pledges to make city government more transparent and accountable, and that the mayor lacks vision.\u201cThe man has no priorities,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf someone says they have priorities you can measure them on what they\u2019ve attempted to do. If they don\u2019t have priorities, how can you give them a report card?\u201dMr. Ganim has bolstered efforts aimed at helping formerly incarcerated people reintegrate into society, a pressing issue in the city but also one that political observers said he embraced reluctantly and out of political expedience. Last year, he announced the creation of an initiative to support the 1,000 men and women who return to Bridgeport each year from prison \u2014 joining about 10,000 others already in the city \u2014 in finding employment and gaining access to mental heath, education and housing services.Louis L. Reed, the program\u2019s director, said he believed Mr. Ganim\u2019s time in prison was a transformative experience.\u201cYou think about being in a 6-by-9 cell,\u201d said Mr. Reed, a Bridgeport native who said he spent 13 \u00bd years in prison. \u201cThink about what that\u2019s going to do to you spiritually. Think about what it\u2019s going to do to you mentally. It\u2019s going to fundamentally change you, for either the better or the worse.\u201d\u201cThat was his moment of clarity,\u201d Mr. Reed added, referring to the mayor. \u201cIt put him back on the road to redemption.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Rollbacks at Scott Pruitt\u2019s E.P.A. Are a Boon to Oil and Gas", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byTrump RulesFREMONT COUNTY, Wyo. \u2014 In a gas field here in Wyoming\u2019s struggling energy corridor, nearly 2,000 miles from Washington, the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory reversal is crowning an early champion.Devon\u2019s pushback, coming amid an effort to ease a broad array of federal environmental rules, is the first known example under the Trump administration of an accused polluter \u2014 which has admitted violating the law \u2014 backing away from a proposed environmental settlement. It is already being hailed by other independent energy companies as a template for the future.\u201cNot in our wildest dreams, never did we expect to get everything,\u201d said Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance, a Denver-based association of independent oil and gas companies. \u201cWe were kind of used to getting punished.\u201dThe extraordinary about-face reflects the onset of an experiment in President Trump\u2019s Washington that is meant to fundamentally reorder the relationship between government and business. Across the federal government, lobbyists and lawyers who once battled regulations on behalf of business are now helping run the agencies they clashed with.Mr. Trump and his team believe that loosening the regulatory grip on business will help the economy, create jobs and allow Americans \u201cto share in the riches,\u201d as he said during the campaign. But in the energy field, environmentalists, Democrats and even some in the industry fear the efforts will backfire, harming health and safety without creating much economic benefit.The E.P.A. has not yet made a public response to Devon\u2019s new posture, and Mr. Pruitt declined to comment for this article. But the new approach follows a series of important victories for the energy industry in Washington that could reshape environmental policy on a national scale and undermine the Obama administration\u2019s campaign to combat climate change.In just the last three months, with Mr. Pruitt in charge, the E.P.A. postponed a long-planned rule requiring companies like Devon to retrofit drilling equipment to prevent leaks of methane gas \u2014 a major contributor to climate change \u2014 and to collect more data on how much of the gas is spewing into the air.The Interior Department, meanwhile, announced this month that it would reconsider a separate rule limiting the burning of unwanted methane gas from wells drilled on federal and Indian lands, a process called flaring. That announcement came the same day the Senate narrowly rejected industry calls to repeal the same rule.Interior officials have also announced their intention to repeal or revise a contentious rule requiring companies like Devon to take extra steps to prevent groundwater contamination caused by hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, a drilling technique in which chemicals and water are forced into rock formations.Environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund are outraged by these moves, and have vowed to fight any rollbacks in court.\u201dDevon is doing to the oil and gas industry what Donald Trump did to the Republican Party, pushing the whole agenda into a world of extremes,\u201d said Mark Brownstein, a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund.Devon and Mr. Pruitt, while he was still attorney general out West, teamed up to block new federal rules imposed by the Obama administration that required fossil fuel companies to more closely monitor oil and gas wells for leaks, and disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracking. Devon also poured millions of dollars a year into lobbying \u2014 and hundreds of thousands into campaign contributions to Mr. Pruitt and other Republicans \u2014 as it pushed regulators and lawmakers in Washington to do away with the restrictions.For Devon and its industry allies, the turnaround is as startling as it is long-sought.\u201cWe are so used to not being able to move an agenda forward that it has been very surprising how quickly things have changed,\u201d Ms. Sgamma said.In Riverton, Wyo., a frontier city of dusty roads and squat brick buildings a half-hour drive from where Devon operates its gas field, a fossil fuel revival could not come quickly enough.Well-paying jobs in oil and gas \u2014 drilling wells, managing roustabouts \u2014 are fast disappearing, as production in the state declines because of a slump in energy prices. Government agencies are bracing for cuts to basic services, including children\u2019s health programs and security at the county jail, because of declining tax revenues from fossil fuel companies.\u201cAt the end of the day, we all just want to make sure we can prosper and raise our families,\u201d said Holly Jibben, a local councilwoman, a former rig worker and a mother. \u201cWhen oil and gas profits, everybody profits.\u201dThe invitation to lunch at the towering new Devon Energy Center in downtown Oklahoma City came to Mr. Pruitt in June 2012 \u2014 18 months into his tenure as Oklahoma\u2019s top law enforcement official \u2014 from Larry Nichols, a co-founder of what had become the city\u2019s biggest independent oil and gas company.Mr. Nichols and his father, John, had created Devon in 1971, starting with four employees and a negative net worth of several million dollars, while sharing a receptionist at an office building not far from their new tower, an early company history says.Now, there was no denying Devon had reached extraordinary heights.That\u2019s where Mr. Pruitt came in.\u201cWe\u2019ll meet Scott in the lobby when he checks in at our concierge desk,\u201d William F. Whitsitt, then the head of Devon\u2019s fast-growing public relations and lobbying operations, wrote in an email to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s executive assistant.Mr. Pruitt, a folksy, deeply religious former state legislator and minor-league baseball team general partner who was largely unknown on the national political stage, had won an upset victory in 2010. He had vowed to challenge Washington\u2019s intervention in Oklahoma\u2019s affairs.\u201cThere\u2019s a mentality emanating from Washington today that says, \u2018We know best,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pruitt said during the campaign, which was supported by a donation from Mr. Nichols, as well as Devon\u2019s political action committee. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-size-fits-all strategy, a command-and-control kind of approach, and we\u2019ve got to make sure we know how to respond to that.\u201dDevon initially participated in a voluntary program to capture leaking methane, or close off leaks, but was so suspicious of the Obama administration\u2019s intentions that it dropped out.Devon, furious, turned to Mr. Pruitt for help in pushing back.\u201cJust a note to pass along the electronic version of the draft letter to Lisa Jackson at E.P.A.,\u201d said one early request for help in 2011 from Devon to Mr. Pruitt. Devon suggested that Mr. Pruitt follow up with Mr. Ferate, the company\u2019s Washington lobbyist and a fund-raiser for Republican causes, if he had questions.The interventions by Devon also targeted the Interior Department and its Bureau of Land Management, which controls 260 million acres of public land and leases out large chunks to oil and gas companies for drilling, including the land here in Fremont County.The bureau was pushing ahead with plans to require that Devon and other companies take extra steps to prevent chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing from contaminating groundwater, including a demand that Devon disclose the ingredients in millions of gallons of chemical-laced water it pumped into the federally managed land.Devon has a total of about 1,500 wells on bureau-controlled land, representing about 15 percent of its oil and gas production.Devon and Mr. Pruitt called the rules redundant in letters to federal officials, including the secretary of the Interior and Mr. Obama, while they also worked to challenge them in court and in Congress.Each of the pieces of this campaign fell into place as planned. But Mr. Obama and his aides were hardly about to fold.\u201cEvery day this was not attended to was a day we got closer to the tipping point \u2014 when it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the kind of climate change damage we are worried about,\u201d said Janet McCabe, who led the air pollution enforcement division at the E.P.A. under Mr. Obama.Devon Energy, Ms. McCabe said, was among the most determined opponents of the agency\u2019s work, far more so, for example, than international giants like Shell.\u201cIn any regulated industry, there are companies that are more aggressive than others in pushing back at every turn and trying to stop the policy,\u201d she said. \u201cDevon was one of those.\u201dBut production from the area\u2019s wells had slowed over recent decades, and Devon, known for its emphasis on new technologies, had a solution: It would inject carbon dioxide into the ground, putting pressure on underground oil deposits and pushing them to the pump.The roaring minerals economy filled state coffers with billion-dollar annual surpluses and brought jobs that kept the unemployment rate for much of that decade below the national average.\u201cIt was gangbusters,\u201d said Mr. Baker, a former weed and pest control man, who points out the oil and gas rigs as fondly as he does the local flora and fauna, like the Indian paintbrush plant that was just starting to show its red flowers.Mr. Baker is not alone. In Riverton, a city of 11,000, the fading road signs \u2014 Gas Hills, Oil Field Road \u2014 underline the importance of fossil fuels. Local officials talk of companies like Devon as good corporate citizens.For the last six Thanksgivings, Devon has helped a local group give food baskets to the needy. For years, the company has also donated to youth educational programs at local state parks.But even as production was rising, tensions were brewing with Washington. The Obama administration had made cracking down on fugitive emissions from oil and gas sites a national priority.By 2014, Devon stood accused by the E.P.A. of releasing 80 more tons a year of the harmful gases from its Beaver Creek plant in Wyoming than its permit allowed. The extra emissions amounted to a fifth more than the company\u2019s stated emissions of 361 tons in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available.This class of chemicals \u2014 known as volatile organic compounds \u2014 is extremely potent and is blamed for helping create blankets of smog. Several of the chemicals are known carcinogens.\u201cYou can smell it in the air,\u201d said John Fenton, a former Devon contract worker turned environmentalist who monitors oil and gas facilities scattered across Fremont County using an infrared camera.At Devon, Mr. Fenton repaired heating equipment and did general maintenance jobs. He later worked elsewhere in the gas fields welding pipes for as much as $50 an hour. But he stopped when wells started cropping up close to residential areas, including about 200 feet from his Fremont County ranch. His neighbors\u2019 water turned black. His wife, Catherine, complained of losing her senses of smell and taste.\u201cThese companies are emboldened by this remoteness to not do anything,\u201d he said.But Mr. Fenton\u2019s concerns have not gained wider traction. Residents fret mostly about the crackdown on energy companies under Mr. Obama, which coincided with a downturn in oil and gas production brought on largely by a glut in the market and lower energy prices. That has made his tough approach a scapegoat for the downturn, and it is difficult to overstate the animosity toward federal environmental agencies.\u201cThe E.P.A. is the evil empire here,\u201d said Steven R. Peck, publisher of The Ranger, Fremont County\u2019s daily newspaper. \u201cBut the regulatory game hasn\u2019t changed as much as the oil and gas industry itself,\u201d he said.\u201cPeople think, \u2018If we could just drill more wells a year,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cbut we also need clean energy and jobs.\u201d\u201cEverything\u2019s gone down, down,\u201d said Frenchie Warren, 59, a member of the Arapaho tribe, who sat killing time one recent afternoon on a bench next to a Shell gas station.Mr. Warren lost his $23-an-hour job at the SST Energy Corporation earlier this year after he mangled his hand in a chain, he said. He is bitter toward Washington politicians, who he said were squeezing the life out of Riverton.\u201cThey aren\u2019t helping us,\u201d Mr. Warren said. \u201cIf I had a gun, I\u2019d shoot them.\u201dMr. Pruitt, who a few days earlier had been confirmed as the new E.P.A. administrator, stood on the stage and tried to calm the nerves of the agency\u2019s staff in the room, as well as thousands more watching remotely.\u201cYou don\u2019t know me very well,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said. \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t know me hardly at all other than maybe what you\u2019ve read in the newspaper and seen on the news. \u2026 I look forward to sharing the rest of the story with you as we spend time together.\u201dBut it quickly became clear that a new day had arrived at the E.P.A. as Mr. Pruitt offered a hint of his priorities at the agency. \u201cI believe that we as an agency and we as a nation can be both pro-energy and -jobs, and pro-environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat we don\u2019t have to choose between the two.\u201dWithin weeks, the dismantling of the Obama-era rules was set in motion, first through broad proclamations from the White House as Mr. Trump signed executive orders, and later through specific administrative actions by Mr. Pruitt.In April, Mr. Pruitt notified the oil and gas industry that he was granting its wish to at least temporarily suspend the agency\u2019s new rule. \u201cAmerican businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized,\u201d he said in a statement then.Devon Energy was poised to be a major beneficiary of the changes.Killing the methane rule would save Devon an estimated $430,000 a year in the four states where it operates wells, according to an analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund, although if industry estimates of the actual costs are accurate, the savings may be much higher.Devon has other allies on the Trump team.Devon Energy of Oklahoma City has long been one of the more aggressive opponents in the oil and gas sector of new federal environmental regulations, working since early in the Obama administration to challenge such rules. Now it is seeing the benefits of this effort, with Scott Pruitt's rise as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.Some Democrats in Congress have questioned whether Mr. Pruitt is taking actions explicitly to benefit Devon and other financial supporters.In a letter last month, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and three other Senate Democrats pressed Mr. Pruitt to explain why he canceled the data-collection effort on methane \u2014 suggesting it might be a favor to industry friends.Oil and gas companies are hoping that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s business-friendly approach will extended to enforcement issues. Devon was first targeted by the E.P.A. in 2014, after it was accused of illegally discharging 80 tons a year of volatile organic compounds into the Wyoming air. The company had been close to reaching a settlement with the federal government.But two days after that disclosure, Mr. Pruitt was confirmed as E.P.A. administrator, and by the next week, Devon was changing its tune.Instead of the proposed leak-detection system, the company was now planning to replace an older gas-fired compressor with an electrically powered unit, reducing volatile organic compound emissions by about 5 tons a year. Devon also says that, after revisiting aspects of the case, it now \u201cdoes not believe that a six-figure civil penalty is justified.\u201dTim Hartley, a Devon spokesman, acknowledged that the company had laid out a shift in its negotiating position. But he attributed the change to \u201csimple economics.\u201dThe plant, he said, was marginal and had been considered for shutdown, and adopting a sophisticated leak-detection program there was not economically feasible, especially at a difficult time for the oil and gas industry. Devon\u2019s stock surged after Mr. Trump won the election, but has since dipped as oil prices have remained depressed.The cost of the leak-detection program would amount to about 20 percent of the plant\u2019s annual operating budget, the company said in its letter.Mr. Hartley said that the violations stemmed from a misinterpretation of complicated regulations and that Devon had not intentionally circumvented the rules. He said that Devon had not contacted Mr. Pruitt about the case.The E.P.A. has not yet made public the investigation, or its decision on a settlement. Andrew Mutter, a spokesman for the agency\u2019s Colorado regional office, which covers Wyoming, said that talks on the matter remained active. The Justice Department attorney in charge of the case did not return requests for comment.Mr. Hartley declined to comment on the effects for Devon of the wider regulatory rollback, saying it would be \u201cpure speculation\u201d to consider how the company might benefit.But Ms. Sgamma, the president of the Western Energy Alliance, which includes Devon, said that Devon is among several independent oil and gas companies now taking a tougher stand with the E.P.A.\u201cI am not going to settle with you now, when this new administration has such a different philosophy,\u201d she said, explaining the new approach. \u201cIt makes sense to do a wait-and-see.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified James Lankford as a senator of Utah. He is a senator of Oklahoma.Hiroko Tabuchi reported from Wyoming, and Eric Lipton from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Digital Insecurity Is the New Normal", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsThis \u201cback to analog\u201d moment isn\u2019t just a knee-jerk, stopgap reaction to a short-term problem. It\u2019s a rational response to our increasingly insecure internet, and we are going to see more of it ahead.The surprise is not that the frequency of such attacks is accelerating; it\u2019s that it took so long. There are at least three reasons for this acceleration. First, the internet has a fundamentally insecure infrastructure that was initially made for interoperability among a small number of trusted parties, but is now being used by billions who do not know and should not trust one another.The second reason is that increasingly inventive criminals have become today\u2019s most ambitious internet entrepreneurs. Their work has been made easier by the theft of powerful hacking tools created by and for state security agencies but now available for sale.Third is the commercial innovation imperative. Consumer demand for digital devices and services keeps pushing companies to the limits of what is technically possible, and then pressing them to go even a little bit further, where security often becomes nice to have but not a necessity.So what would it mean if we crossed the threshold to digital insecurity? One possibility is that some things we now take for granted \u2014 from banking online to electronic medical records \u2014 will shift from being seen as common sense to being viewed as scary, dangerous, even reckless.We know what it looks like when expectations of security in physical environments degrade: People put triple locks on their doors, retreat into gated communities, look over their shoulder as they walk down the street. In our scenario, we\u2019ve imagined the digital equivalent. Will you soon be asked to place your phone and laptop in a locker before you are allowed to enter an office building or a friend\u2019s home? Will you tell your colleagues to call you before they send you an email with an attachment?A society and economy that moves in this direction would be different from the one we have today, and very different from what Silicon Valley is looking to build. Security needs to be made a priority at least as great as innovation right now. We recognize that the consequences of prioritizing security are not all good, and the slowing or reversal of digitization will be a significant headwind for the United States economy even more than for other countries, at a time and in a political environment that really can\u2019t afford such a setback. But there is no other viable choice. You can\u2019t fix a broken foundation by simply building more stories atop the house that rests on it.The world spends a lot of time right now thinking and dreaming about how life will be digitized, mostly for the better. We don\u2019t yet have a word for even a partial \u201creturn to analog,\u201d but we will have to start looking for one at the same time as we work to create a much more secure internet.Steven Weber is a professor at the School of Information and faculty director of the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkeley, where Betsy Cooper is the executive director.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China and India Make Big Strides on Climate Change", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byEditorialUntil recently, China and India have been cast as obstacles, at the very least reluctant conscripts, in the battle against climate change. That reputation looks very much out-of-date now that both countries have greatly accelerated their investments in cost-effective renewable energy sources \u2014 and reduced their reliance on fossil fuels. It\u2019s America \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s America \u2014 that now looks like the laggard.There is also a lesson here for the United States. Piece by piece, agency by agency, the Trump administration seems determined to destroy or undermine every initiative on which President Obama based his pledge in Paris to substantially reduce America\u2019s greenhouse gases: his plan to close old, coal-fired power plants, his proposals to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas wells, his mandates for more fuel-efficient vehicles. The excuse given in every case is that these rules would cost jobs and damage the economy \u2014 the same bogus argument once used by Vice President Dick Cheney to persuade President George W. Bush to renege on his campaign promise to combat global warming.China and India\u2019s enthusiasm for cleaner energy arises in part from a wish to reduce the terrible air pollution that afflicts cities like Beijing and New Delhi; any move away from coal would make a big difference in public health. Investments in cutting-edge energy and transportation technologies would also bolster the economy as a whole.There are, of course, formidable challenges, not least developing batteries to store the excess electricity generated by solar farms on sunny days and wind farms on windy days. And there are emissions from industry and agriculture to worry about. Still, Beijing and New Delhi \u2014 not, embarrassingly enough, Washington \u2014 are showing the way forward.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Promises of Peace in Colombia", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 At the start of each school year, Colombian schoolchildren are still given specially prepared instruction manuals in the form of comic books to teach them how to avoid stepping on land mines. Despite these efforts, during 52 years of war, more than 1,000 Colombian children, usually from the poorest of our farming families working their fields, were killed or maimed by land mines.I ran for president of Colombia to lead a nation where the books we give Colombia\u2019s schoolchildren teach reading, science, math and poetry, not warnings against stepping on explosives. Today \u2013 having signed a historic peace agreement between my government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, on Nov. 24 \u2013 we are building a peaceful Colombia.In more than 203 Colombian municipalities, the dangerous work of locating, disabling and removing Colombia\u2019s land mines is being carried out by NGOs, specially trained units of the Colombian armed forces and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Our goal is to make Colombia land-mine free by 2021.Last year, we saw the lowest level of violence in our country in more than 40 years. FARC guerillas are turning their arms over to United Nations supervisors. But the agreement does more than silence weapons; it delivers a welcome end to conflict for Colombians, a majority of whom have never lived in a country at peace.The agreement sets out to bridge the historic divide between the Colombia of developed urban centers and that of the vast, impoverished interior, where historically there has been little or no government presence and, as a result, limited security, weak rule of law and deficient health care and education.To close this gap, my government has committed itself to a far-reaching program of rural development for the largely low-income population, including land, titles, credit, roads and crop substitution programs.The transition to peace demands a great amount of time, resources and leadership in Colombia \u2014 as well as the continued assistance of the United States and the international community. United States support through Peace Colombia \u2014 a new initiative that will deepen our partnership and reinforce security gains we have achieved together \u2014 is more important now than ever. I had the opportunity to meet with President Trump at the White House on Thursday, and we had a productive conversation about working together to strengthen our strategic alliance in ways that benefit Americans and Colombians.One of the most challenging aspects of the long negotiations was to balance the demands of justice with the demands of peace. Until the agreement, peace settlements in Latin America routinely included blanket amnesty for both guerillas and state actors.The Colombian agreement ends that impunity. Those who fail to confess to war crimes, atrocities or other serious violations of humanitarian law, such as kidnapping, face up to 20 years in prison. Those who confess their crimes and sever themselves from all criminal activities face sentences of up to eight years of \u201ceffective restrictions on liberty\u201d and reparations, such as removing land mines, that are deemed acceptable by their victims.The war cost 225,000 Colombian lives and drove eight million Colombians from their homes. Translated into United States population terms, that would be 1.5 million American lives lost and 30 million citizens driven from their homes. American assistance, training and hardware under Plan Colombia, the military and diplomatic initiative to combat drug cartels and left-wing insurgency and stabilize the country, which began in 2000, helped our nation successfully defend our democracy. Plan Colombia was sustained through multiple administrations and Congresses with enduring bipartisan support. Our victory is a United States foreign policy victory as well.Today, Colombia and the United States, are focused on consolidating the gains and promises of the peace. One of our most important commitments to the United States is to counter narcotics. Some farmers who anticipated significant resources under the peace agreement significantly ramped up production of coca leaf in recent years. Although seizures of illicit drugs have been at record highs these past several years, we are committed to working with the Trump administration to stop and reverse this increase in production.Colombia and the United States are also working together to help Mexico and the \u201cnorthern triangle\u201d of Central America \u2014 Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador \u2014 combat the drug cartel violence that is fueling refugee flows. And we are joined with the United States and other democratic nations to defend democratic values in our hemisphere.My country is far better off today than it was seven years ago. As we strived for peace, we strengthened our economy. We dramatically reduced poverty. Peace in Colombia will only further those gains and will usher in a new era of cooperation with the United States. Colombia is now better prepared to confront the challenges of the future and benefit from its opportunities, and to be an even stronger ally and partner to the United States.Juan Manuel Santos is the president of Colombia.Advertisement"}

The show was produced with the Atlanta Opera and will travel to that city\u2019s Botanical Garden later this month.Mozart\u2019s early opera (he wrote it when he was 18) was subjected to some energetic pruning for the occasion, and a good thing, too. This comedy about concealed identities, madness and mismatched couples contains some lovely arias and ensembles, but also reams of workmanlike recitative. Here, it was trimmed to 90 minutes and the score adapted for wind ensemble (and double bass), creating a more compact sound that carried well out of doors. On Thursday, this arrangement was entrusted to the period-instrument ensemble Grand Harmonie, which, led by Geoffrey McDonald, played it with grace and verve.The story involves three couples with convoluted back stories. The title character is Lady Violet, who poses as a garden girl while putting some distance between herself and her hotheaded lover, Count Belfiore. The On Site Opera version scrubbed out the more disturbing elements of the original, including a stabbing incident that is blithely forgiven, in favor of sharpening the work\u2019s comic thrust.After a few creaky horticultural puns early on \u2014 \u201cI was quite a rake in my time\u201d \u2014 Kelley Rourke\u2019s English adaptation found its flow, and the excellent cast of seven young singers seemed liberated by the brief passages of dialogue that took the place of Mozart\u2019s recitatives. Economy of gesture and wit were also the motto of Eric Einhorn\u2019s stage direction, which had singers moving freely about the garden, and which made inventive use of a pair of pruning shears and a hose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hollywood Writers and Studios, Scrambling to Avert Strike, Reach Last-Minute Deal", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood writers reached a tentative deal for a new three-year contract with television and movie studios early Tuesday, averting a strike in dramatic overtime negotiations.At nearly 1 a.m. on the West Coast, weary union leaders, including Patric Verrone, the former president of the Writers Guild of America, West, emerged from the offices of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, and said that a favorable contract had been drawn up.In a statement posted on its website, the Writers Guild, West, said it had made \u201cunprecedented gains.\u201d It added, \u201cDid we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild\u2019s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept.\u201dIn a one-sentence joint statement, writers and the producers\u2019 alliance said that they had secured \u201ca tentative agreement on terms for a new three-year collective bargaining agreement.\u201dThe previous contract between studios and more than 12,000 writers expired at midnight. The Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, had vowed to go on strike as soon as Tuesday morning.Union negotiators had locked horns with their studio counterparts all the way through. On Sunday, studios had made a new offer \u2014 one reflecting improvements in some areas (health care) and scant movement in others (raises for streaming series) \u2014 and the unions on Monday made counteroffers that held a hard line on multiple demands, according to three people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings.A deal only started to take shape as midnight approached, with both sides scrambling to find common ground.Writers and studios did not see eye to eye on several issues involving technology. Most prominently, writers wanted pay rates for shows that run on streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime to be more like those for blue-chip broadcast network series. The unions also wanted members to receive bigger residual payments for online reruns of old shows and movies.Another sticking point involved what is known as \u201cspan,\u201d or how long TV writers spend on each script. There are more shows than ever, but networks are ordering many fewer episodes per season \u2014 as few as six, compared with 22 or more in the past. At the same time, the episodes that are ordered are taking longer to produce \u2014 up to three weeks per episode, rather than the usual two. So series writers who are paid per episode are often making less while working more.Under proposals discussed Monday, according to analysts at Moody\u2019s, higher compensation for writers would cost some entertainment companies $100 million to $125 million annually for each year of a new three-year contract. Unions representing directors and actors \u201cwill likely key off any agreement\u201d with writers, adding to cost increases.The actors\u2019 contract with studios expires on June 30.As the entertainment capital waited for word on talks on Monday, union members, including one involved with talks, posted messages on Twitter using the hashtag #wgaunity. Eileen Conn, whose credits include the Disney Channel series \u201cK.C. Undercover\u201d and the 1990s sitcom \u201cJust Shoot Me,\u201d posted a photo of Sally Field as the title character from the film \u201cNorma Rae\u201d and wrote: \u201cWe are strong! We are united!\u201dSome prominent politicians joined them. \u201cI stand with the Writers Guild of America for fair pay and decent health care because it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2014 and because Bruce and I can\u2019t wait for the next season of \u2018Ballers\u2019 to start,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Facebook, referring to her husband, Bruce Mann.In the last big Hollywood strike, a decade ago, an enraged Writers Guild walked out for 100 days over pay for digitally distributed shows. Tens of thousands of entertainment workers were idled, and the action cost the Los Angeles economy more than $2 billion, according to the Milken Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady but Voices Confidence in Economy", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A few pieces of disappointing economic news in recent weeks have not shaken the Federal Reserve\u2019s confidence that the economy is in good health.The Fed, as expected, did not raise rates on Wednesday after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. But it remains likely to raise rates in the coming months.The government estimates that the economy grew at an annual pace of just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, and prices continue to rise more slowly than Fed officials would prefer.But the Fed, in a statement issued Wednesday after the meeting of its committee, said the economy\u2019s engine was still looking good, even if the car was moving a little slowly.Consumer spending, the bulk of economic activity, slowed in recent months, but the Fed\u2019s statement said \u201cthe fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remain solid.\u201dSo, too, for the broader economy. The Fed did not explain why it thought growth had slowed in the first quarter but said it continued to expect the economy would expand at a moderate pace.The statement was backed by a unanimous vote of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee.Internal debates have been subdued in recent months; most Fed officials are in broad agreement on the economic outlook and the proper course of monetary policy.The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in December and again in March. Many investors are anticipating another rate increase at the committee\u2019s meeting in June.The steady decline of unemployment is the primary reason the Fed is on the move. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent in March, the lowest level since 2007. (The government is set to release the April jobs report on Friday.)Most Fed officials have concluded that unemployment has returned to a normal level, and continued job growth will put upward pressure on inflation. But the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate remains at a level that supports growth by encouraging borrowing and risk taking.Accordingly, the Fed wants to raise interest rates by the end of the year to a level that does not encourage or discourage growth.Fed officials have also discussed the details and timing of ending a related stimulus program, the Fed\u2019s vast investments in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed has indicated it could begin to reduce those holdings by the end of the year.There are, however, some reasons for hesitation. Despite the Fed\u2019s fears of future inflation, actual inflation remains stubbornly sluggish. The Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of price pressures, the Commerce Department\u2019s index of personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in March. The Fed would like prices to rise at an annual pace of 2 percent.The Fed is less concerned about the slow pace of economic growth in the first quarter, perhaps because there is evidence the government has systematically underestimated first-quarter growth in recent years. Growth over the last 12 months has remained around 2 percent, the mediocre but steady pace the economy has maintained in recent years.Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said recently that the combination of rapid job growth and slow economic growth was \u201ca big problem.\u201d The slow growth appears to reflect the slow pace of improvement in the productivity of the average American worker.That, however, is a problem the Fed cannot solve by holding down rates.The Fed\u2019s statement made little impression on financial markets. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 0.13 percent on the day, closing at 2,388.13. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 2.32 percent, from 2.29 percent. Investors also modestly increased their assessment of the chances that the Fed will raise rates in June \u2014 to 70 percent, from about 67 percent.Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, noted the Fed\u2019s steady optimism, saying: \u201cThe postmeeting statement acknowledged the recent disappointments in growth and inflation but chose to view those developments in a favorable light. This glass-half-full statement leaves the door wide open to a June hike, provided, of course, that the recent data letdowns are indeed transitory.\u201dMichael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said the Fed\u2019s confidence in the face of disappointment was a recent shift.\u201cIn the past, a soft patch in the data or a shift in market sentiment caused the Fed to alter course,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe new Fed seems driven to lead and, at least for the moment, to be determined to follow its chosen path.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Macron\u2019s Next Challenge: Governing", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe next key to Mr. Macron\u2019s improbable quest lies in the parliamentary elections to be held in two rounds on June 11 and 18. The movement Mr. Macron launched 13 months ago, En Marche! (On the Move!), recently recast as a political party called La R\u00e9publique en Marche!, has yet to elect a single deputy to the 577-seat National Assembly. Nonetheless, the party intends to run candidates in almost every district, counting on at least some defections from mainstream parties of left and right.Polls suggest that La R\u00e9publique en Marche! could do well, but what that means concretely fades rapidly into the unknown. French presidents past have usually ushered a majority into the National Assembly, and even a strong minority would empower Mr. Macron\u2019s party to form effective alliances. But if the center-right Republican party, say, wins a majority \u2014 and it is campaigning hard \u2014 it would install its own prime minister and cabinet, imposing its own agenda on the president. Mr. Macron\u2019s choice for prime minister, Edouard Philippe, was no doubt made in part with the notion of luring Republicans over. Mr. Philippe, 46, is a Republican defector and one-time top lieutenant to Alain Jupp\u00e9, a former prime minister who came in second in his party\u2019s primary last year.Mr. Macron cannot afford delay or political uncertainty. All three of Mr. Macron\u2019s predecessors promised to reform France\u2019s antiquated welfare-state model and bloated civil-service sector, but all backed down before waves of national strikes and street protests. Mr. Macron has argued that labor reforms, lower corporate taxes, reduced public spending and a deep reduction of the civil service are essential to stoke the economy and persuade employers to hire more young workers \u2014 a major priority, with a fifth of people under 25 unemployed. But Mr. Macron needs to strike quickly, drawing on the momentum of his election and the novelty of his movement.Mr. Macron\u2019s meteoric rise affirms both centrist moderation over the fear-mongering of populists and nationalists, and the need to undo France\u2019s economic and political sclerosis. In effect, the cabinet he announced is the launch of his next campaign: You voted for me and my promises, he is saying to France, now give me the tools I need.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drama in Washington Rattles Wall Street, and Stocks Dive", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byConfidence in President Trump\u2019s agenda to stoke economic growth was questioned Wednesday, as stocks tumbled and the dollar weakened.The sell-off was startling because it followed months of a steadily climbing, tranquil stock market, a rally that came to be known as the Trump bump. And domestic employment and corporate profits have been strong, usually a boon for stocks.Yet investors, who have shrugged off previous turmoil in the Trump administration, were clearly rattled by the most recent episode. Some on Wall Street speculated about whether the White House\u2019s pro-business pledges to cut taxes, lighten regulation and increase infrastructure would be thwarted by the growing tumult in Washington. Some bank analysts even discussed the probability of impeachment.And at a gathering of big money managers in Las Vegas, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said he was worried about the stability of Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201cI think it\u2019s a reasonable concern, obviously,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. He later added that after years of a strong economy, statistically speaking, it was time for a slowdown.\u201cOver the next four years,\u201d he told an audience of hundreds of investors, \u201cthere is a pretty good chance we\u2019ll have a downturn.\u201dThe question is whether it began on Wednesday.Investors flocked to markets considered safer in times of political risk. The price of gold rose nearly 2 percent, while Treasury securities rallied. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for many interest rates, fell to 2.22 percent from 2.33 percent on Tuesday. (Yields and prices move in the opposite direction.)But the revelations on Tuesday that a memo written by Mr. Comey detailed a plea by Mr. Trump to shut down a federal investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over his ties to Russia, seemed to be more than investors could stomach.\u201cThis piece of news, the market appears to be acting differently towards,\u201d said Curtis Schenker, co-founder of Scoggin Capital Management. \u201cFor the first time, there is real concern that Trump has overstepped his boundaries, which may create some chaos in the market.\u201dThe political risk has existed for months, with Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative Twitter posts drawing scrutiny. Questions have been raised about links to Russia in his campaign team and administration, and the White House has fumbled its legislative agenda.Yet throughout the president\u2019s first months in office, stock investors focused not on the questions and the missteps, but on the pro-business policies he had promised.These included health care changes that would save the government money, paving the way for lower taxes, and help private insurers. One important pledge has been lighter regulation to help banks redeploy their capital and speed infrastructure projects. Perhaps the most anticipated change is a tax overhaul that would lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, helping big corporations and small businesses alike.\u201cEquities had been rallying for a long time, without much of a pause,\u201d Stephen Jen, a London-based hedge fund manager, wrote by email Wednesday. \u201cTo the extent that the political noises in the U.S. further reduce the prospect of market-boosting measures such as tax cuts,\u201d he added, \u201ca correction in the risk assets,\u201d in this case, stocks, \u201cmakes sense.\u201dWednesday\u2019s rout was so unexpected that, even with stock futures sagging early, few research notes analyzing the implications of the Comey news were written.Traders said on Wednesday morning that concerns about the Comey memo could easily blow over, as other recent indications of presidential dysfunction had. But by midmorning, that confidence appeared to be fading.In Las Vegas, where investors had gathered for the annual SALT hedge fund conference, participants spent the early morning catching up on the news from overnight. Outside a ballroom at the Bellagio Hotel, where the meeting was being held, some people hovered near a television screen tracking the S.&P. 500.In his remarks, Mr. Bernanke described Mr. Trump as a \u201cvery unprecedented, unusual person\u201d with no government background who would have a harder time pushing through tax reforms and infrastructure changes because of his low approval ratings.Analysts at Japan\u2019s Nomura bank wrote that, while \u201cimpeachment still seems a distant prospect,\u201d the \u201cnegative impacts that the latest developments have on Trump\u2019s ability to pursue his policy agenda could be more important for markets.\u201dStill, not every investor was unnerved. With the United States job market robust, the prospect of improving growth and a season of healthy corporate earnings ending, the domestic economy is in good shape, some investors said.That strong foundation cannot be undermined by possible presidential misconduct, they argued, no matter how serious.In the absence of more negative economic factors a sustained sell-off in the markets was hard to envisage, Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note to clients.\u201cWe might see a bigger drawdown,\u201d or dip in the markets, \u201cbut it is likely to be both limited and reasonably short-lived,\u201d Mr. McMillan wrote. \u201cThere will be a time to worry, but right now, despite the very real issues being debated, we are still in a good place as investors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Budget Cuts Programs for Poor While Sparing Many Older People", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s spending blueprint seeks to balance the federal budget through unprecedented cuts to programs for poor and working-class families, effectively pitting them against older Americans who would largely escape the budget ax.By requiring Social Security numbers to obtain tax refunds, the White House would also pare back the earned-income tax credit and child tax credit \u2014 wage supplements for the working poor. Mr. Trump also wants to make large cuts to educational programs aimed at helping often low-income students secure federal loans or grants, and he would cut access to disability payments through Social Security.Taken together, the cuts represent a significant reordering of the social safety net, away from poor families and toward older Americans, regardless of income. Medicare would be untouched, and the main function of Social Security \u2014 retirement income \u2014 would flow unimpeded.In that sense, the plan, which was quickly denounced by several organizations and congressional Democrats, would align government spending with the views of senior administration officials like Ben Carson, the head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, who maintain that too much help to the poor is creating dependency on the government and discouraging work.\u201cWe are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said Monday. \u201cWe are going to measure compassion and success by the number of people we help get off of those programs and get back in charge of their own lives.\u201dConservatives cheered the proposals.\u201cThe way that the left approaches it is as if any spending level in the current system that has ever been attained is sacrosanct, and they will fight to the death to maintain that even if the programs are of pretty dubious value,\u201d said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who specializes in welfare and poverty. \u201cIf you look at cash, food and housing for families with children, the total spending is roughly twice what is needed to raise every single child above the poverty level.\u201dNot since President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first budget proposal have programs for the poor been targeted so thoroughly. To critics, it is the opposite of compassion, especially in light of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader plan to cut taxes for the rich, increase military spending and fund his proposed wall on the Mexican border.\u201cThis is overall an assault on a wide range of ordinary Americans for the purpose of providing tax cuts to the wealthiest,\u201d said Olivia Golden, executive director of the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit group focused on low-income Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s both devastating and it\u2019s, to me, completely in opposition to our national interests \u2014 investing in children and families and workers.\u201dThe effect would be broad. About 44 million people received food stamp benefits in 2016, up from the 28 million people who received such benefits in 2008, according to federal data. Those numbers have only receded slightly as the effects of the 2008 recession have faded.To counter that, Mr. Mulvaney said the president would shift some food stamp program costs to state governments, which now do not pay any of the benefits but do pay for half of the cost of administering the program. Mr. Mulvaney also said the budget would propose a work requirement for food stamp beneficiaries.\u201cWhat we have done is not try to remove the social safety net for the folks who need it, but to try to figure out if there are folks who don\u2019t need it and that need to be back in the work force,\u201d he said.Sharon Parrott, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said shifting the cost to states might end up much like Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, where some states greatly reduced the numbers of uninsured while more conservative states chose not to act. If states are asked to pay for part of the benefits that people receive, she said, people in states with conservative governments could go hungry.\u201cThe food stamp program has always had as its basic premise that poor people, particularly poor kids, should not be allowed to go hungry because of the state they live in,\u201d Ms. Parrott said. \u201cRealistically, if you shift costs to states, that is going to come with more flexibility for states, and that could undermine the basic food assistance safety net for people across the country.\u201dShe also pointed out that as a candidate, Mr. Trump promised not to cut Social Security, but on Monday he proposed to cut millions from Social Security Disability Insurance, a program that she described as \u201ccentral to the Social Security system.\u201dMr. Mulvaney said the president was keeping his promises.\u201cHe said, \u2018I promised people on the campaign trail that I would not touch their retirement and I would not touch Medicare.\u2019 And we don\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said of the president. \u201cIf you ask, 999 people out of 1,000 would tell you that Social Security disability is not part of Social Security. Old age retirement \u2014 that they think of as Social Security.\u201d\u201cAble bodied\u201d people and people who are not \u201ctruly disabled\u201d need to go back to work, he said.In total, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget would save $272 billion over the coming decade through efforts to \u201creform the welfare system.\u201d Of that, $40 billion would come from the earned-income tax credit, which benefits low- and moderate-income workers, and the child tax credit, which can be worth as much as $1,000 per qualifying child depending upon a person\u2019s income. Too many of those credits are being claimed by immigrants in the country illegally, Mr. Mulvaney said.Mr. Trump also proposed deep cuts to educational programs that often benefit low-income students including Pell grants, subsidized student loans, and the federal TRIO programs, which provide outreach and services to first-generation college students and people with disabilities.Enacting the proposals will be difficult. A budget could squeeze through Congress on Republican votes only, but changes to entitlement programs like food stamps will likely take Democratic support. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, called the budget \u201cshortsighted\u201d and \u201ccruel.\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Mr. Trump has \u201cturned his back on the working-class Americans who helped him win the presidency.\u201dErica L.

{"Headline": "Video Review: A Quieter and More Refined Mazda CX-5", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byDrivenMazda certainly turns out compelling products. Its MX-5 Miata is the most popular sports car in history. The svelte 6 sedan regularly gets rave reviews from automotive writers. Its CX-9 three-row crossover is an attractive and agile family hauler. People crave style, handling and reliability from their vehicles, all of which Mazda delivers in spades.So why isn\u2019t this small, independent Japanese car company a colossus? Why is Vegemite so popular in Australia? Some things we just may never understand.While it\u2019s rich in the usual Mazda attributes, the new CX-5 crossover will probably not challenge the Chevy Equinox, Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue or Toyota RAV4 in sales. Built on a thoroughly revised version of the outgoing model\u2019s architecture, the conservatively handsome exterior design is all new. So is the interior.The main issues plaguing the outgoing CX-5 were excessive road noise, modest cabin appointments and cargo hold issues that included an uneven load floor with the rear seat backs folded and the lack of a power liftgate.Fixed, fixed and fixed.My brother-in-law, Bob Kakiuchi, who owns a 2016 CX-5, noticed the quiet immediately. He also appreciated that the LCD screen was relocated from the center console stack to atop an instrument panel. The dashboard gains yards of stitching. Add simulated inlaid wood trim and the ambience inside climbs toward the premium level (though I see the white-on-black gauge cluster as austere).The revised 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine delivers 187 horsepower (three more than before) and 185 pound-feet of torque. Until the promised diesel engine arrives this fall (don\u2019t hold your breath), it\u2019s the only engine. The sole transmission is a 6-speed automatic with \u2014 surprise \u2014 no steering wheel shift paddles. While I\u2019m convinced that few owners use them, this is the company that whispers \u201czoom-zoom\u201d in its ads.Acceleration remains midpack. The CX-5\u2019s 0 to 60 mile-an-hour sprints happen in just under eight seconds. The Honda CR-V and Kia Sportage offer turbo power that the Mazda can\u2019t match. But speed isn\u2019t everything. CX-5 delivers a harmonic driving dynamic that is second to none in class. Most automakers can balance comfort and controlled driving dynamics these days. The CX-5 has an extra dollop of liveliness and communication that speaks to those who take driving seriously.A \u201csport\u201d mode gives the throttle quicker reflexes and alters the transmission\u2019s performance to hold the lower gears significantly longer. I wish there were a happy medium between it and the normal setting.The Environmental Protection Agency rates the fuel economy of the CX-5 at 23 miles per gallon in the city and 29 highway when equipped with all-wheel drive. That\u2019s a smidgen more efficient than the Toyota RAV4 but four miles per gallon lower than the average of the roomier Honda CR-V. Just so you know, my brother-in-law, a man not known for a featherweight throttle foot, averages 23 in city driving and 28 highway in his CX-5, which has the same government rating.The Grand Touring model comes standard with improved adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and cross-path detection. (It\u2019s a $625 package on the Touring model but not offered on the Sport.) Dual-zone climate control will keep temperature arguments to a minimum. What\u2019s played on the decent Bose sound system may not.With rear doors that swing wide, putting car seats into the back seat is easy enough. This space easily accommodates two average-size adults, but it\u2019s not as roomy as the CR-V. Two USB ports and buttons for the heated back seats are found by dropping the armrest \u2014 an upmarket touch that\u2019s hard to use when someone is seated in the middle.Those seats now recline and split 40/20/40. But they don\u2019t slide fore and aft to maximize either leg or cargo room. Drop the seats and the floor is fairly flat. Still, a couple more suitcases can be stuffed in a CR-V trunk.CX-5 pricing starts at $24,985, cresting at $33,765 for the fully optioned all-wheel-drive Grand Touring model tested. Mazda\u2019s plan is to position itself at a more premium tier, and CX-5 is a step in that direction. Adding an even higher trim level with vented seats, panoramic glass roof and a kick-to-open tailgate is a logical path forward. With turbo power, this could be an everyperson\u2019s Porsche Macan.To put Mazda\u2019s size into perspective, Nissan sold 329,904 Rogues in the United States last year, while Mazda moved 297,773 vehicles, in total. How this little-car-company-that-could makes such an appealing mainstream vehicle is another one of those mysteries that may never be solved. Just be glad it\u2019s doing it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Russia Stick to Promise to Cut Output With OPEC? Skepticism Abounds", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byMemo From MoscowMOSCOW \u2014 Global oil prices were in a deep slump. And because oil profits lubricate the Russian economy, the Kremlin was casting about for a solution.So Russia\u2019s leaders set politics aside and cut a deal with Saudi Arabia: Russia agreed to join the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on a production cut, with the intent of lifting global oil prices.On the face of things, the agreement worked: Prices picked up, and along with them the cost of gasoline and consumer goods in developed countries.There was just one catch: Russia, in fact, did nothing.\u201cThere was a beautiful public relations effect,\u201d said Aleksey I. Turbin, at the time a senior official at the Ministry of Energy who helped negotiate the deal with the Saudis.That was 16 years ago, but once again, an oil-dependent Kremlin is, if not exactly desperate, at least eager to prop up prices, and again questions abound on whether it is serious about cutting output or just assembling another public relations effort.\u201cIt was a conditional memorandum,\u201d Vladimir S. Milov, then Russia\u2019s deputy minister of energy, said in an interview about the 2001 agreement with OPEC, the first between Russia and the Saudi-dominated oil cartel. The Russian government had agreed to reduce output by 150,000 barrels per day. In fact, it actually raised production, by about 50,000 barrels per day, Mr. Milov said.\u201cWe not only did not fulfill the cuts, but actually increased production,\u201d Mr. Milov said. \u201cOPEC was very angry.\u201dOPEC\u2019s sway over oil is fading. American companies that learned to draw huge quantities of oil from shale rock in a process called hydraulic fracturing have transformed the United States into what is known as a swing producer, able to adjust production rapidly to match changes in the market.With that in mind, the 13-nation OPEC cartel had little choice but to work with Russia, despite the Kremlin\u2019s long history of trying to jawbone up global oil prices while doing as little as possible \u2014 or nothing at all \u2014 to actually curb output.\u201cRussia is always interested in higher prices, and the higher the better,\u201d Igor H. Yusufov, the Russian minister of energy during the 2001 agreement with OPEC, said in an interview. \u201cBut Russia will never become a member of OPEC.\u201dOPEC\u2019s share is 1.2 million barrels per day, while the non-OPEC nations agreed to cut back by 600,000 barrels a day. Russia agreed to the largest cut among non-cartel countries, pledging to lower output by 300,000 barrels per day. The other, smaller non-OPEC producers include Mexico, Kazakhstan and Equatorial Guinea.Russia has been dragging its feet. By March, the International Energy Agency said, Russia had cut about 170,000 barrels a day in output. The Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, grumbled that the non-OPEC producers were in a \u201clearning process\u201d on the need to actually follow through with cuts. Aleksandr Novak, the Russian energy minister, said on May 2 that Russia had reached the targeted reduction.During Russia\u2019s 2001 cheating on the OPEC deal, said Michael Lynch, president of the oil consultancy Strategic Energy and Economic Research, \u201cthe data was so poor that by the time people realized they were not complying, it was moot.\u201d Prices had already risen.The agreement reached last week is again intended to influence \u201cthe psychology of the traders, and the bulk of them were not around in 2001, when there were problems with compliance,\u201d Mr. Lynch said.The only recourse Saudi Arabia has if Russia fails to meet its current output reduction is to withdraw from the deal.\u201cThey can get away with it up to a point,\u201d Mr. Lynch said of the Russians, since it is impossible to find 100,000 or so barrels hidden in Russia\u2019s myriad pipes and storage sites. The Saudis \u201ccould pretend everything is going well, smile and shake hands.\u201dTo be fair, many Russian oil fields are in the far north, where wells are burrowed under permafrost and will freeze if production halts; the industry cannot easily cut output without permanently damaging its wells.In addition, Russia\u2019s industry is not wholly state-owned, and the government cannot legally force companies to comply. But former officials and analysts argue that the Kremlin today stands a better chance of getting compliance than it did in 2001, because President Vladimir V. Putin now has greater power over the oil companies.Yuri K. Shafranik, another former energy minister, said Russia also has stronger incentive to cooperate now because of the new, looming threat that American shale oil will flood the market.Still, among outside experts, skepticism remains that the production cut agreement can hold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuba\u2019s New Luxury Hotels Look to Lure Waves of U.S. Tourists", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetHAVANA \u2014 In Havana\u2019s Parque Central, shady stone benches and graceful palm trees beckon to mojito-sipping tourists and locals gathering to shoot the breeze.The gathering spot, in the center of town, is surrounded by horse-drawn carriages and long lines of colorful finned-and-chromed 1950s cars. But more utilitarian vehicles have recently begun circling the square: construction equipment transforming old buildings into luxury hotels.As Cuba\u2019s relationship with the United States grows warmer, real estate redevelopment is heating up, too.\u201cSo many old buildings sat vacant for years with signs saying they were soon to be converted into hotels,\u201d said Belmont Freeman, a Cuban-American architect based in New York. \u201cNow I actually see cranes on construction sites. Cuban bureaucracy is easing up, and foreign hotel developers are finally finding ways to move these projects forward.\u201dPresident Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s loosening restrictions on private enterprise, improving relations with the United States and financial necessity \u2014 Cuba\u2019s gross domestic product shrank in 2016, for the first time in over 20 years, according to official figures \u2014 have fueled rapid change in many areas.And several obstacles lie between the pent-up demand and a successful liftoff of Cuba\u2019s luxury hotels. Utilities are not always reliable, poverty is widespread and visible, and even getting ingredients for restaurant-quality meals can be dicey.But with Cuba suddenly an option for Americans exploring a culture kept off-limits for decades, the hospitality industry in particular has been supercharged. Over four million tourists visited in 2016, up 13 percent from the previous year, according to the Cuban Ministry of Tourism. Among those visitors were over 614,000 Americans, up 34 percent from the year before.The area around Parque Central has a front-row seat for the struggle, and the potential payoff.Leading the wave of new luxury hotels is the 246-room Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana, which stands in a restored European-style shopping arcade that stretches for a block. On the other side of Parque Central is the Hotel Inglaterra, which opened in 1875 and had Winston Churchill as one of its guests. Within shouting distance are several other luxury hotels managed by the French group Accor and Iberostar of Spain.Because United States regulations on visiting Cuba have not been completely relaxed, the full deluge of American visitors has not yet arrived. Instead of declaring themselves tourists, they must come under the auspices of one of 12 categories like \u201ceducational activities,\u201d which include interactions with Cuban people.But lengthy delays have tripped up many of the projects. Navigating shortages \u2014 Cuba imports 70 to 80 percent of its food, according to the World Food Program \u2014 frequent electricity and internet outages, and a decrepit water and sewage system are just some of the headaches for hotels trying to maintain standards. And the area near Parque Central and much of Havana has been overtaken by poverty since the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s, creating an uncomfortable juxtaposition between struggling locals and wealthy visitors.\u201cPeople are watching the Manzana closely,\u201d said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of pressure to maintain the Kempinski experience, and that will be difficult in Cuba.\u201dLike many buildings in Havana, the Gran Hotel Manzana \u2014 originally the Manzana de G\u00f3mez \u2014 has a storied past. Built between 1890 and 1918, the shopping arcade housed high-end clothing boutiques, two theaters, restaurants, a skating rink and a shooting range. After the revolution, some stores remained on the first floor, while the other floors were taken over by the government for offices and schools. But in recent years, the building \u2014 like many others in Cuba \u2014 fell into disrepair.From the Constante\u2019s windows, guests can see El Floridita, one of Hemingway\u2019s local watering holes (and where the drink was created). Rooms range in size from 430 to 1,615 square feet and will cost from $370 to $660 per night, according to Alessandro Benedetti, a director of Kempinski\u2019s sales and marketing department.Five stories tall, the Manzana also has a rooftop terrace and swimming pool that offers views of the Great Theater of Havana Alicia Alonso, the National Museum\u2019s Palace of Fine Arts and the Capitolio, a national government building that resembles the Capitol in Washington, though its architect is said to have modeled it on the Panth\u00e9on in Paris.The top floor also has a fitness area and spa that cover over 10,000 square feet. From the windows in the massage room, drying clothes can also be seen hanging from the broken windows of crumbling buildings nearby. This region of the city has been nicknamed \u201clas s\u00e1banas blancas,\u201d or \u201cthe white sheets,\u201d for the laundry frequently seen fluttering in the breeze.Indeed, the building boom is also bringing into sharper relief the disparity between visitors and the average Cuban. Many Cubans work for the state and earn the equivalent of $25 to $30 a month. The ceiling on state employees\u2019 salaries has been a challenge when hiring hospitality staff for these new luxury hotels in Havana.While it remains to be seen how tightly it will control private enterprise, the Cuban government is betting that tourism will help solve its economic woes. In 2016, the government declared a goal of 10 million visitors by 2030.The government is looking for new growth as the Cuban economy shrank 0.9 percent in 2016, hurt by the oil crisis in Venezuela, a key trading partner.The challenge will be avoiding the \u201cCanc\u00fan-ification\u201d of Cuba, said the architect and urban planner Miguel Coyula, referring to the resort area in Mexico that is a particularly popular destination for students on spring break.\u201cWith its culture, history and architecture, Cuba has more than just beach and sun,\u201d Mr. Coyula said. \u201cHavana\u2019s infrastructure is under great pressure already. Millions of tourists looking for rumba and mojitos aren\u2019t going to help that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In France, a Stark Debate and a Stark Choice", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byEditorialIt was the most brutal French presidential debate anyone could remember, two and a half hours of interruptions, insults, sarcasm and invective between the 48-year-old, far-right populist Marine Le Pen and the 39-year-old, centrist upstart Emmanuel Macron. They called each other liars, arrogant, dangerous and many other things, often paying little heed to the two moderators.Ms. Le Pen is head of the National Front, an anti-European Union, anti-immigrant far-right coalition her father founded 44 years ago, which she has sought to \u201cde-demonize\u201d since taking charge in 2011 \u2014 by, among other things, expelling her father. Mr. Macron is the wunderkind of French politics, a graduate of elite schools, a student of philosophy and an accomplished pianist, who made a quick fortune in investment banking before plunging into politics. Appointed minister of economy under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2014, Mr. Macron resigned two years later to form a new centrist political movement, En Marche! (or Onward!), to run for the presidency.Ms. Le Pen wants to close borders, ditch free-trade deals and hold a referendum on European Union membership. She also wants to lift sanctions on Russia and has borrowed funds from Russian banks. Mr. Macron advocates reforms that he says will make France more business-friendly while preserving most of its social safety net. He is pro-Europe, tolerant of immigrants and critical of Russia.How much either could achieve in a divided country is another question. That would depend in part on the elections to the National Assembly on June 11 and 18, the next political unknown. Nonetheless, the choice for French voters on Sunday is as stark as was Wednesday\u2019s debate \u2014 and not only for France. A French withdrawal from the European Union would mark a major and potentially fatal blow to the entire European project, and all Western democracies would be hurt by another retreat into narrow nationalism.Advertisement"}

He will try to balance his views with the worries of millions of French workers.But she also said that her party needed to \u201cprofoundly renew itself,\u201d and that she would work to make the National Front a \u201cnew political force.\u201dDuring the final stage of the campaign, Ms. Le Pen had temporarily stepped down from her post as leader of her party to campaign against Mr. Macron. She will likely renew the National Front\u2019s anti-globalization, anti-immigration drive and press her opposition to the European Union in other ways.Low turnout and a high number of blank ballots (a form of protest vote) had been expected to benefit Ms. Le Pen, whose voter base appeared in polls as more committed than Mr. Macron\u2019s. But that did not appear to be the case.About a quarter of the electorate abstained, with many in France forced to choose between two candidates they did not like in the final round of voting. Approximately 10 percent of those who did turn out cast an empty or discounted ballot.Mr. Macron had been expected to pick up support from the left and right in the runoff, if only from those who wanted to keep Ms. Le Pen from reaching the presidency \u2014 a French political tradition known as the \u201cRepublican Front,\u201d in which mainstream parties ally against the far right.There had been cracks in that front, but voters\u2019 distaste for Ms. Le Pen motivated enough of them to turn out to deny her a path to victory.But the most pressing issue will be the legislative elections. Because Mr. Macron belongs to a new party, he will struggle to get enough representatives elected to the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower and more powerful house of Parliament, to support his agenda.The leak appeared to mostly involve documents that showed the mundane inner workings of a presidential campaign, including professional and private emails, memos, contracts and accounting documents.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Addiction to Debt Now Threatens Its Growth", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has gone on a spending spree, borrowing money to build cities, create manufacturing giants and nurture financial markets \u2014 money that has helped drive the economic powerhouse in recent years. But the debt-fueled binge now threatens to sap growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.China\u2019s addiction to debt traces back to the global financial crisis in 2008. As world growth faltered, China unleashed a wave of spending to build highways, airports and real estate developments \u2014 all of which kept the economic engine chugging.To finance the construction, local governments and state-run companies borrowed heavily. Even after the worst of the crisis passed, China continued to rely on debt to fund growth.But credit no longer packs the same punch for China. An aging work force, smaller productivity gains and the sheer math of diminishing returns mean that China has to borrow more money to achieve less growth.The country\u2019s debt has recently been increasing by an amount equal to about 15 percent of the country\u2019s output each year, which has kept the economy expanding between 6.5 percent and 7 percent. Debt, by the same measure, barely changed from 2001 to 2008, when the country achieved some of its fastest, double-digit growth rates.The borrowing binge of late has also been propelled by murky investments with potentially big risks. Foresea Life Insurance, for example, offered souped-up policies that looked more like high-octane investments than staid life insurance.The products promised interest rates more than double traditional bank accounts, attracting droves of ordinary investors. To churn out those gains, Foresea took increasingly speculative bets, pouring the money into real estate, corporate deals and China\u2019s turbulent bond market.China in recent months has stepped up a campaign to clean up the financial system, which is riddled with such products.For China, it is a matter of stability. At a meeting with top leaders last month, President Xi Jinping emphasized that the health of the financial system was an issue of national security.\u201cFinance is the core of a modern economy,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cWe must do a good job in the financial sector in order to ensure stable and healthy economic development.\u201dForesea has pointed to the potential for instability from its own mess. A memo reportedly from Foresea, sent anonymously last week to several Chinese media outlets and reviewed by The New York Times, warns of mass demonstrations, presumably by policyholders, if it cannot raise more money and shore up its finances.Chinese media said the memo appeared to be genuine \u2014 it carried the company\u2019s official seal and other identifying information. The company declined to comment, issuing a statement last week saying that its cash flow was fine.Chinese authorities are facing a complex, economic puzzle: how to squeeze debt-fueled speculation out of the system without choking off growth or drawing unhappy investors into the streets.The government\u2019s latest efforts to reduce risk have contributed to turbulence in the country\u2019s markets. Higher borrowing costs and unusual distortions in lending suggest that investors are skittish about growth. After a strong start to the year, China\u2019s economy is showing signs of cooling.Here lies Beijing\u2019s challenge. The country is reluctant to take strong measures to control overall credit growth, fearing a broad slowdown in lending could prevent the economy from reaching the Chinese leadership\u2019s growth targets. But without drastic action, the debt levels will keep rising, in potentially unsustainable ways.\u201cChina\u2019s recent economic growth trajectory has been accompanied by a buildup of imbalances and vulnerabilities that poses risks to its basic economic and financial stability,\u201d Andrew Fennell, the director of Asian sovereign debt ratings at Fitch Ratings, said.Foresea is an extreme example of the manic speculation that hangs over the entire system.The insurer collected just $40 million in premiums in its first year after it was started five years ago. Last year, the company collected $14.6 billion.Insurers, trusts, non-bank financial companies, small local banks and other semiregulated or unregulated businesses have all been trying to ride China\u2019s ever-expanding credit markets to quick profits. They have accounted for more than half the country\u2019s overall lending activity.Foresea started to run into problems late last year. Its founder and controlling shareholder, Yao Zhenhua, made a hostile bid for Vanke, one of the country\u2019s largest real estate buyers, with plans to fund the deal in large part with insurance premiums.Those types of highly leveraged deals are getting more scrutiny. And Chinese authorities have started to publicly warn about speculative, loosely regulated lending.\u201cThe continuing increasing leverage rate is not good for sustainable development of the economy, and some risks have accumulated,\u201d Yi Gang, a senior deputy governor of the central bank, said in March. \u201cWe should think first to stabilize leverage \u2014 that is, to stabilize the overall rate of leverage, or let it grow more slowly.\u201dZhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, said the same month: \u201cEvery enterprise, especially those with too high a rate of leverage, should be controlled.\u201dForesea was among the first to be pinched.The China Insurance Regulatory Commission in December banned Foresea from offering new products, contending that the company was essentially selling high-yield debt even though it had permission to issue relatively low-risk life insurance. Two months later, the regulator accused the company of misleading authorities.\u201cThe fact that Foresea Life made up and provided fake material is clear,\u201d the commission said. \u201cIt is a serious circumstance that should be punished according to the law.\u201dThe moves have spooked customers. Revenues from newly issued policies plummeted 99.8 percent in the first quarter from the same period last year, to just $11.4 million. Investors also became wary, demanding their money back.Foresea has insisted the business remains healthy. But the leaked memo suggested deeper troubles.\u201cMost of the clients are in economically developed areas like Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai,\u201d the memo read. \u201cClients from these areas have a strong awareness of protecting their rights. The possibility of mass disturbances cannot be ruled out.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter @KeithBradsherAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Scandal? In Montana Race, a Republican Is Following the Trump Playbook", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byBILLINGS, Mont. \u2014 A multimillionaire with an East Coast education stepped off a campaign jet here recently and took jabs at reporters, pledged to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and drowned his opponent in insults and punch lines.\u201cThe first thing we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to work with Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Gianforte said.At a time when President Trump is mired in the most heated scandal of his short administration \u2014 with questions swirling around a Russia investigation and the firing of James B. Comey as director of the F.B.I. \u2014 Mr. Gianforte is barreling toward a special election with the full-throated endorsement of the president. And voting day, which is May 25, will be watched nationally for any signs that Mr. Trump, his tactics or his style of politics are wearing thin with voters who overwhelmingly supported him in November.Could Mr. Trump\u2019s brash, in-your-face approach work for another politician? Or have the president\u2019s stumbles clouded supporters\u2019 views of him and anyone who takes Mr. Trump as a role model?While candidates in recent special elections in Kansas and Georgia have played down connections to Mr. Trump, Mr. Gianforte has hewed particularly close to the president\u2019s narrative: He promotes his outsider status (he has never held office) and his business acumen (his software empire, RightNow Technologies, started in a basement), and takes aim at sanctuary states and \u201cthe liberal elite\u201d whenever he can. He\u2019s crisscrossed the state with the president\u2019s son, Donald Jr., and stumped with Vice President Mike Pence and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.All that is missing, it seems, is the provocative Twitter habit.The similarities have struck a chord with Montanans. \u201cI\u2019m voting for Greg. Period,\u201d Nancy Dehler, 69, said in a recent interview. \u201cHe\u2019s outspoken. He\u2019s not a politician. And he\u2019s a successful businessman.\u201d She characterized her endorsement of Mr. Gianforte as a push for Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, including less spending on welfare, a key issue for her. As for the turmoil surrounding the president, she said, \u201cthe media is doing everything they can do to lie about him.\u201dThe race has pitted Mr. Gianforte, 56, who moved to Bozeman from New Jersey in the 1990s, against Rob Quist, 69, a country music artist who has spent nearly 50 years singing about the state\u2019s big sky and snowy peaks. They are running to fill the at-large seat vacated by Mr. Zinke. Because the state has just one million people, the winner will be Montana\u2019s only representative in Congress. The stakes, as Mr. Gianforte put it in a recent interview, are \u201chuge.\u201dMr. Gianforte billed himself as a Trump acolyte who will repeal Obamacare, slash spending and open development on the state\u2019s public lands. Mr. Quist said he would fight to protect health insurance, encourage student debt forgiveness and keep drillers off federal acres.The state runs red and Mr. Trump won here by 20 points in November. But Montanans are famously independent, a tradition strengthened during the days when a copper company ran state politics, fueling a strong labor culture and a distrust of corporations. People here have often refused political labels, split tickets and voted person over party.A late-April poll, conducted by Garin-Hart-Yang Research Group on behalf of Democrats, showed that 44 percent of surveyed voters intended to cast a ballot for Mr. Gianforte, while 38 percent intended to do so for Mr. Quist.A more recent survey suggested that the race may be tightening.Recent Gianforte events played out like extensions of the 2016 Trump campaign: With a phalanx of protesters outside, Mr. Gianforte referred to his opponent as \u201cNancy Pelosi in a cowboy hat,\u201d and the president\u2019s son Donald entered to calls of \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201dAmong the attendees of a recent rally was Rolly Halverson, 69, a retired rancher who said he saw the country speeding toward fiscal ruin, with two businessman as the only answer. Mr. Gianforte, he said, is a Trump proxy who \u201cbrags less than the Donald.\u201d Which is a positive.\u201cI\u2019m still a believer in Donald Trump,\u201d he said this week. \u201cIf anybody is going to help Trump it\u2019s going to be Gianforte. And you know, I\u2019m not the biggest fan of Trump and how he goes on and on about himself. But I\u2019ll stomach that with the thought that maybe those guys will \u2014 maybe, maybe \u2014 be able to change things.\u201dWhile Mr. Gianforte has toured with the president\u2019s allies, Mr. Quist has traversed the state in a rented Winnebago, with a bandmate as his chauffeur. On Thursday Mr. Quist\u2019s campaign said he had raised $5 million, including more than 200,000 contributions averaging just under $24. Over the weekend, Bernie Sanders joined Mr. Quist on the campaign trail.Mr. Gianforte had raised $3.3 million between January and early May, according to federal filings.Quist supporters balked at the idea of another multimillionaire in Washington.\u201cWe\u2019re already eating ramen in a 500-square-foot family housing apartment, the four of us,\u201d said Mychiel Rauch, 27, who is working toward a microbiology degree and raising two children with her husband. They rely on food stamps and federal assistance for day care and fear cuts to these programs. \u201cGianforte,\u201d she said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent me at all.\u201dBut Jim Vaskey, 60, said he saw the Mr. Gianforte fortune differently \u2014 not as proof that he doesn\u2019t understand everyday people, but as evidence that he\u2019ll be independent if he makes it to Washington. \u201cWhy I was for Trump is why I am for Gianforte,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is beholden to nobody.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Iran and U.S. Leaders Trade Barbs, Big Deals Proceed", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byNews Analysis\u201cUntil the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the meeting, \u201call nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism.\u201dIn what seemed to be a response to the arms deal, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Saturday that such purchases would lead to nothing.\u201cIn terms of whether I\u2019d ever pick the phone up, I\u2019ve never shut off the phone to anyone that wants to talk or have a productive conversation,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.The Trump administration appears to have grasped an important point about Iran: The very thing that the administration complains and worries about \u2014 Iran\u2019s expanding influence in the region \u2014 makes it imperative that the two countries maintain at least a working relationship.The United States will have a hard time solving problems in the Mideast without Tehran\u2019s cooperation: in Lebanon, where it backs the Shiite militant group Hezbollah; in Syria, where it is propping up the government of President Bashar al-Assad; in Iraq, where it supports the government of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and trains powerful Shiite militias; and in Yemen, where to some extent, it is backing the Houthi rebels against the government.That is why some analysts are saying there would be room for compromise if the two countries ever sat down to talk, with the United States trading its control over the Iranian economy for concessions in regional affairs from Iran.The Trump administration did impose a series of sanctions on individuals and companies after Iran conducted a missile test in February. But that was in line with policies set out by President Obama.Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations in 1979, after the hostage crisis at the United States Embassy. But they did speak directly during the negotiations over the nuclear agreement, which began in secret in 2013, even before Mr. Rouhani was first elected later that year.The Iranian president is under pressure from hard-liners in his country to shun direct talks with the United States. But he can point to tangible benefits that have resulted from face-to-face meetings with the West. The nuclear agreement would never have been reached without such dialogue, and the deal has helped ease the suffocating, worldwide sanctions that brought the Iranian economy to a standstill and Tehran to the bargaining table.\u201cThey took part in the negotiations; and at the table, they respectfully spoke to the representatives of the Iranian nation,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said of the American representatives to the nuclear negotiations. \u201cWe had a win-win outcome there, one which I believe was to the benefit of Iran, all P5+1 member states and the world,\u201d he said at the news conference, using the diplomatic name for the countries at the negotiating table with Iran: the United States, Britain, Russia, China, France and Germany.Mr. Rouhani needs such additional talks now to make good on his campaign promise to obtain relief from the unilateral United States sanctions that are still choking the Iranian economy. While many sanctions were lifted under the nuclear agreement, those remaining are still discouraging European banks from providing desperately needed financing for business deals and infrastructure projects in Iran.Mr. Rouhani said on Monday that if Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Mr. Khamenei, agreed, he would try to start the process to get those sanctions lifted. \u201cIt will be difficult, but possible,\u201d he said.On the American side, the private sector experience of many in the new administration in Washington may make them more amenable to the idea of negotiations, suggested Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, a reformist analyst of Iranian politics. \u201cTrump, Tillerson, the others; this is an administration of businessmen. They solve problems by dealing, not fighting,\u201d he said.One official, an adviser to Mr. Zarif, the foreign minister, said he did not rule out direct negotiations, but added that the Iranians were still trying to read Mr. Trump. \u201cHe is a businessman,\u201d said the adviser, Hossein Sheikholeslam, \u201cbut even in business he acts impulsively and unpredictably.\u201dA news analysis article on Monday about American-Iranian diplomacy misidentified one country among a group of nations, known as the P5+1, involved in negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Besides Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, the group also included Germany, but not Iran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The South Faces a Summer With Fewer Peaches", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 Peaches are such a part of Georgia\u2019s identity that schools, streets and health care plans are named after them. Even the sticker you get when you vote is in the shape of the fruit. South Carolina, one state over, grows more peaches than Georgia. A giant statue of a peach is its most famous roadside attraction.Production in Georgia might be a quarter of what it was in 2016, when the state produced 43,000 tons of peaches, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. In South Carolina, which is second only to California in peach production, the numbers are as bad or worse. As much as 85 to 90 percent of the state\u2019s peach crop is gone, according to the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state\u2019s peaches usually bring in about $90 million a year, and their impact on the greater economy is three times that much.\u201cIt\u2019s just really, really bad,\u201d said Juan Carlos Melgar, an assistant professor of pomology at Clemson University in Clemson, S.C. \u201cHistorically bad.\u201dAlthough many growers have crop insurance, it won\u2019t replace lost income. And it won\u2019t help workers who rely on the peach crop. Peaches provide about 1,500 jobs in South Carolina. Many workers are from Mexico and spend as much as nine months pruning the trees, thinning the orchards and harvesting the crop. Many contracts are being canceled or cut short, and workers are heading home or trying to find other agricultural work, Dr. Melgar said.Then came a brutal three-day freeze in March. In South Carolina, many trees had blossoms or had already set fruit; that crop was devastated. In Georgia, the trees were so confused by the weather many just never produced fruit at all.The strange weather combination might save some of the crop. Trees that had worried farmers when they were late to bloom because of the warm winter weren\u2019t hurt by the freeze. As a result, Georgia will have early peaches, but growers warn the supply will stop by early or mid-July, which is when most people here say peaches begin to taste the best.It\u2019s an odd blessing, said Will McGehee, the sales and marketing manager of Pearson Farm, which grows peaches and pecans in Fort Valley, Ga., about 100 miles south of Atlanta, in a part of the state with 1.6 million peach trees.\u201cIf you go by what the old-timers say, we should have had nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say we\u2019re looking forward to pecan season.\u201dSouth Carolina has the opposite problem. The state\u2019s early fruit was wiped out, but growers are hopeful about the late-season crop. There just won\u2019t be that much of it. Roadside stands and local markets will be stocked with peaches, but there will be little to ship elsewhere.In Atlanta, grocery stores might appear to have more peaches than usual in the next month or so because shippers are likely to forgo the cost of shipping most of the state\u2019s peaches north, which is what they do when the crop is more abundant, said Gary W. Black, Georgia\u2019s agriculture commissioner.This year, Northerners might not miss that Southern fruit at all. The 2017 New England peach crop is looking great, growers there said. Of course, after last year, any peaches look good.For Southerners, whose summertime rituals involve eating peaches over the sink, making them into cobblers and ice cream and canning whatever\u2019s left, California might offer the only solution. That state is expected to grow about 625,000 tons of peaches. That\u2019s up almost 8 percent over last year, according to Department of Agriculture estimates.But one would be hard-pressed to find a Southerner who really wants a California peach, even though that state produces half the nation\u2019s crop. California fruit can\u2019t compete with fruit born in Southern soil and made sweet with the heat of Southern nights, they argue.He grew up in the South, the son of a plant breeder. And like many Southerners, he\u2019d rather not eat peaches at all than eat one from California during a Southern summer.\u201cI feel like California peaches are just symbols of peaches,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just the idea of a peach. I feel the same way about winter tomatoes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Saudi Arabia Needs to Hear From Trump", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 When Air Force One touches down in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, this week, President Trump can be sure of one thing: His Saudi hosts have firmly pressed the reset button on a relationship that became strained in the latter years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.Mr. Obama made four visits to Saudi Arabia, more than any other United States president. He agreed to sell the Saudis more weapons than any other president. He provided American military support for the Saudi intervention in the civil war in Yemen. Yet the Saudis rightly saw him as so anxious to solidify his legacy of the nuclear deal with Iran that he was willing to weaken the United States\u2019 75-year-old strategic relationship with their country. In fact, it appeared as if Mr. Obama was willing to tacitly accept Iran\u2019s efforts to dominate the Middle East.Still, the Saudis will be listening intently this weekend for even more reassurance from Mr. Trump that the Iran page has truly been turned and that the Saudi-American alliance is back on track. Mr. Trump should offer three strong messages for his Saudi hosts.First, he should state publicly and strongly that he understands that the kingdom is on the front lines of the war against the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. Sunni extremists are not an existential threat to the United States, but they have repeatedly attacked Saudi Arabia, making no secret that they dream of replacing its government with their \u201ccaliphate.\u201d With control of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast oil reserves, any such caliphate would have a terrible, malevolent influence in the Muslim world and beyond.Along these lines, Mr. Trump should also make it clear that Saudi Arabia is one of the United States\u2019 closest security partners. The United States-Saudi intelligence relationship \u2014 described to me by senior American officials in the years since Sept. 11 as being among the strongest in the world \u2014 protects American lives, disrupting plots aimed at the United States. American drones flying from Saudi bases have, with Saudi intelligence support, killed many senior terrorists, including Anwar al-Awlaki, the American recruiter for Al Qaeda who was seen by many as the most dangerous cleric to emerge in recent years. Such a public statement from the president would help correct the narrative popular in the United States that the Saudi government supports terrorism.Second, Mr. Trump should arrive with concrete proposals to help Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Cooperation Council allies deter Iran, which they see as an expansionist revolutionary power seeking to upend the established order in the Middle East, undermining both security in their countries and American interests.Mr. Trump must make it clear that the alliance between Iran and the Houthi rebels waging war in Yemen, on Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern doorstep, will not stand. Not only does this dangerous alliance aim to imperil the security of Saudi Arabia, one of the world\u2019s leading oil producers, but it could also allow Iran to threaten the Bab al Mandeb, the strait between Yemen and Africa that is a maritime choke point vital to the global economy. Mr. Trump should increase the American military\u2019s involvement in the maritime patrols around Yemen to further interdict deadly Iranian supplies to the Houthis.Acknowledgment by the president that the Saudis have made progress is important. Acknowledging how tricky this is \u2014 changes must be carefully calibrated so as not to incite backlash from the kingdom\u2019s religious conservatives, who are often at odds with Saudi rulers \u2014 would soothe Saudi feelings of being chronically misunderstood.This visit to Saudi Arabia is a chance for Mr. Trump to reiterate that the United States has a loyal ally in the Middle East, in the heart of the Arab world and at the center of Islam. This is the moment for Mr. Trump to affirm the depth and importance of the strategic relationship and to further strengthen that alliance by embracing the Saudis as full partners in business, in politics and in fighting the rise of violent religious extremists.Advertisement"}

So much so that the France Unbowed movement of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the hard-left candidate who received 19.6 percent of the first-round vote, announced that its members were not inclined to turn out for Mr. Macron on Sunday.In an unscientific online survey of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s supporters conducted by his party, only 34.8 percent said they would vote for Mr. Macron against Ms. Le Pen. Nearly two-thirds of those who participated in the poll said they would abstain or cast a blank ballot in the final round.Though more than seven million people voted for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon in the first round, fewer than 250,000 people took part in the online straw poll. Voting for Ms. Le Pen was not one of the options.Ms. Le Pen may have an equally difficult time, no matter whose words she uses, persuading the supporters of her vanquished rivals to back her candidacy. Damien Abad, a former spokesman for Mr. Fillon, said that she was unlikely to persuade many of those who had voted for Mr. Fillon. \u201cFran\u00e7ois Fillon\u2019s voters aren\u2019t fooled,\u201d he told BFM-TV. \u201cThey won\u2019t be bought because one copies parts of their candidate\u2019s speech.\u201d\u201cIt is good (and significant) that Marine Le Pen and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, expressing themselves on France\u2019s universal calling, do so with the same terms,\u201d wrote Mr. Co\u00fbteaux, who founded but no longer presides over a small far-right organization close to the National Front called Sovereignty, Identity and Liberties.Still, he told the newspaper that he supported Ms. Le Pen and was not \u201cdispleased\u201d that the two candidates had used his words.Advertisement"}

It was also devastating because the French, it turns out, are attached to the euro. Macron said the value of people\u2019s savings would plunge 20 to 30 percent the day after a return to the franc.

The flexing of Mafia-style muscle.In other words, it\u2019s business as usual in the State of Mexico, where control of the governor\u2019s office, up for grabs every six years, is the biggest prize of all state contests.The outcome of the race has long been considered a bellwether for the presidential election, providing the victorious party with momentum, campaign money and political influence over the largest state in the country. And this year that seems especially true.But this year, the race is shaping up to be perhaps the closest ever, possibly foreshadowing a similarly tight contest next year in the race to succeed President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, a member of Institutional Revolutionary Party.But unbridled corruption, weak economic growth, soaring violence and the government\u2019s own halting response to President Trump\u2019s aggressive stance toward the country have eroded support for the Mexican president and his party, helping the political opposition improve its chances at the polls.The biggest beneficiary so far, it appears, has been the leftist National Regeneration Movement, or Morena, led by the populist agitator Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. He has tried to harness nationalist animus toward Mr. Trump by criticizing Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s handling of the American president and casting himself as a strong defender of Mexican sovereignty.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, 63, is a front-runner in early polling for next year\u2019s presidential election, and his momentum has helped to advance his party\u2019s candidates at the regional level.In the State of Mexico campaign, two polls released late last month showed his party\u2019s candidate, Delfina G\u00f3mez \u00c1lvarez, 54, taking a thin lead over the Institutional Revolutionary Party\u2019s candidate, Alfredo del Mazo Maza, 41.The election is on June 4. Campaigns for governor are also being waged in the states of Coahuila and Nayarit, but in the State of Mexico the stakes \u2014 and the spoils \u2014 are far greater.\u201cIt would be a big, big, big loss for the P.R.I.,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Merino, a political analyst in Mexico City. The impact of a defeat on the party\u2019s bid to retain the presidency could be profound, he said.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be checkmate, but it would be check,\u201d Mr. Merino said.The State of Mexico wraps around Mexico City and has absorbed most of the capital region\u2019s stunning population growth in recent decades. It is in some ways a microcosm of the country, embodying its extreme socioeconomic contradictions.\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very diverse state,\u201d said Vidal Romero, head of the political science department at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cIt has places with a lot of wealth \u2014 individuals, companies, industries \u2014 and it has places with enormous poverty.\u201dLike the nation as a whole, the State of Mexico has also been wrestling with rising violence and unremitting corruption, which Mr. del Mazo\u2019s opponents have used to bludgeon him and his party.They have also cast him as the epitome of political privilege, a person whose victory at the polls would only perpetuate the clubby, dynastic control of the nation\u2019s most powerful offices. In addition to being the son and grandson of former State of Mexico governors, Mr. del Mazo is Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s cousin.To drive that point home, Josefina V\u00e1zquez Mota, 56, the candidate of the conservative National Action Party, regularly refers to Mr. del Mazo as \u201cthe president\u2019s cousin\u201d in lieu of his name.\u201cToday, because of the P.R.I., because of the excesses of the same families as always, we are in first place in insecurity, in corruption and also in feminicide,\u201d Ms. V\u00e1zquez Mota said during a recent televised debate.While the election is widely viewed as a referendum on the Institutional Revolutionary Party\u2019s recent performance, it is also the biggest test yet of the viability of Morena.Morena was founded in 2014 by Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City and two-time presidential candidate, who has cast himself as the new leader of the political left. His populist message takes aim at the ruling elite and the nation\u2019s rampant corruption, violence and inequality.While his party failed to win a governorship in last year\u2019s elections, it performed strongly in the three races it contested and won seats in local elections. A victory in the State of Mexico would provide an outsize accelerant to the party\u2019s national ambitions, analysts said.Its candidate, Ms. G\u00f3mez, 54, is a former director of a large grade school who entered politics only recently, in 2012, becoming mayor of her hometown and then a congresswoman. The daughter of a construction worker, she has been embraced by voters who identify with her humble origins and see her relative inexperience in politics as an advantage.\u201cHer image is impeccable for her fans: a woman from a working-class neighborhood,\u201d said Fernando Dworak, a political analyst in Mexico City.But looming over her candidacy like a puppet master is Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.He has occasionally joined Ms. G\u00f3mez on the campaign trail, and the disparity in their allure and fame is immediately apparent: the ovations for him are louder, the crowds that surround him more passionate. He is greeted with chants of \u201cPresident! President! President!\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has explicitly tied the State of Mexico campaign to his push for president.Speaking at a campaign rally for Ms. G\u00f3mez in Cuautitl\u00e1n, a small city north of the capital, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said a victory in the State of Mexico would be \u201ca link in the chain that\u2019s being constructed to pull Mexico from backwardness, to pull the people from poverty.\u201dBut two videos published in late April by El Universal newspaper supposedly showed a Morena candidate for a mayoralty in Veracruz State accepting stacks of cash on behalf of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s campaign, in violation of electoral laws. The candidate immediately ended her campaign, and Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador called the episode a setup to discredit him and his party.The federal office that examines campaign conduct has been fielding scores of allegations of impropriety. As of April 15, officials had opened 164 investigations \u2014 nearly double the number of cases at the same point in the 2011 campaign for governor.Opposition parties have accused the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration of meddling in the campaign, including dispatching cabinet members on more than 100 visits to the state in recent months \u2014 more than usual, they say \u2014 to promote various government projects and benefits. The Institutional Revolutionary Party leadership has denied charges of malfeasance and said all the visits were legal and part of the government\u2019s efforts to provide public services.On a recent afternoon, as the three leading campaigns paid parallel visits to the municipality of Naucalpan, on the northwestern border of Mexico City, the Institutional Revolutionary Party\u2019s electoral machinery was particularly evident.Early in the afternoon, several hundred people turned out in a working-class neighborhood to see Ms. G\u00f3mez and Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador speak from a stage under a tent that had been wedged between some buildings and a septic stream littered with garbage. The response was enthusiastic but restrained.Later in the day, the caravan of the conservative party\u2019s candidate, Ms. V\u00e1zquez Mota, rolled into another working-class neighborhood, where several hundred people had gathered under a tent. There was a large band on stage, a separate percussion ensemble, seven stilt walkers, a professional wrestler wearing a mask and a nearly nude carnival dancer. Still, much of the audience was quiet, even somnolent.The Institutional Revolutionary Party, however, took its show to another level. In a middle-class neighborhood, even in the middle of a work day, several thousand people gathered under an enormous tent that covered more than half a soccer field. The crowd was a sea of campaign signs, banners and balloons; many attendees wore the party\u2019s colors or paraphernalia.Half an hour before the event, the chants and raucous anticipation were audible from blocks away.Mr. del Mazo\u2019s arrival was greeted with a sustained, deafening roar from the crowd and the rumble and pop of at least two percussion ensembles. Someone fired a gun that shot a giant plume of confetti.Even as the candidate began his stump speech, wave upon wave of drumming and chanting cascaded over him for several minutes, forcing him to pause.\u201cAlfredo! Alfredo! Alfredo\u201d the crowd thundered. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win! We\u2019re going to win!\u201d And at that moment, in that place, there was nothing to suggest they were wrong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "C. Jackson Grayson, 93, Nixon\u2019s Anti-Inflation Overseer, Dies", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byC. Jackson Grayson, a business school dean who was named by President Richard M. Nixon to oversee the nation\u2019s first peacetime price control program, died on Thursday at his home in Houston. He was 93.Nixon\u2019s price control effort began in 1971, when he was armed with congressional authority to curb runaway inflation, which had reached nearly 6 percent over all and even double digits for some goods. That August he imposed a brief wage and price freeze, followed by voluntary guidelines of 5.5 percent a year for pay and 2.5 percent for prices. He set up the Price Commission as part of that effort.Dr. Grayson was dean of the business school of Southern Methodist University in Dallas when Nixon appointed him chairman of the panel. Reporting to the president, Dr. Grayson was empowered to act without the vote of other commission members, though he would solicit their advice.During the first year of controls, Dr. Grayson said, consumer prices were held to a 3.2 percent increase; without them, he said, the rise would have been as much as 5.2 percent. By the time the so-called Phase II voluntary guidelines were lifted for most of the economy in January 1973, the annual inflation rate was below 4 percent.He left the post in 1973 and returned to S.M.U.Other price regulations were imposed after that, but Congress let the president\u2019s authority to impose controls lapse altogether in April 1974.By then, Dr. Grayson had become skeptical of the efficacy of controls and maintained that inflation resulted, in part, from a psychosomatic reaction by shoppers to measurements of the temperature of the economy.Dr. Grayson founded his research group in 1977, originally as the American Productivity Center, offering training courses in improving worker output, helping companies better measure productivity, and extending proficiency goals beyond the private sector to other areas, like school systems.\u201cFew, if any, individual Americans have done more during the last 20 years to shape the country\u2019s economic future for the better,\u201d Business Week magazine said of Dr. Grayson in 1990.Charles Jackson Grayson Jr. was born on Oct. 8, 1923, in Fort Necessity, in northeastern Louisiana. Until he was 15, he was raised as a farm boy on his father\u2019s Louisiana plantation, where Charles Sr. grew cotton and soy beans and raised race horses. As a student at Georgia Military Academy, Charles Jr. danced with Vivien Leigh at the Atlanta gala premiere of \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201dHe served in the Navy in the South Pacific during World War II and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration from Tulane University, a master\u2019s from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a doctorate from Harvard Business School.After getting his master\u2019s, he decided that he did not want to be an accountant and took a career detour, first working as a reporter in 1949 for The New Orleans Item, where he relished covering crime.That fascination led him to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he became an agent, his only other government job. In one instance he was held hostage at gunpoint after a carjacking in Minneapolis.Returning to the academic fold, he taught at Tulane and became dean of its business school.Dr. Grayson owned race horses, was licensed to pilot a single-engine plane, had visited all seven continents by the time he was 80 and celebrated his 75th and 90th birthdays by sky diving.He was not enrolled as either a Republican or a Democrat, although he said he voted for Nixon for president in 1968.His first three marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, Carla O\u2019Dell, the chairwoman and chief executive of APQC, he is survived by three sons from the earlier marriages, Christopher, Michael and Randall, and four grandchildren. Another son, Daniel, died.In founding APQC, Dr. Grayson warned that the United States was trailing other industrial nations in productivity, or output per worker, a key measure of economic health.\u201cProductivity is something like motherhood,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1980. \u201cEverybody believes in it but most people ignore it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Policy Is Vital to Tax Reform Policy", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThere is strong bipartisan support in Congress for cutting the corporate tax rate to improve competitiveness. If done in a revenue-neutral manner, as the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was, that simultaneously gets rid of inefficient tax loopholes that distort business decision making, this would be a good thing. But what is really holding back the international competitiveness of American businesses isn\u2019t so much the tax code as our health system.The United States is unique among major countries in that health insurance for the working population is provided almost entirely by employers. And until the Affordable Care Act, they weren\u2019t even required to do so; small businesses are still not required.No one ever sat down and thought up this system; it came about by accident during World War II. Because of wage and price controls, employers couldn\u2019t raise wages. But because so many young men were in the military and the large demand for war production, many businesses had an acute labor shortage.To provide additional compensation to get the workers they needed, some businesses started offering health insurance on top of cash wages. Before the war, health insurance was rarely provided.Although obviously a form of income to the worker, the Internal Revenue Service nevertheless ruled that it was not taxable, although businesses could still deduct the cost. This anomalous tax treatment was a fabulous tax loophole for both businesses and workers, especially at a time when tax rates were historically high.Eventually Congress codified the I.R.S. ruling and we have been stuck with an employer-based health insurance system ever since. Although from time to time, politicians have suggested getting rid of the exclusion for health insurance and using the revenue to create an individually based health insurance system, such efforts have been short-lived and unsuccessful.The problem for competitiveness is that businesses are saddled with a huge and rising cost that they cannot pass on to consumers because they must compete with foreign businesses that do not bear this cost. In most other countries, health insurance is provided by the government and financed with a value-added tax that is rebated at the border. (With a V.A.T., the tax applies at the border on imports and is rebated on exports so that exports are free of tax.) Thus, none of the cost of providing health insurance is borne by businesses or embedded in the cost of internationally traded goods.Consequently, foreign businesses have a huge competitive advantage over those in the United States that are forced to provide health insurance for their workers. Of course, such businesses are also at a disadvantage against companies that choose not to provide this benefit for their employees. This is a key reason employment in the American manufacturing sector has declined sharply over the past several decades. Manufacturers, such as those in the steel and auto industries, are among those most likely to provide good health insurance because of strong unions.Back when Congress considered the Affordable Care Act in 2009, one of the first decisions made was to take the exclusion for health insurance off the table. The House recently passed a Republican plan to replace the A.C.A. that also did not touch the exclusion or do anything to reduce the burden of health insurance on businesses.Of course, eliminating the exclusion for health insurance would increase the tax burden on employers and many would drop it. Obviously, Congress would have to come up with something to replace such coverage. But since an individually based health insurance system, which all Republicans favor, would necessarily require tax credits to allow the insurance to be afforded, tax reform is the perfect time to consider such a scheme.If the Republicans are serious about using tax reform to improve the competitiveness of American businesses, the best thing they can do is reform employer-based health insurance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts May Be More Damaging Than Reagan\u2019s", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byAs a young New York Times reporter nearly four decades ago, I helped chronicle the rollout of what proved to be among our country\u2019s greatest economic follies \u2014 the alchemistic belief that huge tax cuts can pay for themselves by unleashing faster economic growth.Buoyed by this idea, Congress passed the largest tax reductions in history just seven months after Ronald Reagan\u2019s inauguration. I was deeply skeptical of the illogical notion that tax cuts could somehow pay for themselves, so much so that I was attacked by name on the Wall Street Journal op-ed page. That, in turn, caused consternation among my editors in an era when reporting was meant to be less analytical.Nonetheless, I felt no joy as the plan immediately made a bad economy worse.Now comes Donald Trump, essentially trying to revive that same supply-side credo (famously branded \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d by George H. W. Bush) with his proposal for $5.5 trillion of tax giveaways, mostly for business. Even some of the outsize personalities that I encountered in 1981 are back, most notoriously the concept\u2019s godfather, Arthur Laffer, who advised the Trump presidential campaign.What proved a bad idea then is a worse one now. Unemployment was 7 percent and rising when President Reagan took office. Today, with unemployment at just 4.6 percent, broad-based fiscal stimulus isn\u2019t likely to create much new employment.For its part, the Reagan tax cut increased the budget deficit, helping elevate interest rates over 20 percent, which in turn contributed to the double-dip recession that ensued. The stock market fell by more than 20 percent. Fiscally, the revenue loss totaled 2.9 percent of the average gross domestic product between 1981 and 1985.But perhaps the greatest damage inflicted by the Reagan tax cuts was to our political psyche, making respectable \u2014 particularly among Republicans \u2014 the terrifying notion that high deficits resulting from tax cuts don\u2019t matter because faster economic growth will quickly close the gap. (At the time, this idea was called supply-side economics, but it has now been rebranded with the phrase \u201cdynamic scoring.\u201d)In 2002, while trying to justify another set of irresponsible tax cuts, Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly said, \u201cReagan proved deficits don\u2019t matter.\u201d By the end of George W. Bush\u2019s tenure, the surpluses that he had inherited were squandered, and as the financial crisis raged, the deficit soared to $511 billion before peaking at $1.6 trillion in 2009 (all figures in 2016 dollars).Deficits have left a lasting mark in the form of vast piles of national debt \u2014 $14 trillion currently, up from $712 billion when Mr. Reagan took office, an almost 20-fold increase. Big deficits can sometimes be advisable, as they were in aiding recovery from the 2009 recession. But incurred pointlessly, as Mr. Trump is proposing, large fiscal gaps simply mean more debt that will be left to our children and grandchildren to pay off.A large deficit is another significant difference in the state of the economy compared with 36 years ago and helps explain why Mr. Trump\u2019s business-heavy proposals are not only grossly unfair to middle-class Americans but also terrible policy.After dropping to $444 billion in 2015, the federal deficit is again marching upward. By 2026, it is projected to be $1 trillion. In normal times, economists consider a deficit of about 3 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 where it is now \u2014 to be appropriate.The Trump plan isn\u2019t all bad. I understand our need to lower the corporate tax rate to compete with other countries and adjust other provisions to keep companies and jobs here. Critics are correct that our business-tax structure encourages companies to ship jobs and even themselves overseas. But in return for that concession, which would significantly benefit shareholders, we should be raising the 23.8 percent capital gains rate closer to the top rate of 39.6 percent on earned income, not lowering it.Should Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal become law, I\u2019ll bet the denouement resembles that of Reagan\u2019s: In 1982, just a year after those cuts, Congress enacted new provisions that recovered about a third of the lost revenues, and by the end of Reagan\u2019s administration, additional tax increases raised that figure to about two-thirds.Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 we have significant economic challenges (as reflected in our anemic sub-2 percent growth rate), and thoughtful tax policy can play a positive role. We haven\u2019t had a serious attack on loopholes, complexities and egregious deductions since 1986, and we desperately need another one.But what we don\u2019t need \u2014 and can\u2019t afford \u2014 is another round of huge, unpaid-for tax reductions that saddle us with large amounts of new debt without producing the growth levels being predicted. Changing the sales slogan from \u201csupply-side economics\u201d to \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d won\u2019t do anything to shield us from the painful consequences.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Billionaire Gadfly in Exile Who Stared Down Beijing", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byThe biggest political story in China this year isn\u2019t in Beijing. It isn\u2019t even in China. It\u2019s centered at a $68 million apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan.The Chinese government responded by unleashing the state-controlled media to enumerate Mr. Guo\u2019s alleged frauds, and asking Interpol to put out a global warrant for his arrest.But then something unexpected happened. China stood down. The state media campaign against him tapered off. In mid-May, Mr. Guo announced on Twitter that his wife and daughter \u2014 previously barred from leaving China \u2014 had been allowed to visit him in New York.\u201cWe need to root out some of the robbers of this country,\u201d Mr. Guo, referring to China, told two New York Times reporters this month at his apartment. To emphasize the point, he wrote it out in Chinese in a notebook. \u201cWe are against using corruption to root out corruption.\u201dMr. Guo\u2019s most recent claims have reverberated across China and fed unease on Wall Street about doing business there. The assertions, if substantiated, could upend politics in China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, possibly driving a wedge between President Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan, the anticorruption czar.Mr. Wang, the focus of Mr. Guo\u2019s allegations, has close ties to Wall Street, with enormous influence over China\u2019s financial sector. Mr. Guo\u2019s assertions come just months before a Communist Party meeting that will decide whether Mr. Wang, recently the focus of speculation that he may become China\u2019s next prime minister, will remain on the party\u2019s elite Politburo Standing Committee.Mr. Guo\u2019s Twitter broadsides have continued, and his ability to stare down the world\u2019s most powerful authoritarian nation has underscored the mystery, in China and abroad, about how he acquired his billions, what he knows and who, if anyone, is backing him.No one better represents the marriage of the party and money than Mr. Guo, known as Miles Kwok outside China, who parlayed relationships with some of China\u2019s most powerful officials to help build a global portfolio including hotels, office buildings and securities brokerage firms.\u201cThe allegations with regard to HNA simply aren\u2019t true,\u201d a spokesperson for HNA said.Over a decade ago, the Chinese Communist Party welcomed businessmen into its ranks. In turn, those tycoons helped make the sons and daughters of the revolution rich while helping the country show spectacular growth rates. Now, armed with information, one of them has strayed.\u201cThese people have power and influence and knowledge,\u201d said William C. Kirby, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cMany of them are easily controlled. But others go off the reservation.\u201dMr. Guo\u2019s presence in the United States poses a dilemma for the Trump administration, which is seeking China\u2019s cooperation to rein in North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions. In recent years Mr. Guo provided Washington with insights into Chinese politics through his visits with embassy officials in Beijing, according to a former senior administration official.When the Times reporters visited Mr. Guo\u2019s apartment at the Sherry-Netherland hotel in late April, he stepped away to take a phone call in another room, with the speakerphone on. His assistant explained that a top aide to Mr. Xi was on the line. The implication was obvious: Despite his unprecedented public tirades against some top officials, Mr. Guo was communicating with the one who matters most.As with many of Mr. Guo\u2019s claims, it wasn\u2019t possible to verify who was on the other end of the call, but the episode was fully in keeping with Mr. Guo\u2019s showman personality. That flair for the dramatic is typical of him, said one longtime acquaintance who was present when he took calls from Mr. Ma, the former intelligence official.When the Chinese government eased up on its attacks against Mr. Guo, the about-face suggested that the Communist Party\u2019s top leadership may not agree on how to deal with him, according to Victor Shih, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies finance and politics in China.\u201cIf the party were unified in opposing Guo Wengui, his family would have had much harsher treatment,\u201d he said.Mr. Guo boasts of multiple residences around the world, including in Beijing, London, Tokyo, Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. His oceanside home there, with sweeping views of Repulse Bay, sits on two lots that Mr. Guo\u2019s son bought for 880 million Hong Kong dollars ($113 million) in 2011, according to property records.His lakeside property in Beijing is modeled on a traditional one-story courtyard home but is far more elaborate, with multiple levels, a cavernous closet with hundreds of identical suits, and a pool, in a complex of more than 86,000 square feet. One real estate agent in Beijing estimated its value at about $230 million.At dinner, he pressed his case, all the while watching a Chinese soap opera on a tiny television screen. \u201cIt was, still to this day, the most bizarre evening I have ever spent in China,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. (Harvard did not take Mr. Guo up on his offer.)Mr. Guo says the motivation for his corruption allegations is simple: He claims the state shot one of his brothers in 1989 and he has been plotting his revenge ever since. The circumstances of the death are murky, though, like much of Mr. Guo\u2019s story.He says he was born in May 1970, one of 10 boys in a family with ties to the Chinese Army from a small town in eastern China\u2019s Shandong Province. (Legal documents say he was born in February 1967.) In prison, Mr. Guo, who has only a middle-school education, learned about Chinese history and other topics from educated inmates, he said.After his release in 1991, Mr. Guo met a prominent businesswoman who introduced him to wealthy investors. Soon after he built a hotel in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, which became a meeting spot for government officials.Since then, he has lived abroad and his assets in China \u2014 he claims 120 billion renminbi ($17.4 billion) in all \u2014 have been frozen. Mr. Guo is facing financial pressures.One hedge fund in Hong Kong, the Pacific Alliance Asia Opportunity Fund, recently sued him in New York, saying that he owes $88 million, a sum that includes millions of dollars in interest in loans from 2008. The fund wants to seize his New York apartment.A representative for Mr. Blair did not address whether Mr. Blair had made introductions for Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo said the article was groundless.Mr. Wang did not respond to faxed questions sent to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection in Beijing.\u201cWang Qishan has been the model of clean and competent, and all but untouchable,\u201d said William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. \u201cShould his star fall, business and government players should be concerned about their own safety.\u201dThere\u2019s no sign that Mr. Guo is letting up. Before the Communist Party meets this fall to pick a slate of top leaders, Mr. Guo plans his most dramatic assault of all: a live event, perhaps from Lincoln Center, that will focus on Chinese corruption.\u201cI want it to be carnival-style with a big screen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will sing. We will cry and we will talk about the world.\u201dChristopher Buckley and David Barboza contributed reporting. Kiki Zhao contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "France Elects Emmanuel Macron", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe decisive election of Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old political neophyte committed to the European Union, economic reform and traditional liberalism, as president of France offered powerful relief to everyone who had feared that France could become the next country to succumb to the wave of populism, nationalism and anti-globalism sweeping through Western democracies.A mysterious, 11th-hour email hack of the Macron campaign appears to have made little or no difference to the eventual outcome. With projections showing Mr. Macron with more than 65 percent of the vote to 35 percent for the far-right, nationalist Marine Le Pen, his was a victory of hope and optimism over fear and reaction; of a future in Europe rather than in resentful isolation.The victory was remarkable in many ways. When he enters the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to start his five-year term next weekend, Mr. Macron will be the youngest president in French republican history. He will be the first president in decades not to come from one of the traditional parties of the left or right; he formed his own centrist political party, En Marche! (loosely translated as \u201cForward!\u201d) barely a year ago. A student of philosophy, accomplished pianist, former investment banker and most recently minister of economy under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, he had never before run for office.But dramatic and impressive as his victory is, Mr. Macron faces formidable challenges. He is taking charge of a nation deeply divided, much like the United States, Britain and other major democracies, with many people feeling marginalized by globalization, economic stagnation, an unresponsive government, unemployment, faceless terrorism and a tide of immigrants.That a far-right nationalist like Ms. Le Pen could reach the second round of voting over the established parties, and then collect more than a third of the vote, was stark evidence of the despair of what she calls \u201cles oubli\u00e9s,\u201d \u201cthe forgotten.\u201dIn a victory address before a vast throng of cheering supporters in the courtyard of the Louvre, Mr. Macron acknowledged the divisions in French society and repeatedly invoked the \u201cimmense task\u201d that lies ahead. That begins immediately: Achieving any of his goals, which include reforming the stultifying French labor code, a perennial frustration for businesses, and cutting the bloated ranks of public employees, will require another political feat next month when France votes for a new National Assembly. Mr. Macron\u2019s fledgling party plans to run candidates in all districts.All that lies ahead. For now, there is the satisfaction that despite the breakdown of traditional parties, despite considerable malaise in the French and European publics, and despite the email hack (causing fingers to be pointed at a familiar target, Moscow) French voters were not seduced by nativist illusions and instead chose a youthful and optimistic president who believes that France must remain open, progressive, tolerant and European.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Wants Fish, So Africa Goes Hungry", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byEditorialOf all the stresses that humans have inflicted on the world\u2019s oceans, including pollution and global warming, industrial fishing ranks high. For years, trawlers capable of scouring the ocean floor, and factory ships trailing driftnets and longlines baited with thousands of hooks, have damaged once-abundant fisheries to the point where, the United Nations says, 90 percent of them are now fully exploited or facing collapse.With its own waters heavily overfished, and being forced to forage elsewhere to feed its people, the Chinese government commands a fleet of nearly 2,600 vessels, 10 times larger than the United States fleet, all heavily subsidized. As Zhang Hongzhou of Singapore\u2019s Nanyang Technological University observes, \u201cFor China\u2019s leaders, ensuring a steady supply of aquatic products is not just about good economics but social stability and political legitimacy.\u201dThe good news, such as it is, is that some nations whose waters are at risk are rebelling, and the Chinese may slowly be getting the message. Indonesia has impounded scores of Chinese boats caught poaching in its waters, and Argentina sunk a Chinese vessel after it tried to ram a coast guard ship. There have been clashes between Chinese fishermen and the authorities in South Korea.China has pledged to cut fuel subsidies to its fleet by 60 percent by 2019. \u201cThe era of fishing any way you want, wherever you want, has passed,\u201d says Liu Xinzhong, deputy general director of the Bureau of Fisheries in Beijing. In January, China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture announced measures aimed at protecting China\u2019s own fisheries, including possible catch limits.That could eventually take some pressure off African and other international waters. So could the international compact known formally as the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, which went into effect last year. The treaty seeks to identify fishing vessels, tracking where they fish and how much fish they are harvesting. The United States ratified the agreement in 2016. As of last week, 44 other countries and the European Union had also signed on.China, regrettably, has yet to do so. Beijing may be feeling the world\u2019s censure. But it has a very long way to go before it becomes a responsible steward of the oceans\u2019 threatened and not inexhaustible resources.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Beauty Product\u2019s Ads Exclude the Black Women Who Use It", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLast week, the hair-care line SheaMoisture faced a powerful customer backlash. The offense was a series of online video clips that highlighted the versatility of the brand\u2019s shampoos, conditioners and styling aids.When the video was released on social media, SheaMoisture\u2019s black customers revolted. Social media users with huge followings, many of whom have provided years of free advertising for the brand, criticized it as marginalizing their loyal black buyers in an effort to attract white women.When black women bought SheaMoisture products, they were rejecting powerful stereotypes about black women\u2019s hair as inherently unattractive. Unwittingly or not, SheaMoisture was part of a political project for black women, helping us resist harmful biases about our natural hair that circumscribe our choices and well-being.To believe it is possible to diversify SheaMoisture beyond its black natural-hair customer base, one must believe that black beauty is desirable for non-black consumers. For that to be true, black women would have to be an ideal beauty type in the global market that Mr. Dennis was going after. Mr. Dennis had one problem: reality.The sociologist Margaret Hunter writes about a concept she calls the beauty queue: a hierarchy of desirable female characteristics. At the head of the queue are white women with pale skin, narrow features and straight (ideally blond) hair. Behind them are the rest of the world\u2019s women, in descending order from most to least white-looking, with black women at the end. This theory describes what black women in the United States have experienced for two centuries: lighter skin and \u201cAnglo\u201d features are a type of global capital that derives its value from the status of white people.These products are selling a very specific version of Korean beauty. Their advertisements do not reflect the full range of skin tones of Asian women. Instead, they feature remarkably pale women selling products whose primary selling point is how \u201cluminescent\u201d they will make skin appear. K-beauty is noted for its many \u201cwhitening\u201d products, from soaps to treatments. They have names like Missha Time Revolution White Cure Blanc Tone-Up Cream, Klavuu White Pearlsation Pearl Serum Mask, and Skinfood Yuja Water C Whitening Ampoule. Products like these reinforce white women\u2019s position at the head of the beauty queue. They are ultimately selling the idea summarized in a black Southern folk saying: \u201cWhite is all right; Brown get out of town; Black jump back.\u201dSheaMoisture could not sell a product meant to make black women look \u201cwhiter,\u201d such as a chemical treatment to straighten hair, without changing its entire product line. But it could concede to the demands of capital by marketing its existing products to non-black women. SheaMoisture eventually apologized, acknowledging the insult many black women felt. By prominently featuring white women in what had become a political project, the company had signaled to black women that we could never be enough.Beauty is never just about preference. It is about economics and power and exclusion. Brands like SheaMoisture rely on certain ideas of what is beautiful to make money. And too often, selling beauty means throwing black women under the bus.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Behind China\u2019s $1 Trillion Plan to Shake Up the Economic Order", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported byVANG VIENG, Laos \u2014 Along the jungle-covered mountains of Laos, squads of Chinese engineers are drilling hundreds of tunnels and bridges to support a 260-mile railway, a $6 billion project that will eventually connect eight Asian countries.Chinese money is building power plants in Pakistan to address chronic electricity shortages, part of an expected $46 billion worth of investment.Chinese planners are mapping out train lines from Budapest to Belgrade, Serbia, providing another artery for Chinese goods flowing into Europe through a Chinese-owned port in Greece.The massive infrastructure projects, along with hundreds of others across Asia, Africa and Europe, form the backbone of China\u2019s ambitious economic and geopolitical agenda. President Xi Jinping of China is literally and figuratively forging ties, creating new markets for the country\u2019s construction companies and exporting its model of state-led development in a quest to create deep economic connections and strong diplomatic relationships.The initiative, called \u201cOne Belt, One Road,\u201d looms on a scope and scale with little precedent in modern history, promising more than $1 trillion in infrastructure and spanning more than 60 countries. To celebrate China\u2019s new global influence, Mr. Xi is gathering dozens of state leaders, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in Beijing on Sunday.It is global commerce on China\u2019s terms.Mr. Xi is aiming to use China\u2019s wealth and industrial know-how to create a new kind of globalization that will dispense with the rules of the aging Western-dominated institutions. The goal is to refashion the global economic order, drawing countries and companies more tightly into China\u2019s orbit.The projects inherently serve China\u2019s economic interests. With growth slowing at home, China is producing more steel, cement and machinery than the country needs. So Mr. Xi is looking to the rest of the world, particularly developing countries, to keep its economic engine going.\u201cPresident Xi believes this is a long-term plan that will involve the current and future generations to propel Chinese and global economic growth,\u201d said Cao Wenlian, director general of the International Cooperation Center of the National Development and Reform Commission, a group dedicated to the initiative. \u201cThe plan is to lead the new globalization 2.0.\u201dMr. Xi\u2019s plan stands in stark contrast to President Trump and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra. The Trump administration walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the American-led trade pact that was envisioned as a buttress against China\u2019s growing influence.As head of the Communist Party, Mr. Xi is promoting global leadership in China\u2019s own image, emphasizing economic efficiency and government intervention. And China is corralling all manner of infrastructure projects under the plan\u2019s broad umbrella, without necessarily ponying up the funds.China is moving so fast and thinking so big that it is willing to make short-term missteps for what it calculates to be long-term gains. Even financially dubious projects in corruption-ridden countries like Pakistan and Kenya make sense for military and diplomatic reasons.The United States and many of its major European and Asian allies have taken a cautious approach to the project, leery of bending to China\u2019s strategic goals. Some, like Australia, have rebuffed Beijing\u2019s requests to sign up for the plan. Despite projects on its turf, India is uneasy because Chinese-built roads will run through disputed territory in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.But it is impossible for any foreign leader, multinational executive or international banker to ignore China\u2019s push to remake global trade.Germany\u2019s minister of economics and energy, Brigitte Zypries, plans to attend the meeting in Beijing. Western industrial giants like General Electric and Siemens are coming, as they look for lucrative contracts and try to stay in China\u2019s good graces.The Trump administration just upgraded its participation.As the sun beat down on Chinese workers driving bulldozers, four huge tractor-trailers rolled into a storage area here in Vang Vieng, a difficult three-hour drive over potholed roads from the capital, Vientiane. They each carried massive coils of steel wire.Half a mile away, a Chinese cement mixing plant with four bays glistened in the sun. Nearby, along a newly laid road, another Chinese factory was providing cement for tunnel construction.Nearly everything for the Laos project is made in China. Almost all the labor force is Chinese. At the peak of construction, there will be an estimated 100,000 Chinese workers.When Mr. Xi announced the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan in September 2013, it was clear that Beijing needed to do something for the industries that had succeeded in building China\u2019s new cities, railways and roads \u2014 state-led investment that turned it into an economic powerhouse. China did not have a lot left to build, and growth started to sputter.Each nation in Mr. Xi\u2019s plan brings its own strategic advantages.The power plants in Pakistan, as well as upgrades to a major highway and a $1 billion port expansion, are a political bulwark. By prompting growth in Pakistan, China wants to blunt the spread of Pakistan\u2019s terrorists across the border into the Xinjiang region, where a restive Muslim population of Uighurs resides. It has military benefits, providing China\u2019s navy future access to a remote port at Gwadar managed by a state-backed Chinese company with a 40-year contract.In Kenya, China is upgrading a railway from the port of Mombasa to Nairobi that will make it easier to get Chinese goods into the country. The Kenyan government had been unable to persuade others to do the job, whereas China has been transforming crumbling infrastructure in Africa for more than a decade.The rail line, which is set to start running next month, is the first to be built to Chinese standards outside China. The country will benefit for years from maintenance contracts.\u201cChina\u2019s Belt and Road initiative is starting to deliver useful infrastructure, bringing new trade routes and better connectivity to Asia and Europe,\u201d said Tom Miller, author of \u201cChina\u2019s Asian Dream: Empire Building Along the New Silk Road.\u201d \u201cBut Xi will struggle to persuade skeptical countries that the initiative is not a smokescreen for strategic control.\u201dIt is a fast start to a much-delayed program that may bring only limited benefits to the agrarian country.For years, Laos and China sparred over financing. With the cost running at nearly $6 billion, officials in Laos wondered how they would afford their share. The country\u2019s output is just $12 billion annually. A feasibility study by a Chinese company said the railway would lose money for the first 11 years.Such friction is characteristic.In Indonesia, construction of a high-speed railway between Jakarta and Bandung finally began last month after arguments over land acquisition. In Thailand, the government is demanding better terms for a vital railway.China\u2019s outlays for the plan so far have been modest: Only $50 billion has been spent, an \u201cextremely small\u201d amount relative to China\u2019s domestic investment program, said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.Even China\u2019s good friends so far are left wanting. Mr. Xi attended a groundbreaking ceremony in 2014 in Tajikistan for a gas pipeline, but the project stalled after Beijing\u2019s demand waned.Mr. Putin will be at the center of the Beijing conference. While two companies owned by one of his closest friends, Gennady Timchenko, have benefited from projects, there has not been much else for Russia.\u201cRussia\u2019s elites\u2019 high expectations regarding Belt and Road have gone through a severe reality check, and now oligarchs and officials are skeptical about practical results,\u201d said Alexander Gabuev, senior associate at the Carnegie Center in Moscow.China is making calculations that the benefits will outweigh the risks.The investments could complicate Beijing\u2019s effort to stem the exodus of capital outflow that have been weighing on the economy. The cost could also come back to haunt China, whose banks are being pressed to lend to projects that they find less than desirable. By some estimates, over half the countries that have accepted Belt and Road projects have credit ratings below investment grade.\u201cA major constraint in investor enthusiasm,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, \u201cis that many countries in the Central Asian region, where the initial thrust of the initiative is focused, suffer from weak and unstable economies, poor public governance, political stability and corruption.\u201dLaos is one of the risky partners. The Communist government is a longstanding friend of China. But fearing China\u2019s domination, Laos is casting around for other friends as well, including China\u2019s regional rivals Japan and Vietnam.After five years of negotiations over the rail line, Laos finally got a better deal. Laos has an $800 million loan from China\u2019s Export-Import Bank and agreed to form a joint venture with China that will borrow much of the rest.Still, Laos faces a huge debt burden. The International Monetary Fund warned this year that the country\u2019s reserves stood at two months of prospective imports of goods and services. It also expressed concerns that public debt could rise to around 70 percent of the economy.As construction gathers steam, nearby communities are starting to rumble.Farmers are balking at giving up their land. Some members of the national assembly have raised questions about property rights.In the past, he said, the government had promised $10 for an acre of land worth about $100. \u201cBut then they never paid it,\u201d Mr. Sipaseuth added.Was the rail project good for Laos?\u201cWe need civilization. Laos is very poor, very underdeveloped,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how many Chinese will come here? Too many is not a good idea.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trade Deals Retains a Hurdle for \u2018Brexit\u2019 Talks", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The European Union\u2019s highest court ruled on Tuesday that a 2014 trade deal with Singapore required the approval of parliaments from the bloc\u2019s 28 members, leaving in place an obstacle to future negotiations \u2014 including talks with Britain over its withdrawal from the union.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, has concluded many aspects of trade deals in the past, and Tuesday\u2019s ruling mostly supported that approach. Yet in maintaining the status quo, the court also made clear that parts of trade agreements, particularly those that concerned investment, were contingent on approval by national governments, leaving them open to shifting domestic politics.Although the impasse was eventually resolved, the dispute highlighted the extent to which a vast array of groups can effectively veto deals that can take years to negotiate.\u201cWhat the court basically said is that E.U. member states have a say in this,\u201d said Anahita Thoms, a D\u00fcsseldorf-based trade lawyer with the British law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. \u201cIt reinforces the principle that the E.U. does not have exclusive competence here.\u201d\u201cNegotiating trade deals is complicated,\u201d she added, \u201cand this judgment will not lessen the complications associated with trade deals.\u201dThe ruling comes amid growing anti-trade sentiment across much of the Western world, including in the European Union. A complex and far-reaching trade deal between the bloc and the United States was essentially abandoned in the final months of the Obama administration in the face of opposition from left-wing groups in Europe.The debate over trade policy has pitted mainstream politicians, who say the agreements spread prosperity, against opponents \u2014 including parties on the extreme right and left \u2014 who say that the deals give corporations too much power and erode national sovereignty.While the ruling itself pertains to a trade deal with Singapore, its impacts could be far-reaching, potentially affecting Britain\u2019s negotiations to leave the European Union.The British government has suggested it will seek a broad-ranging trade deal with the European Union, but others have noted that such agreements typically take several years to reach and that time is limited.Negotiations on the withdrawal must conclude by early 2019, when the clock runs out on Britain\u2019s membership in the bloc, and a ruling that affirmed agreements like the one with Singapore would have eliminated at least one layer of complexity.Tuesday\u2019s ruling did not, however, do so.Margaritis Schinas, the chief spokesman for the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc, said in a statement that the ruling affirmed \u201cthe division of competences between the E.U. and the member states.\u201d He added that officials would still need to \u201ccarefully assess and analyze the opinion\u201d in order to find \u201cthe way forward.\u201dThe ruling on Tuesday is final, according to officials at the court.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jobless Rate at 10-Year Low as Hiring Grows and Wages Rise", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byThe jobless rate dropped to 4.4 percent in April, the lowest level in more than a decade, the government said on Friday, signaling the economy\u2019s resilience and showing a labor market closing in on full capacity.The economic anxiety and uneven fortunes that figured so prominently in the presidential campaign have not disappeared, particularly outside of the country\u2019s flourishing urban centers. Wage growth was also modest, with the year-over-year increase staying just baby steps ahead of inflation.But some of the labor force\u2019s weakest corners improved, with declines in the ranks of discouraged workers and of those working part time who would prefer full-time jobs. The average monthly gain in jobs since February reached 174,000.\u201cGreat news,\u201d Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said Friday morning on Twitter, adding in a later statement that further work was needed \u201con bridging the skills gap and on expanding opportunity.\u201dRepublicans were not alone in paying homage to the labor market\u2019s strength.\u201cThe momentum in the job market is really impressive,\u201d said Jason Furman, the chief economic adviser during the Obama administration. \u201cI\u2019m frankly surprised that this late into an expansion the economy is still adding jobs well above the steady-state pace.\u201dThe April figures renewed a conversation among economists about whether the economy was at \u201cfull employment,\u201d the point at which everyone who wants a job can get one at the current level of pay.There was less agreement on who deserved the credit. Republicans crowed about how many jobs had been created since President Trump took office in January, while Democrats pointed to the ongoing economic legacy of President Barack Obama.Three months is still a short span in the life of an administration, and Mr. Trump has not yet pushed through the main planks of his pro-growth agenda like tax reform or a large investment in infrastructure. Even so, some economists gave the president credit for a jump in optimism.Mr. Holtz-Eakin added that Mr. Trump\u2019s freezing of new regulations and elimination of others were having a measurable impact.\u201cThe observed pace of regulatory activity has come to a standstill,\u201d he said. In contrast, he argued, a persistent rollout of regulations by the Obama administration had added millions of dollars in costs for businesses each week.Another major factor in the economy\u2019s performance is, of course, the Federal Reserve Board, which put a confident stamp on the economy this week and plans to raise interest rates further this year.The jobs report on Friday strengthens that case, though another report is due before Fed policy makers meet again in June. And the wide swing between March\u2019s disappointing jobs growth figure, which was revised to 79,000, and April\u2019s vibrant one was a useful reminder that every monthly jobs report provides only a temporary and incomplete snapshot of the economy.Whatever effect Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are having so far, economists agree that presidents always tend to be given much more responsibility for the economy\u2019s ups and downs than they deserve. \u201cWe have a big, big economy and the overall shape is made by millions and millions of individual decisions,\u201d said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cWe tend to give too much emphasis to role of the president.\u201dCertainly, the administration\u2019s solidly pro-business agenda has buoyed many executives. At the same time, they have steadily complained about a growing shortage of workers.\u201cIt\u2019s not an employer\u2019s market,\u201d said Patrick Bass, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp North America, which makes elevators, steel and other industrial products.Based in Germany, Thyssenkrupp employs more than 15,000 people in the United States, but \u201cthe labor market is very competitive at all levels,\u201d Mr. Bass said. \u201cWe have more positions open than we\u2019ve been able to fill.\u201dYet if shortages were as acute as advertised, then wages would be bid up at a faster rate. Average hourly earnings, though, rose by 0.3 percent in April, bringing the year-over-year growth to 2.5 percent. Last year at this time, increases were the same but inflation was lower, further shrinking the impact of any wage increases.Employers must decide whether to buy skills or to build them, said Michael Stull, a senior vice president at the staffing company Manpower North America. The small pressure on wages, he said, is evidence that they have been trying to buy them, but more businesses are expressing an interest in partnerships with educational institutions or in developing skills so that new hires \u201ccan earn while they learn.\u201dWorkers with fewer skills or less experience can often be hired at a cut rate. Some may have come from the ranks of part-time workers who want full-time jobs and of those who had previously been too discouraged to look. There was a sharp drop last month in the broader measure of unemployment, which includes individuals in both categories, to 8.6 percent from 8.9 percent. That is close to the prerecession rate.Less encouraging was a dip in the proportion of adults who have a job or want one. That measure, known as the labor participation rate, edged down to 62.9 percent last month from 63 percent, a sign that workers who had been sidelined are not being drawn back into the labor market.\u201cThis gets to be the real issue,\u201d said Diane Swonk, founder of DS Economics in Chicago. \u201cAs good as this report is, it points to how hard it is to bring in those marginalized workers. With skills erosion, people in long-term unemployment have gotten into a vicious cycle. An incoming tide does not lift all boats.\u201dAnd the divisions among Republicans in Washington that have left the future of the Affordable Care Act uncertain even after the House vote on Thursday to repeal it have put some employers in a wait-and-see mode.Ms. Swonk noted, for example, that while hiring in health care and social-assistance jobs was up by 37,000, the monthly average in the sector was down from last year at the same time. \u201cHealth care employment since the beginning of the year is not the driver it once was,\u201d Ms. Swonk said, calling it a \u201cresidual of uncertainty regarding health care coverage.\u201d(The biggest gains were found in the leisure and hospitality sectors. \u201cThey\u2019re not buying cars, but they\u2019re buying vacations,\u201d Mr. Swonk said.)Owners of small and medium-size businesses tell pollsters that they are optimistic about the economy, despite several weak economic indicators, said Catherine Barrera, an economics professor at Cornell University and the chief economic adviser for ZipRecruiter, an online jobs platform. But many employers have yet to act on their stated intentions to add workers. \u201cThe thing that stands out most,\u201d Ms. Barrera said, is the \u201cgap between that optimism and the follow-through on that optimism.\u201dMatthew Dolly, director of research at Transwestern, a national commercial real estate firm, said: \u201cBusinesses want to hire and planned on hiring. But until policies are ironed out, hiring will remain stagnant for a bit while that happens.\u201dEven after a policy is carried out, it can take time before the effect kicks in. When it comes to individual tax cuts, for example, consumers have historically started to spend only when the extra money is in hand, not when it is promised, said William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Gauging the impact on businesses is much more complicated.\u201cWe generally think it takes about a decade for the economic effects of a tax plan to fully phase in,\u201d said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the conservative Tax Foundation.And maybe not even then, given how many variables affect investment and the economy, said Alan Viard, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\u201cYou might never be able to pin down what happened due to the tax cut, as there would be no way to know what would have happened without the tax cut,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t observe the path not taken.\u201dNelson D.

{"Headline": "There Was No \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of Air Travel", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byOpinionIt\u2019s pile-on time for America\u2019s commercial airlines. The contempt people hold for them has long been severe, but following a raft of highly publicized incidents, resentment has hit a fever pitch.It started about a month ago, with the forced removal of a passenger onboard a United Express flight. This was followed by several more airlines-behaving-badly controversies, up to and including the death of Simon, a giant rabbit who perished after a London-to-Chicago United flight. Over and over we are reminded about the hellishness that is commercial flying. Enabled by cellphone cameras and the catalyst of social media, even the most mundane boarding snafu or onboard fracas has been getting its 15 minutes.I\u2019m a commercial pilot, so I take some of this personally. I also think it\u2019s time for a slightly different perspective.People often talk about a proverbial \u201cgolden age\u201d of air travel, and if only we could return to it. That\u2019s an easy sentiment to sympathize with. I\u2019m old enough to recall when people actually looked forward to flying. I remember a trip to Florida in 1979, and my father putting on a coat and tie for the occasion. I remember cheesecake desserts on a 60-minute flight in economy. Yes, things were once a little more comfortable, a little more special.For my parents\u2019 generation, it cost several thousand dollars in today\u2019s money to travel to Europe. Even coast-to-coast trips were something relatively few could afford. As recently as the 1970s, an economy ticket from New York to Hawaii cost nearly $3,000, adjusted for inflation.Not only are tickets cheaper, but we have got a wider range of options. There are planes going everywhere, all the time. Pretty much any two major cities in the world are now connected through at most one stop: Los Angeles to Delhi; New York to Fuzhou, China; Toronto to Nairobi. Overall journey times used to be much longer, and flying from the United States to points overseas meant having to connect at one of only a handful of gateway airports, with additional stops beyond.Even well into the jet age, what today would be a simple nonstop or one-stop itinerary could include multiple stopovers. Not just internationally, but domestically, too: Three stops in a DC-9 to reach St. Louis from Albany, then another two stops on the trunk route over to Seattle or San Francisco.Sure, you had more legroom and a hot meal. It also took you 14 hours to fly coast-to-coast, or two-and-a-half days to reach Karachi, Pakistan. Miss your flight? The next one didn\u2019t leave in 90 minutes; it left the following day \u2014 or the following week.I could mention, too, that the airplanes of decades past were louder \u2014 few things were more deafening than a 707 at takeoff thrust \u2014 and more gas-guzzling and polluting. And if, in 2017, you\u2019re put off by a lack of legroom or having to pay for a sandwich, how would you feel about sitting for eight hours in a cabin filled with tobacco smoke? As recently as the 1990s, smoking was still permitted on airplanes.As for legroom, there\u2019s that conventional wisdom again, contending that airlines are forever cramming more rows into their aircraft. Except it\u2019s not necessarily true. The spacing between rows, called \u201cpitch\u201d in the business, is, on average, less than it was 20 or 30 years ago \u2014 and yes, passengers themselves have become larger on average \u2014 but only slightly. Remember Laker Airways, whose \u201cSkytrain\u201d service ran between the United States and London in the 1970s and early \u201980s? Sir Freddie Laker, the airline\u2019s flamboyant founder, configured his DC-10s with a bone-crunching 345 seats \u2014 about a hundred more than the typical DC-10 at the time.And what\u2019s that in front of you? It\u2019s a personal video screen with hundreds of on-demand movies and TV shows. No, not every carrier has these, but on longer flights it\u2019s a standard amenity, along with USB and power ports. Onboard Wi-Fi is widespread. Remember when the \u201cin-flight movie\u201d was projected onto a blurry bulkhead screen, and you listened through one of those stethoscope-style headsets with jagged plastic cups that scratched into your ear?Up front, in first or business class, forget it. You can have your Pullman berths and caviar on the flying boats of the 1940s, trundling along noisily, 17 hours from New York to Paris. You can have your tuxedoed stewards and your piano lounges in the old 747 upper deck. I\u2019ll take the state-of-the-art sleeper seat and 25-inch screen; the electric privacy barrier and five-course dinner presentation. It\u2019s no contest; premium class has never been as swanky or as comfortable as it is today.Then there\u2019s safety.Globally \u2014 catastrophes like those involving Malaysia Airlines Flights 17 and 370 included \u2014 the last 10 years have been the safest in the history of commercial aviation. Here in North America the stats are even more astonishing: There has not been a major crash involving an American legacy carrier in more than 15 years. By comparison, in 1985, 27 air disasters killed almost 2,500 people worldwide. During the 1960s, the United States saw an average of four major crashes every year. United alone had seven major accidents in a five-year span.The 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s also were rife with terrorist bombings and hijackings: Pan Am 103, Air-India, UTA and TWA, among others. Between the late \u201960s and early \u201970s, American commercial aircraft were hijacked at a rate of nearly once per week. Airport terminal attacks were frequent throughout that era as well.For a number of reasons \u2014 technological, regulatory and infrastructural \u2014 aviation accidents have become a lot fewer and farther between. There are twice as many planes in the air as there were just 25 years ago, yet the rate of fatal accidents per miles flown has been steadily falling. The International Civil Aviation Organization reports that for every million flights the chance of a crash is one-sixth what it was in 1980. Hijackings and terrorist attacks, for all of the attention lavished on their mere possibility, have become even rarer.There\u2019s no denying that airlines today could and should do a better job \u2014 at communicating, at treating their customers with dignity and respect. I\u2019m well acquainted with the nuisances of modern-day air travel: I don\u2019t enjoy claustrophobic planes, delays, noisy airports or wasteful security practices any more than you do.Advertisement"}

Uber prohibited employees from using the software after The New York Times wrote about it in March.The investigation adds to Uber\u2019s growing list of problems, which includes issues with its internal culture and lawsuits from other companies.Jessica Golloher, a former Fox News Radio reporter, said she was subjected to gender discrimination over several years. She has said that less than 24 hours after she reported the problem, she was told that the company was eliminating her position.The troubles at Fox News could leak into other parts of the 21st Century Fox empire: Wendy Walsh, who accused Bill O\u2019Reilly of sexual harassment, said she would appear before Ofcom, the British regulator assessing 21st Century Fox\u2019s attempt to take over Sky, the satellite TV giant.At the same time, Fox News is under a federal investigation into settlements made by 21st Century Fox, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who say that a former public relations chief has been subpoenaed and granted immunity from prosecution.A former chief financial officer has also been subpoenaed and given immunity, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.It seemed like an easy bet: Buy up Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds at a discount, pocket the high interest and persuade politicians to make decisions that would raise the value of the investments.The logic was sound \u2014 even if Puerto Rico\u2019s economy and government fell apart, the island was legally barred from declaring bankruptcy as a way to shed its debts.So, of course, hedge funds piled in.Unfortunately for them, Puerto Rico did essentially file for bankruptcy in federal court on Wednesday, under a law passed last summer.And to rub salt in the wound, the filing came just days after those hedge funds thought they had cut a deal with the government to avoid that step.The problem for the funds is that while many think they should be first in line for the money, Puerto Rico has to keep paying police officers and teachers while it struggles to raise revenue.They have among them firms like Aurelius Capital, which fought Argentina in court for years over its sovereign debt default and succeeded in pressuring the government in Buenos Aires to pay up. And mutual fund managers, like Oppenheimer and Franklin Templeton, are also fighting for repayment.\u201cYou will see lawyers much more frequently, in my view, taking positions that are at the very edge of what could be considered permissible under the law because they feel they need to impress the client with how aggressive and tough and creative they are and I think that is an unfortunate trend.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Pet Grooming, a Growing Business and a Competitive Landscape", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipSECAUCUS, N.J. \u2014 Midcareer changes are not uncommon on Wall Street, but when Tania Isenstein quit her job at Goldman Sachs in 2012, her family and friends were shocked by what path she opted for instead: pet care.\u201cI just couldn\u2019t get myself out of bed in the morning,\u201d she recalled of the job burnout she felt, 17 years into a career as a lawyer for the investment bank.So she bought Camp Canine, a struggling pet care business on the street where she lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and where she had taken her own dog.Five years later, she employs 40 people, including five groomers.Many owners and workers in the pet care sector describe similar feelings, realizing that working with animals, and getting a creative outlet in the process, is their true calling. And, when it comes to pet groomers in particular, their number is growing.The field is not for everyone. Schools such as the New York-based American Academy of Pet Grooming charge about $5,000 for basic grooming lessons, which can take nine months, depending on how quickly students fulfill the classroom hours requirement, or more than $6,500 for more advanced grooming techniques. In 2015, non-farm-animal caretakers, the job category that includes pet groomers, earned a median salary of $21,010.But training often takes place on the job, and would-be groomers can apply for apprenticeships. Full-time courses, meanwhile, often offer job placements with local salons.Ms. Jordan said she quit her job at a debt collection firm 13 years ago to become a groomer and hasn\u2019t looked back: \u201cIt changed my whole life.\u201dBut while some groomers have transitioned into the job, others have been training for it for years.Mackensie Murphy, a nationally ranked competitive pet groomer, learned the art from her mother, Jodi Murphy, another top-ranked groomer. Mackensie Murphy began when she was 18, and, like her mother, has represented the United States in competitions internationally.Ms. Murphy, who charges from $150 to $180 for a house call, specializes in cocker spaniels, poodles and Bedlington terriers, and recently ranked first in a contest at Intergroom, an annual trade show in New Jersey.Ms. Murphy had attended art school in Cincinnati, but said she quickly realized there were limited job opportunities with a degree in the arts. Instead, she said, \u201cI channeled my medium of choice into sculpting dog fur.\u201dIntergroom is co-owned by Christine DeFilippo.Ms. DeFilippo, a pet groomer from Massachusetts, got into the industry as a \u201cfluke\u201d after a career as a surgical dental assistant. She was looking for something new to do, and ended up buying a friend\u2019s grooming salon after a year of training. That was 40 years ago.Trade shows \u2014 there are now several a year around the country \u2014 are where quasi-celebrity groomers like Ms. Murphy show off their competitive chops. The prize money may not be huge \u2014 $1,500 was the top prize at the four-day Intergroom event last month in Secaucus, N.J. \u2014 but the publicity can help a business and the participants say the contests can be fun.A popular contest category at the Secaucus event was \u201ccreative,\u201d where groomers dyed pets with safe, bright colors and groomed their fur into temporary sculptures of cartoon characters or mythical beasts.Adriane Pope and Cindy Oliver, friends on the competition circuit, said they each spent 20 to 40 hours preparing their poodles over two or more weeks for the competition. The process involved copious amounts of spray paint, canine hair spray, and a dab here or there of Elmer\u2019s glue.\u201cThe prize money isn\u2019t enough to cover the dye,\u201d Ms. Pope said, preparing her vividly multicolored poodle to be transformed into an Alice in Wonderland tableau, featuring a purple Cheshire Cat and the Johnny Depp version of the Mad Hatter.She said she became a groomer in 1992 after \u201cflunking out of nursing school,\u201d and then opened her own mobile grooming business, Adriane\u2019s Groom and Go, in 1994. She also owns a bed-and-breakfast for dogs \u2014 Rivertown Bed and Biscuit in Conway, S.C. \u2014 and enters four to six competitions a year, she said.Ms. Oliver was working on a 1980s-themed design for her dog, including depictions of the movie alien E.T. and the television character Alf, as well as Strawberry Shortcake and a Care Bear. The E.T. image had a Christmas tree light illuminating his heart and his index finger \u2014 the one he used to point to the sky when he wanted to \u201cphone home.\u201dShe has been a groomer for 21 years and owns Rollin\u2019 Doghouse Mobile Pet Grooming in Cleveland, Tenn., where she lives. She won the creative category at last year\u2019s Intergroom competition with a safari-themed dog.In the recent competition, eight groomers brought their dogs out to the exhibition hall shortly after lunch for final touches. The animals stood calmly on tables as their groomers spray-dyed final details, trimmed fur and made artistic adjustments. Then the judging began.The $1,500 top prize (and a trophy and ribbon) went to another past winner, Angela Kumpe, for her homage to Rocky Mountain National Park. The poodle\u2019s fur was molded and sculpted into a mountain lion, an elk and a bighorn sheep.Ms. Kumpe, a hunting enthusiast from Little Rock, Ark., who owns a salon called Angela\u2019s Grooming, said the dye work alone took six to eight hours, doing it in sections and one leg at a time so the dog didn\u2019t have to sit around too long at any one spell.But the dogs don\u2019t stay fancy for long, and as soon as the contest was over, most groomers were planning to give their pets a bath.\u201cThe minute I let go of him, he ruins it immediately,\u201d Ms. Kumpe said. \u201cHe rolls around, the hair spray goes away.\u201d\u201cThey are dogs after all.\u201dTo subscribe to the weekly Entrepreneurship newsletter, email newsletters@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Recipients Fear Cuts to Food Stamps and Disability Aid in Trump Budget", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byJACKSON, Miss. \u2014 Hoyt Cantrell drove a truck for more than 20 years before seizures \u2014 23 of them since 2009 \u2014 cost him his livelihood. His two-bedroom house in the heart of this Southern state capital is partly boarded up, with no running water or electricity, but he cannot afford much better.He has tried hard to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance and food stamps. So far, he has failed.To President Trump, people like Mr. Cantrell are the exceptions in the expanding world of American poverty. In the view of his administration, access to food stamps is far too easy, and being on disability is just a matter of finding a friendly judge.\u201cWe need people to go to work,\u201d said Mick Mulvaney, the White House\u2019s budget director and the proposal\u2019s chief architect. \u201cIf you\u2019re on food stamps, and you\u2019re able-bodied, we need you to go to work. If you\u2019re on disability insurance, and you\u2019re not supposed to be \u2014 if you\u2019re not truly disabled, we need you to go back to work. We need everybody pulling in the same direction.\u201dMr. Cantrell, 50, is not surprised that Mr. Trump is trying to make a hard process even harder. \u201cThe bigwigs are going to do what they want anyway,\u201d Mr. Cantrell said. \u201cI just live day to day on what God gives me. But it\u2019s hard to do sometimes.\u201dTo Mr. Mulvaney, the president\u2019s proposal is the essence of compassion, a policy shift from Washington to move the poor from dependence to work \u2014 and on to true economic success. The population on food stamps has swollen drastically since the Great Recession of 2008, to a peak of almost 48 million in 2013, up from 28 million five years before.With the economy improved and employment nearing capacity, the number of people receiving food stamps remains stubbornly high; 44 million people received the benefit in 2016. Social Security Disability Insurance rolls have also been sticky. About 11 million people, including workers, spouses and children, were on disability in 2016, up from nine million in 2008 and six million in 1996.Such numbers have convinced supporters of work requirements that far too many people are taking advantage of the system. The federal government already requires some adults without dependents to work for benefits like food stamps and cash assistance. Now, more Americans \u2014 including possibly those with children and those who are older than 49 \u2014 could be required to work as well.\u201cYou need to make sure people on the programs taking in these benefits are actually eligible,\u201d said John Nothdurft, director of government relations at the Heartland Institute, a conservative research group in Illinois. \u201cSo the more we can get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, the better we can help the people who actually do need the assistance.\u201dBut advocates for the poor fear that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies underestimate the difficulty of obtaining benefits \u2014 and could overestimate the capacity of some beneficiaries to work.To most who see her, Shakeitha Perry would fit the definition of \u201cable-bodied adult,\u201d despite the $735 in disability and $56 in food stamps that she receives each month. Ms. Perry sometimes volunteers at a center to help other disabled people, has no children to care for at home and displays no obvious physical ailment.But for six years of her childhood, Ms. Perry was repeatedly molested and raped by her stepfather. She stopped speaking altogether after she was removed from her home, and when she finally could put together sentences again, she was left terrified of men, suffering through frequent panic attacks and navigating daily doses of medication to cope with bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety.Now she fears she could be a prime target as Mr. Trump takes a page from the 1990s welfare overhaul, which created work requirements and established time limits for public assistance.\u201cI don\u2019t think he knows how people like me will have to try to survive because of something he might do,\u201d Ms. Perry said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what I have to endure. He doesn\u2019t know what the next person has to endure.\u201dIn Knoxville, Tenn., Aaron Gilmore, 30, does not see an easy road to the dole, either. One day last week, he had spent the morning doing some paving work as a day laborer, bringing in less than $6 an hour, before stopping for something to eat at a homeless ministry.\u201cThey call this skid row,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad told me, \u2018Son, you don\u2019t want to end up there.\u2019 And that\u2019s where I ended up. It\u2019s just so hard here.\u201dHe knows about food stamps, having grown up on them. \u201cMy mother raised me and my sister by herself, my dad was always in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she worked as many jobs as she could.\u201d He was on food stamps himself, recently, but was kicked off by Tennessee\u2019s work requirements during a dry spell of finding jobs.His mother was also on disability, though it had taken her years to get it, despite a gunshot wound, hepatitis C and a host of other health problems. Though he has worked off and on at low-wage jobs \u2014 working in the kitchen at McDonald\u2019s, mowing lawns, doing day labor, jobs made difficult with no transportation and no reliable place to sleep \u2014 he has applied six times for disability benefits because of mental problems. He was denied all six times.\u201cI think disability is as strict as it could be right now,\u201d he said. Especially, he said, for people like those in this mission, who rely on caseworkers to help them with the most basic of tasks, \u201cjust getting from A to B.\u201dDespite what looks like swollen rosters, the current social safety net is largely underfunded, said Micah Dutro, a lawyer at Disability Rights Mississippi, a nonprofit that represents disabled clients. Many people who need help are not receiving it.Since last January, about 83,000 people receiving food stamps in Mississippi between the ages of 18 and 49 without dependents have been required to work, or prove they are looking for work, at least 20 hours a week to receive food stamps, according to Beth Orlansky, advocacy director of the Mississippi Center for Justice, a group focused on issues of racial and economic inequality. The rules originated a decade ago in Washington, but because of its high poverty rates, Mississippi had been allowed a waiver since 2006.This year, state officials chose not to apply for an extension of that waiver, and \u201cable-bodied adults\u201d got new rules, Ms. Orlansky said.While asking people to work might sound like a good idea \u201cin the abstract,\u201d she said, a state like Mississippi \u2014 with large pockets of poverty, sprawling rural communities and some of the highest rates of people on disability and food stamps \u2014 does not have enough jobs in the right places. Most people receiving food stamps and disability are doing some sort of work, but they need better skills and education to rise above poverty wages.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to pick on people who can\u2019t really stand up for themselves and point them out as leeches on the federal government,\u201d Ms. Orlansky said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not helpful to our society.\u201dMr. Dutro said he was particularly frustrated with the portrayal of disability as easy to get when in most cases it can take years of appeals and court hearings.\u201cWhen I hear people say that it is too easy to get on disability, I wonder what system they are talking about,\u201d he said.Melissa Cooper, 57, began receiving disability benefits shortly after a bullet tore through her spine and paralyzed her while she was sitting in a car outside a store in Memphis, Tenn. For 20 years she could not work as she learned to cope with life as a paraplegic and raise three children with the help of family. Then last year, she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in English at the University of Mississippi and got a job helping others who are disabled learn to live independently at the Living Independence for Everyone Center in Jackson.Mr. Trump\u2019s possible vetting of disabled benefits both scares and disturbs her.\u201cHe cannot put himself in my shoes and know the mental trauma associated with me having lost my mobility or how long it took me to get my head back on straight and to want to live,\u201d Ms. Cooper said as she shuffled in her wheelchair and began to cry.At the East Tennessee Technology Access Center, a nonprofit organization in Knoxville that helps people with disabilities learn to use technologies, there was only anxiety and gloom about the proposed changes.\u201cI keep thinking of something my grandmother used to say, about throwing the baby out with the bath water,\u201d said Joel Simmons, 55, a counselor at the center who seven years ago had his spinal cord transected in a car accident. \u201cAre we going to just have survival of the fittest?\u201dMr. Simmons\u2019s condition is easy to see. But there are others who unquestionably need these meager benefits, he said, but whose disabilities are not as immediately clear.\u201cWho\u2019s going to decide,\u201d he said of any plan to restrict access. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of hidden disabilities. Who\u2019s going to make these decisions? Donald Trump?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Spur Small Business, First Free the Banks", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSomewhere in the United States right now, an entrepreneur is having trouble getting a small-business loan for expansion. The reason? The bank is committed to keeping a large portion of its money in government debt instead.After the financial crisis, the government, in the form of the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, imposed liquidity requirements that force American banks with assets over $50 billion to hold huge amounts of government debt as liquid assets.Those assets represent $4.3 trillion in government debt, or about one-quarter of all American banking assets. They include $1.75 trillion in bank deposits (called excess reserves) held at the Fed, $1.5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (called government-sponsored-enterprise debt) and $560 billion in United States Treasuries.American banks are truly awash in government debt at five times pre-crisis levels. If President Trump wants to follow through on his promise to increase lending to small businesses, he should start by scaling back these requirements.Why do we have these rules? They are based on the idea that financial institutions need a cushion to protect them from runs on the bank. During a crisis, government debt can quickly be sold to meet withdrawals by panicking depositors and short-term creditors.But bank liquidity requirements come at a very high cost to the economy. Studies find that they reduce overall bank lending by 3 percent to 5 percent, and increase interest rates by 15 to 30 basis points. And indeed, small-business lending is down in the time since regulators imposed them.Ultimately, according to a survey of studies by the Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Research, liquidity requirements reduce economic growth by as much as three percentage points.These liquidity requirements will continue to tie banks\u2019 hands even if the Fed shrinks its balance sheet. When the Fed reduces its holdings of United States Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt, it must also reduce excess reserves that banks rely on to comply with liquidity requirements. As a result, American banks will have to buy more Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt and thus will not have increased spare capacity to lend privately to the small businesses and homeowners who need loans.Considering that the cost of bank liquidity requirements is clearly so high, they should provide commensurate stability to the financial system. Unfortunately, there is good reason for skepticism on this front.First, liquidity requirements cannot reduce the risk of a panic outside the commercial banking sector, like the panic in 2008 that included the otherwise solvent investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the affiliated broker-dealers of large banks and money market funds.Second, bank stores of government assets, while large, are still finite. Therefore, while those assets may reduce banks\u2019 need to hold a fire sale of harder-to-value assets, like small-business loans and mortgages, it does not eliminate the risk of a panic. Depositors and short-term creditors still have an incentive to run in a crisis.Worse still, bank liquidity requirements may worsen a crisis as banks are forced to hoard liquid assets and are thus unable to lend to one another. That\u2019s the worst medicine: In a crisis, you want banks to lend to other institutions that need money.Several prominent conservative economists and I have recently called for the Federal Reserve to establish a framework for any Fed lending during a financial crisis.A key contributor to the crisis in 2008 was that the Fed was simply not prepared, and therefore the market had no confidence that any financial institutions would be protected. Rather than relying on costly and untested liquidity requirements, what we need is for the Fed to have a plan for how it would value and lend against private collateral, including small-business loans and home mortgages, held by solvent financial institutions. Solvency determinations during a fast-moving crisis are too difficult. The Fed must plan ahead to protect the financial system by making loans immediately to solvent banks based on their balance sheets and avoid lending to insolvent institutions, such as A.I.G. in 2008.Liquidity requirements can\u2019t save us from the next crisis, and they can make that crisis worse. In the meantime, all the money stockpiled in banks would be better spent invested in companies to spur economic growth. It\u2019s time that small businesses across the country stopped paying for Wall Street\u2019s mistakes.Hal S.

{"Headline": "Agreements That Lock Up Workers, Legally", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe economy thrives when businesses compete with each other for workers and customers. That is hardly a new idea, but it bears repeating as companies increasingly use noncompete agreements to lock up employees and prevent them from taking better-paying or more fulfilling jobs.Proponents of noncompete agreements might argue that lawmakers don\u2019t need to intervene because these are private contracts between consenting adults. But researchers say many workers are not aware that they are subject to such agreements, which are often buried in documents they sign when hired. Often, people are not told that they will have to sign until they have accepted jobs, at which point they may not be able to walk away. Even workers who recognize the perils might see no choice but to consent because they need a job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Parable From Down Under for U.S. Climate Scientists", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byBy DegreesSpeaking softly and downing coffee at an outdoor cafe in this old port city, he sounded more like a fellow fresh off a jousting match. \u201cI think we had a win \u2014 a bigger win than I ever anticipated,\u201d Dr. Church said in an interview last month.Australian climate science went through an upheaval last year, one that engaged the press and the public in defending the importance of basic research. In the end, Dr. Church did indeed lose his job, but scores of his colleagues who had been marked for layoffs did not. Some of them view him as having sacrificed his career to save theirs.What happened in Australia shows the power of an informed citizenry keeping watch on its government. And it may turn out to be a precursor to an attack on fundamental climate research in the United States.Australian climate science is important not just for Australia, a country of 24 million people, but for the world. Australia is the most scientifically accomplished nation in the Southern Hemisphere, which has expanses of ocean and relatively little land.In effect, this small country is keeping an eye on half the planet for the rest of us.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Though Dr. Marshall is Australian, he made his name as a scientific researcher and entrepreneur in the United States. He went back to Australia with the goal of sprinkling some Silicon Valley pixie dust on the agency, doing more to turn its fundamental research into jobs and start-up companies to benefit the economy.Studying the agency\u2019s costs, Dr. Marshall and his aides decided that too many people were working on basic questions about the climate. If he laid off scores of them, he reasoned, he would have money to reinvest in other priorities. Those would include looking for ways to reduce emissions, and to adapt to climate changes that could no longer be avoided.When they found out about the plan, though, the agency\u2019s scientists were dumbfounded. They were entirely in favor of research on solutions, but the notion that basic climate monitoring and analysis could be scaled back struck them as preposterous.While the world\u2019s scientists have established that the planet is warming, that human activity is the main cause and that continued high emissions will pose profound risks, they are still far from having a complete understanding of the planetary climate.When Dr. Marshall\u2019s plan was unveiled, Australian researchers hit the panic button. Among those who swung into action was Dr. Church.Trying to allay suspicion about his motives, Dr. Marshall took pains to make clear that he accepted the basic findings of climate research. The climate \u201cabsolutely is changing,\u201d he declared before a committee of the Australian Senate. \u201cIt is changing, and we have to do something about it.\u201dExplaining the origins of the controversy, Dr. Marshall said in a recent telephone interview from Canberra, the national capital, \u201cUnfortunately, with a finite funding envelope, you\u2019ve got to make choices where you fund.\u201dDespite the government\u2019s efforts to quell the controversy, the proposed layoffs became an issue last summer in a hard-fought election campaign, part of a larger argument about the perceived weakness of Australia\u2019s climate policies.Originally, scores of scientists and staff members at a research center outside Melbourne had been marked for layoffs, but in the end only 20 or so left, many of them near or past retirement age. The center is now recruiting additional scientists, and may wind up larger than before the fight.In the interview, Dr. Marshall said he wished he had communicated more effectively with the agency\u2019s employees about the reasons for the shift in priorities. \u201cWe are a learning organization, and there are definitely things we\u2019d do differently,\u201d he said.As the controversy unfolded, Dr. Church was implacable in public, but he said in our interview that he had wrestled with major doubts.\u201cI had sleepless nights for months,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, am I doing the right thing by my colleagues? Am I looking after their positions, or am I making it worse for them and for the Australian public?\u201dThe end, he said, came as no great shock. He was on a research ship in the middle of the Southern Ocean when the word came down that his job would not be one of those being saved.\u201cI\u2019m still angry, in some sense,\u201d he said, citing certain colleagues in the agency who he felt had not defended the integrity of science at a critical moment.As Dr. Church and I were finishing our coffees, I noted that President Trump had offered a budget outline for the United States that, if enacted, would almost certainly require huge cuts in the basic scientific enterprise of monitoring and analyzing the climate.That means the citizenry in the United States, just as in Australia, is alert and watching. You can bet a lot of American scientists are thinking these days about how they will respond if the government starts gutting climate research.\u201cI guess somebody in the United States,\u201d Dr. Church said, \u201chas to step out into the public and do what I did.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the meantime, he is expected to name a prime minister and a cabinet.But if Mr. Macron\u2019s party does not win enough seats, the Assembly could essentially force him to choose another prime minister.The two mainstream parties \u2014 the Socialists and the Republicans \u2014 hope to reassert themselves in the legislative elections, as does the far-right National Front, led by Ms. Le Pen. The movement of the far-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon also hopes to do well.In short, the parliamentary elections could easily be a five-party affair, a reflection of the electorate\u2019s fragmentation and a loss of faith in mainstream parties.Richard Ferrand, the secretary general of Mr. Macron\u2019s movement \u2014 En Marche!, or Onward! \u2014 said at a news conference on Monday that the names of the party\u2019s candidates would be announced on Thursday. Half will come from civil society, and half will be women. He added that members of other parties would be allowed to run under the centrist banner, on the condition that they vote with Mr. Macron\u2019s government and sit in the majority group in Parliament.And En Marche! will soon sound a bit more like a traditional party. Mr. Ferrand said the name would be changed at a congress in mid-July to La R\u00e9publique en Marche, or Republic on the Move. Mr. Macron resigned as head of the movement after his election victory, and a temporary president has been appointed, Mr. Ferrand said.Sylvie Goulard, a centrist member of the European Parliament who supports Mr. Macron, told the CNews channel on Monday that Mr. Macron would go to Berlin for his first trip outside France, but that he might first visit French troops posted abroad.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany congratulated Mr. Macron on Monday on his \u201cspectacular\u201d victory. \u201cHe carries the hopes of millions of French people, and of many people in Germany and the whole of Europe,\u201d Ms. Merkel said at a news conference. \u201cHe ran a courageous pro-European campaign, stands for openness to the world and is committed decisively to a social market economy.\u201dMr. Hollande has privately complained that he was betrayed by Mr. Macron, his onetime prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but he showed no signs of bitterness on Monday.\u201cIt is true that he followed me for many years, but afterward he freed himself,\u201d Mr. Hollande said of Mr. Macron on Monday. \u201cHe wanted to propose a project to the French. It is up to him now, strengthened by the experience he has acquired with me, to continue his march. I wish him every success.\u201dPresident Vladimir V.

{"Headline": "Would Fees at the Met Deter Visitors?", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byJacob Maasland, an 8-year-old from New Zealand with an exuberant, toothy grin you can\u2019t say no to, wanted to see the mummies at the Metropolitan Museum of Art so badly that his parents didn\u2019t think twice about paying the Met\u2019s suggested admission fee of $25 per adult.\u201cI actually thought it was mandatory,\u201d Jacob\u2019s father, Tom Maasland, said of the fee.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible collection,\u201d added Shoshana Maasland, Jacob\u2019s mother. \u201cI would\u2019ve been prepared to pay the full amount anyway.\u201dIn conversations with tourists and visitors at the Met last week, there was some ambivalence about a mandatory fee for only non-New Yorkers, given that they were already spending a lot of money to visit. But there was also considerable openness to the idea that the Met\u2019s high quality justified some sort of admission payment.\u201cCharging people is O.K. but in my opinion, everyone should be charged,\u201d said Johannes Mueller, 27, who was in town from Munich for a conference on\u00a0digitalization. \u201cI feel like if you want to maintain that standard of art that\u2019s presented in there, it takes a lot of money and a lot of effort. I would be totally O.K. with paying for it. But then I would say equal treatment for everyone.\u201dNearly 40 percent of visitors to the Met are from outside of the country and an additional 24 percent are from outside of New York State, according to the museum. Susie Wilkening, a longtime museum consultant who is not associated with the Met, said she did not believe a mandatory fee would make any difference for average out-of-state tourists. More uncertain, she said, was the impact on visitors near and dear to New York City: its neighbors.\u201cWhat about people who live in New Jersey and Connecticut?\u201d Ms. Wilkening said. \u201cIf this were to go forward, I\u2019d love to see some accommodations made for residents in the metro area.\u201dYet some regulars love the Met so much that they don\u2019t need new enticements. Melinda Fuller, an art teacher from Connecticut who has visited the Met more than 50 times, excitedly said on her way out of the museum that she had just signed up become a member. She volunteered that she\u2019d be willing to pay $30 for admission.\u201cI think that\u2019s O.K., absolutely,\u201d Ms. Fuller said. \u201cI pay every time I go.\u201dThe current\u00a0\u201csuggested\u201d entrance fee at the Met is clear to some people but fuzzy to others, like Mr. Maasland from New Zealand. Once you walk in the front door of the Met, to get to an admissions desk, you can turn right and walk past a massive statue depicting an Egyptian pharaoh or swerve left and pass a marble sculpture of the Greek goddess Athena. Then you approach a desk, under a sign that reads: \u201cSuggested Admission: The amount you pay is up to you.\u201d But the museum has those suggestions, too: $25 for adults, $17 for seniors, $12 for students, and children under 12 go for free.According to the Association of Art Museum Directors, a 2016 survey of 219 museums in the United States, Canada and Mexico showed that 59 percent charge admission, 34 percent are free and 7 percent are suggested donations. A number of museums have shifted from a free-admissions model to a paid model in the last couple decades to increase revenue. The Albany Institute of History & Art, for instance, was free for all visitors before it closed in 1999 for renovations. When it reopened in the fall of 2001, it charged admission to everyone, including Albany residents. Of its $1.6 million budget, admissions fees generate about $70,000, a crucial revenue lifeline.\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about what it would be like not to charge admission again,\u201d said Tammis Groft, the museum\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe really don\u2019t feel at this time we could compensate without having significant funding that would cover it every year.\u201dThere are significant steps that remain before the admission fee becomes a reality. Museum officials said they still have to write a longer and more specific proposal for New York City, which then would have to approve it. The city and the museum will have to agree on terms, including the price of admission and how to delineate New York residents from tourists when many residents may not have New York identification.Ms. Wilkening, the museum consultant, said that if the fee is ultimately approved, the Met should emphasize its New York roots by doing away with any mention of a \u201csuggested\u201d donation for city and state residents.\u201cThey need to really own that this is free to New York State residents,\u201d she said.An article on Monday about the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s plan to begin charging a mandatory admission fee to visitors from outside New York State, using information from the museum, misstated the proportion of visitors who are from states other than New York. It is 24 percent, not 16 percent. (About 40 percent of visitors are from outside the United States.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congo Opposition Leader Died 3 Months Ago. He\u2019s Still Waiting to Be Buried.", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Joseph Kabila, the increasingly isolated president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, appears determined to silence opponents, even if they are dead.Congo is rich in minerals but is also one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. Mr. Kabila, who has ruled since 2001, after the assassination of his father that year, is suspected of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through fraudulent mining deals.On Friday, the former opposition leader\u2019s remains were finally set to arrive in Congo. They were to be buried at the headquarters of his party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, in Kinshasa, the capital. But the body never arrived, and is still in the morgue.In a series of episodes apparently intended to thwart the body\u2019s expected homecoming this week, a police vehicle and a police station in front of the opposition headquarters were set on fire on Tuesday by unidentified assailants. About 100 police officers quickly swarmed the area and surrounded the building.Since then, party officials, including F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, Mr. Tshisekedi\u2019s son and successor, have been denied entry to the headquarters or have had to shove their way through a cordon of police officers, said Abraham Luakabuanga, a party spokesman.Early Friday, the police padlocked the building, leaving 30 officials stuck inside, Mr. Luakabuanga said. \u201cIt\u2019s a frame-up to prevent the return of the body of our president, \u00c9tienne Tshisekedi, and to delay his funeral,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Kinshasa, referring to Mr. Tshisekedi\u2019s onetime position as head of the party.\u201cWhat we fear is that the police hide weapons that could compromise us, and use that as an excuse to lock the area down for even longer,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re returning to the era of Mobutu. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, referring to Mobutu Sese Seko, Congo\u2019s kleptocratic leader whom \u00c9tienne Tshisekedi fell out with and fought against.Neither the government nor the police responded to requests for comment.Roger Ilunga, another of Mr. Tshisekedi\u2019s sons, said his father\u2019s body would be flown into Congo in about 12 days. \u201cWe agreed with the government on the location of a new burial ground,\u201d he said from Brussels, where he lives with the rest of the Tshisekedi family. \u201cSo theoretically, there should not be a problem.\u201dLast week, a Belgian architect who was in charge of building a mausoleum for Mr. Tshisekedi was assaulted and temporarily detained in prison in Kinshasa. Four police officers barged into his home, put a knife to his wife\u2019s throat and stole $32,000, said Mr. Luakabuanga, the U.D.P.S. party spokesman. They also took his passport.On Tuesday, Mr. Kabila reshuffled his government in what may have been an attempt to appease the opposition. Last year, he struck a deal with the opposition in which he promised to hold elections by the end of this year.Not long after that deal was reached, one of the prime negotiators and the main opposition leader, Mr. Tshisekedi, died, and a power struggle erupted over who should succeed him atop the opposition coalition, known as Rassemblement.Last month, Mr. Kabila appointed Bruno Tshibala as prime minister. Mr. Tshibala had been a major player in the opposition coalition but was ousted after he clashed with Mr. Tshisekedi\u2019s son and successor, F\u00e9lix.In Tuesday\u2019s government reshuffle, Mr. Kabila retained most of his ministers. He also appointed four opposition lawmakers to the government.In addition to political instability, the Congolese economy is reeling from a rapid currency depreciation and low foreign reserves, because of weak mineral prices. Inflation has skyrocketed from below 2 percent in 2015 to more than 25 percent last year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In South Korea, New President Faces a Tangle of Economic Problems", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The day after South Korea elected a new president, the mood on the campus of Yonsei University in Seoul was bleak.Many students, who might have been expected to celebrate the victory of a liberal, Moon Jae-in, to the presidency on Tuesday, instead spoke of fears about their prospects in a country plagued by corruption, household debt and other economic ills.\u201cUnfortunately, because we ourselves do not see the future of Korea as so rosy, I do not want to bring up children in this unpromising society,\u201d said Bang Seong-deok, 26, a civil engineering doctoral student taking a break with a friend outside a classroom block on Wednesday. \u201cI think that mentality is persistent among many of my peers.\u201dHe faces daunting obstacles as he tries to overhaul entrenched practices and deliver on ambitious campaign promises in a country that has yet to complete the tough transition from tiger economy to developed society.In the food court of a student lounge at Yonsei, Lee Ji-won, 23, a public administration major, said her friends often described the moribund state of their country as \u201cHell Chosun,\u201d a reference to the last dynasty of Korea, which lasted for five centuries.Ms. Lee, who aspires to be a lawyer, said she worried about eventually having to take care of her parents and grandparents. Although just over half of voters in their 20s and 30s cast their ballots for Mr. Moon, according to exit polls, Ms. Lee did not vote for him. She said she was not convinced that he would be able to pay for his economic policy prescriptions.Because the chaebol tend to guarantee lifetime employment to an elite group of employees, those who do not secure these jobs have grown disaffected. And since the chaebol effectively wield monopolistic powers over their suppliers, workers at smaller businesses that depend on the large companies for their revenue often suffer from depressed wages and tough working conditions.Those factors have exacerbated income inequality in South Korea, and young people in particular are affected as they scramble to compete for a small pool of prestigious jobs at the chaebol or accept lower-paid work at smaller companies. In many cases, they cannot find jobs at all. The youth unemployment rate here is nearly 10 percent.They are \u201cthe backs on which the middle-aged and elderly people are going to be eating, sleeping and surviving for the next few decades,\u201d she added.Some economists have also expressed skepticism about how Mr. Moon\u2019s administration will finance his plans, which include pledges to create 810,000 public sector jobs and subsidize living expenses for young people during job searches.Some measures could work in the short term, economists said, but would not be sustainable.Kim Sang-jo, a professor of economics at Hansung University in Seoul and an adviser to Mr. Moon, said creating government jobs and offering subsidies were just early steps.\u201cIt is the role of the government to stimulate the market in the first stage to fix the market that hasn\u2019t been running smoothly,\u201d Mr. Kim said in an interview shortly after the election. He said the \u201ctrickle down\u201d model of the chaebol was no longer working. But he added, \u201cOf course the government cannot solve all problems.\u201dMr. Moon\u2019s public job creation plan got mixed reviews even among students studying for the exams that are required to land jobs in the bureaucracy.In the Noryangjin neighborhood of Seoul, which is home to several cram schools dedicated to preparing for the exams, Yoon Bo-mi, 26, a nutrition major, said she was studying for the test because she did not think private corporations offered enough good opportunities.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think that young people all learning to become bureaucrats is so desirable for society,\u201d she said.Economists say that for South Korea to create many more private sector jobs, it needs to open up the market for entrepreneurs and prevent the chaebol from taking over start-ups before they have the chance to expand.For now, many entrepreneurs are concentrated in retail and dining. The fate of Reo Sushi Maguro, a cozy restaurant in the heart of Seoul, is a sobering illustration of the challenges facing Mr. Moon.Around the corner from several government office buildings, Reo Sushi, which specialized in premium tuna sashimi, enjoyed a bustling business as corporate executives treated civil servants to expensive meals.To cover costs as well as replace lost income, the owner, Oh Sung-min, 39, began borrowing money at high interest rates, until the debt spiraled to about $266,000.Mr. Oh\u2019s wife, Chung Sora, 35, a beauty salon owner who learned the extent of the debt only two weeks ago, blames the antigraft law.\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cThe politicians may have thought, \u2018We will try to regulate people\u2019s bad behavior,\u2019 but so many shops closed as a result.\u201dMr. Oh, who decided to close his sushi place after a government counselor agreed to help him develop a 10-year debt-repayment plan, is in a familiar situation. Economists say small-business owners have taken out a large portion of the country\u2019s about $1.19 trillion in household debt.Mr. Oh, the father of a toddler, will depend on Ms. Chung\u2019s beauty salon to support the family for now. Ms. Chung, who recently took on her own debt to expand the salon, said she was determined to pay off her husband\u2019s debt in a year.As Mr. Oh served final customers this past week, he said he had plans to start fresh with a new restaurant, this time offering chicken ribs and cheaper tuna dishes.

The remaining contenders are divided evenly between the so-called principlists \u2014 hard-line conservatives who assert strict fealty to the principles of Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic revolution \u2014 and the so-called reformists, who are seen as more moderate and flexible.While no Iranian president has ever been defeated for re-election to a second term, politics can be unpredictable, and the country\u2019s 55 million eligible voters do have real choices when they go to the polls on Friday compared with elections elsewhere in the Middle East.Here are summaries of each candidate:Hassan Rouhani, 68But conservatives have targeted Mr. Rouhani for what they regard as his softness toward the United States and tolerance of Western culture. They also have sharply criticized him for what they call his misleading prediction that the nuclear agreement would herald an economic boom in Iran, where joblessness remains pervasive and the economy is the most pressing campaign issue. Still, Mr. Rouhani is considered the front-runner.Ebrahim Raisi, 56Mr. Raisi also is a member of the Assembly of Experts, the clerical body that supervises the work of the supreme leader, and is regarded as a possible successor to Mr. Khamenei. Mr. Raisi wears a black turban identifying him as a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad.Critics contend that Mr. Raisi, with his strict anti-Western views, would lead Iran back into isolation like President Rouhani\u2019s unpopular predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Rights advocates say he was among the judicial authorities responsible for mass executions of leftists and dissidents during political turmoil in 1988, when roughly 4,500 people were believed to have been killed. Mr. Raisi is not known to have spoken in the campaign about that era.Eshaq Jahangiri, 60Mr. Rouhani\u2019s vice president, Mr. Jahangiri is a reformist who joined the race in a politically strategic move to help Mr. Rouhani counter their conservative critics and defend the nuclear accord, which many Iranians regard as an exemplary achievement even if it has yet to yield major economic benefits.Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, 55Mr. Qalibaf, who established his hard-line political trajectory as Tehran\u2019s mayor, long resisted calls by other conservatives to step aside to endorse Mr. Raisi. But on Monday he relented. A onetime airline pilot who still has his flying license, he had boasted of his hard-line credentials as a former Revolutionary Guard commander and police chief.Mostafa Agha Mirsalim, 69An engineer and former minister of culture and Islamic guidance, Mr. Mirsalim was an adviser to Ayatollah Khamenei when he was president in the 1980s. He is considered a pious hard-liner known for closing reformist newspapers and denouncing what he considers a Western cultural onslaught subverting Iran\u2019s youth.Mostafa Hashemi-Taba, 70A former top official of Iran\u2019s physical education organization and National Olympic Committee, Mr. Hashemi-Taba is closely associated with Mohammad Khatami, the former reformist president who preceded Mr. Ahmadinejad. He has been a strong defender of the nuclear accord and may drop out to support Mr. Rouhani.Mr. Hashemi-Taba has been outspoken in his ridicule of hard-line conservatives over what he calls their denial of the destructive effects of nuclear sanctions during Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s tenure.Advertisement"}

Advocacy groups unfurled new campaigns to kill the central provision of the Republicans\u2019 plan, a border adjustment tax on imports.Facing such daunting obstacles, Republicans insisted that it was now or never for major tax revisions and that they must not let fantasies of a perfect \u201cunicorn\u201d tax code get in the way of getting something done.\u201cWhile there is no perfect way to tax, there are proven solutions to grow our economy and improve the lives of all Americans,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, the Republican tax policy chairman on Ways and Means, signaled that lawmakers would need to show flexibility to make the tax system better for everyone.\u201cThere\u2019s an old phrase that says when the bulls fight, the grass loses,\u201d he said. \u201cPursuing the perfect tax code is a complete illusion.\u201dRepublicans and Democrats generally agreed on the need for a comprehensive tax overhaul that does not add to the deficit. But beyond that, the disagreements were many.Democrats assailed the tax ideas promoted by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration as giveaways to big companies and the rich. They called for tax cuts aimed at the middle class. \u201cI will not vote for tax reform that is targeted to people who are the engine, I want to take care of people who are in the back cars and in the caboose,\u201d said Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., a New Jersey Democrat.Democrats also accused Republicans of not being interested in working with them on a tax bill and argued that a task so mammoth should have feedback from a range of perspectives beyond business interests. \u201cWhere are the women? Where are the minorities?\u201d asked Representative John Lewis of Georgia, lamenting that the panel of witnesses invited to testify about the need for tax reform was composed of five white men.While some members of Congress have expressed hopes for a grand bipartisan bargain on tax reform, Republicans in Congress and President Trump have so far signaled that they plan to go it alone. This means they will be walking a tightrope by using the Senate\u2019s budget reconciliation process, which allows legislation to pass with a simple majority but dictates that any changes expire after a decade if they add to the deficit.The elephant in the room on Thursday was the border adjustment tax, which lawmakers addressed mostly in general terms because it will get a hearing of its own next week. Mr. Brady said he remains fully committed to the concept of taxing imports while letting exports go tax free even though the Trump administration and many Republicans in the House and the Senate think the idea is unworkable.While many tax experts and exporters believe that the border adjustment tax is a smart idea that would make American businesses more competitive globally, the resistance to it from lobbyists for retailers and importers is intensifying as the momentum behind tax legislation gathers pace.Outside the building where the hearing was convened, protesters held signs opposing the tax. The billionaire Koch brothers stepped up their opposition to it on Thursday, announcing through their advocacy groups Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity a multimillion-dollar campaign to promote tax cuts \u2014 but not the border tax.The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, showed little affection for the idea while testifying steps away before the Senate Banking Committee. \u201cWe think in the current form it doesn\u2019t work. It has too much risk to the economy,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Republicans in Congress are meeting regularly with the White House economic team in the hopes of bridging their differences and coming up with a unified tax plan this spring or in early summer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Budget That Promises Little but Pain", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byEditorialIf President Trump\u2019s 2018 budget, to be unveiled on Tuesday, was worthy of praise, you can bet Mr. Trump would be in Washington to bask in it. But his overseas trip keeps him at a distance physically, if not politically.As detailed in a preview on Monday by Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, the budget is a naked appeal to far-right Republicans aiming for a partisan rallying cry, even as a legislative victory most likely remains out of reach.Of 13 major initiatives in the budget, nine are drastic spending cuts, mostly aimed at low-income Americans. The biggest of those, by far, is an $866 billion reduction over 10 years in health care spending, mostly from Medicaid. That would be achieved if the Senate approves the House bill to undo President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. But many Senate Republicans oppose it; Senate Democrats are dead set against it and the vast majority of Americans don\u2019t want it, and for good reason. It would deprive an estimated 10 million low-income Americans, many of them nursing home residents, of Medicaid benefits; it would also defund Planned Parenthood, reducing or ending health services to 2.5 million people, mainly women.The budget also calls for slashing food stamps ($192 billion over 10 years) and disability benefits ($72 billion over 10 years), including a big chunk from the Social Security disability insurance program. The rationale is that the cuts would force Americans back to work. But some 60 percent of food stamp recipients already work and an estimated 15 percent more work most of the time, availing themselves of food stamps only when they are between jobs or when their hours are reduced. The remainder are disabled and elderly. They will not go back to work if their food stamps are reduced. They will go hungry.The cuts to Social Security disability benefits would be similarly cruel. The budget assumes the cutbacks would prod disabled people back to work. That assumption ignores how severely disabled most benefit recipients are. The cuts also ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge not to cut Social Security. Mr. Mulvaney walked back that pledge on Monday, saying the promise pertained only to retirement benefits.The budget also continues the practice outlined in Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cskinny\u201d budget preview from March of immense defense increases coupled with deep cuts in non-defense discretionary spending, the catchall category that includes all of the federal programs that are annually appropriated by Congress. By the end of the 10-year budget period, such spending \u2014 for law enforcement, diplomacy, environmental protection, scientific research, justice, arts and humanities, tax collection and entire executive branch departments \u2014 would be lower as a share of the economy than in records dating back more than 50 years.The budget leaves Medicare spending untouched. It also promises to help finance $1 trillion in infrastructure investments, which is likely to mean subsidizing private investors in roads, bridges and other public works in exchange for a share of what used to be thought of as public property. It lists a $19 billion paid family leave program that appears to be supported by funds intended for unemployment benefits.What it lacks is any meaningful discussion of taxes. The budget asserts that any cuts would be offset by revenue from huge economic growth, unspecified loophole closings or additional spending cuts.The truth is that trillion-dollar tax cuts, most of which would flow to the wealthy, would hurt millions of other Americans. The nation will not prosper by cutting aid to sick, hungry, disabled and low-income Americans, or by boosting military spending while devastating domestic spending, or by privatizing infrastructure.Advertisement"}

Putin. Mr. Kadyrov\u2019s father, Akhmad, started out as a separatist Islamic leader, but at the beginning of Russia\u2019s second military campaign against Chechen rebels, which began in 1999, he swapped sides to support Moscow.When Akhmad Kadyrov was killed in a terrorist attack in 2004, his son took his place, muscling out rival strongmen and monopolizing power in the republic by placing his people in charge of federal institutions. Mr. Kadyrov ensured that his fighters were integrated into the local police force, largely preserving the command chains, and their violent skills were deployed in heavy-handed counterterrorism operations on behalf of the Kremlin.Collective punishment is the hallmark of Mr. Kadyrov\u2019s repression. Relatives of those who displease the authorities are threatened, beaten, held hostage, expelled from the republic or have their homes burned down. Such methods were first applied to suspected rebels but have spread to regime critics, religious dissenters, even drunken drivers. The same techniques have now been applied to the families of men thought to be gay, which are threatened with detention unless the suspects turn themselves in to the police.Chechnya is a state within a state. Mr. Kadyrov is the only regional leader in the federation who has de facto control of the security services in his territory. Beside the republic\u2019s Russian subsidies, a parallel economy based on extortion and kickbacks thrives. State employees report being obliged to hand over part of their salaries and bonuses. In other cases, they have to purchase equipment or raise funds for reconstruction projects, or collect money as gifts for celebrities visiting Grozny.\u201cSome think they are sadists and we are simply another social group that they are terrorizing,\u201d a Chechen gay man told me, \u201cbut in fact, it is part of their new ideology of a \u2018pure nation.\u2019 \u201dBy promoting nationalism and traditionalism, Mr. Kadyrov tries to prove to Chechens that their republic now has more autonomy than separatist leaders ever dreamed of; and this justifies his strong pro-Putin position. But his appeal to tradition is self-serving and spurious. Until now, Chechnya never had any record of organized violence against gays.Behind this facade of stability, Mr. Kadyrov lacks legitimacy, both at home and abroad. Chechnya\u2019s ruling elite has many enemies among the Russian military, which sees Mr. Kadyrov as a separatist who was unduly promoted.Mr. Kadyrov and his clique depend entirely on Mr. Putin. It is within the Russian president\u2019s power to halt the violence against gay men, empty the illegal prisons and force an investigation into this crackdown. If Mr. Putin continues to give the Kremlin\u2019s tacit approval to Mr. Kadyrov\u2019s repressions, he is only storing up trouble for the Russian Federation.The Chechen conflict has not been resolved but merely contained by brute force and a personal bond between the two leaders. In the long run, such an unstable situation makes a deadly new conflict in Chechnya almost inevitable.Ekaterina Sokirianskaia is the project director for Russia and the North Caucasus at International Crisis Group, an independent conflict prevention organization.Advertisement"}

Suddenly, power went out at one station in Brooklyn, but that lone failure triggered a meltdown that crippled service across New York City, stranding countless commuters whose plans for the day were derailed.One woman never made it to housing court and now faces eviction. Another missed a doctor appointment made months earlier. A graphic designer lost $100 in wages. A computer technician paid more than $50 for an Uber car to make a meeting. A lawyer was late for a sentencing. A pastry chef who needs every hour of work he can scrounge lost an hour and a half of pay. A psychoanalyst never made it to her session with a patient. Neither did her patient.For many riders, the subway is failing at its fundamental task \u2014 getting people where they need to be when they need to be there.It is difficult to calculate with precision the economic fallout of a single awful day on the subway. But these episodes have inarguably cost New Yorkers and their employers millions of dollars each year in lost productivity, forfeited wages and extra expenses, like unplanned taxi rides and extended child care.The maddening subway delays that Tuesday \u2014 May 9 \u2014 provide a window into the cascading economic consequences of a single incident. A power loss that affected the signal system at the DeKalb Avenue station wreaked havoc on at least seven lines stretching from Brooklyn to the Bronx.For hourly wage workers like Jonathan Yung, a pastry chef, the chaos meant losing badly needed income. It took Mr. Yung three hours to travel from Brooklyn to a kitchen in Queens. He missed an hour and a half of work, or about $27 in wages.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to lose time based on the train, that\u2019s money out of your pocket,\u201d said Mr. Yung, who often struggles to secure 40 hours of work each week.Spencer Viator, a professional opera singer, gave himself two hours to travel to an important rehearsal on the Upper West Side. After taking four different trains, he arrived 45 minutes late, harried and angry.With subway delays surging, Mr. Viator has considered moving, but his work as an opera singer keeps him here. \u201cI would love to leave New York if I could,\u201d he said.Others faced more serious repercussions. Alicia Sciascia had a 9:30 a.m. hearing in housing court in Downtown Brooklyn. Her landlord had taken legal action against her, and she was asking for more time to respond. She was turned away from a subway station in Brooklyn. Buses were crammed with people. She did not arrive at court until 1 p.m.\u201cI was completely flustered, but I imagined since it was such a big citywide emergency that I would be able to be heard that day regardless,\u201d Ms. Sciascia said.Instead, she was cited for failing to appear in court. Now, she is worried that a city marshal will visit her home to start an eviction process.The New York City metropolitan region contributes $1.6 trillion a year to the national economy, or nearly 9 percent of the gross domestic product in 2015, according to the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group. Even a small dent in the city\u2019s economic output has ripple effects as conferences are canceled and offices sit empty, and the constant upheaval undermines the quality of life, leading some to consider moving.The subway \u2014 New York\u2019s lifeblood, carrying nearly six million riders each day \u2014 has become so unreliable that business leaders are worried the increasingly frail system will damage the city\u2019s recent growth and prosperity. Subway delays rose to more than 78,500 in March, up 14 percent from a year earlier, and some lines have an on-time rate of under 40 percent.\u201cThe combination of breakdowns, delays and accidents, and the condition of the overall transportation system serving the region, are very discouraging to employers who saw the conditions deteriorate to a point in the 1980s that was intolerable,\u201d said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City.Based on that formula, the cost would be far higher now that the average wage is about $30 an hour and subway ridership has nearly doubled. Using the same formula, a rough estimate for a five-minute increase in the length of a ride would be about $1.1 billion annually.On a personal level, it means riders have to build in plenty of extra time to ensure they arrive on time and be prepared to dig deeper into their pockets when the inevitable subway upheaval forces a plan B.On May 9, Shea Donato, a lawyer who lives in Queens, was late for a 9:30 a.m. sentencing in Manhattan. So was everyone else who was supposed to be at the hearing. After sitting on a stalled train for at least 30 minutes, Ms. Donato walked to another line only to find it was also delayed.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an isolated thing \u2014 it\u2019s been building up,\u201d she said of the delays. \u201cThis one was really bad. I was frustrated and thought, \u2018Of course this is happening again.\u2019\u201dPamela Schultz missed a doctor\u2019s appointment in Manhattan she had scheduled six months earlier. When she arrived at her subway station in Ditmas Park in Brooklyn about 9 a.m., there were large crowds outside. She waited on the platform for a while, but eventually gave up and went back home.\u201cThis is the second time in two months that this has happened, both to appointments in Midtown,\u201d she said.While several major disruptions have recently crippled large sections of the city, the less tumultuous but persistent subway delays have led to a growing sense of fatigue.\u201cThere is no alternative,\u201d said Pavel Shreyder, a computer technician who paid for an Uber on May 9 so he would not miss a work meeting. \u201cWe can only use the hashtag #M.T.A.Sucks. What else can we do? Can we overthrow the management of the M.T.A.?\u201dKaren Nelson, a psychoanalyst, missed her 9 a.m. therapy session with a patient during the delays on May 9. The patient was caught up in the same disruption and rescheduled. Ms. Nelson said she loses about $600 a year to canceled appointments because of train delays.\u201cI have my own business,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have an appointment, I don\u2019t make any money.\u201dPatti Lui, a graphic designer, lost $100 in wages when she was two hours late to work after the same incident.\u201cSomething I expect to run on time,\u201d she said, \u201cis really disappointing me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Problematic Math: Budget Plan Adds Growth, but Doesn\u2019t Subtract Cost", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s budget proposal, unveiled on Tuesday, purported to show the benefits of cutting taxes on businesses and consumers: By the end of the decade, faster growth could balance the federal budget.The numbers looked great because the White House left out something essential: the cost.When the government cuts taxes, it collects less money. That is the purpose of a tax cut. But Mr. Trump\u2019s budget does not include any hint of a decrease in federal revenue. To the contrary, it projects that federal tax revenue will increase every year for the next decade.The White House is indeed projecting faster economic growth as a consequence of tax cuts. What it is not doing is projecting the cost of those tax cuts: that is, the loss in tax revenue. It is the rough equivalent of trying to raise $10,000 for a project expected to produce $100,000 in revenue, and telling investors the profit will total $100,000. It won\u2019t, because you have to account for the cost.One example of the budget-ledger legerdemain: Mr. Trump has pledged to end estate taxation. His budget, however, projects that the government will collect more than $300 billion in estate taxes over the next decade. Indeed, the Trump administration projects higher estate tax revenue than the Obama administration did because it expects faster economic growth.Mr. Trump, in other words, is proposing to balance the federal budget in part by simultaneously increasing estate taxation and eliminating estate taxation.Peter R. Orszag, the director of the Office of Management and Budget during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, said the treatment of taxation was part of a broader failure by the Trump administration to present a credible plan for managing the budget.\u201cIt is not hard to write down a series of numbers on a paper and say: \u2018Tada! I balanced the budget!\u2019\u201d Mr. Orszag said. \u201cThat is a much different process than having a credible plan for how that could be achieved. And they have not done that.\u201dGovernment spending would be cut substantially. See how every budget item would be changed.The Trump administration, for its part, said the focus on details was misplaced. The Office of Management and Budget said in a statement that the president\u2019s tax plan would not increase the deficit because the cost of tax cuts would be offset by faster growth and by changes that increase revenue, like limiting deductions.In effect, it is saying: The details might be wrong, but the bottom line won\u2019t change. The government will simply end up with a smaller share of a much larger pie. And that revenue, combined with spending cuts, will produce a balanced budget by 2027.But Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, offered a different explanation. \u201cWe felt it was premature to put in any changes to the budget as a result of taxes, since we\u2019re not far enough along to estimate what that impact will be,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on Tuesday at a \u201cfiscal summit\u201d meeting sponsored by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.The budget\u2019s presentation of the benefits of the administration\u2019s economic policies also raised questions. White House officials said that tax cuts and other changes, like reductions in regulation, would push annual economic growth to 3 percent by 2020, well above the 2 percent annual average since the recession. The budget projects that the increase in economic growth will produce $2.1 trillion in additional federal revenue.The Trump administration appears to be counting this windfall twice. It needs the money to offset the cost of the tax cuts, but in the budget, the $2.1 trillion is also recorded as a separate line item above and beyond the steady growth of tax revenue.\u201cThe same money cannot be used twice,\u201d Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement criticizing the administration\u2019s math.The budget office insisted in an email that the $2.1 trillion was in addition to the revenue necessary to offset the cost of the tax cuts. The administration, in other words, said that it had previously underestimated the benefits of its own plans.But Marc Goldwein, a senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the budget itself showed that this could not be true.The White House, in a different part of the documents published Tuesday, projected that the increase in growth would produce total revenue of about $2.1 trillion.The budget itself says that Mr. Trump will not achieve his stated goal of a balanced budget.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Balancing Politics and Pragmatism in Irish Bank I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAllied Irish Banks\u2019 initial public offering is as large as it is political.Ireland plans to sell 25 percent of the nationalized bank in a dual Dublin-London stock listing. The question is whether the Irish government can persuade investors to pay more than book value for a bank that is still a work in progress.Allied Irish is an almost pure play on the Irish economy, one of the fastest-growing in the eurozone. Only 14 percent of its loans were in Britain by the end of 2016, compared with 40 percent at its domestic peer, Bank of Ireland. It also has a leading 36 percent market share in Irish mortgages, which are a growth business. And crucially, it is the first domestic Irish lender to resume paying a dividend since the financial crisis.Dublin\u2019s weak coalition government is nowhere near getting back the 20.8 billion euros in taxpayer money it pumped into Allied Irish from 2009 onward. Even so, selling that first slice for anything less than book value is likely to be politically unpalatable. Yet Bank of Ireland currently trades at 84 percent of its estimated book value for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon. On a similar multiple, the government would raise 2.4 billion euros.Expect Allied Irish\u2019s owners to suggest comparisons further afield, then \u2014 like Lloyds Banking Group of Britain, which trades at 1.1 times book value. It is a reasonable analogy. Allied Irish had a core equity capital ratio of 16 percent by the end of March, higher than Bank of Ireland\u2019s 12 percent. Its costs as a percentage of income are 52 percent, not far from Lloyds\u2019 enviable 47 percent. And, like the formerly government-owned British bank, excess capital means room for future dividends.The big difference is that Lloyds has already cleaned up its act, whereas Allied Irish Banks\u2019 legacy of reckless lending still lingers on its balance sheet. Around 14 percent of its loans are nonperforming \u2014 roughly three times the European average and well above Lloyds\u2019 1.8 percent.

Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Friday that policies making it easier for women to work could significantly improve the nation\u2019s economic growth.That remains more than 10 percentage points lower than the figure for men in the same age range working or seeking work, which was 88.6 percent in April.Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech was unusually narrative and unusually personal. Speaking at her alma mater, she told the stories of other women who graduated from Brown, including her husband\u2019s aunt, Elizabeth Stafford Hirschfelder. She said Ms. Hirschfelder, who graduated in 1923, faced discrimination throughout her career as a mathematician. \u201cI believe that Betty Stafford Hirschfelder was denied opportunities and greater success simply because she was a woman,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen, who is 70, said women of her own generation had faced fewer obstacles and had more opportunities. \u201cI enrolled at Brown fully planning to attend graduate school and have a career, as did many of my classmates in the Class of 1967,\u201d she said. She noted that changes in policy supported and reinforced changes in society. A 1974 law, for example, allowed women to apply for loans without a male co-signer.Women gained entry into a wider range of professions, and the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s wages narrowed significantly.

{"Headline": "How Google Took Over the Classroom", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Education DisruptedThe tech giant is transforming public education with low-cost laptops and free apps. But schools may be giving Google more than they are getting.Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 The sixth graders at Newton Bateman, a public elementary school here with a classic red brick facade, know the Google drill.In a social-science class last year, the students each grabbed a Google-powered laptop. They opened Google Classroom, an app where teachers make assignments. Then they clicked on Google Docs, a writing program, and began composing essays.Looking up from her laptop, Masuma Khan, then 11 years old, said her essay explored how schooling in ancient Athens differed from her own. \u201cBack then, they had wooden tablets and they had to take all of their notes on it,\u201d she said. \u201cNowadays, we can just do it in Google Docs.\u201dIn the space of just five years, Google has helped upend the sales methods companies use to place their products in classrooms. It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google\u2019s products to other schools. It has directly reached out to educators to test its products \u2014 effectively bypassing senior district officials. And it has outmaneuvered Apple and Microsoft with a powerful combination of low-cost laptops, called Chromebooks, and free classroom apps.Today, more than half the nation\u2019s primary- and secondary-school students \u2014 more than 30 million children \u2014 use Google education apps like Gmail and Docs, the company said. And Chromebooks, Google-powered laptops that initially struggled to find a purpose, are now a powerhouse in America\u2019s schools. Today they account for more than half the mobile devices shipped to schools.In doing so, Google is helping to drive a philosophical change in public education \u2014 prioritizing training children in skills like teamwork and problem-solving while de-emphasizing the teaching of traditional academic knowledge, like math formulas. It puts Google, and the tech economy, at the center of one of the great debates that has raged in American education for more than a century: whether the purpose of public schools is to turn out knowledgeable citizens or skilled workers.The director of Google\u2019s education apps group, Jonathan Rochelle, touched on that idea in a speech at an industry conference last year. Referring to his own children, he said: \u201cI cannot answer for them what they are going to do with the quadratic equation. I don\u2019t know why they are learning it.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t ask Google for the answer if the answer is right there.\u201dSchools may be giving Google more than they are getting: generations of future customers.Google makes $30 per device by selling management services for the millions of Chromebooks that ship to schools. But by habituating students to its offerings at a young age, Google obtains something much more valuable.That doesn\u2019t sit well with some parents. They warn that Google could profit by using personal details from their children\u2019s school email to build more powerful marketing profiles of them as young adults.\u201cMy concern is that they are working on developing a profile of this child that, when they hit maturity, they are able to create a better profile,\u201d said David Barsotti, an information technology project manager in the Chicago area whose daughter uses Google tools in elementary school. \u201cThat is a problem, in my opinion.\u201dMr. Rochelle of Google said that when students transfer their school emails and files to a personal Google account, that account is governed by Google\u2019s privacy policy. \u201cPersonal Gmail accounts may serve ads,\u201d he said, but files in Google Drive are \u201cnever scanned for the purpose of showing ads.\u201dGoogle, a unit of the $652 billion Alphabet, is the latest big contender in a decades-old battle among tech companies to hook students as future customers. \u201cIf you get someone on your operating system early, then you get that loyalty early, and potentially for life,\u201d said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource Consulting, a research company.Google captured these next-generation users so quickly by outpacing its rivals in both educational product development and marketing.In 2013, while other tech firms seemed largely content to sell their existing consumer and business offerings to schools, Mr. Rochelle, a co-developer of Google Docs, set up a team at Google to create apps specifically for schools.10 Photos\u201cTeachers really helped to drive adoption of Google in the classroom, while Apple and Microsoft continued to leverage traditional sales channels,\u201d said Phillip DiBartolo, the chief information officer of Chicago Public Schools.But that also caused problems in Chicago and another district when Google went looking for teachers to try a new app \u2014 effectively bypassing district administrators. In both cases, Google found itself reined in.Mr. Bout said that student data in Google\u2019s core education services (including Gmail, Calendar and Docs) \u201cis only used to provide the services themselves, so students can do things like communicate using email.\u201d These services do not show ads, he said, and \u201cdo not use personal data resulting from use of these services to target ads.\u201dSome parents, school administrators and privacy advocates believe that\u2019s not enough. They say Google should be more forthcoming about the details it collects about students, why it collects them and how it uses them.\u201cIf my daughter came home and logged on to Google Docs on my computer at home, they\u2019ll know it was now coming from this address,\u201d said Mr. Barsotti, the Chicago-area project manager. \u201cIf this is truly for educational purposes, what is their business model and why do they need to collect that?\u201dMr. Casap quickly persuaded university officials to scrap their costly internal email service (an unusual move at the time) and replace it with a free version of the Gmail-and-Docs package that Google had been selling to companies. In one semester, the vast majority of the university\u2019s approximately 65,000 students signed up.And a new Google business was born.This became Google\u2019s education marketing playbook: Woo school officials with easy-to-use, money-saving services. Then enlist schools to market to other schools, holding up early adopters as forward thinkers among their peers.The strategy proved so successful in higher education that Mr. Casap decided to try it with public schools.\u201cThat caused the same kind of cascade,\u201d Mr. Casap said. School districts around the country began contacting him, and he referred them to Mr. Nelson, who related Oregon\u2019s experience with Google\u2019s apps.By then, Google was developing a growth strategy aimed at teachers \u2014 the gatekeepers to the classroom \u2014 who could influence the administrators who make technology decisions. \u201cThe driving force tends to be the pedagogical side,\u201d Mr. Bout, the Google education executive, said. \u201cThat is something we really embraced.\u201dAlthough business practices like encouraging educators to spread the word to their peers have become commonplace among education technology firms, Google has successfully deployed these techniques on a such a large scale that some critics say the company has co-opted public school employees to gain market dominance.\u201cCompanies are exploiting the education space for sales and public good will,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, the president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm. Parents and educators should be questioning Google\u2019s pervasiveness in schools, he added, and examining \u201chow those in the public sector are carrying the message of Google branding and marketing.\u201dMr. Bout of Google disagreed, saying that the company\u2019s outreach to educators was not a marketing exercise. Rather, he said, it was an effort to improve education by helping teachers learn directly from their peers how to most effectively use Google\u2019s tools.\u201cWe help to amplify the stories and voices of educators who have lessons learned,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it can be challenging for educators to find ways to share with each other.\u201dAt Chicago Public Schools, the teacher-centric strategy played out almost perfectly.\u201cWe were bootlegging using Google apps,\u201d Ms. Magiera recalled in a phone interview. \u201cI just knew I needed my kids to collaborate,\u201d she said, touching on one of Google\u2019s own main arguments for its products.Chicago administrators like Lachlan Tidmarsh, then the school district\u2019s chief information officer, visited Ms. Magiera\u2019s classroom to observe. Mr. Tidmarsh said he concluded that if individual teachers were already using Google\u2019s services, the district should officially adopt the platform \u2014 to make sure, for instance, that younger children couldn\u2019t email with strangers.Ms. Magiera\u2019s advocacy came at an ideal moment. Chicago Public Schools was looking to trim the $2 million a year it was spending on Microsoft Exchange and another email service; it had opened bidding for a less expensive program.Quickly, though, a data privacy and security issue emerged, exposing a culture clash between Google\u2019s business practices and a major school district\u2019s values.Instead, Google initially proposed abiding by its own company policies, Mr. Wagner said, and followed up by emailing links to those policies \u2014 terms that the company could change at any time. \u201cOur lawyers were a little bit apoplectic when they were given links to security things,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a link that can change.\u201dMr. Nelson, the former education official in Oregon, reported similar frustrations over student privacy when his state negotiated a contract with Google. \u201cThat\u2019s why it took 16 months,\u201d he said.Mr. Bout of Google said that the tech company had \u201calways taken the compliance needs of our education users seriously.\u201d He added that \u201ceven early versions\u201d of the company\u2019s agreements for its education apps had \u201caddressed\u201d the federal education privacy law.Today, Google\u2019s standard agreements with schools for its education apps include a commitment to comply with that law.Since adopting Google apps, Chicago schools have saved about $1.6 million annually on email and related costs, a district spokesman said.\u201cWe were always enthusiastic to tell the Google story,\u201d Mr. Tidmarsh said. \u201cI would like to think dozens of school districts switched, based on our success.\u201d(Ms. Magiera has since occasionally worked as a paid speaker for education technology organizations that train teachers on Google\u2019s tools.)\u201cYou can see it radiate out from certain geographic hubs, and that is very deliberate,\u201d Mr. Bout said of Google\u2019s growth strategy for education. \u201cWe are taking a very geographic approach because we know it works.\u201dBy then, Google had developed a simplified, low-cost laptop called the Chromebook. It ran on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system and revolved largely around web apps, making it cheaper and often faster to boot up than traditional laptops loaded with locally stored software.But there was one interested audience: public schools. In the fall of 2011, Google invited school administrators to its Chicago office to meet Mr. Casap, hoping to interest them in Chromebooks.Mr. Casap didn\u2019t talk tech specs. Instead, he held the audience spellbound as he described the challenges he had faced as a Latino student growing up on welfare in a tough Manhattan neighborhood.His message: Education is the great equalizer, and technology breaks down barriers between rich and poor students.In the audience, Jason Markey, principal of East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Ill., was converted. Students in his blue-collar district near O\u2019Hare International Airport faced similar struggles. On the spot, Mr. Markey said, he abandoned his previous plans to buy Microsoft Windows laptops for 3,500 high school students. Now he wanted Chromebooks for them instead.\u201cI went up to Jaime immediately after the presentation and said, \u2018Are you guys ready to ship these?\u2019\u201d Mr. Markey said.Then Mr. Markey went back to his district to inform administrators and teachers that he wanted to order an unproven device that most of them had never heard of. \u201cIt was a tough announcement to make,\u201d he conceded.It was an opportune moment for Google to pitch lower-cost laptops to schools. Districts administering new online standardized tests needed laptops for students to take them on. And Google offered a robust way for districts to manage thousands of computers online: They could lock Chromebooks remotely so that students could not search the web during tests, or disable missing ones.Another attraction: The Chromebook\u2019s cloud-storage approach made sharing among students easier. They could gain access to their documents no matter which Chromebook they used.\u201cThat is one of the big reasons we took off in education,\u201d said Rajen Sheth, who oversees Google\u2019s Chromebook business. \u201cIn less than 10 seconds, a student can grab a Chromebook and be off and running.\u201dThe Chromebook\u2019s price and usability fit neatly into Mr. Casap\u2019s argument that, for students, access to technology was an issue of fairness. \u201cI didn\u2019t want us to be vendors in the space,\u201d he said of Google\u2019s education philosophy in an interview last year at the SXSWedu conference in Austin, Tex. \u201cI wanted us to be thought leaders, to have a point of view.\u201dAs he spoke, a group of students trooped past wearing purple superhero capes emblazoned with the logo for Microsoft OneNote, a rival classroom service. Spotting the capes, Mr. Casap said, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d He added dryly, \u201cI love gimmicks.\u201dSome critics, though, contend that the equity argument for technology is itself a gimmick that promotes a self-serving Silicon Valley agenda: playing on educators\u2019 altruism to get schools to buy into laptops and apps.\u201cIt centers learning on technology, not students,\u201d said Mr. Fitzgerald, the learning app analyst. \u201cIt is a very narrow lens on equity that leaves out things like student-teacher ratios.\u201d(Mr. Casap said he would not advise school districts with deficiencies in areas like teaching or student support services to invest first in classroom technology.)Mr. Markey, the East Leyden High School principal, had another equity concern. About 20 percent of his students lacked home internet access, he said. How would they do their homework on a Chromebook, which required a connection?Google was already working on offline capabilities, Mr. Casap said, and ultimately modified its education apps so that students could take their work home on Chromebooks, then upload homework the next day using school Wi-Fi.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever remember when a specific device and platform has taken off so quickly across different kinds of schools,\u201d said David Andrade, a K-12 education strategist at CDW-G, a leading Chromebook dealer.In 2014, Google\u2019s education juggernaut hit a speed bump in Chicago Public Schools. The culture clash illuminated profound differences between Google, a build-it-first-and-tweak-it-later Silicon Valley company, and a large, bureaucratic school district with student-protection rules to uphold.At the time, she was the school system\u2019s director of technology change management. Early on, she said, Google had invited teachers to try an initial version of Classroom, without first contacting the school district\u2019s technology administrators \u2014 effectively making a district policy decision from the outside. Now Google wanted Chicago Public Schools to switch on the app districtwide, she said, before determining whether it complied with local student-protection policies.\u201cYou can\u2019t just hand out product and hope it will work in the classroom,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. \u201cYou have to work with the districts to make sure that you are keeping the kids and the teachers safe.\u201dJim Siegl, technology architect for Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, the nation\u2019s 10th-largest school district, reported a similar experience.He said that Google had directly contacted certain Fairfax teachers who had volunteered to beta-test Classroom, giving them early access to the app. In so doing, he said, the company ignored the Google settings he had selected that were supposed to give his district control over which new Google services to switch on in its schools.Mr. Siegl added that Google did not tell him which, or even how many, Fairfax teachers the company had enlisted to try out the Classroom app. And by the time he was able to shut off the app, Mr. Siegl said, teachers had already set up virtual classrooms on the service and started using it with their students.He said he complained to Google.\u201cBecause of who they are and how sprawling the ecosystem is,\u201d Mr. Siegl said, \u201cthey are held up and need to meet a higher standard than any other vendor schools deal with.\u201dIn an emailed statement, Mr. Bout said of the company\u2019s core education services, \u201cIn all cases, the use of these services is tied to the approval of an administrator who is responsible for overseeing a school\u2019s domain.\u201dClassroom was the brainchild of Mr. Rochelle, who started Google\u2019s education apps group, and Zach Yeskel, a Google product manager and former high school math teacher. They said they envisioned the app as a kind of \u201cmission control\u201d dashboard where teachers could more efficiently manage tasks like assigning and correcting homework, freeing teachers to spend more time with students. To create the app, they collaborated closely with teachers.\u201cThey developed a real momentum with teachers,\u201d said Mr. Fisher of Futuresource Consulting. \u201cGoogle Classroom was key to that.\u201dThat was too fast for Chicago Public Schools.Administrators there wanted to test Classroom first to make sure it complied with district policies and fit their teachers\u2019 needs. So they set up a pilot program, involving about 275 teachers and several thousand students, to run for the entire school year. Every month, Ms. Hahn said, she collected teachers\u2019 feedback and sent it to Google.\u201cWe wanted to help them do it right,\u201d Ms. Hahn said.One immediate problem administrators identified: School board policy required employees to keep records of cyberbullying and other problematic comments. But Classroom initially did not do that. If a student wrote something offensive and a teacher deleted it, there was no archive.\u201cIt took us a long time to get them to do it,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. She added, \u201cUnfortunately, there were things that a district of our size needed that Google did not understand.\u201dGoogle eventually added an archiving feature. The next fall, the Chicago district switched on Classroom. Teachers there later vetted other Google products, effectively becoming a test lab for the company. \u201cWe have said to Google many times, \u2018If it works in Chicago, it will work anywhere,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hahn said.Mr. Bout of Google agreed, saying that Chicago Public Schools often made more stringent demands on Google than other school districts did.\u201cIf you can get it in Chicago, it\u2019s sort of like you have passed a lot of tests,\u201d Mr. Bout said, \u201cand then you can probably get it into any school in the country.\u201dThe relationship has benefited Chicago Public Schools, too.Today, about 15 million primary- and secondary-school students in the United States use Classroom, Google said.Google\u2019s ability to test its products on such a monumental scale has stoked concerns about whether the tech giant is exploiting public-school teachers and students for free labor. \u201cIt\u2019s a private company very creatively using public resources \u2014 in this instance, teachers\u2019 time and expertise \u2014 to build new markets at low cost,\u201d said Patricia Burch, an associate professor of education at the University of Southern California.Mr. Rochelle, the Google executive, said that it was important for the company to have large, diverse sets of educational users giving feedback \u2014 otherwise it might develop products that worked for only a few of them.\u201cOur goal is to build products that help educators and students,\u201d Mr. Rochelle said. \u201cTeachers tell us they appreciate the opportunity to get involved early and help shape our products to meet their needs.\u201dMs. Hahn, who now works for the same health care company as Mr. Tidmarsh, agrees. She said that schools were getting something substantive in return from Google, something they had rarely received from other tech companies: quick product improvements that responded to teachers\u2019 feedback.After the Chicago schools tested Classroom, she said, members of Google\u2019s education team started directly contacting her when they were seeking educators to try out the company\u2019s innovations. \u201cThey no longer just turn stuff on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come to us first.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Priming of Mr. Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byBut why should anyone besides pedants care?First, a mind is a terrible thing to lose. Senior moments, when you can\u2019t remember a name or phrase, or misremember where it came from, happen to many of us. But that Economist interview was basically one long senior moment \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t very different from other recent interviews with the commander in chief of the world\u2019s most powerful military.Second, we\u2019re talking about some really bad economics here. There are times when temporary deficit spending can help the economy. In the first few years after the 2008 financial crisis, for example, unemployment was very high, and the Federal Reserve \u2014 normally our first line of defense against recessions \u2014 had limited ability to act, because the interest rates it controls were already very close to zero. That was a time for serious pump-priming; unfortunately, we never got enough of it, thanks to scorched-earth Republican opposition.America may not be all the way back to full employment \u2014 there\u2019s a lively debate among economists over that issue. But the economic engine no longer needs a fiscal jump-start. This is exactly the wrong time to be talking about the desirability of bigger budget deficits.But that\u2019s not what Trump is talking about. He\u2019s calling for exploding the deficit so he can cut taxes on the wealthy. And that makes no economic sense at all.Then again, he may not understand his own proposals; he may be living in an economic and political fantasy world. If so, he\u2019s not alone. Which brings me to my third point: Trump\u2019s fiscal delusions are arguably no worse than those of many, perhaps most professional observers of the Washington political scene.If you\u2019re a heavy news consumer, think about how many articles you\u2019ve seen in the past few weeks with headlines along the lines of \u201cTrump\u2019s budget may create conflict with G.O.P. fiscal conservatives.\u201d The premise of all such articles is that there is a powerful faction among Republican members of Congress who worry deeply about budget deficits and will oppose proposals that create lots of red ink.But there is no such faction, and never was.There were and are poseurs like Paul Ryan, who claim to be big deficit hawks. But there\u2019s a simple way to test such people\u2019s sincerity: when they propose sacrifices in the name of fiscal responsibility, do those sacrifices ever involve their own political priorities? And they never do. That is, when you see a politician claim that deficit concerns require that we slash Medicaid, privatize Medicare, and/or raise the retirement age \u2014 but somehow never require raising taxes on the wealthy, which in fact they propose to cut \u2014 you know that it\u2019s just an act.Yet somehow much of the news media keeps believing, or pretending to believe, that those imaginary deficit hawks are real, which is a delusion of truly Trumpian proportions.So I\u2019m worried. Trump may be not just ignorant but deeply out of it, and his economic proposals are terrible and irresponsible, but they may get implemented all the same.But maybe I worry too much; maybe the only thing to fear is fear itself. Do you like that line? I just came up with it the other day.Advertisement"}

The other day I did, and I was blown away, not by its link to the past but by its luster in the present. On previous trips to Rome and during the two years I lived here, I knew it as a gray and grimy relic. Now it\u2019s stripped of soot and the color of ivory, thanks to an elaborate cleanup.But a few hundred yards away, in a hilltop park, there\u2019s badly cracked pavement, wildly unkempt grass and oodles of trash, because there\u2019s trash almost everywhere in Rome, whose officials keep promising \u2014 and failing \u2014 to get the problem under control. That\u2019s the first thing that Romans mention if you ask them about their city these days. It\u2019s also the second and third.\u201cA tragic situation,\u201d Massimiliano Tonelli told me. \u201cNo other country in Europe has a capital in this condition.\u201dOn top of which, there\u2019s the shocking, mocking contrast of monuments that gleam for tourists while everyday Rome reeks for its residents. The contradiction constantly reminds Italians that \u201cthe public sector is inefficient and totally disorganized while the private sector functions better,\u201d Tonelli said.And that\u2019s happy news, for the most part. An Italian government strapped for money is smartly tapping private philanthropy to protect its cultural heritage, which is a vital engine of its economy. And it hasn\u2019t let these companies stamp their names or logos prominently on centuries-old travertine.But this new reliance on corporate munificence could set up a dynamic by which only the most famous landmarks get face-lifts, because they generate the publicity that donors want. Income inequality: the monumental version.\u201cPeople who have a stake in these things are really frustrated,\u201d he told me.It\u2019s not just the trash. It\u2019s the profusion of unlicensed street vendors. The riot of untamed weeds. The erratic public transportation. The obstacle course of cars parked where they shouldn\u2019t be. The treacherous bulges and dips of unrepaired streets.I did notice the birds but even more so the butts: cigarettes cast away and never swept up. I counted them to distract myself as I ran beside the bilious water of the Tiber, slaloming around broken glass and swatting away mosquitoes, which seem to be enjoying a boom of their own.Later I climbed the Spanish Steps, freshly gleaming. From the top I could see the glory of Rome. I could also see how so many Italians \u2014 and plenty of other Westerners \u2014 feel that they live in some perverse shadow of affluence, and how anger and cynicism flower.

{"Headline": "In Venezuela\u2019s Chaos, Elites Play a High-Stakes Game for Survival", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterEven as Venezuela sinks into chaos, with clashes between protesters and the police escalating, why have its powerful political and military elites stuck by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro?The country would seem to be a prime candidate for something scholars call an \u201celite fracture,\u201d in which enough powerful officials break away to force a change in leadership.Long-mounting rage against Mr. Maduro\u2019s government exploded this past week when he called for a new Constitution, widely seen as the latest in a series of a power grabs. Demonstrators have overwhelmed city streets, so far undeterred by a police crackdown in which hundreds have been arrested and dozens killed.The violence deepens a monthslong crisis marked by food shortages, economic collapse and Mr. Maduro\u2019s fumbling attempts to consolidate authority. In quasi-democratic systems like Venezuela\u2019s, such pressures have often led elites to force a change, and have provided them an excuse to do so.\u201cThe fact that it hasn\u2019t happened in the last two years is the biggest puzzle of all,\u201d said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist. \u201cIf it happens next week, all of us will say, \u2018Yeah, it was bound to happen.\u2019\u201dStill, splits are beginning to emerge, as a few figures in major institutions signal opposition to Mr. Maduro, hinting at growing dissatisfaction and the government\u2019s inability to silence it.Recent actions by both elites and the government suggest they take the possibility of fracture seriously \u2014 maneuvering in a high-stakes contest that is potentially decisive but whose outcome remains uncertain.Elite fracture operates as a kind of game in which each player tries to figure out what the others are about to do. Stay loyal to a failing government too long and you risk going down with it. But if you break with the government and others don\u2019t, you\u2019ll pay a high price for disloyalty.This may be as old as politics itself. Plato, the 4th-century B.C. Greek philosopher, wrote that a united elite could resist popular uprisings, but that when the ruling class fractured, power could change hands.Members of the elite, in this game, try to test one another over where they stand, as well as the government\u2019s strength, in order to decide whether to remain loyal. If enough believe they have achieved critical mass to force a leadership change, they will all push at once.The government faced a dilemma. Tolerating Ms. Ortega\u2019s dissent would signal that elites could more freely break with Mr. Maduro, making action against him easier. But punishing her would risk backlash from any elites who shared her view.Ms. Ortega went unpunished, and the ruling was reversed.\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of enormous weakness inside the ruling clique that Luisa Ortega took the position that she did and kept her job,\u201d said Francisco Toro, a Venezuelan political scientist who edits the Caracas Chronicles website. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened before.\u201dRapid policy changes can open such fissures by forcing elites to decide whether to go along. In 2015, for instance, Mr. Maduro seemed to consider halting legislative elections, but ultimately agreed to hold them.\u201cThey tried to go too far,\u201d Mr. Levitsky said. \u201cThat created too much conflict within the regime.\u201dThis is why periods of crisis can heighten risks of elite fracture, as governments make rapid changes to keep up.The deciding vote in these situations is often cast by the military, which has the power to break a deadlock among elites and, often, the popular legitimacy to lead a transition.In Venezuela, some are already calling on the military to step in.Such statements can hardly force change. But by conferring pre-emptive legitimacy, they signal to potential coup leaders that they would enjoy at least some elite support.Still, the government has been preparing its defenses since 2002. That year, amid major protests, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, ordered the military to impose order. It instead removed him in a coup that was quickly reversed.After that, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez packed the military with allies.But 2002 also provided a warning that authoritarian leaders have learned repeatedly throughout history. Even a loyal military, when forced to resolve a political crisis, might decide against the leader who called it in.The impossibility of fully predicting how the military might decide in another crisis, along with growing unrest that could again test it, has left the government nervous.In March, a video spread on social media showing three lieutenants who said they no longer recognized Mr. Maduro\u2019s authority. The next month, they turned up in Colombia, where they requested asylum.The Venezuelan government has publicly demanded their return, which Mr. Levitsky called \u201cpretty clear evidence that the government is worried about some sort of conspiracy\u201d within the ranks.Because the government cannot be sure whether these voices represent wider opposition within the military, it has to guess at how severely to silence them \u2014 a guessing game it cannot afford to get wrong.But Mr. Maduro can also play this game. He has enabled loyalists to profit from corruption and patronage, giving them a financial stake in the government\u2019s survival.Loyalty was once purchased with oil revenue, but today, Mr. Toro said, the most valuable resource in Venezuela is access to favorable exchange rates. By leveraging official government rates, which value the bol\u00edvar considerably higher than the unofficial rate, someone with the proper connections can generate a small fortune out of thin air.But as the economy worsens, elites compete over a smaller pie.\u201cWhen elites begin to compete among themselves, usually somebody defects,\u201d Mr. Levitsky said, using the formal term for an elite who turns against the government.Venezuela is also growing internationally isolated, forcing elites to fear they could face foreign sanctions or even criminal charges if they remain loyal and the government falls.As threats mount, Mr. Levitsky said, \u201ceven actors who were bought off with patronage tend to worry.\u201dThis is part of what makes the lack of widespread defection, amid Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse, so unusual.Pressed to explain Mr. Maduro\u2019s resilience, Mr. Levitsky cited one of the only forces more powerful than economic self-interest: ideological polarization.Mr. Chavez\u2019s hypercharged populism succeeded in so dividing society that crossing over remains, for many, unthinkable. And so ideological dedication remains widespread, including among elites.\u201cDefection is harder when the other side isn\u2019t just some guy you disagree with about tax policy but rather is the enemy,\u201d Mr. Levitsky said. \u201cMoving to opposition, calling for Maduro\u2019s fall, is still akin to treason. That atmosphere makes defection much harder.\u201dZimbabwe, Mr. Levitsky said, might be the only other country whose government survived similar collapse. Its leader, Robert Mugabe, maintained elite support by framing his fight against dissent as a continuation of the revolutionary movement he had led against the white-supremacist colonial regime in Rhodesia.That same fervor could create an opportunity for dissidents, however. Venezuela\u2019s few defecting elites have tended to portray themselves as the true guardians of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s cause and Mr. Maduro as the traitor.The country\u2019s widespread shortages of food and medicine could also provide an opening for Ms. Ortega and other defectors to claim that the government is not fulfilling its socialist mission.And younger, second-tier Ch\u00e1vistas may worry about Mr. Maduro\u2019s damage to the cause and its longevity.\u201cThese guys have a stake in preserving some semblance of political capital in Ch\u00e1vismo,\u201d Mr. Levitsky said.This is why coups are often led by colonels or civilians of equivalent rank, who also enjoy fewer fruits of patronage and so face less downside in defecting.But movement can come only when elites, junior or senior, are sure they have the numbers to win. And any contest over ideological loyalty will tilt toward the status quo. The rules of the game still favor Mr. Maduro, even if the state of play does not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At First New Jersey Governor Debates, Parties Differ on Policy and in Tone", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byGALLOWAY, N.J. \u2014 After months of a campaign fought largely in town halls and mailboxes and on scattered commercial airwaves, the candidates for governor of New Jersey met here at Stockton University on Tuesday for the first televised primary debates. And while the Republican candidates sparred over tax policy and achievements, the Democratic candidates found themselves largely in agreement.Voters looking for a substantive debate about the many issues plaguing New Jersey \u2014 including critically underfunded pension and school systems, record property taxes and a transportation network on the brink of failure \u2014 were treated largely to candidate indictments of Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s stewardship of the state.In a Democratic debate that was more peaceful than acrid, the candidates transitioned from making biting opening statements to standing in unison in support of legalizing marijuana, supporting alternative energy sources such as wind turbines, paying for the entire school funding formula, investing in the state\u2019s failing infrastructure and countering President Trump.One of the few divisive moments in the Democratic debate came as Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and ambassador to Germany who is leading comfortably in early polling, offered his proposal of a public bank, run by the state, as a method to combat unemployment.John Wisniewski, a state assemblyman, countered: \u201cA state bank for New Jersey would be a disaster. If Mr. Murphy wants to create a state bank, maybe he should go back to Wall Street.\u201dJim Johnson, a former undersecretary of the United States Treasury, said, \u201cWe cannot adopt Wall Street gimmicks to address Main Street problems.\u201dIn his opening statement, Mr. Johnson had repeatedly framed Mr. Murphy\u2019s experience through the lens of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank frequently vilified by progressives.At the outset, it appeared that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wisniewski, trying to chip away at Mr. Murphy\u2019s polling lead, would frame their arguments as a condemnation of the \u201cpolitical machine\u201d that had thrown its early support behind Mr. Murphy and would portray him as an out-of-touch banker. But the early animosity largely faded.Mr. Murphy weathered the attacks, claiming support from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for a public bank. Perhaps aware of the coming Goldman references, he introduced his family story as one of the \u201cworking poor.\u201dSeveral of the questions focused on the environment, and Mr. Murphy emphasized that he had a plan \u201cthat envisions a 100 percent clean energy economy by the year 2050.\u201dThe fourth Democratic candidate, Raymond J. Lesniak, a state senator of about 40 years, pointed to his extensive experience in Trenton \u2014 particularly fighting for environmental legislation \u2014 and his frequent battles with Mr. Christie.\u201cOn Monday there\u2019s another deal I\u2019m going to stop,\u201d Senator Lesniak said, asserting that he was going to put a \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d on the governor\u2019s proposed $300 million renovation of the State House.On the Republican side, Jack Ciattarelli, a state assemblymen, kicked off the debate with a blunt warning, and harsher blame.\u201cWe\u2019re on the brink, and you all know the crisis: They ruined our economy and punished New Jerseyans every single day,\u201d Mr. Ciattarelli said, adding: \u201cKim Guadagno and the Christie administration had seven-plus years to fix New Jersey. They just haven\u2019t been able to get it done.\u201dMs. Guadagno, the lieutenant governor and the other Republican candidate at the debate, found herself in the delicate dance she has performed for most of her nascent campaign: embracing the few successes of her tenure with Mr. Christie at the helm while frequently pointing out where she disagreed with the governor. She said that she was \u201cnot a climate denier\u201d and that the current Republican plan in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act was a \u201cdisaster.\u201d But she also said she opposed the gas tax.The two Republican candidates repeatedly sparred over taxes. Ms. Guadagno tried to frame Mr. Ciattarelli\u2019s plan to solve the property tax crisis with a reorganization of the school funding formula as a potential tax. \u201cI have never seen a job that was created with a tax,\u201d she said.She offered instead her \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d program, which would provide a direct tax credit to residents with excessive property taxes in proportion to their income, although she never offered a detailed explanation of the plan.\u201cI\u2019ve presented a circuit breaker plan that will help those who are in need of making payments for their property taxes now,\u201d she said, \u201cnot in two or three years when Jack tries to get his school funding formula through the legislature.\u201dBut speaking with the rapid, metronomic clip of a candidate armed with an arsenal of practiced responses, Mr. Ciattarelli was relentless as he attacked Ms. Guadagno. He said she refused to address issues \u201cwith any specificity\u201d and called her circuit breaker plan \u201cirresponsible,\u201d her position against the gas tax \u201chypocritical\u201d and her pledge to never support a tax increase as \u201cpandering of the worst kind.\u201dMr. Ciattarelli even looked to the moderator at one point, alerting her when he saw that Ms. Guadagno had gone over her allotted time as she was answering a question about marijuana legislation.\u201cThank you for reminding me about the time, Jack,\u201d the moderator said.The debate came at a pivotal time in the race to succeed Mr. Christie, a Republican whose historically low approval ratings indicate an electorate anxious for a change.Yet no candidate has been able to break through and excite voters: A Quinnipiac poll last month found that 57 percent of state residents remained undecided.Participants in the debate were determined by the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, which sponsors the debates.Candidates qualifying for the state\u2019s matching funds program, which is available to any campaign that has raised at least $430,000, are required to take part in the debate. Mr. Murphy, who has opted out of the matching funds program, agreed to participate.Advertisement"}

If the market says that\u2019s what the painting is worth now, that\u2019s what it\u2019s worth.\u201dThe Sotheby\u2019s auction was destined to set a record for the artist because of the backing of a third-party \u201cirrevocable bid.\u201d In return for guaranteeing a sale at a certain undisclosed price, such third parties at Sotheby\u2019s are rewarded with either a fixed fee or a share of the \u201cupside\u201d above the guarantee, typically about 15 percent. Both types of guarantor can carry on bidding. If this arrangement involved taking a cut of the upside, the undisclosed irrevocable bidder on the Basquiat could have enjoyed a windfall of about $6 million.\u201cThe market is being more and more financialized, that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing more guarantees,\u201d said Adam Chinn, chief operating officer of Sotheby\u2019s, who declined to comment on the details of the Basquiat \u201cirrevocable\u201d bid. \u201cThe growth in capital is outstripping asset prices. It needs somewhere to go, and it\u2019s going to chase assets like postwar and contemporary art.\u201dThere appeared to be plenty of asset-chasing at the Sotheby\u2019s contemporary auction, which raised $319.2 million from 50 lots against a low estimate of $211 million. Two lots failed to sell.But with 71 lots, Christie\u2019s had a much larger offering, and no fewer than 39 works were backed by guarantees, compared with 18 at Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cThey sobered everything up a bit,\u201d said Mr. Nathan, adding that many of the guarantees backed high prices at Christie\u2019s. \u201cIt felt flat. High guarantees can distort the estimates beyond the market, so the auction becomes a parade, with the auctioneer\u2019s hammer merely confirming a pre-sale.\u201dYet the Christie\u2019s total was 41 percent higher than its equivalent contemporary auction last May, and sales at Sotheby\u2019s were up 32 percent from a year earlier.Was this a clear indication that the top end of the art market was gaining confidence in the Trump economy? The problem is that salesroom results are becoming a less clear indicator of the market. Guaranteed lots have been presold and high-value works offered without guarantees, but that fail to attract interest, can simply be withdrawn to keep the mood and the numbers upbeat.On May 16, Sotheby\u2019s pulled Egon Schiele\u2019s 1909 \u201cDanae,\u201d estimated at $30 million to $40 million, from its evening Impressionist and Modern sale; Willem de Kooning\u2019s 1977 abstract \u201cUntitled II,\u201d valued at $25 million to $35 million, disappeared from the Christie\u2019s contemporary sale on May 17; and the following afternoon at Phillips, Gerhard Richter\u2019s 1994 work \u201cAbstraktes Bild (811-1),\u201d with a low estimate of $15 million, was also withdrawn.With 19 guarantees in place, Phillips was able to claim a 100 percent \u201cwhite glove\u201d success rate for its 37-lot sale of 20th-century and contemporary art. The auction raised $110.3 million \u2014 more than double the equivalent sale last spring \u2014 led by Peter Doig\u2019s 1991 landscape \u201cRosedale,\u201d showing snow falling in Toronto, at $28.8 million, an auction high for the Scottish artist. This attracted two telephone bidders as well as its guarantor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Way It Used to Be", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byWordplayFRIDAY PUZZLE \u2014 As anyone who has ever been on a television game show knows, there is a big difference between confidently shouting out the answers from the comfort of your couch at home, and the pressure of having to come up with coherent responses in front of an audience under the hot lights of a TV studio.So it is with solving crossword puzzles versus creating them. There\u2019s a learning curve when you start to construct. Most constructors have the luxury of time, where they get to refine their word lists and practice their clue writing.Others, like our celebrity constructor today, don\u2019t have that luxury. Bill Clinton, who served as the 42nd president of the United States, made time in his very busy schedule to contribute a crossword puzzle to The New York Times Crossword\u2019s 75th anniversary celebration, and he and the Times constructor Victor Fleming offer us a themeless Friday to end our solving week.That\u2019s a particularly brave thing to do after a lifetime of solving and not constructing, so I\u2019m going to look at this a bit differently than if I were evaluating a regular Friday puzzle.I also like \u201cHeavy metal shortage?\u201d for ANEMIA and \u201cOnes in the closet?\u201d for LINENS.Congratulations are also extended to Judge Fleming, as this is his 46th crossword puzzle for The Times.\u25a0 18A: Today we\u2019re interpreting \u201cA real money maker\u201d literally: the answer is U.S. MINT.\u25a0 26A: Wordplay alert! \u201cInside look?\u201d is an M.R.I.\u25a0 47A: SAT Flashback: We\u2019ve got a theatrical analogy today. The Moli\u00e8res are the TONYS of France.\u25a0 7D: I used an OB/GYN, but it\u2019s possible that the real \u201cBaby deliverer\u201d was the STORK. You could have told me anything at that point, and as long as you had an epidural in your hand, I would have believed it.\u25a0 9D: I liked this clue a lot. The answer can\u2019t be \u201cchords,\u201d because those can be minor. The answer to \u201cThey can\u2019t be minor\u201d is ADULTS.Bill and I, along with the girls, were in some daddy-daughter programs \u2014 camp-outs, meals together, a dress-up dance, etc. Occasionally, he and I worked New York Times crosswords together \u2014 though, it\u2019s probably more accurate to say I helped a tad on puzzles he was solving. They were always weekend puzzles, and I couldn\u2019t finish Friday-Saturday Times puzzles until the mid-90s.After meeting Patrick Creadon and Christine O\u2019Malley \u2014 director and producer of \u201cWordplay\u201d \u2014 at the 2005 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, I sort of helped Pat and Chris get in touch with Bill to ask for an interview. Bill called me to ask about them, and I encouraged him to take the meeting.Bill, of course, was a star of the film \u2014 along with Will, Merl, and other notables such as Jon Stewart and Ken Burns. Though not totally surprised, I was honored when Will contacted me and asked if Bill and I would participate in the celebrity crossword series to celebrate The New York Times Crossword\u2019s 75th anniversary. We were given the task of \u201cthemeless puzzle with a political edge.\u201d I hope we hit the mark.Bill wrote all the clues. I sent him a few tweaks. He circled a bunch of them and wrote, \u201cToo easy and boring \u2014 might as well print the answers in the puzzle!\u201dSo, I backed off.Will told us that he was editing Bill\u2019s clues with \u201ca very light touch,\u201d so as to allow as much of his personality as possible to shine through. I think Will hit a home run on that score.Your thoughts?An earlier version of this article misstated President Bill Clinton\u2019s experience in creating crossword puzzles. He wrote clues for a puzzle in 2007; the Friday puzzle was not his first crossword.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s how these issues are playing out in the election.One of his rivals, Hong Joon-pyo, the candidate for the Liberty Korea Party, has said that a government under Mr. Moon would be too soft on North Korea. Mr. Hong says he is the true representative of conservatives, who favor close ties to the United States, and is calling for \u201carmed peace\u201d that supports the status quo of being tough on North Korea.As in the past, most candidates have promised legislation to make the chaebol more transparent and to make it harder for chairmen to help their children amass fortunes through dubious but lucrative deals involving their companies. Mr. Moon wants to give minority shareholders more power in electing board members of such conglomerates, which he says could ultimately dilute the families\u2019 control over the chaebol. Mr. Ahn, the centrist, has been similarly critical, suggesting that the government\u2019s Fair Trade Commission should have more power to regulate the chaebol.Mr. Hong, the conservative, has colorfully pledged to rid the country of corruption by putting it through a washing machine. He wants to crack down on the power of labor unions and is candid about favoring the chaebol because of their importance in the economy.The youth unemployment rate, for people 25 to 29, reached 8.2 percent in November, its highest level since 1999, raising questions about the country\u2019s ability to create jobs for recent college graduates.Mr. Moon has vowed to create 810,000 jobs in the public sector and raise taxes for the wealthy. But Mr. Ahn, an entrepreneur, has said that plan would be too costly. He has instead focused on the private sector, saying \u201ccompanies underpin growth of the country while creating jobs.\u201d He wants to guarantee employment for young people for five years, while promising wages at small companies that would be comparable to what they could earn at conglomerates.Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But the class action claims that McFarland and Atkins intentionally defrauded ticket buyers \u2014 that they \u201cwere knowingly lying about the festival\u2019s accommodations and safety and continued to promote the event and sell ticket packages\u201d after they knew they couldn\u2019t deliver \u2014 even warning performers and celebrities in advance not to bother coming. The case would seem to hinge, in part, on the question of what the organizers knew and when they knew it. In other words: Did they set out to scam ticket buyers, or did they just screw up?Right now seems like a good time to ask this question in general: Where is the line, exactly, between a poorly produced but well-advertised product and a con? More and more, we fully expect things to fall short of their advertising; if everything lived up to its hype, the world would be burdened with far fewer bad movies, miracle vitamins and optimistic campaign promises. Not long ago, I booked a plane flight using miles; when the flight was canceled because of bad weather, the airline simply kept the miles. Wells Fargo employees spent five years creating millions of fake accounts for unsuspecting customers in order to charge them additional fees; the year before this practice was uncovered, a news release introduced the bank\u2019s new brand campaign as one that would \u201ceschew product promotion for storytelling.\u201d Our president has agreed to pay millions in fraud settlements to thousands of students of his \u201cuniversity,\u201d with its $35,000 \u201cGold Elite\u201d program; his daughter, whom he has employed for much of her career, has published a book in which she writes about \u201ccultivating authenticity\u201d and presents herself as an accomplished businesswoman. It\u2019s a brand that she\u2019s selling \u2014 the have-it-all sizzle of a self-actualized career woman and loving supermom in fashionable shoes. Who cares whether, somewhere behind it, there may be the equivalent of an undeveloped gravel pit and some unboxed disaster tents?The ability of wealthy people to purchase and post their way to fabulousness may help explain why, in the aftermath of the Fyre fiasco, much of the delight that burbled up online revolved around the suffering of the presumably moneyed suckers who had purchased tickets: There were even jokes going around Twitter that Ja Rule had not only heroically fleeced wealthy millennials but successfully stranded them in an island gulag.These days, the scam economy may be entering its baroque phase. Technology has ushered in a sharing economy that lowers wages, reduces payrolls and turns workers into roguish free agents. Reality-TV and social-media figures train us to treat them like stars merely for acting like stars. Under the right circumstances, we\u2019ll even make folk heroes out of scammers. Seemingly inspired by the belief that \u201cevery modern woman is a scammer\u201d and that the heroine always gets away with it, a comedian named Branden Miller created a beloved internet character called Joanne the Scammer. Miller is a gay biracial man with a beard, but he plays Joanne as a Mexican-American in a fur coat who sees herself as a rich white woman and swans awkwardly through life on a cloud of \u201cCaucasian\u201d entitlement, unapologetically taking everyone for everything she can get. If the scam economy had an id, it would be Joanne, surviving in a scam-or-be-scammed world, fighting fraud with fraud: The odds are stacked against her, but she gives as bad as she gets. BuzzFeed even made a series of motivational posters from her tweets, like \u201cScam today before tomorrow scams you\u201d and \u201cOne way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as one big heist.\u201dThis was in the \u201970s, the consumer-advocacy heyday of Ralph Nader. Early in that decade, the transportation, communications, utilities, banking and insurance industries were heavily regulated. Unions were at their strongest. Wealth inequality was low. I was too young to understand any of this; I was watching Ernie excitedly showing off his purchase of nothing to an exasperated Bert. But I imagine it might have been much easier then, without all the extra anxiety and aspiration, to tell a clothed emperor from a naked one. The big generational shift since then, it seems, is from cynicism and avoidance to an admiration of the hustle and an enthusiasm for all the enthusiasm, which has dovetailed perfectly with the new laissez faire. The more Wild West the business environment, the more the hustler is elevated to folk hero or legend, much the same way that the robber barons once were.How surprising would it be if they couldn\u2019t? We are now expected to favor the story over reality, to accept that saying a thing makes it so. Recently, after I spent the better part of an afternoon on hold, a customer-service specialist asked me: \u201cHow may I provide you with legendary service today?\u201d And I thought, Well, I guess, just like that.Advertisement"}

The company has raised its starting wage by 10 percent since the beginning of the year to $17.50 an hour, but it\u2019s not enough.\u201cWe never want to have to say, \u2018We can\u2019t do it,\u2019 but we need people,\u201d Ms. Pappas said.That\u2019s good news for workers, who are reaping wage increases and moving to better jobs after years of stagnating pay that, for many, was stuck at a low level. Daniel Edlund, a 21-year-old call center worker in Provo, Utah, learned Monday that his hours were changing. On Wednesday, he had his first interview for a new job.\u201cI\u2019m trying to find a company that treats you well,\u201d he said.But labor shortages are weighing on overall economic growth, slowing the pace of expansion in northern Utah and other fast-growing regions even as unemployment remains stubbornly high in Rust Belt cities like Cleveland and in regions still recovering from the 2008 recession, like inland California.To Todd Bingham, the president of the Utah Manufacturers Association, \u201c3.1 percent unemployment is fabulous unless you\u2019re looking to hire people.\u201d\u201cOur companies are saying, \u2018We could grow faster, we could produce more product, if we had the workers,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIs it holding the economy back? I think it definitely is.\u201dPresident Trump continues to promise that he will accelerate job growth by cutting taxes and regulations. But the accumulating evidence that workers are getting harder to find, and that wages are rising more quickly, has convinced many economists that significantly faster growth is unlikely. The Federal Reserve has cited the trend as its reason for moving to wind down its own economic stimulus campaign. The Fed may raise interest rates again at its next meeting in June.Each Monday, the company ties red balloons to the desks of that week\u2019s batch of new employees. Last week, there were several dozen of those balloons. The parking lot outside the new headquarters building is already overstuffed, including many cars that still have out-of-state plates.Ryan Smith, now the chief executive, said Qualtrics had hired about three dozen graduates from the University of Michigan alone last year. The company estimates that new arrivals bought 100 homes in Provo last year.Companies in Utah, as in the rest of the country, were slow to raise wages in recent years. At first there were plenty of available workers. But by the end of 2015, a report by Utah\u2019s Department of Workforce Services concluded that inadequate wages had become a key reason companies were struggling to find employees.\u201cIt was as if employers hadn\u2019t adjusted their approach to the labor market\u201d as the economy recovered, said Carrie Mayne, the department\u2019s chief economist.Now there are signs the logjam is breaking. Adam Himoff, the president of Xemplar Skilled Workforce Solutions, a recruiting firm hired by Roofers Supply to find drivers, said he had seen an increase this year in the willingness of clients to raise wages.\u201cLabor has become the constraint on their growth goals, and they\u2019re recognizing that they\u2019re going to have to increase wages to achieve what they want to achieve,\u201d he said.Ms. Mayne said the state also saw signs of what she described as a broad-based acceleration in wages in the most recent data, through the end of last year.But the share of Utah adults who have withdrawn from the labor force remains higher than before the recession. Last year, 31.7 percent of adults in Utah were neither working nor looking for work, up from 28.2 percent in 2006. That is part of a broad national trend.And a 3.1 percent unemployment rate still means that about 50,000 people in Utah were trying to find jobs in March.But even in a red-hot market, some of the people who are looking for work struggle to find the right fit. Noel Nampijja, 42, left her job as a nurse\u2019s aide two months ago because the work of moving patients was hurting her back. She just completed training as a phlebotomist, a medical assistant who draws blood.\u201cI\u2019m hoping to find a job that won\u2019t hurt as much,\u201d she said.In less lucrative industries, labor shortages may remain an intractable problem.Ron Gibson, a fifth-generation dairy farmer, tends 1,500 cows on family land outside Ogden. Last month, he placed an ad in local papers seeking three workers at wages starting around $12 an hour. It did not draw any responses.Mr. Gibson cannot afford to chase workers by raising wages. The price of milk, adjusted for inflation, is lower now than in the 1980s. Instead, he is producing less milk. Each cow is milked three times a day; only 15 percent get a fourth milking.He also laughed at the idea that Americans might move from other states to milk cows in Utah. He relies primarily on immigrant labor, communicating with his two dozen workers in the Spanish he learned as a young Mormon missionary in Argentina. And since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, he said, workers are harder to find.\u201cWe are either going to import workers or we are going to import milk,\u201d Mr. Gibson said.The work \u201cis dirty, stinky and hard,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we teach our young people to do.\u201dMr. Gibson is not yet ready to make the jump. Each machine costs half a million dollars, and the New York farmer spends about as much on mechanics as he spent on farmhands. But Mr. Gibson said he expected his children would use robots to milk cows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Are Responding to Washington. That\u2019s Bad News for Markets.", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsWall Street is finally waking up to the reality in Washington. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1.8 percent on Wednesday in the most notable reversal to the so-called Trump rally since last year\u2019s election. Stockholders nevertheless remain too optimistic about any policy uplift.The promise of relaxed regulation, corporate tax cuts, and investment in America\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges under President Trump and a Republican Congress has excited investors for most of the past six months.Clinging to that cheery outlook required overlooking a plethora of warning signals, not least the daily dysfunction in the nation\u2019s capital and the possibility of detrimental decisions on matters such as trade. There were also the slapdash efforts at overhauling United States health care and regular leaks about investigations into potential links between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling into the election.Investors elsewhere have expressed a good deal of concern about the chances of Congress\u2019s passing legislation that might buoy both the economy and corporate bottom lines. The United States dollar index is right back where it was in early November. The 10-year Treasury yield, after soaring to 2.6 percent from under 2 percent, has retreated to 2.2 percent.The biggest market slump since September means equity investors are getting rattled, too. For that to happen, though, it took news that Mr. Trump had asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end an investigation into the administration\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn \u2014 along with the ensuing fallout, which has stirred mention of the word impeachment on Capitol Hill.There are, of course, other factors behind the stock market surge. For example, nearly all S & P 500 constituents have reported first-quarter results, revealing average profit growth of about 15 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Interest rates are low, and the employment picture is solid.Even after Wednesday\u2019s wobble, however, bank shares have jumped by more than a fifth, and the broader market is still up by some 13 percent since Mr. Trump won at the polls. That translates into a valuation of about 25 times earnings, a multiple hard to justify without at least factoring in ancillary benefits such as a tax cut. It should mean there is a bigger D.C. discount in store.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How North Korea Managed to Defy Years of Sanctions", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byDANDONG, China \u2014 As the end of the fashion season approached, and the suits and dresses arrived in her company\u2019s warehouses here in the Chinese border town of Dandong, the accountant crammed about $100,000 into a backpack, then boarded a rickety train with several co-workers.After a six-hour journey, she recalled, they arrived at a factory where hundreds of women using high-end European machines sewed clothes with \u201cMade in China\u201d labels. Her boss handed the money to the North Korean manager, all of it in American bills as required.Fraudulent labeling helps support its garment industry, which generated more than $500 million for the isolated nation last year, according to Chinese trade data.But China has a long record of shielding North Korea from more painful sanctions, because it is afraid of a regime collapse that could send refugees streaming across the border and leave it with a more hostile neighbor.Foreign trade, primarily with China, has surged, too, more than doubling since 2000, though it has slipped in the past three years.In theory, North Korea\u2019s greater openness to trade makes it more vulnerable to sanctions, with new potential targets and pressure points. But it also highlights the limits of an approach to sanctions \u2014 defined largely by China at the United Nations \u2014 that aims to punish North Korea\u2019s military and ruling elite while sparing its people. As trade expands, the lines have blurred.Positioned near the mouth of the Yalu River, Dandong is China\u2019s largest border town, and much of North Korea\u2019s trade with the world flows across its old bridges or through its deepwater port.Ms. Lang, 33, moved here more than a decade ago to study environmental protection. She ended up like many with ambition in this city of more than three million: doing business with North Korea.She wears exquisite makeup and carries a Louis Vuitton handbag, and she said her role in the garment trade was straightforward: Orders come in from Japan, Europe and other parts of China, and she gets the clothes made.For those with quick deadlines or detailed specifications, she turns to Chinese factories in Dandong, where quality control is better. Yet even these factories employ North Korean laborers, she said.For decades, North Korea has been accused of sending workers abroad and confiscating most of their wages, an arrangement that activists liken to slave labor. Researchers say the practice has expanded since Mr. Kim took power, with more than 50,000 workers now toiling in up to 40 countries.In Dandong, the local government boasts that 10,000 North Koreans are employed in its apparel factories, working 12- to 14-hour shifts, with just two to four days off each month and a monthly wage of no more than $260.Ms. Lang sends more-flexible orders to North Korea, where costs are lower but it is impossible to guarantee delivery dates because of power failures and a shortage of trucks.Her company ships fabric, buttons and zippers to factories there, she said, because the North lacks the materials, and they put \u201cMade in China\u201d labels in garments to make them easier to sell overseas. That would most likely be considered fraud and a violation of place-of-origin rules in countries that import the clothes, experts said.Paul Tjia, managing director of GPI Consultancy, a Dutch company that offers advice on doing business in North Korea, said that some European clients had ordered hundreds of thousands of garments and that \u201cMade in China\u201d labels could be justified by additional work put into the clothes inside China.But he added: \u201cI\u2019m not a garment manufacturer. I just make the introductions.\u201dChina has kept North Korea\u2019s garment sector off the list of industries targeted by United Nations sanctions, arguing that punishing it would hurt ordinary people and not military programs. It has protected North Korea\u2019s seafood industry using the same argument.But it is difficult to say who benefits from this trade, in part because even private enterprise in North Korea is overseen by state officials who extract taxes and bribes.\u201cWhether the proceeds from the textile industry support the nuclear program is an open question,\u201d said Joseph M. DeThomas, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and a former American ambassador involved in sanctions policy. \u201cMoney is fungible.\u201dAnd South Korean officials say the millions paid by Chinese companies to fish in North Korean waters go primarily to firms controlled by the North\u2019s military.Sanctions also do not cover the organized export of labor. The United States has urged countries to eject North Korean workers, saying their remittances benefit the military, not their families. But China, Russia and other nations continue to hire them.The United Nations Security Council did not impose sanctions until July 2006, when, after a series of missile tests, it banned countries from selling material for missiles or weapons of mass destruction to North Korea.The North detonated its first nuclear device months later, followed by additional tests in 2009 and 2013, and two in 2016. The Security Council tightened sanctions after each test, as well as after a satellite launch in 2013. It targeted military supplies and luxury goods, shut Pyongyang out of the international financial system and, most recently, banned a range of mineral exports.\u201cHow much cooperation will the international community get from Cuba, Russia, Iran or even Pakistan, Bangladesh or Laos?\u201d asked Stephan Haggard, an expert on the North Korean economy at the University of California, San Diego.The United States has also urged a boycott of Air Koryo, the North Korean airline, but it still flies to China and Russia. Chinese tourism to North Korea is booming, said Cha Yong Hyok, whose company, Indprk, takes groups by train to Pyongyang and will soon use new flights from Dandong.The North often circumvents banking sanctions using front companies and agents overseas, and North Koreans routinely send and receive payments using Chinese intermediaries who take a commission, despite the ban on \u201cbulk cash\u201d transfers.\u201cWe can and should go after these targets, but turning this into a game of financial cat-and-mouse will never achieve the level of pressure needed,\u201d said Daniel L. Glaser, a former Treasury Department official involved in sanctions enforcement.Ultimately, he argued, that pressure will come only if China makes a strategic decision to truly squeeze the North. \u201cThough China has taken helpful steps at times,\u201d he said, \u201cit has never been willing to go all in.\u201dMany of China\u2019s best-known companies have done business with North Korea even as they have sought customers and investors in the United States or relied on American-made parts and materials. ZTE, the mobile phone and electronics manufacturer, for example, shipped about $15 million of goods to the North in 2015, according to Chinese customs records viewed via the global trade database company Panjiva.But many Chinese companies sell products to North Korea without such problems. The electric car and battery maker BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway owns a 10 percent stake, has shipped $14 million in goods to North Korea since 2012, including rubber products in January and vehicles in December, customs records show. BYD and Berkshire Hathaway didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Just about every big Chinese appliance maker does business with North Korea, too, shipping refrigerators, air-conditioners, televisions and other electronics. The major Chinese automakers sell vehicles to the North as well.Even Tsingtao Brewery shows up in customs records, delivering $20,000 worth of beer in the summer of 2014.United Nations sanctions prohibit the sale of luxury goods to North Korea, but countries are generally left to define what that means. The resolutions list jewelry, luxury automobiles, sports equipment and snowmobiles but make no mention of televisions, consumer electronics or home appliances.In some cases, Chinese companies with access to advanced technology are doing business with North Korea. Subsidiaries of the defense manufacturer Norinco made seven shipments, mostly of electronic and optical goods, worth a total of $1.5 million, in the second half of last year, records say. Norinco did not respond to a request for comment.Matthew Brazil, a security consultant and former diplomat for the United States who investigated Chinese trade controls in the 1990s, said it was often impossible to get China to follow up on leads suggesting Chinese firms were violating restrictions. \u201cThree months later, if you\u2019re lucky, the visit is scheduled, and many times, visits weren\u2019t scheduled at all,\u201d he said.Mr. Brazil said the problem had persisted, and \u201cany level of control of American electronics has completely collapsed because this technology can be so easily shipped from China to North Korea.\u201dOn AliExpress, an e-commerce platform run by the Chinese internet giant Alibaba, six of the nine shipping services list North Korea as a potential destination. Alibaba declined to comment.The manager of a shipping firm in Dandong who asked to be identified only by her surname, Li, because of the nature of her work said shipping a package of electronics to North Korea was straightforward \u201cas long as it doesn\u2019t have obvious labels\u201d and meets weight requirements.In fact, a delivery is more likely to run into problems on the North Korean side of the border than with customs inspectors in China. \u201cThe key,\u201d she said, \u201cis to make sure everything is fine with the people on the other side.\u201dJane Perlez and Yufan Huang reported from Dandong, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

He also worried about possible Saudi war crimes in which America could be implicated.Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to apply pressure, combined with the giant arms sale, is raising fears that he may give the Saudis a green light to escalate the fighting, as well as find other ways to beef up America\u2019s own support for Riyadh.Since 2015, the Saudi-led coalition has been bombing the Houthis to try to push them out of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana.

Not Anymore.", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported by\u201cThis was an opportunity missed,\u201d said Michael Lamb, Pittsburgh\u2019s city controller, who has called on Uber to share the traffic data gathered by its autonomous vehicles.Yet Pittsburgh shows the clash of private-versus-public interests that can result. The lessons are college course level \u201c101,\u201d said Linda Bailey, the executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials.Uber \u201cis a business, and they want to make money,\u201d she said. \u201cWith Pittsburgh, we learned we need to present the city\u2019s needs upfront.\u201dUber said it was open to a deal with Pittsburgh but had yet to see a draft of proposed commitments the city is seeking from the company. Uber said it planned to share some data collected by its autonomous vehicles with the city this year, though Pittsburgh officials say the data Uber shares with other cities is insufficient.\u201cUber is proud to have put Pittsburgh on the self-driving map, an effort that included creating hundreds of tech jobs and investing hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe hope to continue to have a positive presence in Pittsburgh by supporting the local economy and community.\u201dPittsburgh\u2019s frustrations with Uber are encapsulated in the Hazelwood neighborhood along the Monongahela River, where the company opened a driverless vehicle testing track last year. From the second floor of the neighboring Center of Life church, the track is in full view. Sky-blue Volvo S.U.V.s with large revolving lidar devices on their roofs navigate around shipping containers and stoplights. The area is enclosed by a chain-link fence wrapped in a black tarp.When Uber picked the site in 2016, a company representative told community leaders that it wanted to hire from the neighborhood. Tim Smith, a pastor at the Center of Life church and the head of a neighborhood group, said he had given Uber a list of job candidates, including a mapping engineer and technicians.Since then, Mr. Smith said, he has been told that applicants should go through Uber\u2019s general jobs site. None have been hired.\u201cWe have been underserved for decades, and now there are people who live right on the other side of that fence that are missing out,\u201d he said.Uber has benefited Pittsburgh in some ways. The company has raised Pittsburgh\u2019s profile, and its Advanced Technologies Center there, which Uber opened for driverless research in 2015, has revived the former steel mill neighborhood known as the Strip District.Molly Nichols, executive director of the group, said Uber had called to ask her to cancel the protest, which ultimately went ahead.\u201cThe warning signs about Uber\u2019s questionable business practices were all over the place, and the mayor should have recognized that and worked harder to create a partnership that was more equitable,\u201d Ms. Nichols said.She added that there might be longer-term problems from autonomous vehicles, including automation\u2019s effect on Uber\u2019s 4,000 drivers in the city. Parking fees also make up about 15 percent of Pittsburgh\u2019s revenue, and the city has not said how those funds would be replaced if fewer people owned and parked cars and used driverless services instead, she said.Mr. Peduto, a third-generation Pittsburgher, has perhaps had the most noticeable change of heart.Mr. Kalanick first approached Mr. Peduto in 2015 with plans to start driverless trials in Pittsburgh. At the time, Mr. Kalanick had hired away more than three dozen researchers and robotics experts from the city\u2019s Carnegie Mellon University, upsetting some faculty and officials. Mr. Peduto defended Uber and said he shared Mr. Kalanick\u2019s vision.The two exchanged texts frequently. In September, Mr. Peduto became the first passenger to hail a driverless car and posted a photo of himself grinning in the back seat of an Uber car.\u201cIt was inspiring, and we knew in Tempe, the innovation center of Arizona, we wanted to have that kind of partnership,\u201d said Mark Mitchell, the mayor of Tempe, where Uber began testing driverless cars last fall.But hidden from the public was Mr. Peduto\u2019s simmering frustration with Uber. In early 2016, Uber had indicated it would support Pittsburgh\u2019s application for a federal grant to redo local transportation, according to Mr. Peduto. He asked Uber to commit private funds to enhance the proposal. Uber said that the request had come too late and that the desired amount \u2014 $25 million \u2014 was too much. Pittsburgh didn\u2019t win the federal competition.In January, Mr. Peduto was also surprised to get billed for a ride home in an Uber autonomous vehicle. \u201cTravis Kalanick had told me the rides would be free and a service for the public,\u201d he said.Uber said it had always intended to charge for driverless rides.Still, there are signs that Uber is trying to improve some relations. The company said it had agreed to work with Hazelwood residents on an art installation along the black chain-link fence surrounding the test track. This month, Uber officials also invited Mr. Smith, the church pastor in Hazelwood, to discuss job training for young adults.\u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\u201cWhen it came to what Uber and what Travis Kalanick wanted, Pittsburgh delivered,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cBut when it came to our vision of how this industry could enhance people, planet and place, that message fell on deaf ears.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying for four and a half years to coax the economy into a higher gear. Although Japan\u2019s output is still the world\u2019s third-largest, after the United States and China, consistent growth has been elusive \u2014 the result of headwinds like a declining population and deflation.Japanese gross domestic product increased by 2.2 percent in annualized terms in the three months through March, the government\u2019s Cabinet Office said in a preliminary estimate on Thursday. The economy has now been expanding for a longer period than at any time since 2005-6, when it grew for six quarters in a row.The pace of expansion also accelerated from the previous quarter, and was stronger than economists had expected. Analysts surveyed by news agencies had forecast a growth rate of 1.7 percent, on average.The domestic side of the economy has been shakier, with spending by consumers and businesses mostly weak and inconsistent. But in the latest quarter, consumption and business investment both rose.A warm one, certainly. Output grew 1 percent in all of 2016 \u2014 not exactly China-fast, but about twice what economists estimate Japan should be able to achieve given its shrinking pool of workers and consumers. For the first few years after Mr. Abe came to office, in 2012, on a promise to kick-start growth, the economy lurched between expansion and contraction. Now it appears to have found a more stable groove.The big idea behind \u201cAbenomics,\u201d as Mr. Abe\u2019s strategy is known, was to engineer a rise in consumer prices, which would in turn lift corporate profits and workers\u2019 pay. That, the government said, would make the economy grow not only faster but also more consistently. Prices have barely budged, however, leaving many economists speculating that the current streak, though welcome, will fade.Advertisement"}

Each month they help feed 43 million poor and low-income Americans, most in families with children and working parents. Food stamps, officially the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, keep millions of people from falling into poverty each year and prevent millions of poor people, many disabled or elderly, from falling deeper into poverty.They also improve the future prospects of poor children by fostering better health and graduation rates.The budget would also reduce the food stamp program by making its strict requirements even stricter. For example, it would all but prohibit states from waiving a federal rule that generally cuts off unemployed childless adults after three months. The cutoff is supposed to prevent freeloading, but it mainly affects people who have low skills, arrest records, substance abuse problems or other impediments to employment. The budget would also make it harder for states to adjust the eligibility formula where rents or child care costs are high. And no matter how large a family is, the benefit calculation would be capped at six people.The proposed cuts have little chance of enactment, but they are still dangerous. Extreme proposals are a way to make less extreme proposals seem acceptable. To avoid that trap, members of Congress from both parties need to do more than simply declare the Trump budget dead on arrival. They need to make specific objections and draw clear lines in the sand. Otherwise, the objectionable provisions will return, slightly altered, but hardly less awful. They also need to resist accepting federal spending cuts as inevitable.So the problem is not the number of people on food stamps; it\u2019s that companies pay wages so low that their employees qualify for them. It is a problem that Congress and the White House can rectify, not by cutting spending, but by raising the minimum wage, updating the overtime-pay rules and instituting paid sick leave \u2014 for starters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Real Estate\u2019s New Normal: Homeowners Staying Put", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byFor much of last year, Greg Rubin was looking to buy a bigger house. He has been in the same two-bedroom home for 17 years and hoped to upgrade to a place with a guest room, a home office and a workshop for his guitars, radio-controlled planes and gardening equipment.This year, Mr. Rubin has a new plan. He stopped looking and embarked on an ambitious renovation project that will begin with a new kitchen and end with a workshop for all the man toys.\u201cMy girlfriend would like to get a larger house, but right now, I\u2019m staying put,\u201d said Mr. Rubin, who lives in Escondido, Calif., and owns a landscaping firm called California\u2019s Own Native Landscape Design.Mr. Rubin is the face of what appears to be a new normal in the real estate business: Homeowners are moving less, creating a drag on the economy, fewer commissions for real estate brokers and a brutally competitive market for first-time home shoppers who cannot find much for sale and are likely to be disappointed during real estate\u2019s spring selling season.For many homeowners, the desire to stay put began out of caution or necessity. Mr. Rubin\u2019s business lost more than half of its revenue in the years after the Great Recession, so until recently, he had no money or desire to upgrade. Millions of other homeowners lost their jobs or were stuck in homes worth less than they owed the bank \u2014 two big reasons that the median homeownership tenure rose to about eight and a half years last year, up from about three and a half in 2008, according to data from Moody\u2019s Analytics and First American Financial Corporation. That is the longest tenure since their data began in 2000.But even though the economy and the housing market have improved \u2014 unemployment is below 5 percent, and steadily rising home prices have freed millions of people from the scourge of \u201cunderwater\u201d mortgages \u2014 economists expect elevated homeownership tenure to continue for the next decade or even longer. That is because the better economy has come with a steady rise in interest rates.Like tens of millions of others, Mr. Rubin refinanced when mortgage rates were near a historic low. He has a 3.25 percent interest rate on his home loan, so even if he could find a similar home for the same price, his payment would go up considerably. For a 30-year fixed-rate $500,000 mortgage, an interest-rate rise to 5.5 percent would increase the monthly payment roughly $700 to $3,600, including estimated taxes and fees, according to Zillow, the real estate data service.\u201cOnce mortgage rates climb to 5 or 5.5 percent, we are going to start to see the lock-in effect really take hold,\u201d said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.In any case, the increase in homeownership tenure is yet another example of how the economy is still feeling the effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the Federal Reserve\u2019s extraordinary policy measures to address it. It also highlights just how far the housing market remains from its pre-recession form.We created a set of charts for several metropolitan areas that look at school quality, home price and commute. There are deals to be had.\u201cWe are coming out of a deep, dark hole called the housing bust, but we are a long way from normal, and we may never get back to normal, if normal was the average person stayed in their home for four or five years,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re at eight-plus now, and even under the best of circumstances, maybe we get to six.\u201dStill, the impact will be felt throughout the economy. Whether in broker commissions, new furniture or junk hauling, moving costs a lot of money, so longer home tenures are likely to weigh on consumer spending.It could also hurt the economy in more subtle ways, by making people less mobile. For instance, some people might find a better job in another city but decide not to take it because the pay would not make up for the increase in mortgage costs.Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm, sees this in the form of a persistent inventory shortage. More people are buying tear-downs. The bidding wars that have come to characterize hot job markets like San Francisco and Seattle are spreading to less-expensive cities.Mr. Kelman said those who would normally sell their home to get the down payment for a new one were increasingly becoming landlords because their low-interest loans meant extra profit in rent \u2014 translating into less business for him.\u201cPeople who buy a home and sell their home are the meat and drink of the real estate business, but increasingly, we\u2019re only getting half the sales from them,\u201d he said.The Olsons live in Chicago in a two-bedroom apartment with views of Wrigley Field. For the last few years, when winter turned to spring, they embarked on a weekend-to-weekend journey in search of their first home.When they started, it was just the two of them, and they limited their search to two nearby neighborhoods. But with inventory scarce, competition high and a newborn who arrived in January, they now go to open houses with their son in a baby carrier and have expanded their search to encompass most of the city\u2019s North Side and a few nearby suburbs.\u201cThere is no inventory \u2014 we\u2019re talking four or five houses in our price range a week,\u201d said Mr. Olson, who works in information technology at a bank. \u201cSome of those are houses with holes in the floor, holes in the roof \u2014 and even those are flying off the market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hyundai Whistle-Blower, in Rarity for South Korea, Prompts Recall", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Kim Gwang-ho, an automotive engineer, did something last year that many South Koreans saw as an act of betrayal: He became a whistle-blower.Mr. Kim was then a 25-year veteran of Hyundai Motor Group, one of South Korea\u2019s most successful companies and an icon of its industrial might. But he believed Hyundai was hiding dangerous defects from the public and the authorities, and he sent a batch of internal Hyundai documents to officials in South Korea and the United States to prove his allegations.\u201cIf someone higher-ranked than you says you do it, you do it, no questions asked,\u201d Mr. Kim, 55, said in an April interview, echoing critics who say South Korea suffers from a rigid hierarchical corporate culture. His eyes showed signs of fatigue that he attributed to months of publicly clashing with Hyundai. \u201cIf you talk back to a boss frankly, you\u2019ll get fired,\u201d he said.Hyundai, which fired Mr. Kim, disputes his allegations. But on Friday, the government ordered Hyundai to recall 240,000 vehicles in South Korea and said that it would refer accusations that it hid defects to prosecutors. The government cited manufacturing issues brought to its attention by an insider it did not identify, but Hyundai, government officials, the local news media and Mr. Kim have all said that he is that insider.\u201cThe Hyundai case could be a trigger for more systematic support for whistle-blowers, given the high level of public interest,\u201d said Lee Young-kee, a lawyer who heads the Horuragi Foundation, a civic group that seeks greater whistle-blower protections. \u201cThis is a rare opportunity.\u201dSouth Korea\u2019s companies can also fight back. Hyundai has said it will comply with the recall order but disputes that it hid any problems or that Mr. Kim had evidence of wrongdoing.\u201cThe issues raised were being monitored before his request was made, as part of our stringent internal procedures,\u201d it said in a statement.South Korea is known for a strict hierarchy in the workplace, stemming from past military rule as well as mandatory military service of about two years for all able-bodied men. Those who find positions through family, school or hometown connections are often well taken care of, but critics say the culture discourages independent voices.For a whistle-blower here, coming out of the shadows can be an ordeal. In a 2013 survey of 42 whistle-blowers by the Horuragi Foundation, 60 percent said they were fired after exposing organizational corruption. Whistle-blowers also said they experienced financial hardship and ostracism from colleagues.On Friday, the Transport Ministry ordered a recall affecting 12 popular Hyundai models under both its Hyundai and Kia brands, including sedans such as the Elantra and the Sonata as well as the Santa Fe, a sport utility vehicle. The ministry added that it asked prosecutors to investigate whether the carmakers hid five defects related to the recall from the public, including damaged vacuum pipes and excessive ventilation resistance in fuel vapor canisters.The 240,000 vehicles recalled \u2014 all in South Korea \u2014 add to another 1.4 million Hyundai offered to fix last month in South Korea and the United States. A spokeswoman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States said in an email that the agency \u201cis reviewing and will take appropriate action as warranted\u201d but declined to comment further. An N.H.T.S.A. investigator working on the case declined to comment. Hyundai has said there were no deaths or injuries related to the recalled vehicles.The battle between Hyundai and Mr. Kim unfolded over several months in the South Korean news media. Mr. Kim shared his allegations everywhere he could, uploading parts of the documents on online forums and providing them to the local news media.\u201cEngineers are like that,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cWe don\u2019t lie.\u201dHyundai filed for a court injunction against him in October to stop him from exposing internal documents, saying he breached a written oath of confidentiality. That same month, Hyundai sued him for breach of trust, leading to a criminal investigation by the police.Mr. Kim joined Hyundai in 1991 at age 29 and had few complaints about the company until about two years ago.According to Mr. Kim, he was in a meeting in July 2015 where his colleagues suggested playing down just-discovered design flaws to an engine model to reduce repair costs. Fearing he would be considered an accomplice, Mr. Kim alerted company auditors about the meeting and requested an internal transfer, which was granted.But after a year, he saw no action had been taken against the meeting\u2019s participants or to fix the problems, and so he took matters in his own hands.In November, a court in Seoul, the South Korean capital, ruled that his online activities and news media access exceeded the legal definition of whistle-blowing. The judges also ruled that the documents in his possession were not conclusive, saying the findings were \u201clikely to be updated continuously.\u201d Hyundai fired Mr. Kim that same month.But in March, South Korea\u2019s Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission ruled that he should get his job back. Mr. Kim returned to Hyundai last month, but the carmaker had been challenging the commission\u2019s decision with an administrative court. On Tuesday, the two sides appeared to reach a deal, with Mr. Kim resigning from Hyundai and the company withdrawing both the lawsuits and the complaint to the police, a Hyundai spokeswoman said.\u201cI had a good life when I worked there, with good salary and benefits,\u201d Mr. Kim said.He added that, for others, \u201cto fight against a big business, in Korean culture, I wouldn\u2019t bet on that happening again soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Passes Measure to Repeal and Replace the Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Thursday narrowly approved legislation to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, as Republicans recovered from their earlier failures and moved a step closer to delivering on their promise to reshape American health care without mandated insurance coverage.The vote, 217 to 213, held on President Trump\u2019s 105th day in office, is a significant step on what could be a long legislative road. Twenty Republicans bolted from their leadership to vote no. But the win keeps alive the party\u2019s dream of unwinding President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.The House measure faces profound uncertainty in the Senate, where a handful of Republican senators immediately rejected it, signaling that they would start work on a new version of the bill virtually from scratch.\u201cTo the extent that the House solves problems, we might borrow ideas,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee. \u201cWe can go to conference with the House, or they can pass our bill.\u201dEven before the vote, some Republican senators had expressed deep reservations about one of the most important provisions of the House bill, which would roll back the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.But a softening of the House bill, which could help it get through the Senate, would present new problems. For any repeal measure to become law, the House and the Senate would have to agree on the language, a formidable challenge.The House voted in May 2017 on a  health care bill to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act.Just before the House vote, the Senate gave final approval on Thursday to a $1.1 trillion spending bill that will finance the government through September, and unlike the health care legislation, the spending bill had broad bipartisan support.After weeks of negotiations and false starts, Mr. Trump and House Republicans were not about to dwell on the tough road ahead. Passage of the health care bill completed a remarkable act of political resuscitation, six weeks after House leaders failed to muster the votes to pass an earlier version of the measure, a blow to Mr. Trump and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.\u201cYes, premiums will be coming down; yes, deductibles will be coming down, but very importantly, it\u2019s a great plan,\u201d Mr. Trump boasted on Thursday at the kind of White House Rose Garden victory ceremony typically reserved for legislation that is being signed into law, not for a controversial bill that passed just one chamber.\u201cWe want to brag about the plan,\u201d Mr. Trump said, after asking those assembled how he was doing in his debut as a politician. \u201cHey, I\u2019m president!\u201dMr. Trump quickly turned his attention to pressuring the Senate to act, calling the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, to talk about the way forward for the health plan.Democrats, who voted unanimously against the bill, vowed to make Republicans pay a political price for pushing such unpopular legislation. As Republicans reached the threshold for passage, Democrats serenaded them with, \u201cNa na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye!\u201d\u201cI have never seen political suicide in my life like I\u2019m seeing today,\u201d Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, said on the House floor before the vote.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, warned moderate Republicans who supported the measure: \u201cYou have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead. You will glow in the dark on this one.\u201dThe House bill would eliminate tax penalties for people who go without health insurance. It would roll back state-by-state expansions of Medicaid, which covered millions of low-income Americans. And in place of government-subsidized insurance policies offered exclusively on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplaces, the bill would offer tax credits of $2,000 to $4,000 a year, depending on age.A family could receive up to $14,000 a year in credits. The credits would be reduced for individuals making over $75,000 a year and families making over $150,000.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the first version of the bill would trim the federal budget deficit considerably but would also leave 24 million more Americans without health insurance after a decade. Average insurance premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in 2018 and 2019, but after that, they would be lower than projected under current law.Mr. Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee, said Thursday that Republicans had been quietly working for several months on their own bill and would take the House measure under consideration for ideas and components.Senate Republicans will face some of the same dynamics that stymied the House for weeks. Moderate senators will demand significant concessions, which in turn could alienate three hard-liners: Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah.Republican senators are certain to face pressure from governors worried about constituents on Medicaid losing their coverage. Republican leaders changed the House bill to woo hard-line conservatives, allowing state governments to roll back required coverage for essential services like maternity and emergency care. States could also seek waivers that would let insurers charge higher premiums for some people with pre-existing medical conditions.The Times would like to hear from Americans who are signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWe cannot pull the rug out from under states like Nevada that expanded Medicaid, and we need assurances that people with pre-existing conditions will be protected,\u201d said Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, who is up for re-election next year.Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said he wanted to ensure that the final repeal bill \u201cfulfills President Trump\u2019s promises to lower premiums, maintain coverage and protect those with pre-existing conditions.\u201dDemocrats are confident that some provisions of the House bill will be found to violate special budget rules that Republicans must follow in order to skirt a Senate filibuster.\u201cThis bill is going nowhere fast in the United States Senate,\u201d the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said. He said his Republican colleagues \u201cshould refuse to follow their House colleagues over a cliff, reject repeal, and work with Democrats to improve our health care system in a bipartisan way.\u201dRepublicans have promised for seven years to repeal the Affordable Care Act, under which around 20 million Americans gained health coverage. But they had no consensus on how much of the law should be repealed and had great difficulty devising a comprehensive replacement. Their doubts were reinforced by constituents who said the health law had saved their lives.Doctors, hospitals and other health care providers joined patient advocacy groups like the American Cancer Society and AARP in opposing the repeal bill.But House Republicans said that insurance markets in many states were already melting down, and they pointed to Iowa, where the last major insurer under the Affordable Care Act has threatened to pull out.There may be \u201cnobody to write insurance for people that are in the Obamacare exchanges\u201d in 94 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties, said the House Republican whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana.The House vote on Thursday occurred before the Congressional Budget Office had released a new analysis of the revised bill with its cost and impact. Democrats angrily questioned how Republicans could vote on a bill that would affect millions of people and a large slice of the American economy without knowing the ramifications.The Republican bill, the American Health Care Act, would make profound changes to Medicaid, the health program for low-income people, ending its status as an open-ended entitlement. States would receive an allotment of federal money for each beneficiary, or, as an alternative, they could take the money in a lump sum as a block grant, with fewer federal requirements. The bill would also repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act on high-income people, insurers and drug companies, among others. And it would cut off federal funds from Planned Parenthood for one year.Many defenders of the bill focused less on its details than on what they saw as shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cObamacare has hijacked the free market and has taken some Americans\u2019 liberties with it,\u201d Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said on the floor, adding that the health law \u201creplaced our doctors with bureaucrats, because that\u2019s what socialized medicine does.\u201dDemocrats worked to link House Republicans\u2019 actions to an unpopular president. \u201cThe Pied Piper of Trump Tower is playing a tune today, and they must dance,\u201d said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas.Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Republicans: \u201cYou are taking away essential health care protections. You are allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.\u201dIn truth, Republicans argued, with so many problems afflicting the Affordable Care Act, the status quo is unsustainable, regardless of what Congress does. Hours before the vote, Mr. Trump pointed to Aetna\u2019s announcement this week that it would no longer offer policies on Virginia\u2019s Affordable Care Act exchange.\u201cDeath spiral!\u201d the president wrote on Twitter.Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Alan Rappeport and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Questions Surround Ukraine\u2019s Bailouts as Banking Chief Steps Down", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byIn the years since Ukraine\u2019s revolution ushered in a pro-Western government, the United States, the International Monetary Fund and other donors loosened the purse strings to offer Kiev foreign aid.But at the same time, anticorruption groups have been raising questions over where those billions of dollars have gone, concerns that have been amplified after Ukraine\u2019s central bank chief resigned amid an investigation into a bailout of the country\u2019s largest bank, a lender once owned by a pro-government oligarch.The stakes are high, with Ukraine heavily dependent on foreign financial help as it grapples with the loss of about 12 percent of its territory and nearly a fifth of its gross domestic product as a result of its war with Russia.But her resignation comes after the authorities opened an inquiry in March into the central bank\u2019s operations. The government in December spent $5.6 billion on a recapitalization of PrivatBank, which is owned by Ihor V. Kolomoisky \u2014 the pro-Kiev commander of a battle-hardened militia and the governor of a crucial region that is on the front line of the Russian conflict.Ms. Gontareva, who took the post in 2014, closed half of Ukraine\u2019s private banks. That was part of efforts to carry out a \u201ctotal revamp of the Ukrainian banking system,\u201d she said in a recent interview.Not everyone was pleased with her efforts. At one point during her tenure, she found a coffin dumped outside her home.Among the moves she oversaw were deals offering PrivatBank central bank refinancing to strengthen the lender\u2019s balance sheet. But at least $1.8 billion of that money quickly vanished into bad loans, according to the Anti-Corruption Action Center, an independent organization tracking fraud in Ukraine that is financed in part by United States government grants. By December, PrivatBank faced a huge capital shortfall.\u201cWhen I opened their books as governor of the central bank, I was shocked,\u201d Ms. Gontareva said. \u201cInstead of real assets, they have just shells.\u201dPrivatBank, with nearly a third of Ukraine\u2019s individual bank deposits, was too big to fail, particularly in a country destabilized by war. The government in Kiev soon stepped in with the $5.6 billion bailout, nationalizing the lender.Through it all, Mr. Kolomoisky was financing a major anti-Russian militia in the war in eastern Ukraine. The militia, called Dnepro-1, remains well regarded by Ukrainian soldiers and was crucial in holding parts of the front line before the regular army could be transformed into a battle-ready state.That support for the militia insulated his business activity from aggressive oversight by the government he was defending militarily, said Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kiev School of Economics. \u201cPeople respect him for helping to save Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Mylovanov said.Instead, the I.M.F. mandated the creation of an independent anticorruption watchdog. On March 29, agents from that body searched the central bank\u2019s headquarters as part of a half dozen criminal inquiries into \u201cmisuses or misappropriation,\u201d of central bank funds, including one looking specifically at possible wrongdoing by central bank employees, according to a spokeswoman.Independent anticorruption groups say the March raid was related to accusations of impropriety over refinancing deals with failing, oligarch-controlled lenders, like PrivatBank.Ms. Gontareva has protested her innocence and said bank closings during her tenure had in fact put an end to refinancing fraud in Ukraine. She said that the central bank had forwarded recommendations for criminal prosecutions for loan fraud to the authorities but that with the judicial system still largely unreformed, few cases had made it to court.\u201cSad to say, some of these loans were extended with the full knowledge that they would never be paid back,\u201d said Frank Gill, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cThat is how things worked in the past, and Governor Gontareva had the unenviable task of cleaning that up.\u201dThe former central bank chief blamed criticism of her work in the Ukrainian media, and the death threats, on disgruntled businessmen unhappy with her efforts to close banks. She described the corruption investigation as \u201cnothing special\u201d and said it was one of several audits and reviews of the central bank.She said she had carried out tough reforms, reducing the bloated size of the central bank\u2019s staff, which at one point numbered 12,000; slashed inflation to single digits from 43 percent in 2015; and moved the country to a more flexible foreign exchange system.Ms. Gontareva said she was planning to take some time off and re-enter the private sector \u2014 she previously worked for a brokerage firm in Ukraine \u2014 adding that she hoped never to be a bureaucrat again.A former spokesman for Mr. Kolomoisky, Borys Braginsky, said in a telephone interview that he had no means of contacting the businessman. He added that Mr. Kolomoisky had not retained a new spokesman and could not be reached for comment.With so much money at stake, political pressure is mounting on the Ukrainian anticorruption watchdog, which is investigating the central bank and which last summer revealed secret payments in Ukraine to President Trump\u2019s then campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort. Rival factions in Parliament have clashed over the appointment of an outside auditor to the organization.The I.M.F. has now tightened its conditions for lending.In February, it listed the creation of an anticorruption court, free from political interference, as a benchmark for future disbursements. It said in written replies to questions that it was considering elevating some requirements from benchmarks to \u201cprior action\u201d demands, or conditions that a country must meet before the fund\u2019s board will even convene to consider releasing a new tranche of funding.There is little dispute that the central bank had to close several shaky banks in Ukraine, said Daria M. Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center. But the hefty cost to Ukrainian taxpayers and Western donors, including the United States, was most likely too high because the failing banks \u2014 most disastrously PrivatBank \u2014 were refinanced shortly before they collapsed.The eventual loss from PrivatBank, Ms. Kaleniuk said, should have been obvious to the central bank before it cost donors and taxpayers billions.\u201cThis scheme could have been noticed by the central bank and by Gontareva,\u201d Ms. Kaleniuk said. \u201cThe problem is, nobody has been punished yet for such a huge fraud.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Powerful Family Business Ties Could Be Tough to Cut", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byForget Machiavelli, or \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d When it comes to staying in power, South Korea\u2019s richest business clans have the game plan down.There is the charity maneuver, in which family members park their stakes in their business empires in philanthropic nonprofits, letting them keep control without paying heavy taxes.There is the new company maneuver, in which they create new firms that strike lucrative and friendly business deals with the others they control.And then there is old-fashioned corporate engineering, in which they merge arms of their empires together to consolidate power, even as other shareholders complain.\u201cChaebol family control as we know it could end with this generation,\u201d said Kim Woochan, a professor of finance at Korea University Business School in Seoul, the South Korean capital, pointing to an intensifying backlash against inherited wealth. \u201cAn opportunity as good as this one is unprecedented.\u201dBut that could be easier said than done, South Korean officials and experts say. While the public blames the chaebol for an embarrassing series of political and business scandals and for holding back the country\u2019s once-surging economy, they continue to hold considerable political power. Their controlling families have also proved adept at finding ways to keep control, even as they face increasing challenges from inheritance taxes, unhappy outside investors and their own family squabbling.\u201cLeaders, markets, they don\u2019t change overnight,\u201d said Rhyu Sang-young, a professor of political economy at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cEvery culture has a strong legacy, inertia. It takes time.\u201dThe front-runner in Tuesday\u2019s election, Moon Jae-in, has vowed to stop families from using nonprofit foundations, complicated shareholding plans and other methods to keep control of businesses. One of his main advisers is Kim Sang-jo, an economist known for hawkish views on the chaebol.But the Democratic Party, led by Mr. Moon, holds only 119 seats in the 300-member legislature, the National Assembly. The Democrats would find it hard to get support from rival parties in passing chaebol reform bills through a fractured legislature, where a pro-business lobby also remains strong. Passing a bill will take many months of wrangling.Mr. Moon has also promised to make prosecutors more independent and to make it more difficult for a president to abuse the power of the office, limiting the ability of chaebol to collude with the authorities and escape justice. But such reforms would likely require a revision of the Constitution, which would be very difficult to pull off given the nation\u2019s fractious politics.But frustration with the chaebol has been building for years. Critics blame the conglomerates for a number of social ills, including corruption, inequality and the crowding out of smaller and potentially more innovative businesses. Shares in the chaebol trade at lower prices than they otherwise would \u2014 the so-called Korea discount \u2014 because outside investors fear founding families will shortchange them.Family shenanigans have not helped perceptions.They face other challenges \u2014 in particular, taxes. Perhaps surprisingly in a country where dynasties have persisted, inheritance taxes in South Korea are high \u2014 for the wealthy, 50 percent or more.That is where the power-preservation playbook comes in.One solution has been to transfer stakes in chaebol companies to family-controlled charities. Four foundations controlled by the Lee family hold billions of dollars worth of shares in key Samsung subsidiaries, including the smartphone maker.Another option is to ensure that chaebol heirs get rich before their parents die. That can be accomplished by setting up small companies under an heir\u2019s control, then making them bigger using the family\u2019s business connections.Critics say that is what happened at Hyundai Motor, where Chung Eui-sun, the son of the carmaker\u2019s chairman, invested in a small logistics company in 2001. The company, now called Hyundai Glovis, quickly secured lucrative contracts with Hyundai affiliates. Within a few years Hyundai Glovis and Mr. Chung were worth billions. A Hyundai spokeswoman declined to comment on the arrangement.Mr. Lee of Samsung, who is technically vice chairman but leads the conglomerate on behalf of his ill father, also benefited from maneuvers designed to preserve family power. Starting in 1996, when Mr. Lee was just 28, Samsung companies began issuing him cut-price bonds that he was later able to convert into stock, allowing him to accumulate valuable ownership stakes at a fraction of the market cost. Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, was ultimately convicted of breach of trust in connection with the deals \u2014 though he was later pardoned, and the younger Mr. Lee was allowed to keep his shares.Another maneuver is at the heart of the charges against him. The merger of two Samsung companies in 2015 made Mr. Lee the dominant shareholder in a crucial part of the Samsung empire. Mr. Lee earlier this year was accused of bribing President Park and others to push another major shareholder, the government\u2019s pension system, to approve the deal. Mr. Lee denies the charges and says he was a victim of extortion.\u201cSouth Korea has to promote the role of the institutional investor,\u201d said Professor Rhyu of Yonsei University, adding that the pension service lacked a culture of independence. \u201cThe problem is corporate governance.\u201dIn the National Assembly, political parties have sponsored several bills that would make chaebol corporate governance more transparent and make it harder for their chairmen to help enrich their children through dubious business transactions. One idea pushed by Mr. Moon is to introduce so-called cumulative voting to make it easier for candidates supported by minority shareholders to get a board seat.But any campaign to overhaul the chaebol would be vulnerable to overall economics. If the economy slows, politicians may fear that constraining the chaebol would hurt business activity.\u201cThere are people who recognize the problem, but also a lot who don\u2019t,\u201d said Professor Kim of Korea University Business School. \u201cThere are plenty of people who think, yes, there has to be an owner family involved.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the size of the Samsung Foundation of Culture\u2019s stake in Samsung Electronics. The foundation\u2019s stake is 0.03 percent, not close to 8 percent.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo, and Jeyup S. Kwaak and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}

Both offered similarly reckless policies: Exit the European Union and NATO. Adopt economic protectionism. Get cozy with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.Ms. Le Pen \u2014 a political goddaughter, if ever there was one, to Donald Trump \u2014 remains in the running for president. But instead of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, on Sunday she must face Emmanuel Macron, a young pro-Europe centrist who is given a good chance to defeat her.He\u2019s not elected yet, but his first-place showing two weeks ago clarified the choices in France\u2019s severe crisis of identity. About half of those who voted chose Ms. Le Pen, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon or some other extreme populist. Is the strength of demagogy just another example of the populist winds blowing throughout the West? Or is France uniquely cursed \u2014 the sick man of Europe?The story behind the answer begins in 1940: France never got over its collapse after Nazi Germany\u2019s blitzkrieg and the collaboration that ensued. To be sure, Charles de Gaulle and the Resistance formed a heroic minority around which could be woven a comforting myth of greatness. In 1945, that was enough for France to be counted as one of the war\u2019s winners. It also allowed France to repress the humiliation of surrender and, after the war, to embark on ill-timed military exploits to restore its self-confidence as a global power. In Indochina and Algeria, it defended its empire, and with Britain at Suez it sought to maintain its Middle Eastern influence. But those efforts failed. By 1962, France had lost most of its overseas possessions \u2014 most notably Algeria, since 1830 the jewel in France\u2019s crown.The Algerian debacle was also repressed \u2014 again by de Gaulle. He spun a new myth of France\u2019s global importance and prepared France\u2019s economy for modernization. He and his successors gave the French atomic bombs, supermarkets, Ariane rockets and high-speed trains. Through the Cold War, they promised new frontiers for influence in Western Europe that could make up for the painful loss of empire and the trauma of 1940 \u2014 in short, a Gallocentric Europe.German reunification put an end to such illusions. With the European Union incorporating Central European countries, Germany again became the continent\u2019s epicenter. And because Germany focused on making its economy more efficient, it distanced itself from its neighbor, ensuring that Europe would never be a Grande France. Indeed, the 1990s and 2000s brought Europe a new paradigm driven increasingly by Anglo-American ideals: the market society, multicultural and neo-liberal.Here the French held their ground, clinging to their own vision of a secular, centralized welfare state. No longer the center of the world, France now swam against the current of history. An aging diva whose charms had long masked her narcissism no longer embodied modernity.And so, today\u2019s conundrum: What does it mean to be French? What is France\u2019s calling in a globalized world? No one, least of all the political elite, has had an answer. As the French mourn their past (or imagined) grandeur, the resentful among them have turned their backs on Europe and shut themselves off from the world.This identity crisis conceals yet another, now erupting to sow fear and rare violence. The place of Islam in France, a fallout from the Algerian era, has became a national neurosis. From 1954 to 1962, France waged a terrible colonial war: eight years long, fought by more than two million draftees, leaving 300,000 to 400,000 dead on the Algerian side and 25,000 soldiers and 3,000 civilians among the French.The repercussions in France have been unique: A million \u201cpieds noirs\u201d returned to French cities and their European origins when hostilities ended. Hundreds of thousands of Algerians and other North Africans joined them to work in France\u2019s thriving factories. But unemployment skyrocketed during the 1970s oil crisis, just as their families gained permission to follow the workmen; this completed the reunion of all the participants in the Algerian tragedy but with little or no inclination to reconcile.Instead, memories and guilty consciences too long in the shadows re-emerged to plague all sides. Old prejudices and stereotypes \u2014 Arab, colonist, white man, noble savage \u2014 clashed. Jean-Marie Le Pen, a former paratrooper in Algeria and the father of Marine, founded the xenophobic National Front. Identity conflict arose among many of the grandchildren of 1960s and \u201970s immigrants, driving some to political Islamism.Today, most French people see their Islamist compatriots as separatists. The jihadists who attacked in 2015 and 2016 were not foreign; they were French citizens killing other French citizens.In the face of all this, France needed brave, visionary leaders; it got, as its last two presidents, Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2014 mediocre politicians who flaunted big words without risking ambitious reform. Mr. Sarkozy spoke of change \u2014 a shift to neo-liberalism and a reinforcement of law and order; instead, he kept the socialist 35-hour workweek and cut 10,000 employees from the police force. Mr. Hollande swore to wage \u201cwar on finance gone wild,\u201d but taxed the middle class instead.Thus, France let a decade go to waste. Unemployment and debt remain high; competitiveness and purchasing power decline. In the right-wing primaries for this election, Mr. Sarkozy was eliminated in the first round. On the left, Mr. Hollande didn\u2019t dare run.On the right, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon set out to be the white knight. A former prime minister, he made speeches with Churchillian overtones, asking sacrifices to save the land. A Catholic father of five, he vowed to be a model president. He is now suspected of embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds to pay his wife for a no-show parliamentary job. For a generation or more, the motto of the French political class might have been, \u201cI serve the state so I can use the state to my own convenience.\u201dSo, on April 23, the French decided to wipe out Mr. Fillon and his Socialist rival, Beno\u00eet Hamon, the candidates of the two parties that had dominated French political life for nearly 60 years.The death of that system on April 23 left the runoff this weekend a referendum on Ms. Le Pen. Perhaps it is fortunate that her National Front is strongly nationalist and xenophobic, with a fascist past that recalls the shame of Vichy France. That may spare the French another 1940 \u2014 one more debacle.But even if it does, Mr. Macron would inherit a fractured, ungovernable France, recalling Germany\u2019s Weimar Republic. Its red and brown extremes would keep spinning their webs, refuse to help him, and wait for the Republic\u2019s final collapse. For that reason, Mr. Macron would have to quickly and decisively build a new, myth-free vision of France and its identity in Europe, working on the home front and with whoever is Germany\u2019s chancellor, as he promised to do during his campaign.That kind of cleareyed partnership could finally offer a new horizon to the bewildered French. There\u2019s still time to resolve their conundrum \u2014 by guaranteeing France a central role in a European counter-model to Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Turkey and Mr. Trump\u2019s America.Olivier Guez, a French essayist and a scriptwriter for the film \u201cThe People vs. Fritz Bauer,\u201d is the author of a forthcoming novel about Josef Mengele.

{"Headline": "2017 Could Prove to Be a Turning Point for Plug-In Hybrids", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byWheelsUntil recently, if you wanted to ditch your gas guzzler and go electric, there were few choices. You could take the high road and opt for a $70,000 luxury vehicle, like the Tesla Model S, or take the low road and choose a more modest commuter, like the $31,000 Nissan Leaf.But this year, all that appears to be changing.More and more, plug-in hybrid models will go head-to-head with different versions of the same car. The current Kia Niro, for example, a hybrid that relies on a gas engine and braking to recharge its battery, will compete later this year with a plug-in hybrid sibling, with similar features and amenities including luggage space \u2014 and with a price to match, around $23,000.\u201cWe want to be price-neutral for the consumer,\u201d said Steve Kosowski, long-range strategy manager for Kia Motors America. \u201cWhen you walk into the showroom, it should be, why wouldn\u2019t you buy this one?\u201dSome of the pricing parity relates to economies of scale.\u201cBattery prices have decreased by 70 percent over the last six years,\u201d said Simon Mui, a director at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.\u201cThe strategy is to make the latest S-550e plug-in the same price as the V8 counterpart,\u201d said Paul La Penta, a supervisor in electromobility at Mercedes-Benz.\u201cThe biggest benefit of these cars is the torque,\u201d said Frank Wiesmann, a spokesman for Porsche, referring to the superiority of electric motors in delivering an initial boost from a standing start. \u201cWith electric help, it\u2019s faster to 60 m.p.h. and delivers a higher top speed.\u201dAfter voicing support for the federal standards, the biggest car companies have recently appealed to President Trump to loosen the fuel economy targets.\u201cThere\u2019s a Jekyll-and-Hyde component to automakers,\u201d Mr. Mui said. \u201cEngineers say, yes. Lobbyists say, no, don\u2019t make us do this. They are conflicted.\u201dBut like a supertanker under full power, the electrification ship may be too hard to turn around. In interviews with car company representatives, the most often repeated responses to questions regarding the easing of current regulations were: \u201cWe like to plan long term\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re a global company.\u201dIt takes several years to design and build a new car, and many electric vehicles are already in development. General Motors representatives stressed that the automotive industry was a long-term, capital-intensive business. Kia said it was already investing $10.2 billion over five years on vehicles ranging from plug-in hybrids to those running on fuel cells.Other car markets, such as China, are offering their own incentives to encourage electrics and plug-in hybrids, regardless of what happens in the United States.\u201cWe want to demonstrate several different powertrains in the same market,\u201d said Steve Center of Honda\u2019s environmental business development office. Such models often offer plug-in and pure electric versions, as well as hydrogen fuel-cell options. These are no longer combustion engine models simply retrofitted with electric motors, nor are they impractical experimental vehicles.\u201cNow, we\u2019re developing the plug-in version right from the beginning,\u201d Mr. La Penta of Mercedes said.Indeed, automakers across the board are hoping that plug-in hybrids prove to be the gateway to fully electric vehicles. While the electric-only range of plug-in vehicles can be modest at best \u2014 Mercedes\u2019s S-Class plug-in hybrid can go only 13 miles solely under electric power \u2014 it is improving. When the Chevy Volt was introduced in late 2010, it could travel only 35 miles before having to rely on gas. This year\u2019s model can go 53 miles without having to switch over.As drivers become more comfortable with these cars, the thinking goes, the anxiety over having to recharge electric vehicles\u2019 batteries every day will lessen.Electric-only vehicles are also improving their range. The electric version of the Kia Soul has a 93-mile range while the Chevy Bolt has a 238-mile range.According to G.M., a 40-mile range should meet the needs of about 80 percent of American drivers. But the psychological barrier still exists. Fred Ligouri, a Chevrolet spokesman, said that 200 miles on a single charge seemed to satisfy most consumers. Hence, cars like the Tesla Model S and Chevy Bolt are seen as breaking the range-anxiety barrier.When analysts look back, 2017 may turn out to be the tipping point in popularizing plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles. Companies are promising more to come. Porsche says it plans to introduce an electric sports car that can go 300 miles on a single charge by the end of the decade. And Tesla is expected to announce plans for the first production all-electric truck this fall.When Chevrolet introduced the plug-in Volt more than seven years ago, it received considerable press criticism for failing to meet high expectations. The question is, with so many companies now following in its footsteps, does it feel vindicated?\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on being first,\u201d Mr. Ligouri said. \u201cBut we showed there\u2019s customer demand for this.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Republican Primary Conundrum: How Far to Run From Christie", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported by\u201cPeople would say to me you\u2019re being critical and I would say I\u2019m only being honest,\u201d Mr. Ciattarelli said of his campaign\u2019s language in an interview before an event here. \u201cI\u2019m a citizen first, and when I think an administration or a governor or a president has gotten it wrong, I think it\u2019s important to speak up.\u201dWith less than 40 days to go before the Republican primary for governor, the two Republican candidates vying to replace Mr. Christie are gauging how best to navigate their relationship with a member of their own party who has close ties to the president but is also among the least popular governors in state history.Ms. Guadagno is leading in early polling \u2014 a new poll from Quinnipiac University released on Wednesday showed the lieutenant governor at 23 percent among likely Republican voters, compared with 12 percent among the same group for Mr. Ciattarelli in the Republican primary. And on Wednesday she picked up the endorsement of the comedian Joe Piscopo, who had been publicly flirting with a run for governor, but decided against it and instead endorsed Ms. Guadagno.Ms. Guadagno has the more delicate dance: As the second-in-command in the administration, she owns some of the record. And while she is trying to separate herself from the governor on certain issues, she also needs the support of Republican voters who have remained loyal to the governor.She has had a relatively chilly relationship with the governor during his tenure that has only worsened on the campaign trail. In her stump speech, Ms. Guadagno has adopted a bit of a \u201chear no evil, speak no evil\u201d style; she rarely, if ever, invokes the governor\u2019s name. Not when she boasts about the state\u2019s economy, and not when she laments the many problems facing New Jersey, including an underfunded pension system and public transportation woes.Instead, she dishes out coy insults, like discussing Mr. Christie\u2019s plans to renovate the State House in Trenton by invoking the term \u201cPalace of Versailles,\u201d and noting that she doesn\u2019t travel around the state by helicopter.Then there are the direct, public breaks from the governor, such as over a gas tax increase \u2014 which Mr. Christie ultimately supported after opposing it \u2014 or Mr. Christie\u2019s plan to have Horizon, a private insurer, pay for the state\u2019s drug treatment program.But even on these issues, Ms. Guadagno goes to great lengths to avoid saying Mr. Christie\u2019s name.Mr. Ciattarelli has more freedom, having been a bit of a thorn in the governor\u2019s side for years, and he has been upfront about criticizing the governor as he tries to eat into Ms. Guadagno\u2019s lead.He gave the governor a \u201cD\u201d in an interview with The Star-Ledger and has frequently criticized him as someone who has put his own ambitions above the state\u2019s needs.\u201cEight years of the Christie-Guadagno administration has gone by, and we still have a property tax crisis, school funding crisis, tax code crisis, affordable housing crisis,\u201d Mr. Ciattarelli told a crowd gathered here Monday for a town-hall meeting that included his signature PowerPoint presentation.Voters who came out to see Mr. Ciattarelli had similar sentiments.\u201cGiven the popularity and public consumption of these policies, I would have to say a change would be in order,\u201d said Jim Schanz, 59, a communications researcher from Hamilton who drove two hours to see Mr. Ciattarelli. But he cautioned that criticizing the governor and changing direction needed to be done within the framework of Republican politics. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a change to the opposite extreme.\u201dMr. Christie, for his part, has been responding, even before a lot of stones had been cast. During a February speech to the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Mr. Christie said that Democrats and Republicans were promoting alternative versions of the truth.\u201cEither they\u2019re lying or they\u2019re going to increase taxes so much that people are not going to be able to live here anymore,\u201d Mr. Christie told reporters, referring to promises being made on the campaign trail.When asked if he was speaking about both the Republican and Democratic candidates, Mr. Christie smiled.\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve said there\u2019s examples on both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cA little more stark on the Democratic side, but yeah, on both sides.\u201dAttacking the governor may prove necessary for both Ms. Guadagno and Mr. Ciattarelli, who will face an uphill battle in the fall against a Democratic nominee in an increasingly blue state.\u201cI think that most Republicans are savvy enough to realize that if a Republican is going to have even the slightest bit of a fighting chance against the Democratic nominee,\u201d said Brigid Callahan Harrison, a political-science professor at Montclair State University, \u201cthey\u2019re going to need to run away from Christie.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New and Noteworthy Books on Military History, from Afghanistan to Waterloo", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byWar StoriesTwo very good and very different new books reflect the extraordinary range of military history being written these days.Nolan\u2019s primary argument is that focusing military history on battles is the wrong way to understand wars because what wins conflicts is almost always attrition, not battle. Generally, one side, usually the one with a smaller economy and population, becomes exhausted, and gives up. Talk about \u00e9lan and audacity all you like, he counsels, but what wins wars is demography and economic strength.In fact, he says, the ideal of a \u201cdecisive battle\u201d waged by great leaders should be seen as a pernicious myth that takes weaker, fascistic powers into wars against nations they know they cannot defeat in the long run. Two leading examples of this \u201cshort war\u201d delusion are, of course, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Hence Germany\u2019s blitzkrieg campaigns early in World War II and Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.Inside this very good fat book is an excellent thin book trying to get out. That\u2019s more a criticism of the Oxford University Press than of the author, because what this book needed was an editor with a strong hand. At 670 pages, it is just too damn long. It contains sections that wax encyclopedic without any evident connection to the book\u2019s core themes. For example, we are subjected to seemingly everything Nolan knows about the Crimean War, like the fact that the efforts of Florence Nightingale, the pioneer of modern nursing, were at first rebuffed by some British officers. We get a deep dive into the Franco-Prussian War, but oddly almost nothing on the American Civil War that preceded it. Asia goes unmentioned before the 20th century. The chapter titles are opaque, more like symbolic poetry than guideposts for the book.On the other hand, a book has to be really thought-provoking to have so many problems and still be so fascinating. I cannot remember reading anything in the last few years that has made me reconsider so many basic questions \u2014 What wins wars? What is the most illuminating way to relate military history? Most important, is our own military too focused on battles and insufficiently attentive to what is required to win wars? In other words, are our generals flailing because they try to substitute battlefield skill for strategic understanding? (I think they are.)Ultimately, Nolan is persuasive that too much attention has been paid to battles. Even for that great genius of warfare, Napoleon, he argues \u2014 credibly \u2014 that the slow bleed of guerrilla war in Spain did much more than any battle to bring about his defeat. By the time of Waterloo, he insists, France was a spent force. And if Napoleon hadn\u2019t been finished off there, he would have been at his next battle, or the one after that. So much for perhaps the most famously decisive battle in history.In the summer of 1877 it became clear that Joseph\u2019s peaceable dream of coexistence was not possible. Deciding they would have no more to do with the whites, the Nez Perc\u00e9 set off on a trek from their homeland, which lay in the area where Oregon, Idaho and Washington meet. They eventually turned north, crossing at one point through the Yellowstone National Park, which had been established five years earlier. Howard\u2019s soldiers, pursuing the tribe, enjoyed that park, Sharfstein notes, catching trout in the mountain rivers and poaching them in its geysers.The tribe\u2019s thousand-mile retreat ended not far from the Canadian border, where it was finally surrounded by Army forces. Joseph famously stated there, \u201cFrom where the sun now stands I will fight no more.\u201d Less well known is the speech he gave in Washington, D.C., a few years later: \u201cIf the white man wants to live in peace with the Indian, he can live in peace. There need be no trouble. Treat all men alike. Give them all the same law. Give them all an even chance to live and grow. \u2026 Let me be a free man \u2026 and I will obey every law, or submit to the penalty.\u201dThe book occasionally falters. The author, A. Roger Ekirch, a historian at Virginia Tech, seems to have a better feel for American political history than for command at sea. For example, a deep sea generally is an advantage for a ship, not a hazard. Similarly, marine officers were more likely to be resented aboard a ship than others, because the marines were effectively naval police, enforcing shipboard discipline. And the second half of the book occasionally bogs down in multiple quotations from newspapers of the time. Still, the level of detail, including verbatim testimony from subsequent courts-martial, is impressive.Yet all this has been well told before. The mystery is why it has to be told once more, especially in a volume of almost 900 pages. This is not an argument that historians should stop writing about the Civil War. But when they do, they should offer new information or a fresh perspective. I found neither here.The other contributors to the volume \u2014 almost all military veterans of the Afghan war \u2014 generally agree that the American people are culturally unable to win wars like this one. \u201cPrudence was blinded by unexamined political and cultural assumptions, and the result was a massive and avoidable waste of time, lives and resources,\u201d Aaron MacLean concludes; he led a Marine infantry platoon there and also holds a master\u2019s degree from Oxford in medieval Arabic studies.MacLean tellingly observes that the Americans were not trying to bring governance to a place that had none, but rather were trying to replace an existing unwritten constitution they didn\u2019t understand and indeed barely perceived. \u201cIt consisted of traditional ethnic, tribal, state and religious patterns, all of which had been partially transformed by modernization and traumatically stressed by decades of war and the rise of Islamic radicalism,\u201d he writes. Surprisingly, no good overview of our Afghan war has been published yet. Until that happens, this enlightening volume is probably the best introduction to what went wrong there, and why.Do we really need another history of the Peloponnesian War? That was the question in my mind when I opened this book. When I finished it, I thought, yes, we seem to. Military historians often neglect developments in the arts, for instance, but Roberts weaves in Greek culture, showing how works by dramatists and philosophers reflected events in the war. Aristophanes\u2019 \u201cLysistrata,\u201d about women going on a sex strike to bring peace, was produced in 411 B.C., in the wake of the Athenian disaster in Sicily. She portrays the death of Socrates 12 years later as one more evil consequence of the war, with the great philosopher scapegoated \u201cfor the ills of a city that had suffered war, economic collapse, demographic devastation and civil strife.\u201d\u201cReporting War\u201d makes for melancholy reading. Among the most famous of American war correspondents was Ernie Pyle. Another journalist covering the fighting, The New Yorker\u2019s A. J. Liebling, astutely observed that part of Pyle\u2019s success came from his treating the war not as an adventure or crusade but rather as \u201can unalleviated misfortune.\u201d After the liberation of Paris, Pyle himself wrote, \u201cFor me war has become a flat, black depression without highlights, a revulsion of the mind and an exhaustion of the spirit.\u201dPyle died during the landings on Okinawa in April 1945. Such ends were not unusual; Moseley cites one estimate that correspondents suffered a higher casualty rate during the war than combat troops did. After the war, some of those who survived went on to fame, like Walter Cronkite and Eric Sevareid. But many others expired prematurely of alcoholism, depression, midlife heart attacks and car accidents.One of the lessons of all these books is that wars always look worse closer up. Indeed, one of the tests of the veracity of a history of a conflict is whether it is depressing. If it is not, something may be wrong.Thomas E. Ricks is the author, most recently, of \u201cChurchill and Orwell: The Fight for Freedom.\u201d His column appears twice a year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Students Get \u2018Grades 13 and 14\u2019 Free of Charge?", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyFree college is a lovely, sensible notion \u2014 but countries seem capable of embracing it only when enough of their top earners pay 50 percent or more of their income in taxes. In the United States, New York is the sole state to have taken the step of offering to cover tuition at all its public colleges and universities. And even this new benefit, the Excelsior Scholarship, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law last month, helps only a small fraction of the state\u2019s residents \u2014 households earning less than $125,000 that are not already covered by financial aid \u2014 and their grants convert into loans unless graduates both live and work in the state for as many years as they benefited from the program. It also does not cover living costs.Sara Goldrick-Rab, a self-described \u201cscholar-activist\u201d who teaches higher education policy at Temple University, has a more expansive idea: Make the first two years free for everyone who attends a community college (all of which are public) or four-year state school. Directing more resources to the first two years of college would help people from lower-income families overcome the biggest barrier to their success, which is the living costs associated with housing, food, transportation and books while they attend school.\u201cWhen students are able to focus on college, and not work, they graduate,\u201d Goldrick-Rab told me recently. The federal government currently gives tens of billions of dollars in grants and subsidies each year to private colleges and for-profit trade schools in the United States, despite the fact that public colleges educate three-quarters of the students pursuing a postsecondary degree. \u201cI say let the privates and for-profits fend for themselves,\u201d Goldrick-Rab says, and put that money instead toward what she sometimes calls Grades 13 and 14.Finishing high school might once have provided enough education to find employment that pays well. But globalization and automation are decimating those jobs. Even manufacturing work that remains in (or returns) to America requires knowing how to operate the computers that run today\u2019s factory floors, at least if you expect to earn anything close to a living wage. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do almost any job now without a 13th or 14th year of schooling,\u201d Goldrick-Rab says. The establishment of universal high school in the early 20th century helped the United States economy surge past those of countries in Europe and elsewhere that lacked a similar educational standard. Making 14th grade the new 12th grade might be essential if the United States is to maintain its status as an economic powerhouse.In 2015, someone in the United States who had no more than a high-school diploma earned about $35,600 on average. By comparison, an associate degree from a two-year college translated into $44,000. A graduate from a four-year college averaged just under $65,500. Is it any wonder that the children of the working poor take on frightening amounts of debt in pursuit of post-secondary-school degrees?Low-income students used to be able to go to college for close to free. In the early 1970s, the federal Pell grant \u2014 created to help those of modest means continue their education beyond high school \u2014 covered more than the entire cost of community college and about 90 percent of what it took to attend a four-year state school, including room, board and books. Nowadays, a full Pell grant, worth $5,815 this academic year, pays for less than one-third of the annual cost of a four-year public institution. Even after grants and scholarships, the typical family making less than $30,000 needs to pay 77 percent of its income to cover the costs of a four-year public college, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit advocacy group.Goldrick-Rab, a sociologist by training, started thinking about fixes for the price of higher education around 2008, when she started following 3,000 Pell recipients who entered a community college or publicly financed four-year program in Wisconsin. Six years into her project, only half of them had completed their studies. The subjects whom Goldrick-Rab featured in her book \u201cPaying the Price\u201d last year worked so many hours just to cover their bills that most of them never had a chance. \u201cCommunity college is where the working class gets stuck,\u201d Goldrick-Rab says. \u201cIt\u2019s where the lower middle class gets stuck.\u201dBarack Obama understood the importance of community colleges, which teach one-quarter of the country\u2019s undergraduates, when he floated the idea in 2015 of making them free. So did the Republican governor of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, when he signed a bill in 2014 that made community college tuition-free for recent high school graduates. (This month, the Legislature approved his plan to expand the benefit to those 24 and older.) If nothing else, the Great Recession underscored the importance of all those job-specific associate degrees and certificates \u2014 typically granted for programs that can be completed in less than two years \u2014 offered by community colleges. An astonishing 99 percent of the jobs created during the recovery, according to a 2016 report by Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce, \u201chave gone to workers with at least some college education.\u201d Anthony P. Carnevale, the center\u2019s director, says as an example that available jobs in the health care support field have meant that those studying to be an occupational therapy assistant or radiology technician often earn more on average than those with a bachelor\u2019s degree. The same holds true, he adds, for a recent graduate who earned a certificate in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. \u201cWe found 30 million jobs in the economy that begin at $35,000 a year and offer a career pathway but don\u2019t require a B.A.,\u201d Carnevale says.Goldrick-Rab first laid out her free-college idea in a 2014 paper she wrote with Nancy Kendall, who teaches education policy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIf you complete a high-school degree,\u201d the authors proposed, \u201cyou can obtain a 13th and 14th year of education for free in exchange for a modest amount of work while attending school.\u201d They identified large pools of federal dollars allocated to higher education that could be tapped to pay for their plan. This money includes the $5 billion in Pell grants that ended up in the coffers of for-profit colleges during the 2015-16 academic year and another $5 billion that went to private colleges and universities, which Goldrick-Rab argues can use their endowments and other scholarship funds to offset lost federal dollars.Under Goldrick-Rab and Kendall\u2019s plan, municipalities and states are responsible for covering living expenses \u201cequivalent to 15 hours of work a week paid at the living wage in the region\u201d \u2014 more than $10,000 a year in places like New York with a high cost of living. That\u2019s probably a pie-in-the-sky prescription, but Goldrick-Rab points to the possibility of public-private partnerships. The National School Lunch Program already helps feed kids through the 12th grade. Why not expand it to cover students in their first two years of college? Goldrick-Rab and Kendall also call for a significant scaling up of the Federal Work-Study program to help students cover their expenses.One reason is that treating the first two years of college as an extension of high school would probably generate wider support than a plan meant only for the needy. Offering a benefit to everyone proved to be crucial a few years ago when New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, sold the notion of universal prekindergarten, or \u201cPre-K for All,\u201d on the basis of its availability to rich and poor alike. Bipartisan support for two free years of college might be more likely if presented as a universal benefit \u2014 and one critical to the country\u2019s economic competitiveness, internationally speaking.Two years of free college is not a panacea. Not everyone is cut out for it, and the barriers to success often go beyond the time needed to study. Yet making the 13th and 14th years of schooling more accessible, as Goldrick-Rab and Kendall propose, would give more people hope, at least, in an economy that now pretty much requires skills well beyond the ones taught in high school.Gary Rivlin is a former Times reporter and an Investigative Fund fellow at the Nation Institute.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Tax Plan Will Not Bolster Growth, Economists Say", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump says the perfect medicine for the economy\u2019s sluggish growth is a big tax cut.Mr. Trump and his advisers say that leaving more money in the hands of businesses and consumers will lead to more spending and investment, lifting economic growth, which has been stuck in a 2-percent-a-year rut.Indeed, the Trump administration insists its tax plan will be so good for growth that the federal government won\u2019t even lose any revenue. The government will simply get a smaller share of a much larger pie.But a range of economists, both conservative and liberal, are highly skeptical that a tax cut is the cure for what ails the economy. They say Mr. Trump has little opportunity to increase economic growth in the next few years because the economy is already growing about as fast as it can. The government\u2019s focus, they say, should be on raising the economy\u2019s speed limit, for example, by encouraging investments that increase productivity.Indeed, by some estimates, Mr. Trump\u2019s plan could reduce economic growth \u2014 although such estimates necessarily involve a large dollop of guesswork because the administration has provided few details.\u201cI don\u2019t think any of this should be thought of as increasing short-term growth,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and former director of the Congressional Budget Office who now runs the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. He said he remained hopeful, however, that congressional Republicans would push for a different set of changes that could improve the nation\u2019s long-term economic prospects.But the benefits are likely to be limited, in part because the nation\u2019s economic circumstances are different now than in the early 1980s or the early 2000s. The recession that began in 2007 was long and deep, but it has been followed by one of the longest periods of uninterrupted growth in American history.When the economy is struggling, cutting taxes can increase spending by leaving consumers and businesses with more money to spend. That increased demand is valuable when unemployment is high; it puts people back to work.But during periods of low unemployment, tax cuts can actually be damaging to the economy. If companies find it difficult to respond to the additional demand for goods and services by hiring workers and increasing output, the result is likely to be higher prices rather than faster economic growth.The unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in April, a low level that most economists regard as the normal churn of people moving among jobs. Some economists argue that stronger growth could persuade more people to start looking for work. But that debate is academic because the Federal Reserve is in the first camp. Fed officials have said that if fiscal policy makers step on the gas by cutting taxes, the Fed is likely to step on the brakes by raising interest rates more quickly.\u201cI think well-designed tax reform could add to economic growth\u201d in the long term, said Jason Furman, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who served as chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cBut poorly designed, deficit-increasing tax reforms are as likely to reduce growth as they are to add to growth.\u201dEconomists see little short-term benefit in a tax cut, but they think the government could strengthen long-term growth by focusing on the right problem: productivity.The speed limit on economic growth depends how much more every American worker produces. The Fed estimates the economy can expand at a sustainable pace of around 1.8 percent a year \u2014 close to the actual pace since 2010.\u201cIt means that right up front the business is seeing a payoff in sticking money into something that will make it bigger and more productive in the future,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.Even the rosiest estimates of the potential benefits of such changes fall well short of creating the economic growth necessary to offset the cost of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan.Mr. Furman said he thought he could write a tax code that would increase annual economic growth by about 0.3 percent. Over a decade, that\u2019s enough to add about $1,500 to the average family\u2019s income.Others are slightly more optimistic. The Tax Foundation thinks 0.4 percent is a reasonable estimate of the best case. Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that he regarded 0.5 percent as an upper bound on the potential benefits.But that is still only about half the growth required by Mr. Trump\u2019s plan. And that is as good as it gets. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone remotely sane or credible that would put a number higher than that,\u201d Mr. Furman said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "OPEC, Fighting Market Forces, Extends Production Cuts", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byThe earlier announcement helped lift prices from a low of $46. But on Thursday, prices slipped nearly 4 percent, to around $53.The markets followed a similar path in September, when OPEC, with Russia and other nations, initially outlined plans for reductions. When the euphoria faded, prices slumped.\u201cOPEC is being caught in a pincer movement of technology and policy that will, over time, erode oil use,\u201d said Bill Farren-Price, chief executive of Petroleum Policy Intelligence, an advisory firm for hedge funds and other investors. \u201cThis meeting is more about forestalling an oil price collapse than driving prices higher.\u201dHere are some factors muting the impact of the cuts to output.Oil prices that topped $100 a barrel as recently as 2014 may have helped plant the seeds that are now weakening OPEC.But fracking has required substantial investment. When oil prices plummeted in 2015 and 2016, output from shale in the United States fell about 900,000 barrels a day, equivalent to almost 1 percent of the global supply.The American shale industry today, however, is far more efficient. And unlike in previous years, it has an array of sources of capital to finance the drilling of new wells, including advance sales of oil, bank and private loans, and high-yield bonds.When prices are down, that money dries up. But when prices tick up around $52 a barrel, activity ramps up quickly, according to Roger Diwan, a vice president at IHS Financial Services, which advises investors.Khalid A. al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said on Thursday that he foresaw a healthy comeback for American shale production, but he played down its effect on OPEC\u2019s efforts.Still, the bloc\u2019s biggest worry is such a revival, presenting it with a thorny problem as it considers its own market moves.\u201cThe higher the price goes, the more shale operators accelerate production, and the more OPEC has to cut,\u201d said Mr. Diwan, who forecast that United States shale operators would increase their output by about 900,000 barrels a day this year, soaking up much of OPEC\u2019s production cuts.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.A few years ago, high energy prices were sustained by a belief that the supply of oil was reaching a peak, but demand \u2014 driven by fast-growing economies like China and India \u2014 would keep rising.The trends are shifting, and fast. Not only does there seem to be a major new source of oil from shale, but growth in demand is slowing.In particular, the increasing number of electric vehicles is playing a role in limiting demand for oil. Their impact may grow with the development of cars run by computers.Mr. Helm, the author of a new book, \u201cBurn Out,\u201d on the decline of fossil fuels, argues that, given oil\u2019s uncertain future, $50 a barrel could turn out to be a \u201cvery high\u201d price.Even some big oil companies are accepting the view that demand for fossil fuels may soon decline.OPEC seems finally to be paying attention, too. Mr. Falih said on Thursday that the bloc needed to better understand the impact the 2015 Paris deal on climate change would have on oil demand.In decades past, an OPEC decision to curb or increase production had wide consequences and would move markets.That is no longer the case.\u201cOPEC has used Band-Aids to get through crises of the moment,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the research firm IHS Energy. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear they are willing or able to address the larger issues of the global market.\u201dWith that in mind, Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, brought in Russia and other producers outside the cartel to lend clout to the recent production cuts. Riyadh has also suggested changes to OPEC\u2019s internal management, pushing the organization to better cooperate with other producers. OPEC, Mr. Falih said, \u201cneeds to evolve\u201d and needs to \u201cbe part of the debate, rather than simply reacting to what is going on.\u201dOn Thursday, the bloc announced that Equatorial Guinea, one of Africa\u2019s largest producers, had joined OPEC, becoming its 14th member.But presenting a united front with such a variety of players has proved complex.Disunity already has occurred within the bloc. Member countries like Iraq and Iran contend they are entitled to higher production because of years of revenue lost to conflict and sanctions, and will probably press for increases to their output allocations.A disconnect exists between the announced level of the cuts and the actual reductions.Knowing that cuts were on the horizon, OPEC members increased production before they were made, which meant they were starting from an artificially high base. Several members have also been selling from their stockpiles of crude, blunting the impact of the reductions.IHS Markit, for instance, estimates that OPEC countries trimmed output by 1.1 million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2017, but exports fell by only 900,000 barrels a day.Signs suggest that the oil glut is easing, but its persistence has undermined OPEC\u2019s ability to affect the markets.Advertisement"}

In those areas, he said, \u201cfewer young people have access to school, fewer have access to culture and fewer have access to employment.\u201dHe added, \u201cSuburban France and rural France have the right to succeed, to develop themselves and we have to permit them to more forward, we have to invest in them.\u201dMathieu Plane, an economist at the Observatoire Fran\u00e7ais des Conjonctures \u00c9conomiques, the economic research center for Sciences Po, a university in Paris, said that many of Mr. Macron\u2019s economic proposals are not vastly different from those put in place by the country\u2019s current and unpopular president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. But the policies have not yet prodded France out of its economic stagnation.One difference is that Mr. Hollande ran on a Socialist platform but as president introduced a short-term payroll tax credit plan to reduce rising labor costs, leaving many Socialists feeling betrayed. Mr. Macron has made clear that he supports a variety of stimulus measures that help businesses, wants to make the payroll tax credit permanent and would push labor reforms even further.He has endorsed a 50 billion euro (about $55 billion) stimulus plan to reduce unemployment \u2014 which includes investing in training programs for one million youths and offering bonuses to businesses that hire from the impoverished suburbs \u2014 as well as a host of other proposals that focus more on innovation and modernizing infrastructure.\u201cHe has a social-liberal program which is in the spirit of the five-year term we just had,\u201d Mr. Plane said of Mr. Macron.This raises the question of whether Mr. Macron\u2019s plans will in fact be enough for France: enough to stimulate jobs while easing the effects of globalization, which have sown such anger that about 40 percent of votes in the first round of the election went to populist candidates, both far right and far left.Rayanne Benyahia, 16, who is in the program for disadvantaged and troubled youths at the center and keeps up with politics through the internet, said he was skeptical about Mr. Macron\u2019s economic plans.\u201cI saw him on Snapchat and I saved it,\u201d said Mr. Benyahia, smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s like us.\u201dFor Mr. Benyahia, who lived in foster care for six years, a permanent job with a living wage seems almost a pipe dream. \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it,\u201d he said as he sat in the campus cafeteria, scrolling through videos on his cellphone.The vocational schools themselves are no silver bullet to the country\u2019s economic and social ills. It has proved difficult for the centers to keep up with the needs of increasingly high-tech employers, as well as to overcome stigmas in France attached to apprenticing in a trade.Trade and artisan training programs \u201chave a bad image because it is seen as what you do when you failed at school,\u201d said Leila Diri, the director of the school. \u201cSo already they have negative baggage,\u201d she said of the students.In part for that reason, the center has room for 3,000 students but just 1,500 are enrolled, Ms. Diri said.While the school is quite successful at guaranteeing that the students will get an apprenticeship \u2014 between 75 and 80 percent do \u2014 it often does not turn into a full-time job.Employers remain reluctant to add permanent staff members because of the cost of social security taxes, which can add as much as 50 percent to a salary.Murat Boz, 18, who came to France five years ago from Turkey with his parents and three siblings, is typical of the immigrant students at the center. He has embraced life in France and is studying to be an electrician.\u201cI came to the campus to get an apprentice contract because I want to find work quickly,\u201d he said in fluent French, which he mastered soon after moving here.But for now, \u201cAs an apprentice we often do the job of an employee and we are not even paid the minimum wage,\u201d he said.Even if the pay is low, students unable to find permanent work often come back to get a second diploma in a related field and a second apprenticeship, because it is all they can get.Mr. Macron is hoping to change that cycle by waiving the requirement that employers pay social taxes for new employees, which would significantly reduce the cost of hiring and, he hopes, spur job creation.He would like to make working hours more flexible and also offer companies financial incentives to hire people from poor neighborhoods.The center in Bobigny has already expanded its reach to include unemployed adults. Some have lost their jobs because their firms closed or restructured and others simply want a career change.In the pastry making course, about half the students are adult workers switching careers or retraining. The school has a graduate who got an apprenticeship at the presidential palace, the Elys\u00e9e, and another at Pierre Herm\u00e9, a renowned Parisian pastry chef.Mr. Toulmet, who had gotten to know Mr. Macron when the candidate was still economy minister, recalled the conversation that planted the seed for the pilot program at the center he now runs for at-risk youths.Mr. Macron asked him what could be done to help the teenagers and young people who lived in areas like his. Mr. Toulmet explained that the school needed a program for troubled young people who were even unprepared for vocational studies, but there was no money for it.That is when, he recalled, Mr. Macron told him about the European Union grant that was available to local governments \u2014 in this case, the prefecture of St. Denis. The pilot program now has 190 students and is almost at capacity, Mr. Toulmet said.Yet in those classes, the mood is sometimes dark among the students, ranging from 16 to 26 years old. Some are all but silent, others verge on rudeness, some look bored and distant.The students start the day with cross-fit or a similar exercise program to help them manage their restiveness and anger. Then, they have classes and each month spend a week trying out different vocational training programs.Rayn Charley, 16, who got kicked out of school, said none of the offerings interested him. Asked what he would like to do, he rubbed his thumb and forefinger together, saying with a grin, \u201cMoney, money, money.\u201dHis mother doesn\u2019t work, there\u2019s no father in the picture and he has three siblings, he said.\u201cPeople in my neighborhood, they sell drugs; there\u2019s lots of prostitution,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to live like movie stars. I\u2019m losing time here.\u201dMr. Toulmet said he is honest with the students, telling them that though they have multiple strikes against them, they can succeed. He tells them, too, that he understands discrimination \u2014 he is handicapped and uses a wheelchair.\u201cI tell them, \u2018It is going to be hard \u2014 your neighborhoods have a bad image, your names do not sound French and it is going to be harder to find an apprenticeship \u2014 but you can do it,\u2019\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iranian Voter\u2019s Plea: Stop Saying \u2018Death to America\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 As a college student studying mechanics, Hamidreza Faraji had expected after graduation to land a steady job with a fixed salary, a pension plan and the occasional bonus. He envisioned coming home at 6 p.m. to his family and vacationing at a resort on the Caspian Sea.But Mr. Faraji, 34, has long since given up on all that. These days, he said, the only people who lead such predictable lives are government employees. Their jobs are well paid and offer security, but are hard to get in part because older employees stay on well past retirement age, limiting opportunities for the next generation.So millions of Iranians, particularly younger ones, find themselves caught like Mr. Faraji in a vicious cycle of hidden poverty, an exhausting hustle to stay afloat, working multiple jobs and running moneymaking schemes just to keep up. The youth unemployment rate is 30 percent.\u201cSeeking opportunities, and trying to make the best of them,\u201d Mr. Faraji said when asked about how he supported himself and his wife. A baby is on the way \u2014 \u201cthat just happened\u201d \u2014 but they have no idea how they are going to pay for the additional costs with the money he makes as a small-time trader.To many in the outside world, Iran seems to be riding high, its coffers replenished with billions of dollars it received after reaching a nuclear agreement with foreign powers. International businesses have been swarming into the country, seemingly eager to clinch deals.The government is throwing its weight around regionally as well, lending political and military support to Shiite groups and governments in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen and extending its influence eastward into Afghanistan. In fiery speeches, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, boasts of Iran\u2019s far-reaching impact.The Trump administration has expressed deep concerns about Iran\u2019s expanding power, with the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, saying recently, \u201cEverywhere you look if there is trouble in the region, you find Iran.\u201dBut with a presidential election coming Friday, many middle-class Iranians see things in a different way. Disillusioned and cynical, they are frustrated by years of high unemployment, inflation that eats relentlessly into living standards and widespread corruption.And they are frustrated with a state widely regarded as ossified and out of touch, a mixture of a quasi-socialist economy dominated by the military and clergy, and elective institutions supervised by conservative clerical bodies that have the final say on legislation and candidates for political office.Veterans of the 1979 revolution, like Ayatollah Khamenei, are still in charge, reinforcing a rigid revolutionary ideology and doing their best to resist pressures for change. With no obvious younger generation of leaders, the country also faces a looming succession crisis.While foreign investors often are said to be intent on doing deals, it is unclear whether they will help start an economic boom. With few exceptions, they are signing memorandums of understanding, not actual contracts.Many are concerned that the Trump administration could penalize big international banks that choose to do business in Iran, if they are deemed to violate nonnuclear American sanctions still in force against the country.Only big banks can provide the large-scale financing needed for the major, job-creating infrastructure projects that Iran desperately needs.He accomplished the nuclear pact, but the economic benefits have been meager at best. Instead, Iranians, many of them college graduates, are working longer and harder just to make ends meet.For Mr. Faraji, that means selling honey and saffron to supermarkets and running a cosmetics shop. To survive in a brutally competitive marketplace, he has to keep an eye out for the police while he buys smuggled products, pays bribes, intimidates delinquent bill payers and devises schemes to dupe store owners into buying his products.He counts himself lucky, in some respects. He says he has avoided doing any smuggling himself, or resorting to other illegal activities like selling alcohol or organizing mixed weddings, where men and women dance with one another \u2014 all common in Iran\u2019s underground economy.Some afternoons his wife joins him at his shop. Otherwise, they would never see each other. \u201cI go to sleep at 1 a.m. and leave the house at 6 a.m.,\u201d Mr. Faraji said.Most of the time, he tries not to think about why his life has become such a struggle, he said. But in his heart he knows: \u201cEverything has ground to a halt. We\u2019re moving back, rather than forward.\u201dStill, he explained, he would be voting for Mr. Rouhani, saying he would choose \u201cthe least-bad candidate to prevent an even worse situation.\u201dMr. Faraji\u2019s workday begins around 6:30, when he feeds his two caged songbirds, settles behind his desk in a run-down house and starts working the phones, pressing for unpaid bills and checking with his field representatives.In the struggle to move the honey and saffron, Mr. Faraji has resorted to an age-old scheme, sending his team into supermarkets across the city asking for the brands he has amassed, hoping to build a market for them. The next day, he sends his employees out again, each to a different store, offering to sell the products they had asked for the day before.But as they gathered around Mr. Faraji\u2019s desk on a recent morning, it was clear that business was not going well.\u201cThe supermarkets aren\u2019t buying anything,\u201d said Hassan Seyedi, 29, who moved from the western city of Kermanshah to Tehran, the capital, a year ago in search of work.Across from him sat Mehdi Khanzadeh, 27. Mr. Khanzadeh was lucky, the others said, in that he worked two days a week for Iranian state television, a position he had secured through a family contact.\u201cI studied architecture, but there are no jobs,\u201d he said, adding that like many Iranians in their 20s and 30s, he still lives with his parents. He said he often fell short of the $750 a month he needed to scrape by, but \u201cat least I have some steady income.\u201dThe young men laid out how they saw the facts. Business was bad, and if the shopkeepers ordered anything, it was in small quantities and they refused to pay in advance.\u201cGive them a reasonable bribe, if necessary, so that they take our honey,\u201d Mr. Faraji advised. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about payment later.\u201dAlso in the room was a bulky man with a mustache: Mr. Faraji\u2019s debt collector. There is rarely a need to rough people up, the man said, because \u201cusually they pay when I come over.\u201dIran\u2019s Ministry of Labor counts every Iranian who works at least one hour a week as employed. There is no welfare for the long-term unemployed, but laid-off workers get some unemployment insurance. By the official figures, which economists say understate the problem, eight million Iranians are jobless, and only half of Iran\u2019s educated women ever find a job.At the same time, the government, seeking to provide some sort of safety net in hard economic times, is running fat: It employs around 8.5 million people, out of a national population of just 80 million. But those highly sought-after jobs are difficult for younger Iranians to even hope for.For Mr. Faraji, the day was barely half-done when at 11 a.m. he shared a taxi to the shopping center where he had recently rented a tiny space to sell perfumes and cosmetics. Most of his merchandise is smuggled into the country, often by powerful groups related to security organizations, he said. While technically illegal, it is a common practice, the only way to avoid a hefty official import tax.In the mostly empty mall, the only sound was the odd crackle of an escalator.Whether it\u2019s honey or perfumes, Mr. Faraji concluded, prices are too high and no one is buying. Like many Iranians, he blamed politicians and an ideology that has left roughly 80 percent of the economy under state ownership.\u201cOur leaders need money, so they raise the prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to spend money in Syria, in Yemen and Iraq to defend their ideology. We are paying.\u201dThe ideology, a mix of anti-Western socialism and a rigid interpretation of Islam, is widely regarded as outdated. Mr. Faraji is not alone in calling it a drag on the economy or in throwing up his hands in frustration.\u201cStop saying, \u2018Death to America,\u2019 make amends with the world and foreign investors and jobs will come,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be realistic: That will not happen.\u201dNot everyone is so jaded. Many in Iran\u2019s moderate and reformist faction are guardedly optimistic that the country is changing, albeit in fits and starts, and always subject to reversals by hard-liners.One of those optimists, Mahmoud Sadeghi, a former cleric and son of a famous ayatollah, now wears a suit as a member of Parliament and takes to Twitter as he probes corruption among the ruling elite.In the parliamentary elections of 2016, reformists and moderates gained a small majority, which they have used to attack problems like corruption that discourage economic initiatives.Mr. Sadeghi and other reformists note that, largely under the radar, Iran has changed a great deal over the years, in some ways resembling many Western societies. After roughly 20 years of the internet, satellite television and affordable foreign travel, Iranians have grown more sophisticated, educated and moderate, and less pious.Iran\u2019s aging leaders have been forced to give ground, tolerating changes they can no longer prevent. Gone are the days when police officers would raid rooftops to remove illegal satellite dishes. Most Iranians can now watch more than 150 foreign-based Persian language channels, while state television, heavily salted with lectures by conservative clerics, is increasingly ignored.\u201cWe are successful in bringing change, as otherwise I would not be sitting in Parliament,\u201d Mr. Sadeghi said, referring to his status as a corruption fighter.In November, Mr. Sadeghi gave a speech in Parliament accusing the head of the judiciary, Sadegh Amoli-Larijani, of maintaining a secret bank account to collect diverted public funds. After the speech, representatives of the judiciary tried to arrest him, but were stopped when dozens of people gathered in front of his house to protect him.Nevertheless, change for Mr. Sadeghi and many within Iran\u2019s establishment means altering existing law, not overhauling Iran\u2019s political system and establishment.And that change is halting. For instance, in 2016, Parliament passed a measure that would have made women eligible for top political positions, only to have it blocked by the 12-member Guardian Council \u2014 now led by a 90-year-old hard-liner, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati \u2014 which reviews all new laws to ensure they are properly \u201cIslamic.\u201dParliament\u2019s attempts to make it easier for women to obtain a divorce and more difficult for men to take a second wife were similarly rejected by the council, which also vets candidates for elections.This, too, has consequences for the economy, as obscure laws enacted after the revolution in 1979 remain on the books, often used by ideologues or unscrupulous officials to undermine business ventures that in most other countries would be brilliant successes.Take, for example, Sohrab Mostaghim, 28, and some of his friends, all graduates of Tehran\u2019s best universities, who designed a treasure hunt set in the city\u2019s most popular park. Soon, hundreds of people were happily paying the equivalent of $11 each to play the game, based on riddles and questions embedded in an app on their mobile phones.But when they told a manager of the park what was going on, they were blindsided by his reaction.\u201cInstead of welcoming the extra visitors and this fun game, he pressured us, claiming our promotional video was against Islam, since at the end the brother and sister hug,\u201d Mr. Mostaghim said. Physical contact between men and women in public is officially forbidden in Iran, but the rules are widely flouted in the larger cities.Ultimately, the partners felt they had to shut the game down, whereupon the manager changed his tune.\u201cNow, he is asking us for bribes to allow us to use the park,\u201d Mr. Mostaghim said. \u201cWe are not even sure if he will really allow us if we pay.\u201dThe whole idea of a start-up is to embrace freedom to think and create, he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have that here.\u201dEven established businesses that suffered during the years of sanctions are finding it difficult to recapture lost customers. For Bahram Shahriyari, 58, the prospect of lifting international sanctions after the nuclear deal was a faint light at the end of what had become a dark tunnel.Until the sanctions were imposed, he had owned a business providing parts and components for new and used vehicles made by Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn of France, one of the most prominent foreign brands in the country. At its peak just four years ago, his company had 400 employees and even exported parts to France.\u201cBut the sanctions and mismanagement of our leaders was neck-breaking,\u201d Mr. Shahriyari said. His principal customer, an Iranian state-owned automotive company, Iran Khodro, stopped placing orders because it was having trouble selling cars. Before long, his checks started bouncing, he said, and he told employees that he could no longer pay their wages.\u201cA contact, an ambassador for Iran, once told me, \u2018You have to pay the price for the nuclear advancement of our country,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, I did.\u201dAn article on Monday about disillusionment in Iran over the approaching presidential election misstated the timing of a parliamentary election in which reformists and moderates won a small majority. It was in 2016, not 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Route to Air Travel Discomfort Starts on Wall Street", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byBut ultimately, the episode was set in motion elsewhere \u2014 on Wall Street.Relentless pressure on corporate America is creating an increasingly Dickensian experience for many consumers as companies focus on maximizing profit. And nowhere is the trend as stark as in the airline industry, whose service is delivered in an aluminum tube packed with up to four different classes, cheek by jowl, 35,000 feet in the air.\u201cThere\u2019s always been pressure from Wall Street,\u201d said Robert L. Dilenschneider, a veteran public relations executive who advises companies and chief executives on strategic communications. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been watching this for 30 years, and it\u2019s never been as intense as it is today.\u201dRich bonus packages for top executives are now largely tied to short-term income targets and fatter profit margins instead of customer service. Of course, bolstering profits \u2014 and in turn, stock prices \u2014 has always been a big part of management\u2019s responsibility to shareholders, but making it virtually the only criterion for executive pay is new.Five years ago, American Airlines factored in on-time arrivals, lost baggage and consumer complaints to help calculate annual incentive payments for top management. Today, these bonuses are based exclusively on the company\u2019s pretax income and cost savings.United has also scaled back bonuses linked to reliability and customer satisfaction for senior executives in recent years. But in the wake of what happened in April, bonuses \u201cwill be made more comprehensively subject to progress in 2017 on significant improvement in the customer experience,\u201d the company said in a financial filing.\u201cFifteen years ago, airlines competed with each other over who could buy the most planes or have the most routes,\u201d said Jamie Baker, a top airline industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cExecutives are just as competitive today, but it\u2019s about who can achieve an investment-grade rating first, who can be a component in the S. & P. 500, and who has better returns for investors.\u201dThese new incentives also partly explain why airlines are packing seats more densely and squeezing more passengers into the back of the plane. \u201cDensification is driven by the desire to sweat the assets and generate revenues without having to commit capital to building new planes,\u201d Mr. Baker said.Such a shift isn\u2019t unique to the airline industry.\u201cAs in other industries, like manufacturing or consumer goods, the focus is on more traditional financial metrics like pretax income, margins, return on capital and total shareholder return,\u201d said Andrew Goldstein, head of the executive compensation practice in North America for Willis Towers Watson. \u201cAirlines haven\u2019t abandoned operational and customer-service metrics, but they are putting less emphasis on those factors.\u201dAnd with the economy growing at a rate of only 2 percent while the stock market rallies on promises of soaring earnings, something must give so profit margins can grow.In the case of United or Spirit Airlines, whose repeated cancellations led to a melee among travelers this month at a terminal in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., it was customer service. At other companies, like Ford and Alcoa, it was the head of the chief executive that was served up when profits failed to meet expectations.Mature industries \u2014 where double-digit annual profit growth is a reach in the best of times \u2014 are especially vulnerable to activist investors\u2019 demands for board seats, bigger stock repurchases and other short-term financial rewards.The pressure is especially brutal in the airline industry because the key expense, fuel, is for the most part beyond management control. Yet airline executives have largely convinced Wall Street that the bad old days of bankruptcies and fare wars are over, replaced by the kind of predictable annual profits more common among industrial companies.That\u2019s among the reasons fees have popped up in recent years for everything from checking bags to securing an assigned seat before boarding. Known on Wall Street as ancillary revenue, this stream of income is especially favored by investors because it doesn\u2019t swing sharply the way fares do.And so far, despite occasional bouts of air rage and frequent consumer complaints, Wall Street has been getting what it wants.United\u2019s stock has surged to more than $80 per share from $25 per share five years ago, with profit margins rising to 13.6 percent from 3.7 percent over the same period. Overall industry margins hit 16.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent in 2012.Spirit\u2019s operating margins are among the highest in the industry, topping 20 percent in 2015 and 2016. But Paul Berry, a company spokesman, said Spirit had pivoted to focus more on customer service in the last year, even as some larger rivals keep cutting costs to compete.Despite rewarding top executives strictly according to financial targets, American said it, too, was committed to improving the passenger experience.\u201cEvery single person at American knows we succeed or fail based on how well we serve customers,\u201d said Joshua Freed, a company spokesman. \u201cWe will only meet those financial goals if we keep our customers happy.\u201dStill, the promise of steady profit growth has prompted even Warren E. Buffett to take a fresh look at airline stocks. He once famously called the industry a money-losing \u201cdeath trap,\u201d but reversed course late last year, with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, acquiring stakes in several airlines.\u201cIn the past, airline stocks were seen as hazardous to one\u2019s wealth,\u201d said Mr. Baker, the JPMorgan analyst. \u201cThey were trading vehicles, and potential destroyers of capital.\u201dThe pressure on United, American and other giants is only going to increase with the rise of so-called ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant. In fact, American and United are rolling out a stripped-down new class called Basic Economy.Here, in exchange for the cheapest tickets, fliers can\u2019t choose their seats before checking in and are more likely to be stuck in the middle of the row. They board last and are less likely to be able to sit with companions. No carry-on luggage is permitted, forcing anyone without elite frequent-flier status to check anything larger than a backpack \u2014 for a fee.\u201cThat\u2019s the experience on a ultra-low-cost carrier,\u201d said Rajeev Lalwani, an airline industry analyst with Morgan Stanley. As the legacy airlines introduce similar no-frills offerings to hold off upstarts like Spirit, he said, \u201cpart of the idea is to get folks to upgrade to premium economy and collect fees.\u201dIt\u2019s also the wave of the future, at least for budget-conscious travelers.\u201cFor the lowest price comes the most basic product,\u201d said Alan Wise, a senior partner with the Boston Consulting Group, who leads the firm\u2019s travel and tourism practice for North America. \u201cSpirit has been a growth story in the space, and it\u2019s forced the legacy carriers to adapt and innovate.\u201dTo be sure, some industry veterans insist it is a mistake to simply blame investors or hedge-fund managers for fostering a race to the bottom in customer service.\u201cThe response isn\u2019t to Wall Street. It\u2019s to customer behavior,\u201d said Alex Dichter, a senior partner at McKinsey who works with major airlines. \u201cAbout 35 percent of customers are choosing on price, and price alone, and another 35 percent choose mostly on price.\u201dMr. Dichter noted that when American added two to four inches of legroom in coach in the early 2000s, \u201cas far as I know, the airline didn\u2019t see one bit of improvement in market share or pricing.\u201d\u201cThe great irony is that most C.E.O.s would love to compete on product and experience,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s much more fun. The problem is that customers aren\u2019t paying attention to that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Lab Rat Is a Snake", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "The Health IssueWhy Burmese pythons may be the best way to study diabetes, heart disease and the protective effects of gastric-bypass surgery in humans.Supported byIt was the late fall of 2012, and Choudhary, then a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, had become interested in the Burmese python on account of its extraordinary physiology. The animal is essentially a slithering digestive tract: In the wild, it often spends a month or two in silent ambush; then, when the moment is right, it wraps its coils around a monkey, a pig, an antelope and swallows its prey head first. A single meal for a full-grown python may contain more than 50,000 calories, a tidal wave of nutrients and fatty acids that could be deadly to another species. But the python has adapted to the overload. For the week or so that follows feeding, its body turns into an engine of digestion: Its intestine thickens; its liver and kidneys nearly double in mass; its insulin level shoots up; its temperature increases by six degrees Fahrenheit; its pulse triples; and its metabolism jumps. Once all the food has been absorbed, the python\u2019s organs shrink back to their quiescent state.Growing up in a farming area several hours from Kolkata, India, Choudhary had always been afraid of snakes. \u201cI was told not to mess with those creatures,\u201d he says. Now he realized they might hold a cure for diabetes. The pancreatic cells he used in the lab were beta cells, and diabetes is a beta-cell disease. In the early-onset (Type 1) form, the body\u2019s immune system turns against these cells and nearly wipes them out. Without a source of insulin, a patient can\u2019t control the sugar in the bloodstream. In Type 2 diabetes, the version of the ailment linked to Western diets and obesity, it goes the other way: The patient loses sensitivity to the insulin being produced, and the beta cells become overcharged to compensate, until eventually they weaken or die. What if Choudhary could find a chemical in snake blood that worked to bolster the beta cells and reverse the condition?Choudhary knew the stakes as well as anybody. In India, they call diabetes \u201chaving sugar,\u201d and his family seemed at special risk: Nearly every one of his male relatives, and some females, too, had sugar, and many died from its complications. Even he and his younger brothers, all of whom now live in the United States, may be doomed to the condition in their later middle age. So after completing his dissertation work in quantum chemistry and biophysics, Choudhary started looking into diabetes.Until that point, he found, much of the research into therapies for beta cells had been done on laboratory rodents. After years of work on rats and mice, scientists had come up with lots of drugs that energized a rodent\u2019s pancreas, but very few of these showed any promise when it came to treating humans. We don\u2019t yet know why, but one reason may be that the pancreas of a mouse or a rat is a bit peculiar. For one thing, its beta cells are livelier than ours and more likely to divide. They are also grouped together in one place in the pancreas, while ours are a bit more scattered. And rodents have a pair of genes encoding insulin, while we have only one.In spite of these discrepancies, rats and mice remain the most common research animals for the study of diabetes, as they are for all of biomedicine. In part because of their proximity to humans on the evolutionary tree, in part because of their small size and in part because of our facility at playing with their DNA, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus have become the default choice for biomedical experiments. But if sickly diabetic mice and rats were useful models of the disease, Choudhary thought, might there be even greater value in a species that evolved to be the opposite \u2014 a model of good health, resistant to whatever makes a rodent or a person fall apart?Choudhary had the snake blood and a plate of beta cells on steroids. But before he allowed himself to dream of wonder cures, he tried the same experiment again \u2014 putting milky drops into a petri dish \u2014 this time using plasma from a different snake. Once again, the beta cells were sent into a riot. If Choudhary were to start a brand-new research program using laboratory pythons, he would need to be absolutely certain that he hadn\u2019t messed things up. \u201cWhen the results are too good,\u201d he said, \u201cyou always worry that something must have gone wrong.\u201d He ran the experiment four more times. It always worked.Benedict came to Boston on behalf of the Carnegie Institution to found a laboratory for the study of nutrition. He brought with him a state-of-the-art device that he helped develop while at Wesleyan, known as the respiration calorimeter. An airtight chamber lined with zinc and copper, it could be used to calculate the energy in food \u2014 i.e. its \u201ccalories\u201d \u2014 and study how exercise or eating might affect a person\u2019s metabolic rate. He soon discovered that his measurements of energetics could be applied to nearly any animal \u2014 he once built a mammoth version of the chamber for an elephant \u2014 and used to answer endless questions on nutrition, important or mundane. At one point, he calculated the energetic cost of thinking: \u201cThe cloistered scholar at his books may be surprised to learn that the extra calories needed for one hour of intense mental effort,\u201d he announced in 1930, \u201cwould be completely met by the eating of one oyster cracker or half of a salted peanut.\u201dAs part of his grand project on behalf of Carnegie, Benedict set out to construct a bestiary of metabolic rates. In 1915, he traveled to New York City to install a respiration chamber in the reptile house at the Bronx Zoo. He hoped to use the snakes \u2014 including the zoo\u2019s 17-foot python \u2014 to understand how and why an animal\u2019s body temperature might fluctuate. Eventually, he predicted, this work could help explain the mysteries of human fever.By the following spring, Benedict had begun a study of the snakes\u2019 response to eating. It intrigued him that pythons and other constricting snakes, in particular, could ingest an \u201cinconceivably large mass\u201d at one time. He had them gobble rabbits whole, or hunks of beef fat wrapped in the pelts of guinea pigs, and tested them in his giant-snake-size chamber. The resulting bumps in heat \u2014 and fivefold increase in carbon-dioxide production \u2014 left him dazzled. \u201cWith no other animals in the world, certainly among the vertebrates, can one expect such economy in the taking of food,\u201d he wrote in his monograph from 1932, \u201cThe Physiology of Large Reptiles.\u201d A photograph of Benedict, published that same year, shows him in a lab coat and bow tie, proudly holding an eight-foot python by its neck.For Benedict, the python\u2019s Olympian feats of digestion made it worthy of study, but he was nearly as impressed by its placid disposition \u2014 a highly valued trait in a laboratory animal. Special credit went to the python he examined at the National Zoo in Washington: \u201cIn the entire series of experiments with this animal she gave but one sign of agitation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhich was a heavy, deep breath, approximating a hiss, in the middle of an afternoon session.\u201dYet despite Benedict\u2019s efforts to proselytize, the python barely made its way into the labs of other physiologists. In fact, the details of its digestive tract and their implications for our understanding of metabolism were more or less ignored for 60 years, until a young biologist named Stephen Secor started tracking rattlesnakes in the Mojave Desert.Secor, who grew up on a horse farm, planned to be a veterinarian, but a love of snakes derailed him. At first, he tried to study their behavior in the lab (the mating habits of the speckled king snake), but he found the research boring. So for his Ph.D. at the University of California, Los Angeles, Secor headed out into the field to track a pair of wild species \u2014 the coachwhip and the sidewinder rattlesnake \u2014 and learn how they managed their metabolism in a natural setting. As eaters, these snakes were polar opposites. Secor noticed that the coachwhip, whose form is long and slender, was always on the move, chasing little lizards through the Kelso Dunes. A sidewinder waits for its dinner: It sits in ambush until a kangaroo rat happens to come hopping by, and then it has a banquet.When Secor presented his observations at a 1991 scientific meeting at White Mountain Research Center, a few hours north of Los Angeles, Jared Diamond raised his hand. Diamond, now better known for his work as a geographer and historian (he is the author of \u201cGuns, Germs and Steel\u201d), was at the time a physiologist in the mold of Francis Gano Benedict. Since the early 1980s, he had been working on a grand survey of animal digestion. His lab had looked at rats and mice, cats and minks, frogs and fish. He had even studied how a hummingbird handles so much nectar in its small intestine.Diamond thought of the intestine as something like a muscle, lifting substances into the bloodstream. If you had to do more lifting, he reasoned, you would need to have a stronger muscle. So Secor\u2019s talk about the sidewinders, and their feast-or-famine diet, made him wonder if the animals\u2019 intestines were endowed with superhero strength. As it happens, Secor had tried to measure the rattlesnakes\u2019 metabolism, but the numbers he got were so high that they seemed impossible. A mammal\u2019s metabolic rate typically rises by one-quarter or one-half after feeding. The largest such increase anyone had ever measured in a reptile was a fourfold or fivefold change. But Secor\u2019s data showed that sidewinders could increase their metabolism by almost eightfold \u2014 a bigger jump than anyone had seen in any species. A prominent scientist at U.C.L.A., who would later serve as Secor\u2019s mentor, told him that he must be doing something wrong. \u201cLeave the physiology to physiologists,\u201d the professor said.But when Diamond looked at Secor\u2019s numbers, he believed them. \u201cThis is the most exciting data I\u2019ve seen in five years,\u201d he announced. As soon as Secor finished his dissertation, he moved his work to Diamond\u2019s lab. It soon became apparent that, as research animals, Secor\u2019s three dozen wild rattlesnakes were not ideal. \u201cEvery now and again, he\u2019d get bitten, and then he\u2019d get a little dizzy,\u201d Diamond remembers. Secor says the venom didn\u2019t bother him much, but U.C.L.A.\u2019s administration was not keen on housing a colony of sidewinders. So Secor and Diamond set out to find a safer snake with an athlete\u2019s intestine. Secor tested a Noah\u2019s ark of options \u2014 a pair of water snakes, a pair of corn snakes, a pair of black racers, a pair of Burmese pythons \u2014 before he found his champion. The python\u2019s gut looked even more impressive than the rattlesnake\u2019s. After feeding, the intestine blew up like a bodybuilder\u2019s, doubling in mass.And if the python\u2019s meal was very large, its metabolic rate would increase not just eightfold, like the rattlesnake\u2019s, but by a factor of 44. The only comparable metabolic increase Diamond knew of had been identified in a galloping racehorse. The most impressive short-term increase he had seen in humans \u2014 measured in water-polo players and cyclists in the Tour de France \u2014 was no more than five or six times their resting rate. \u201cThese pythons made the Tour de France cyclists and water-polo players look like wimps,\u201d he says. What\u2019s more, the python could sustain that level of metabolism for several days.Secor kept a pair of 12-footers in his home, Linus and Bob; he knew pythons were easy to acquire and maintain. The pet trade in the Burmese python had been booming since the 1980s. So he reached out to a guy he knew in Oklahoma, who happened to be the nation\u2019s biggest python breeder, and put in an order for 100 snakes. Over the next few years, Secor worked on tracing how a Burmese python\u2019s body transforms itself after feeding. Nearly every facet of digestion was exaggerated, he found, from the way the python fills its stomach with hydrochloric acid to the way its organs thicken and expand. For him and Diamond, the scale of these effects had a scientific value of its own. It made the process of digestion easier to study, because every nuance could be seen in high relief.But as Secor finished this initial round of work, Diamond was preparing to move on. \u201cThe future of the world does not depend on intestines and gallbladders,\u201d he had decided. In the fall of 1998, he and Secor summarized their research on pythons in the journal Nature. Their article was half-prospectus and half-plea \u2014 a call to fellow physiologists to make the Burmese python a standard laboratory animal. The snakes were practical, the article said, on account of their infrequent feeding and inexpensive upkeep, their convenient \u201clinear anatomy,\u201d their easygoing nature and their relative lack of moral standing. (Snakes \u201cdo not arouse the controversy associated with medical research on similarly sized mammals,\u201d Secor and Diamond noted.) But the Burmese python\u2019s greatest value \u2014 its raison d\u2019\u00eatre as a laboratory species \u2014 derives from its special way of eating.\u201cThe history of biology illustrates the importance of selecting exceptionally suitable species as models,\u201d Secor and Diamond wrote. The fruit fly, for example, with its rapid reproduction, helped scientists understand genetics; the squid, with its peculiarly gigantic axon fibers, allowed scientists to examine the workings of a single nerve cell. Could pythons, with their astounding feats of regulation, become the next great model animals?For most of his career, Secor\u2019s work has been unadulterated by the need for real-world applications. People rarely bothered him with plans to plumb the python as a source of pharmaceuticals or as a means to better human health. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the medical aspects,\u201d he says he might have told them at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I do. I just love these animals because I\u2019m interested in their biology.\u201dThen, all at once, the field began to change. First a group based at the University of California, Irvine, led by a comparative physiologist named James Hicks, published data showing that the python\u2019s heart can grow in size by 40 percent as the animal digests. Not long after, Leslie Leinwand, who studies cardiac disease at the University of Colorado, became interested. Leinwand knew that in humans, an enlarged heart can be a sign of good health \u2014 athletes get bigger, stronger hearts from working out \u2014 but it can also signal that the organ is diseased. With help from Secor, she and her postdoctoral researcher, Cecilia Riquelme, found that after feeding, a python\u2019s heart swells the way an athlete\u2019s does, with no ill effects. Then they tried pouring snake blood on a dish of rat heart cells and found it bulked them up, like liquid exercise. A subset of the fatty acids in the python\u2019s blood seemed to function as a cell-expanding cocktail, one that worked even in living mice.In early 2012, Leinwand presented her research at the Broad Institute, where Choudhary had just begun to think about the python as a tool for treating diabetes. The python\u2019s heart might swell by 40 percent after feeding, he thought excitedly, but its pancreas would double. Leinwand had found a signal in a python\u2019s blood that makes heart cells big and strong. What if he could do the same, or more, for pancreatic beta cells? Later, in 2013, another researcher, Nicholas Stylopoulos of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, whose office happens to be just down the street from Choudhary\u2019s (and from the site of Francis Gano Benedict\u2019s), decided that the python might be a useful model for his work on the science underpinning gastric-bypass surgery and its benefits for diabetics.Why did it take so long for medical researchers to see the value in the python? For one thing, the conditions the python might help to treat have become more prevalent. In 1998, when Secor and Diamond\u2019s essay first appeared, 10.5 million Americans were found to have diabetes. By the time Leinwand published her results, that number had nearly doubled. Obesity rates have also climbed during that span. Our worsening diets have made the python\u2019s way of eating more germane.Leinwand has begun to investigate whether the snakes themselves get fat and sick. In the 25 years since Secor started work in Diamond\u2019s lab, escaped or discarded Burmese python pets have found their way into the Everglades in Florida. With no natural predators, they have flourished on the region\u2019s supersize supply of birds, raccoons and opossums, as well as bobcats, deer and alligators. Leinwand wants to know whether the Burmese python \u2014 or the Burmese-American python, really \u2014 might be getting ill from all this food. (And if it isn\u2019t, then what, exactly, is protecting it?) \u201cTheir diet is different, they\u2019re eating things that they\u2019re not normally eating and they\u2019re eating way more often,\u201d Leinwand says. \u201cSo one of the experiments that we\u2019re working on right now is asking, Is this a bad thing for them, or a good thing, to be exposed to such huge amounts of food and fat?\u201dIt\u2019s not clear when Leinwand\u2019s and others\u2019 newer projects might develop. Python research has been very slow, especially compared with the work done on rodents. It took Leinwand and Riquelme several years just to make sure that antibodies they used for their mouse research would work the same for snakes. And while a round of lab mice can be bred in a matter of weeks, new python hatchlings arrive only once per year. That glacial pace makes the work on snakes \u201ca very high-risk, high-reward project,\u201d Choudhary says. Last year, he and Secor and a third researcher, Bridget Wagner, secured a grant of $2.5 million from the National Institutes of Health, from a special fund for \u201cinnovative, unconventional, paradigm-shifting research projects.\u201d They have started by setting up what Choudhary calls a \u201csnake infrastructure,\u201d so they can rear and analyze the pythons as efficiently as possible.The work is on the verge of getting easier for another reason too. When Leinwand and Riquelme started on the Burmese python, the animal\u2019s genetic code had not been mapped. They did their best by comparing bits of python RNA to published genomes of the chicken and the lizard. But just before they published their research, a group of snake biologists put out a first draft of the sequence for the Burmese python. Now Leinwand\u2019s lab, as well as Choudhary\u2019s and Stylopoulos\u2019s, has a detailed atlas of the python\u2019s DNA. That means they can feed a Burmese python in the lab and then use a simple probe to analyze tissue from its heart, pancreas or small intestine to see which genes are tuning up or down within each cell. Choudhary has been using this approach to figure out the genes behind the beneficial changes to a python\u2019s beta cells. These might be useful targets for a future diabetes drug, he says.If all this work on snakes continues to expand, the python may one day be as central to our understanding of disease \u2014 or at least those illnesses that stem, in part, from overeating \u2014 as the laboratory rodent. Eventually, in some respects, it might even overtake the mouse. Perhaps that would be fitting. As she raises the baby Burmese pythons for her lab, Leinwand has them on an all-mouse diet.Advertisement"}

Meltzer, an influential conservative economist who strongly opposed government bailouts and was credited with coining the anti-bailout slogan, \u201cCapitalism without failure is like religion without sin,\u201d died on Monday in Pittsburgh. He was 89.Marvin Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University and a colleague of Dr. Meltzer\u2019s there, confirmed the death, at Shadyside Hospital. Dr. Meltzer taught at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon and, at his death, held a professorship there in political economy that was named for him.Throughout his career Dr. Meltzer was a consultant to congressional committees, the Federal Reserve System, the Treasury Department, foreign governments and central banks, advocating a hands-off approach to economic affairs, even in the face of fiscal failures.\u201cThe reason he was one of the greatest economists in the 20th century is because he played a leading role in persuading the Federal Reserve to end the great inflation with disciplined monetary policy,\u201d Dr. Goodfriend said, referring to the late 1960s to the early 1980s.In 1999 and 2000 he was chairman of a congressional commission \u2014 informally called the Meltzer Commission \u2014 that examined how the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had responded to the 1997-98 financial crisis, in which a sharp devaluation of Southeast Asian currencies beginning in July 1997 rippled across the global economy, affecting markets in the United States, Europe and Latin America.His economic philosophy has found renewed favor in the Trump administration. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Adam Lerrick, who helped Dr. Meltzer with his I.M.F. and World Bank report, has been nominated as deputy under secretary for international finance in the Treasury Department.In coining the slogan \u201cCapitalism without failure is like religion without sin,\u201d he added another maxim: \u201cBankruptcies and losses concentrate the mind on prudent behavior.\u201dAllan Harold Meltzer was born on Feb. 6, 1928, in Boston to George Meltzer and the former Minerva Simon. His mother died when he was 6, and his father later remarried.Allan attended the Boys\u2019 Latin School and Brookline High School in Massachusetts. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Duke University in 1948 and received master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles.In 1957 he became an assistant professor at the Carnegie Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later named the Tepper School of Business.Dr. Meltzer\u2019s economic influence stretched decades. In 1973, he helped found the private Shadow Open Market Committee with Karl Brunner of the University of Rochester. The panel offered policy recommendations to the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.He received many awards for his work, including the Harry Truman Medal for Public Policy and the Truman Medal for Economic Policy.Dr. Meltzer wrote more than 10 books, including the comprehensive multivolume \u201cA History of the Federal Reserve.\u201dHe is survived by his wife, the former Marilyn Ginsburg; two sons, Bruce and Eric; a daughter, Beth MacIsaac; a half sister from his father\u2019s second marriage, Maxine Smith; and eight grandchildren.In recent years Mr. Meltzer found a new interest in law and regulation.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Matter With Europe?", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byOn Sunday France will hold its presidential runoff. Most observers expect Emmanuel Macron, a centrist, to defeat Marine Le Pen, the white nationalist \u2014 please, let\u2019s stop dignifying this stuff by calling it \u201cpopulism.\u201d And I\u2019m pretty sure that Times rules allow me to state directly that I very much hope the conventional wisdom is right. A Le Pen victory would be a disaster for Europe and the world.Yet I also think it\u2019s fair to ask a couple of questions about what\u2019s going on. First, how did things get to this point? Second, would a Le Pen defeat be anything more than a temporary reprieve from the ongoing European crisis?Some background: Like everyone on this side of the Atlantic, I can\u2019t help seeing France in part through Trump-colored glasses. But it\u2019s important to realize that the parallels between French and American politics exist despite big differences in underlying economic and social trends.They\u2019re also just about equally productive. It\u2019s true that the French over all produce about a quarter less per person then we do \u2014 but that\u2019s mainly because they take more vacations and retire younger, which are not obviously terrible things.In short, France is hardly a utopia, but by most standards it is offering its citizens a fairly decent life. So why are so many willing to vote for \u2014 again, let\u2019s not use euphemisms \u2014 a racist extremist?There are, no doubt, multiple reasons, especially cultural anxiety over Islamic immigrants. But it seems clear that votes for Le Pen will in part be votes of protest against what are perceived as the highhanded, out-of-touch officials running the European Union. And that perception unfortunately has an element of truth.Those of us who watched European institutions deal with the debt crisis that began in Greece and spread across much of Europe were shocked at the combination of callousness and arrogance that prevailed throughout.Politically, Eurocrats got away with this behavior because small nations were easy to bully, too terrified of being cut off from euro financing to stand up to unreasonable demands. But Europe\u2019s elite will be making a terrible mistake if it believes it can behave the same way to bigger players.Indeed, there are already intimations of disaster in the negotiations now taking place between the European Union and Britain.Which brings me back to the French election. We should be terrified at the possibility of a Le Pen victory. But we should also be worried that a Macron victory will be taken by Brussels and Berlin to mean that Brexit was an aberration, that European voters can always be intimidated into going along with what their betters say is necessary.So let\u2019s be clear: Even if the worst is avoided this Sunday, all the European elite will get is a time-limited chance to mend its ways.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}

But Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was most likely on target when he said that the Russians are \u201cactively involved in the French elections.\u201d Whether Russia\u2019s efforts are effective is another question; yet another is how to counter them.The fourth candidate, Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old former economy minister, is strong on maintaining Russian sanctions and favors strengthening the European Union, which Mr. Putin would dearly like to see weakened. Not surprisingly, Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign charges that Russia is spreading fake news about him through its state-funded media, such as RT and Sputnik, including rumors about his sex life.If Russia is in fact conducting hacking operations to affect the outcome of the French election, French authorities have every right to take strong measures, as Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has vowed to do. And social media companies should take steps to fact-check dubious content. In the end, however, the best defense against Russian meddling is to expose it for what it is. And if the American presidential election is any guide, the greatest effect of Russian interference was to create even more problems for the Kremlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Targets German Trade, and the South Grimaces", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byGREER, S.C. \u2014 No matter that this small Southern city sits squarely in the middle of Trump country: The president, with his criticism of German trade policy, was setting off alarm bells in the mind of Mayor Richard W. Danner.President Trump, on his recent trip to Europe, reportedly declared the Germans \u201cbad, very bad\u201d on trade; Greer\u2019s City Hall sits mere miles from a BMW automobile plant that employs about 8,800 people. And so after Mr. Danner read the news here, he quickly organized a call with Chamber of Commerce officials, who on Tuesday brainstormed ways to reassure BMW executives that they in fact considered them to be good. Very good.\u201cThere was a real sense of urgency that we need to be clear to BMW and to anyone else who would listen that we can\u2019t take this kind of rhetoric lightly,\u201d said Mr. Danner, who was first elected to Greer\u2019s nonpartisan mayor\u2019s office in 1999. \u201cFor us, this isn\u2019t a political issue. This is a matter of livelihoods and of a regional economy and a lot of other things that are going on here.\u201dBut the same areas have also proved to be reliable bases of support for Mr. Trump, underscoring the unresolved tension between globalist and protectionist tendencies within both the administration and the broader Trump coalition.In few places is the tension more evident than South Carolina. The current governor, Henry McMaster, a Republican, was an early and ardent supporter of Mr. Trump. The previous governor, Nikki R. Haley, made attracting foreign and outside investment a central theme of her tenure, aggressively marketing the state\u2019s low-tax and anti-union policies to potential manufacturers. Ms. Haley, a Republican, now serves as Mr. Trump\u2019s envoy to the United Nations.Mr. McMaster was not available for an interview, his spokesman said on Wednesday, and Ms. Haley did not respond to an interview request. But both have spoken passionately about BMW\u2019s importance to South Carolina: Ms. Haley said in 2011 that it had become \u201ca South Carolina company.\u201d Last week, Mr. McMaster visited Greer with a German government minister.Mr. Trump\u2019s latest salvos against Germany have drawn criticism in recent days from other Republicans in a state that is home to 160 German companies and where German investment from 2011 to 2016 totaled $4.6 billion, resulting in more than 10,000 new jobs in South Carolina, according to data from the State Department of Commerce.\u201cI\u2019m a little bit surprised and disappointed that the president has chosen to attack before he gets his facts straight,\u201d said Ted Pitts, president and chief executive of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, who previously served as Ms. Haley\u2019s chief of staff and, before that, as a Republican state legislator. \u201cI guess we\u2019re surprised that he\u2019d try to make this claim at the expense of South Carolina and American jobs.\u201dWhether Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter messages and comments are just bluster or grounds for a significantly retooled trade stance toward Germany is not altogether clear. Obama administration officials also expressed frustration with Germany\u2019s vast trade surplus with the United States, which stood at $64.8 billion in 2016. It is also unclear how much control Germany ultimately has over this reality because its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank and because of its membership in the European Union.The broader concern, in states like South Carolina, is the idea that Mr. Trump is presenting foreign companies with new waves of doubt and instability as they consider expanding or relocating stateside.\u201cA company like BMW has been around 100 years, and they expect to be around another 100 years, and so they\u2019re making very serious location decisions based on our trade policies and they expect those to be honored,\u201d said Doug Woodward, an economics professor at the University of South Carolina. \u201cThey expect those to change, but not fundamentally. And they thought that we were all moving in the direction of more open trade.\u201dIn an interview on Wednesday, Germany\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Peter Wittig, spoke of the ripple effect that German auto plants could have: A 2014 University of South Carolina study noted that for every job at the BMW plant, three others are created elsewhere.\u201cAnything that impedes the free flow of goods and services and people, and erects impediments to that free and fair trade order, is nefarious from our point of view,\u201d Mr. Wittig said.But the industries have vigorous defenders on both sides of the aisle. On Wednesday, Andy Berke, the Democratic mayor of Chattanooga, Tenn., spoke of the Volkswagen plant in town, which employs 3,200 people and is linked to at least 9,500 jobs at the plant\u2019s suppliers, but has room to expand. Mr. Berke worried that Mr. Trump\u2019s words might give the company pause.\u201cIf we move backwards and push our auto suppliers out of the country, that really rolls back the good in Chattanooga,\u201d he said.In Alabama, State Representative Corey Harbison, a Republican, represents a district that is home to Rehau, a supplier to a Mercedes-Benz factory in Tuscaloosa County. Mr. Harbison welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip style. But he also said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure on this one that it was the best thing to do.\u201dOn its campus of shimmering white buildings alongside Interstate 85, the company, founded in 1916, nods to its past and its future, with an entrance display that promotes \u201cthe next 100 years.\u201d Near the exit of a museum stocked with shining models from days past, a 318i sedan, the first automobile produced here, bears a license plate that reads: \u201cProud to Call South Carolina Home.\u201dOver a glass of unsweetened tea in downtown Greer, where local leaders are still weighing how to express their support for BMW, Mayor Danner said he had learned that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets should be taken \u201cwith a grain of salt.\u201d\u201cThe thing that concerns me more than anything else is what I view as a lack of understanding about the global economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t profess to be an economist, but I know there has to be give and take.\u201dAlan Blinder reported from Greer, and Richard Fausset from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expecting a Big Economic Bump? It\u2019s Looking Less Likely", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byThe big economic bounce that some experts have confidently predicted for later in the year may turn out to be only a small bump.It is not that the economy is weakening, or that a recession is in the offing. Rather it appears as if the pace of growth in 2017 will not be much faster than it was last year, or the year before that.So even as the Commerce Department on Friday offered an upward revision of the first-quarter growth rate \u2014 to 1.2 percent from the 0.7 percent cited last month \u2014 other forecasters were lowering their sights for the current quarter.The expectations have dipped amid fears of lackluster consumer spending and orders for durable goods, and new data on Thursday that showed a larger-than-anticipated trade deficit in April.Instead of 4.1 percent growth in the second quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s widely followed GDPNow model now calls for a 3.7 percent rate. And the New York Fed reduced its rival Nowcasting estimate slightly to 2.1 percent. In March, that forecast stood at 3 percent.Despite the slight erosion in expectations recently, the job market has remained strong, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.4 percent last month. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board is expected to raise interest rates twice more this year, with traders betting that the next increase will come in June.In other words, the so-called new normal \u2014 steady but not spectacular growth that never reaches escape velocity \u2014 is beginning to resemble the old normal.\u201cWe\u2019re still on track for a 2 percent growth economy, give or take a little, but not a 3 percent economy,\u201d said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago. \u201cIt may not sound like much, but the difference is important.\u201dIn a $17 trillion economy, it is a difference of $170 billion per year, which has major implications for corporate profits, worker pay and even the federal government\u2019s bottom line.Neither figure is realistic, given the country\u2019s aging population, and low growth in productivity, Ms. Swonk said.\u201cThose two factors make for headwinds that are hard to overcome,\u201d she said. Although the kind of annual gains that Mr. Trump has targeted were achieved in the mid-2000s and the late 1990s, the economy\u2019s underlying potential is not as strong now than it was then.\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to use old road maps in a GPS world,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cWe need to acknowledge that.\u201dScott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, has not had to lower his expectations for the current quarter. That is because he has been considerably less optimistic than many of his peers, with a forecast of roughly 3 percent.\u201cI\u2019ve been below consensus for a while,\u201d Mr. Anderson said, citing the likelihood of weaker spending by businesses. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of visible growth drivers outside of consumer spending and rebuilding inventories.\u201d\u201cEveryone is hanging their hat on stronger consumer spending, but there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty there,\u201d he added, noting that data expected next week on personal income and spending would be an important indicator of how consumption is shaping up.Besides tempering expectations for the broader economy, traders appear to be discounting the likelihood of major tax cuts or a burst of infrastructure spending this year, judging by a recent drop in bond yields.Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond, which move inversely to price, were 2.25 percent on Friday, down from 2.6 percent in March. Investors tend to buy bonds when economic activity and the risk of inflation ease, and pare back as growth quickens.The inquiries into possible dealings with the Russian government by associates of Mr. Trump, and conflicts among Republicans in Congress, may further stymie any big stimulus from Washington.\u201cWe haven\u2019t built any stimulus into our projections for 2017, and the way I\u2019m seeing things, possibly not in 2018 either,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust in Chicago. \u201cThe dissonance in the Republican caucus is such that it will be hard for them to reach consensus.\u201dGiven at least a modest uptick this quarter after the year\u2019s weak start, Mr. Tannenbaum is looking for growth in the first half of 2017 to average about 2 percent.While lower than many experts and consumers would like, that is still slightly higher than the growth rate in Germany, the largest economy in the eurozone.Growth of around 2 percent is also what economists like Mike Gapen at Barclays expect for all of this year and next.Typically, quarterly data is volatile, but in recent years, first-quarter growth estimates have been especially unpredictable. This year, as was true in 2014 and 2011, growth appears to have been very weak in the first quarter. Experts expect a rebound in subsequent quarters in 2017, as happened in those previous years.Early this year, output was also reduced slightly by warm temperatures in many parts of the United States, slowing demand for energy from utilities.One key indicator for the current quarter will come on Thursday, when the latest monthly data for auto sales is released. Slightly lower car sales reduced growth by about 0.4 percentage points in the first quarter, Mr. Gapen said.On an annual basis, demand for cars has been running just over 17 million. If the number sinks below that threshold, expectations may have to be adjusted downward again for the second quarter, which ends on June 30.On the other hand, Mr. Gapen noted that Asia, Europe and other markets are finally growing in sync with the United States, rather than there being rotating global weak spots.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem child,\u201d he said. \u201cIn previous years, it was the fiscal cliff in the U.S., or debt fears in Europe or a hard landing in China. Global growth is more synchronized, without any individual pillars showing weakness.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber to Repay Millions to Drivers, Who Could Be Owed Far More", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byUber said Tuesday that it had made a mistake in the way it calculated its commissions, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars to its New York drivers, and the company vowed to correct the practice and make the drivers whole for the lost earnings.The ride-hailing service said it had been taking its cut from a figure including state taxes, rather than a pretax fare. If a passenger handed over $20, and $2 of that represented taxes, Uber\u2019s commission was a percentage of the full $20, not of $18, as it should have been. Even at pocket change per ride, the cumulative difference was vast.\u201cWe are committed to paying every driver every penny they are owed \u2014 plus interest \u2014 as quickly as possible,\u201d Rachel Holt, the company\u2019s regional general manager for the United States and Canada, said in a statement.But Uber\u2019s handling of passenger payments raises questions about a larger legal issue, potentially far more substantial: not the pocket-change difference in the commission but whether that entire $2 in taxes is improperly coming out of the drivers\u2019 wallets.Uber\u2019s contract with drivers appears to allow the company to deduct only its 25 percent commission, not taxes, from their fares. But a lawsuit filed by a drivers\u2019 advocacy group in New York last year said the company was making its drivers swallow the tax burden \u2014 a practice the group said amounted to wage theft.Documents examined by The New York Times also point to such a practice, which could have cost drivers hundreds of millions of dollars.Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the advocacy group, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said that \u201cfrom the beginning, Uber built its business model on the assumption that \u2018we hate taxes,\u2019\u201d and that it had long \u201cpassed this tax on to drivers.\u201dIn response to Uber\u2019s acknowledgment of error on Tuesday, the advocacy group said in a statement that \u201cUber hasn\u2019t just wrongly calculated its commission; it has been unlawfully taking the cost of sales tax and an injured-worker surcharge right out of driver pay.\u201dIn New York, the company must reckon with a state sales tax of nearly 9 percent per ride, as well as a 2.5 percent \u201cblack car fund\u201d surcharge to cover workers\u2019 compensation and death benefits.Under New York state laws and tax regulations, the charges are supposed to be paid by passengers, meaning they are to be assessed on top of the fares. But trip receipts have long suggested that Uber deducts the amount from the drivers\u2019 portion instead. The receipts have typically depicted an overall fare amount, from which the company subtracted an \u201cUber fee\u201d (essentially its commission), the sales tax and the black-car surcharge. The drivers received what remained.The collection method dates to at least 2014, and possibly to 2012, when Uber began operating in New York, and has affected tens of thousands of drivers.Uber has denied that it is deducting the levies from drivers\u2019 pay. \u201cWe calculate and have calculated sales tax and black-car fund correctly,\u201d a company spokesman, Josh Gold, said in an emailed statement.In early May, when The Times initially asked about the deductions, an Uber official made available by the company said the sales tax and black-car surcharge were incorporated into the passenger\u2019s overall fare and then subtracted from the drivers\u2019 take so that Uber could remit the money to the state. This, the official said, meant the passenger was actually paying the charges even though they appeared to be coming from the drivers.The official compared the practice to selling a slice of pizza for $1 with tax included, but acknowledged that it was confusing.The explanation appeared contrary to Uber\u2019s contract, which as of last week defined the fare as the base plus a rate for each mile and minute \u2014 the definition makes no mention of a tax. The explanation also appears to be at odds with Uber\u2019s trip receipts.New York assesses sales tax only on rides that begin and end in the state, not rides beginning in New York and ending in other states. But Uber has calculated the fare for both types of rides the same way, suggesting that \u2014 contrary to the pizza example \u2014 there is no tax included in the fare the passenger pays.For example, a driver\u2019s receipt from Aug. 14, 2016, for a trip from Roslyn, N.Y., to Manhattan showed Uber charging a $7 base fare plus 65 cents per minute and $3.75 per mile \u2014 the rate for Uber Black, the company\u2019s higher-end service. A second receipt from Aug. 3, 2016, for an Uber Black trip from Manhattan to Old Greenwich, Conn., showed identical rates, even though no sales tax would have been assessed.Uber deducted $13.91 to cover sales tax from the driver in the Roslyn-to-Manhattan trip but deducted no sales tax from the driver in the Greenwich trip. (Both trips were subject to the black-car surcharge, which applies regardless of destination.)The Uber official, in an interview on Tuesday, maintained that the tax was included in its fares and said the driver simply got a bonus on trips to Connecticut because the state assesses no tax on those trips.At least one of Uber\u2019s competitors in New York State, Lyft, appears to deduct the sales tax from drivers\u2019 earnings as well. A Lyft driver\u2019s receipt from July 24, 2016, depicts an overall fare of $16.34 and two deductions labeled \u201cRide Surcharge From Driver\u201d that precisely equal the black-car surcharge and the sales tax amounts.Lyft could be including the tax in the original fare it charges to passengers \u2014 there appears to be less evidence to contradict this claim than there is with Uber. A Lyft spokesman declined to comment on the issue.The New York attorney general\u2019s office and a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo did not respond to requests for comment on whether the practices of ride-hailing services on drivers\u2019 pay might violate state regulations.If a judge ruled on behalf of drivers in the complaint filed by the alliance, drivers could be awarded up to double the amount of the wage deductions, if the drivers were deemed to be employees rather than independent contractors. The judge could also award damages to drivers if Uber violated its own contract, which would not depend on their employee status.\u201cThey have an army of lawyers actively lobbying in Albany for the repeal of this specific tax,\u201d the Taxi Workers Alliance said in a statement. \u201cThat would imply a pretty intimate knowledge of the obligations of this tax.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But he conceded that only a catastrophe would lead to the adoption of his concept.\u201cEconomic collapse,\u201d he said, would demonstrate to people that elected politicians \u201caren\u2019t competent enough to get us out of these problems, and they will look to possible solutions.\u201dRobert Murphy, an associate scholar at the Mises Institute, which promotes the teaching of Austrian economics, wrote in 2010 that idealists like Mr. Fresco were \u201cwrong to blame our current dysfunctional world on capitalism or money per se.\u201d Instead, Mr. Murphy wrote, if property rights were respected by all, \u201chumanity would become fantastically wealthy.\u201dMr. Fresco\u2019s abiding faith in computers led him to say that they would someday run nearly everything, including government.\u201cComputers don\u2019t have ambition,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t say, \u2018I want to control people.\u2019 They don\u2019t have gut instincts.\u201dJacque Fresco was born in Brooklyn on March 13, 1916, to Isaac Fresco, a horticulturalist, and the former Lena Friedlich, a homemaker. His parents wanted him to be a sign painter, like his uncle, but he was devoted to studying mathematics, conducting science experiments in the family bathroom and building advanced models of ships and aircraft. At 13, he designed a fan with rubber or fabric blades after a relative was hurt when he stuck his hand into a metal fan.He did not like attending school and was often a truant. By his early teens, he was on his own.At some point, he said, he went to Florida, where he caught poisonous snakes in the Everglades and sold them to circuses. He never attended college and occasionally fretted in later years that his lack of academic credentials might have limited his impact.After hitchhiking to California, he started a career as an aircraft and architectural designer, research engineer, creator of rocket models for science-fiction films and designer of prefabricated aluminum homes that were displayed at the Warner Bros. studio. During World War II, he said, he served in the Army Air Forces\u2019 design and development unit at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio.He predicted in 1956 that there would be \u201csaucerlike\u201d space stations, elevators that moved horizontally as well as vertically and, presciently, driverless cars.Cars, he said, would have \u201cproximity control\u201d that would render collisions \u201cimpossible.\u201dMr. Fresco had been thinking of a planned city, like the one laid out in Project Venus, since at least the 1950s. His work on it intensified after he moved to Florida, where he sketched out \u201cProject Americana,\u201d a scheme in which \u201csensitive machines\u201d would react to the environment to cool and clean the city, direct traffic and close floodgates, he told Florida Living magazine in 1961.For the Venus Project, he and Ms. Meadows built 10 steel and concrete structures on their compound, half of them domed, using processes that would be models for the architecture of the project\u2019s proposed cities. Inside one dome, Mr. Fresco\u2019s workshop was filled with hundreds of models and renderings of futuristic houses, apartment buildings, helicopters and cars.Ms. Meadows, the co-founder of the Venus Project, said that Mr. Fresco understood how improbable it would be for his vision to be adopted.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t na\u00efve,\u201d she said Wednesday in a telephone interview. \u201cBut I think people are na\u00efve to think that the current system would work for the betterment of people. We\u2019re heading toward annihilation in many areas.\u201dAnd, she added, \u201che came up with many positive solutions for the future.\u201dMs. Meadows is Mr. Fresco\u2019s only survivor. His two marriages ended in divorce, and his son, Richard, and daughter, Bambi, are dead.Mr. Fresco, who believed fervently in science\u2019s power to transform life for the better, said on Facebook: \u201cWe have the technology to build a global paradise on earth, and at the same time we have the power to end life as we know it. I am a futurist. I cannot predict the actual future \u2014 only what it can be if we manage the earth and its resources intelligently.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Almost 188,000 party members were eligible to take part in the Socialist primary.Despite his unexpectedly clear-cut victory, Mr. S\u00e1nchez faces an uphill struggle to revive a party that he led to two successive election defeats in which the Socialists received their lowest percentage of votes ever.Mr. S\u00e1nchez, 45, returns to front-line politics at the helm of a party that has also lost voters to Podemos, a far-left party. The Socialists have been operating under a caretaker management team since Oct. 1, when Mr. S\u00e1nchez was removed after an internal party revolt led by other senior party members.After his ouster as party leader, Mr. S\u00e1nchez also gave up his seat as a member of Parliament. But he then began a campaign to win back his party leadership, calling on grass-roots party members to unite around him against the party establishment, which he blamed for engineering his ouster.Sunday\u2019s election was an unexpected setback for Ms. D\u00edaz, who in 2013 became the first woman to take charge of the Socialists in Andalusia, Spain\u2019s largest region and a Socialist fief. Her candidacy had the backing of most of the Socialist Party apparatus, including Spain\u2019s two former Socialist prime ministers, Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez and Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero. However, Mr. S\u00e1nchez successfully portrayed her as the establishment candidate, out of tune with ordinary party members. The primary also showed that Ms. D\u00edaz was unable to turn her regional popularity in Andalusia, where she won again on Sunday, into a national candidacy, as she lost instead by a wide margin in other key regions, like Catalonia.After her defeat, Ms. D\u00edaz said at a news conference, \u201cWe will be available for what the Socialist Party needs of us.\u201dMr. S\u00e1nchez was first elected Socialist leader in 2014 as a relatively unknown candidate, but one seen as capable of rejuvenating the party. On Sunday, he talked about a new start for the Socialists, after the feuding and the election loss of last year. \u201cWe will construct the new Socialist Party to regenerate and change Spain,\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez told party members after his victory.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next Front in the U.S. Fight Against ISIS", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorEgypt and Libya, in particular, could represent tipping points for the Islamic State and its global presence. In Egypt, the group appears to be employing the sectarian playbook used by its predecessor, Al Qaeda, in Iraq. An uptick in attacks against Christian minorities in Egypt, including twin bombing attacks on Coptic churches on Palm Sunday, mirror the Qaeda group\u2019s campaign of terrorism against Shiite communities in Baghdad that was intended to intimidate locals and bolster its own recruiting.The United States should be especially concerned about a repeat of this approach in Egypt, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country, which is already on edge thanks to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s strongman tactics against journalists, political opponents and human rights groups. For the past few years, the United States\u2019 approach has been to provide carefully calibrated security cooperation while clearly condemning Mr. Sisi\u2019s authoritarian actions. For example, the Obama administration supported Egypt\u2019s fight against insurgents in the strategically vital Sinai region, yet withheld certain military sales and was outspoken about America\u2019s concerns over Egypt\u2019s human rights record.Arguably, this balance wasn\u2019t perfect; perhaps it might have been more effective to couple the condemnation for Mr. Sisi\u2019s increasing authoritarianism with even greater counterterrorism assistance. In any case, American silence about the Sisi administration\u2019s human rights record is not the answer. After all, Al Qaeda traces its roots to Cairo\u2019s prisons under Egypt\u2019s earlier repressive regimes.The Islamic State is losing in Iraq and Syria, but if the United States hopes to cement that success and deal the group a lasting defeat, we must engage now with America\u2019s key partners in North Africa. Otherwise, the conditions will be set for a deadly resurgence of the group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Francesco Totti Leaves the Field, and Romans Weep for a Living Monument", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 The first half of Francesco Totti\u2019s last ever game in an A.S. Roma soccer jersey ended, and the fans at the Roma Club spilled onto the street in a sour mood.\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day,\u201d said Luigi Carinci, 65, who had sat in the front row in Testaccio, the neighborhood that is the club\u2019s spiritual home, and dabbed his eyes whenever the screen showed Totti stretching his legs or sipping water on the bench. \u201cRome is a mess. The bus never comes, they don\u2019t pick up the garbage and the cops do nothing. Now Totti\u2019s leaving. It\u2019s the last thing we need.\u201dThe past decade or so has not been kind to Rome. Garbage piles up in the piazzas. The parks look like littered Iowa cornfields. The city\u2019s sputtering economy hemorrhages jobs, and the mayor\u2019s name has become a national byword for urban disaster.But at least it had Totti.The Golden Child. The Phenomenon. The Captain. The Legend. The greatest player who ever wore the Roma jersey, and one who grew up not far from the Colosseum, as a die-hard fan. He refused to leave Rome \u2014 the team or the city \u2014 no matter how much money bigger clubs threw at him. Fans, including some supporters of the rival Roman club, Lazio, called him \u201cthe symbol of Rome,\u201d \u201cthe emblem of Rome,\u201d \u201cRome.\u201d\u201cRome is a city of symbols, the pope, the Colosseum. And Totti is part of this,\u201d said Maurizio Crosetti, a sportswriter for La Repubblica, who considered Totti essential for beleaguered Romans who struggled to tell a good story about themselves. \u201cHe was something not to be ashamed of.\u201dAnd so Romans, both fans and citizens, took his departure especially hard.\u201cToday it\u2019s hard to live in Rome,\u201d said Giulio Lucarelli, whose Core de Roma restaurant, on Totti\u2019s childhood street, is essentially a shrine to the \u201cyellow and red,\u201d as the Roma team is often called because of its colors. \u201cThe image of Rome has yellowed from the vivid yellow and red of the glory days.\u201dTotti\u2019s career spanned more than 25 years. He first caught the notice of soccer aficionados at age 12 as a junior player on Roma\u2019s youth teams. He broke into the first team in 1993 at age 16, dazzling the city with his skill and imagination.And then, in 2001, he visited a miracle upon the city. With Rome already spick and span after preparations for the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s Jubilee year celebrations in 2000, Totti led his club to a long elusive national championship.The city basically lost its collective mind.Totti, disguised in a bandanna and red and yellow face paint, went with Mr. Lucarelli to parties in Testaccio and at the Circus Maximus, where a million people showed up and a famous actress, in attendance at Totti\u2019s last game, performed a strip tease.\u201cRome was a more joyous city. There was enthusiasm, fun. Now it is darker, melancholy,\u201d said Alessandro Vocalelli, the editor of Corriere dello Sport. \u201cNow that Totti stops playing, many people will feel a little older, suddenly grown up.\u201dAged 40 and weathered, with a famous showgirl wife and three children, Totti had found his role diminished this season: He was usually playing as a substitute. The team\u2019s management had decided his time had come.The holder of so many records wasn\u2019t happy about it, and he made sure, with a sour Facebook post, that everyone knew he was being forced out. Mostly, however, he handled the situation with grace and humility. The papers speculated that he might move to another club in the United States or Asia, but never in Italy.\u201cWe\u2019d kill him,\u201d said Lorenzo Ciliberti, 23, who wore a No. 10 Totti jersey as he stood in a circle drinking beers in Piazza Vittorio, now overrun with homeless men and vagabonds, some of whom used its palm trees as toilets.Crimson Totti jerseys were everywhere on the afternoon of the game, as fans sidestepped pizza crusts and broken beer bottles to make pilgrimages to a 2001-vintage mural of the player pointing to the sky. They marched across the Circus Maximus, now only partly mowed, like a half shaven face.As game time approached, Sergio Rosi, 80, opened the gates of the Roma Club in Testaccio. The walls were covered in pictures of the club and of Totti through the ages. Here he was raising trophies, posing for the national team, getting married.\u201cWe Romans are all in mourning,\u201d Mr. Rosi said, pausing to yell \u201cForza Roma!\u201d (\u201cLet\u2019s go, Roma!\u201d) at the people yelling \u201cForza Roma!\u201d to him. The state of the city, he said, had made the loss that much more bitter. \u201cFor two months they didn\u2019t clean this street,\u201d he said. \u201cThe filthy animals!\u201dThe game started, with Totti on the bench. Roma, in the hunt for the second-place slot, gave up an early goal to lowly Genoa. The screen showed Totti\u2019s anguished face. Mr. Carinci dabbed his eyes in the front row.The second half started and \u2014 to some surprise, and applause \u2014 Totti entered not long after the break. Roma soon scored a go-ahead goal and Mr. Rosi rose to blast a deafening siren and pump his fists.The club members then waved disgustedly at the screen and Totti shook his head on the field after Genoa tied the match at 2-2. Then Roma scored the winning goal. With only minutes left, Totti kept control of the ball, eating up the clock by kicking the ball off the shins of his opponents and out of bounds.\u201cHe\u2019s a maestro at this,\u201d the television commentator said.After the game, Totti took a victory lap around the stadium accompanied by his wife and children, including his son, Cristian, 11, who many hope might carry his father\u2019s torch.As the theme from \u201cGladiator\u201d gave way to Elton John\u2019s \u201cCircle of Life,\u201d Totti started weeping. Bawling. So did the members of the Roma Club, old and young, men and women. They sang the chorus of the team song \u2014 \u201cRoma Roma Roma\u201d \u2014 and wept. They held their children and wept. They screamed \u201cmortacci loro\u201d and wept. One man, wearing a \u201cThere\u2019s Only One Captain\u201d shirt, wrote his son at the stadium and asked for an update.\u201cWeeping,\u201d his son\u2019s reply read.As Totti read out a letter (\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to switch off the light. Now I am afraid.\u201d) the faces of thousands of fans contorted with tearful anguish. In the club, Mr. Rosi started pouring white wine with an A.S. Roma label. \u201cI feel awful, awful,\u201d he said, from behind a small plaque that referred to Totti as the \u201cKing of Rome.\u201d \u201cNow we will realize it. That he is gone.\u201dBut not just yet. A couple of hours later, Totti and his family arrived at La Villetta, a favorite restaurant. There was a barrage of kisses from loved ones, several of whom said they had spent the game in tears.As homeless men made their beds on the sidewalk in front of Totti\u2019s old haunt, a handful of fans in No. 10 jerseys peered through the windows. Like them, Totti still wore shorts, but he had traded in his jersey for a red polo shirt.slide showAdvertisement"}

But Will He Relinquish Power?", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byLUANDA, Angola \u2014 A billboard in the heart of Angola\u2019s capital, Luanda, reads like a warning to any challengers, reminding everyone of the tremendous share of votes won by President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos in his party\u2019s leadership race last year: 99.6 percent.As Africa\u2019s second-longest-serving head of state, with nearly 38 years in power, Mr. dos Santos appeared to be a member of the continent\u2019s club of lifetime leaders. His grip only tightening with age, it seemed that this legendary survivor would surely die in office.The president\u2019s family and close allies have amassed great fortunes, controlling a nation that is Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer. Giving up the presidency could put all that at risk.But as campaigning started recently for Angola\u2019s coming elections, something surprising happened: Mr. dos Santos, 74, whose face appears on the country\u2019s currency and every citizens\u2019 national identity card, was not running.Instead, his handpicked successor, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, the defense minister popularly known as \u201cJLo,\u201d rallied supporters at a mass gathering in the capital.Mr. dos Santos may be the \u201cforce of the present,\u201d he said. Yet \u201cI am seeing a citizen, wearing a red tie,\u201d Mr. Lourenco said of himself, \u201cwho with your support is going to be the force of the future.\u201dSuch words would have been unutterable just a few months ago in Angola. But now, in a rare moment for Africa, a strongman whose image has become inseparable from his country\u2019s and whose tenure has spanned generations, says he is going to step down \u2014 voluntarily.For many Angolans, an Angola without Mr. dos Santos at the top is hard to imagine.\u201cOur president is omnipresent,\u201d said Luaty Beir\u00e3o, 35, a rapper and critic of the government who, like most Angolans, was born after Mr. dos Santos became president. \u201cHe\u2019s on our money. He\u2019s on our IDs. He\u2019s in our heads. He\u2019s everywhere.\u201dLopo do Nascimento, who served as a prime minister and secretary general of the president\u2019s party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or M.P.L.A., said that with Angola at peace for more than a decade, the time was right for a transition and that it would go \u201csmoothly.\u201dBut as the end of the dos Santos era looms, many are wondering how complete that transition will be. Why has Mr. dos Santos, whose control over all levers of government is regarded as nearly absolute, decided to step down as president but not as party leader?Mr. dos Santos assumed office in 1979, Angola\u2019s second president after independence from Portugal in 1975. After the end of Angola\u2019s nearly three-decade civil war in 2002, he presided over an extended oil boom that turned the country into one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing economies.But in recent years talk spread among Angola\u2019s political class that Mr. dos Santos was looking to leave office for health reasons. In the same period, he moved to consolidate his present \u2014 and perhaps future \u2014 power base.\u201cLook at what has been happening, subterraneanly, in Angola\u2019s political economy,\u201d Mr. Soares said. He added that the president \u201chas spent the last three years seriously building up the infrastructural power of his family.\u201dInitially, Mr. dos Santos pushed to have his eldest son succeed him as president, M.P.L.A officials said.\u201cBut opposition from inside the M.P.L.A forced him to back down,\u201d said Marcolino Moco, who served as Mr. dos Santos\u2019s prime minister in the 1990s but is now critical of the government. \u201cThere are many people in the party with a lot of experience.\u201dMr. Louren\u00e7o \u2014 a party veteran who enjoys strong ties to the military and, unlike some of his peers, is not especially known for his wealth \u2014 was the compromise candidate. He is widely expected to be the next president, given his party\u2019s dominance.\u201cHe will continue to represent the same group that shares the same fundamental interests, people who fear an open democracy and won\u2019t let control over the media and the wealth slip away,\u201d Mr. Moco said.Though Mr. dos Santos has faced no threat to his rule since the end of the civil war, his government has shown no tolerance for public protests.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to put more than 30 people out on the streets,\u201d Mr. Beir\u00e3o said. \u201cSo, normally, people with so much power shouldn\u2019t be concerned about us. Why bother? I think they\u2019re afraid that if they let us, we will quickly pass from 30 to 3,000. I think they\u2019re very, very nervous.\u201dTensions could also emerge between Mr. dos Santos and Mr. Louren\u00e7o, experts said. The fate of Mr. dos Santos\u2019s children could provide one of the first indications.The state oil company has long functioned as a parallel state under the direct control of the president. If Ms. dos Santos remains at the helm of Sonangol after her father\u2019s retirement, Angola will have two centers of power.\u201cJLo, whatever power he has, will be forced to take her down by the public opinion,\u201d Abel Chivukuvuku, an opposition politician, said of the president\u2019s daughter. \u201cIf he allows her to stay on, then people will believe he is not really the president.\u201dFor now, Mr. dos Santos and Mr. Lourenco are projecting unity. Billboards showing both men, some separately, others together, have been planted throughout Luanda.More than a decade ago, Mr. dos Santos announced that he would retire from politics. He quickly changed his mind, though only after gauging reaction to the announcement to flush out potential rivals.This time, with campaigning already taking place and the Aug. 23 election just months away, Mr. dos Santos seems unlikely to reverse himself.But some were hedging their bets.Asked to assess Mr. dos Santos\u2019s nearly four decades in power, Mr. Nascimento, the former prime minister, smiled and said, \u201cI think this should be discussed when he goes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Doing so \u201cwould be counterproductive at this moment, and would not serve the objective of achieving visa-free travel for all E.U. citizens,\u201d it said.The commission added, \u201cOn the contrary, it would immediately result in retaliatory measures by the U.S., leading to the visa requirement being imposed on all E.U. citizens.\u201dDimitris Avramopoulos, the commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, said that inflaming the dispute would not help because the union was making progress on visa issues through diplomacy. He noted that Canada had agreed to stop requiring Bulgarian and Romanian visitors to obtain visas as of Dec. 1.\u201cOur continued engagement and patient diplomatic contacts over the past year have brought tangible results already with Canada, and we are committed to proceeding in the same way with the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Avramopoulos said in a statement. He added, \u201cWe are on the right track.\u201dThe commission said it would report to the Parliament again on the matter by the end of the year.European impatience with the American visa policy has been building for years. The commission considered proposals a year ago to end visa-free entry for Americans and Canadians, but it concluded then that doing so would \u201chave significant negative impacts in a wide range of policy areas, notably on external relations, trade, tourism and the E.U.\u2019s economy.\u201dThe commission said on Tuesday that in recent months, \u201cpolitical and technical contacts have been stepped up\u201d with the new American administration. Mr. Avramopoulos said he had discussed the matter with the Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, in Washington on Feb. 8.

That has often led to claims by tech executives that the region has an anti-American bias, accusations that European policy makers deny.Facebook, experts say, is only the latest in a long line of Silicon Valley companies to face European regulatory anger, though this time, the focus is likely to be on the reams of online data gathered, including information that Facebook collects on both its users and nonusers through third-party websites.While Facebook started in the United States and has expanded aggressively across the developing world, its actions in Europe \u2014 and the response to those acts by local officials \u2014 are likely to have implications on its global operations.The company\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin. Though that is mostly for tax purposes, it gives European data protection and antitrust officials wide scope to monitor and police Facebook activities involving its more than 1.5 billion users outside North America.In the past, for instance, Facebook has been forced to alter its privacy settings for all of its users worldwide after European privacy campaigners brought legal challenges to how the social network collected and used people\u2019s data.The changes come as policy makers worldwide vie for influence over how people use digital services, including potentially putting limits on how companies like Facebook operate so as to exert some control over the internet.\u201cIt was inevitable that there would be this type of struggle,\u201d Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, said in an interview last year. \u201cThe internet is not used to national borders.\u201dAfter Facebook announced last year that it would use WhatsApp data to bolster its wider advertising business, American privacy campaigners filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, putting forward similar arguments to those made against the partnership in Europe.\u201cU.S. antitrust law has failed to keep up with the digital economy and the emergence of monopoly services,\u201d Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said in an email. \u201cThere is far too much \u2018lock in\u2019 with a dominant provider, and far too much consolidation of personal data.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Movies that operate on yearslong production schedules also wouldn\u2019t feel much immediate pain.But television programs that rely on a regular diet of fresh writing could be forced to air reruns.

Citibank won a contract from Bank of China to handle a complex $3 billion bond offering last month to raise money for opening branches across Asia, Eastern Europe and East Africa. The technology and manufacturing company Honeywell International is selling equipment to Central Asia for processing natural gas.Some non-Chinese companies are also tweaking their businesses to win more orders related to Beijing\u2019s plan, and G.E. has rearranged its marketing staff for global power equipment to give them priority.China\u2019s spending doesn\u2019t necessarily mean immediate profit. Most of the money has yet to be earmarked, much less spent. And China \u2014 which has too many factories making too much steel and cement \u2014 is making sure that its own companies will be the biggest beneficiaries.Companies like Caterpillar, for example, will have to contend with a fast-growing, government-controlled Chinese maker of construction machinery, the Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, known as X.C.M.G. Such businesses, facing a maturing market at home, are eager to find new markets \u2014 a core ambition of the plan.At one of X.C.M.G.\u2019s cavernous factories here in north-central China, workers are rushing to double the number of excavators that can be made each year, mainly by adding robots to the assembly process. The initiative has the factory humming 16 hours a day, six days a week.\u201c\u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 makes our internationalization strategy like a tiger with wings added,\u201d said Wang Min, X.C.M.G.\u2019s chairman.For businesses, the plan offers uncertainty as well as promise. The infrastructure that China is building could someday become the avenues for billions of dollars in increased trade \u2014 or become debt-ridden sinkholes. Mr. Xi is pressuring companies already doing business in China to participate no matter what the prospects.The hope of future prosperity is enticing. Li and Fung, a Hong Kong company that for decades has sent Chinese-made goods to American and European department stores, is now marketing to small and medium-size retailers in the developing world. It is a bet that the Chinese initiative will lift consumer spending across dozens of countries, said Victor Fung, chairman of the Fung Group, its parent company.Others are waiting to see whether China\u2019s ambitious idea translates into actual investment \u2014 and whether American and European companies will have a place at the table. They are particularly troubled that the program seems to be mostly about Chinese exports, and not much about imports.\u201cTell us what we are going to get out of this,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing who is a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, referring to the West. \u201cIt\u2019s a nonstarter if it\u2019s all about bringing Chinese goods to Europe, or if it\u2019s all one way.\u201dA top official in the Trump administration, Matthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, said at Sunday\u2019s conference that China should provide transparency in the bidding for contracts related to the initiative, to give a better chance to companies that aren\u2019t state-owned.China\u2019s industrial overcapacity is a big motivator behind the plan. China can make nearly 1.1 billion tons of steel a year, as much as the rest of the world put together, but has domestic demand for only about 800 million tons. The initiative might absorb only about 30 million tons a year, according to a recent study by the European Union Chamber of Commerce.Some American companies are taking steps to improve their chances \u2014 but that sometimes means manufacturing more in China, not the United States. Ms. Duan said G.E. had focused on ways to produce goods in China to meet the country\u2019s requirements that some of the work be done locally. Honeywell said in a statement that it had also been looking for ways to produce more goods in China for the program.Others are waiting and watching. Investments have been heavily concentrated in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other nearby countries that are geopolitical priorities for China but that have weak economies.Vincent Lo, a real estate billionaire who is the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, led a team of 50 Shanghai and Hong Kong businesspeople to Thailand and Vietnam last week to explore investments based on the Chinese initiative, he said. Trips to the Mideast and Eastern Europe may be next. Central Asia is far down his list.\u201cIf Central Asian countries are keen, we will work with them, but of course we\u2019ll have to look at the financial fundamentals,\u201d Mr. Lo said. \u201cA lot of these countries will have to do a lot of reforms to be able to receive capital.\u201dChinese players look to be big winners from the outset.Mr. Xi has designated the city of Xuzhou \u2014 a dusty rail hub roughly halfway along the five-hour bullet train trip between Beijing and Shanghai \u2014 as a key manufacturing base for his policy. At the foot of a hill here topped by a new complex of Buddhist temples, Caterpillar has one of the world\u2019s biggest construction machinery factories, making huge pieces of digging equipment.Nearby, its local rival X.C.M.G. is ramping up. Employing 23,000 workers in this city and controlled by the Xuzhou municipal government, X.C.M.G. is China\u2019s largest manufacturer of construction machinery, from excavators to cranes to bulldozers.The factory makes tank-size excavators in a series of four halls with 80-foot-high steel roofs. Almost everything inside is new, from the 13 steel-cutting robots the size of cottages to the costly Italian and Japanese machining equipment that precisely trim steel components.Mr. Wang, X.C.M.G.\u2019s chairman, dismissed concerns that the business won\u2019t materialize.\u201cWe should be persistent and manage our business as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the spring comes, we will arise abruptly.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Subway Riders Fume, City and State Leaders Are Mostly Mum", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byThrough this list of recent woes, the person most responsible for ensuring that the trains run on time, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, has remained mostly silent as subway service gets worse by the day.\u201cGovernor Cuomo shows up to open the Second Avenue subway, but he\u2019s missing in action for the day-to-day disaster that transit riders are experiencing,\u201d John Raskin, the executive director of Riders Alliance, an advocacy group, said after the last major disruption.\u201cI never know if I am going to get to anything on time,\u201d said Frank Leone, 31, who lives in Queens. Worsening subway service has made him rethink living in New York City. \u201cI give myself an hour to get to work everyday, even though it only takes 35 minutes,\u201d he said, \u201cand I still show up late to work.\u201dYet Mr. Cuomo often gets a pass: Many riders \u2014 even some who work in city government \u2014 mistakenly direct their anger at Mayor Bill de Blasio, believing the city\u2019s leader would naturally be in charge of its subway. Mr. de Blasio, also a Democrat, has been quick to disabuse them whenever the subject comes up and has also had little to say about the constant drumbeat of subway meltdowns.\u201cThe M.T.A. is run by the State of New York, not the City of New York,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said when asked directly about subway delays in a radio interview Thursday. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to do all we can to push the state to invest in the subway system.\u201dChronic problems with the state-run transit system have prompted some elected officials to wonder whether nearly six million daily riders would, in fact, be better off if the mayor took over.\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to have a move to put it under the mayor\u2019s control,\u201d said Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president who has fumed over the subway chaos. \u201cBecause it is in the city, we should have someone who is directly responsible.\u201dFrustrated commuters are left to wonder why Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio are not addressing their pain. It offers a stark contrast to how they respond when the news is good. In the days before the opening of the Second Avenue subway, Mr. Cuomo sent out a blizzard of news releases and regularly appeared before cameras to herald the line as an example of the big things government can do.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Mr. Cuomo had helped to secure the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s largest capital improvement plan after years of underinvestment. (The de Blasio administration also pointed to its $2.5 billion commitment to the capital plan.)\u201cStill, the constant service disruptions are entirely unacceptable, so in the short term, he has tasked the M.T.A. with developing a plan to address the root causes of the subway delays plaguing its customers,\u201d Ms. Lever said in a statement.On Monday, the authority announced a $20 million plan to target frequent causes of delays, including overcrowding and signal problems. The first phase, which focuses on the Eighth Avenue lines in Manhattan, includes directing riders to painted zones at less busy locations on platforms and responding to incidents on the tracks more quickly.The authority\u2019s interim executive director, Veronique Hakim, said in an interview that the agency was committed to improving subway service.\u201cWe feel it,\u201d she said of the growing frustration. \u201cWe know it. We understand it.\u201dMr. de Blasio has been wary of publicly delving into the subway\u2019s current woes, City Hall officials said, to avoid provoking Mr. Cuomo and endangering transportation issues that the city and state are working on together, such as select bus service and preparations for the temporary closure of the L train.\u201cNew Yorkers deserve a subway system that works, not more talk,\u201d said Austin Finan, a spokesman for the mayor.Yet, with subway service so dire, many agree it is time for Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo to step up, put aside their long-running animosity and work together.\u201cThey\u2019re letting this disagreement, this feud, have a deleterious effect on the state and the city, and that\u2019s scary,\u201d said David R. Jones, a member of the authority\u2019s board nominated by Mr. de Blasio. \u201cI don\u2019t mean this should be a kumbaya moment, but they should really get together and come up with a common approach about improving the M.T.A.\u201dThat is what happened in the late 1970s and 1980s, when Mayor Edward I. Koch famously rode the subways to ask \u201cHow\u2019m I doin\u2019?\u201d and waged a public campaign against subway graffiti. But Mr. Koch had a friend in Gov. Hugh L. Carey during the first part of his mayoralty; the two men served together in Congress and, before that, in Europe during World War II.Richard Ravitch, the former M.T.A. chairman credited with turning the subway around in the 1980s, said Mr. Koch helped him improve the system. Though Mr. Koch let Mr. Ravitch take the blame for fare increases, the mayor worked behind the scenes to gain support for the subway, he said.\u201cEd Koch did whatever I asked him to do,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said in an interview.Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also worked with the state to merge the transit police \u2014 a separate state agency \u2014 with the New York Police Department, whose officers now patrol the subways. \u201cIt required the mayor to work with the governor who he didn\u2019t endorse,\u201d said Joseph J. Lhota, a deputy mayor at the time and, later, the chairman of the transportation authority.Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio declined requests for interviews. The governor\u2019s office would not say the last time he rode the subway, though Ms. Lever noted that Mr. Cuomo does not live in New York City; Mr. de Blasio\u2019s office said he last rode it a little over three weeks ago, after a news conference near Grand Central Terminal. Both are facing re-election \u2014 Mr. de Blasio in November; Mr. Cuomo next year \u2014 without serious challengers on the horizon.The politics behind the transportation authority, which controls the city\u2019s subway, buses and commuter railroads, are also complicated. Mr. Cuomo appoints its chief executive and board chairman, and he has taken an increasingly hands-on role at the agency. The mayor nominated three of the 19 members on the current board.\u201cHe\u2019s turned his attention to some cosmetic changes, which don\u2019t impact the day-to-day commute,\u201d Ms. Vanterpool said, \u201cand don\u2019t relieve a lot of the day-to-day frustration.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Advisers Wage Tug of War Before Decision on Climate Deal", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A divided White House staff, anxious corporate executives, lawmakers and foreign leaders are fiercely competing for President Trump\u2019s ear this week as he nears a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, the landmark agreement that commits nearly every country to combat global warming.For a president not steeped in policy intricacies, the decision is vexing. On both sides are voices he profoundly respects: chief executives of some of the world\u2019s largest companies urging him to remain part of the accord and ardent conservatives like Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, and Scott Pruitt, his Environmental Protection Agency administrator, tugging him toward a withdrawal from the 195-country agreement.Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive, Darren W. Woods, wrote recently that remaining in the agreement would be prudent, part of a nearly united corporate front. Within the administration, Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council; the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump; and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, say the United States can remain a party to the accord even as the administration moves to eviscerate the Obama-era climate policies that would have allowed the United States to meet its pollution-reduction targets under the agreement.In a major climate speech Tuesday, the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, exhorted world leaders to stick to their commitments to the accord, calling for \u201cincreased ambition\u201d in the face of threats to disengage.But the voices calling for a clean break from Paris are no less urgent, tugging at the president\u2019s gut-level instincts by arguing that remaining a party to the agreement would shackle the American economy and betray his core supporters.As President Trump decides whether to stay or leave the international climate agreement, political and corporate leaders on both sides of the debate are lobbying him fiercely.\u201cHe wants a fair deal for the American people,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe will have an announcement on that shortly.\u201dMr. Trump has given few public indications of his thinking. Inside the West Wing, advisers have believed for weeks that the president was inclined to do what he promised during the campaign: In rallies, he repeatedly vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d what he called the job-killing agreement.Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter, however, has spent the past several weeks making sure that her father has heard from both sides, according to an administration official familiar with her efforts.Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser in the White House, also favors staying as long as doing so does not legally limit the steps Mr. Trump is taking to move away from the restrictive environmental standards President Barack Obama put in place.On the other side, Mr. Bannon has been one of the most aggressive advisers lobbying the president to pull out of the agreement. Since the administration is already moving quickly to reverse the policies implemented to comply with the accord, staying in would be pointless, he argues, but would risk costing the president support from his core supporters.Meanwhile, advice is pouring in from outside the White House \u2014 much of it unsolicited.On Capitol Hill, 22 Republican senators signed a letter urging the president to abandon the agreement. Staying in \u201cwould subject the United States to significant litigation risk that could upend your administration\u2019s ability to fulfill its goal of rescinding the Clean Power Plan,\u201d they wrote.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, chided his colleagues from his party, saying on CNN that pulling out of the Paris accord would amount to \u201ca statement that climate change is not a problem, is not real.\u201dDemocratic senators took to Twitter \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite communication medium \u2014 over the weekend to make their case.Mr. Woods, the Exxon Mobil chief executive, wrote to Mr. Trump this month after the two men spoke by phone about investments that the company was planning in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a company spokesman, Alan Jeffers. As disagreement over whether to withdraw appeared to intensify, Mr. Woods wanted to communicate his stance directly.\u201cBy remaining a party to the Paris Agreement, the United States will maintain a seat at the negotiating table to ensure a level playing field so that all energy sources and technologies are treated equitably in an open, transparent and competitive global market so as to achieve economic growth and poverty reduction at the lowest cost to society,\u201d Mr. Woods wrote.He included an earlier letter that the company had sent expressing support for the agreement to George David Banks, the special assistant to the president for international energy and environment, who had asked the company to share its views.Environmentally oriented groups like Ceres, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions have brought together big companies like Apple, Ingersoll Rand, Mars, National Grid and Schneider Electric to appeal to the president to stay in. Many of them operate globally and worry that if the United States abandons the deal, it would be harder to operate in existing markets and break into new ones.\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing \u2014 we finally had a workable framework,\u201d said Stephen Harper, global director of environment, energy and sustainability policy for Intel, who has attended several of the global climate meetings. \u201cMore than half of our market is outside the United States \u2014 our biggest market right now is China.\u201dTom Werner, the chief executive of SunPower, a solar panel maker, sent letters to Mr. Trump and other administration officials arguing that companies have already made plans based on the Paris standards.\u201cIt was important to speak up,\u201d he said.President Emmanuel Macron of France told reporters that he urged Mr. Trump not to make a \u201chasty decision.\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany called her discussions with the president \u201cvery difficult, if not to say very dissatisfying.\u201dThe global pressure campaign continued on Tuesday with the speech by Mr. Guterres at New York University. While not specifically mentioning Mr. Trump in his speech, the secretary general of the United Nations referred to \u201cthose who might hold divergent perspectives\u201d as he called for all countries to fulfill the promises they made. After the speech, in answer to a question from the audience, Mr. Guterres said he hoped that the United States would stick to the deal, or that American businesses would if the government did not.\u201cIt is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement \u2014 and that we fulfill that duty with increased ambition,\u201d Mr. Guterres said. \u201cThe real danger is not the threat to one\u2019s economy that comes from acting. It is, instead, the risk to one\u2019s economy by failing to act.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision may be influenced by voices closer to home. Critics of the pact said they hoped Mr. Trump would think less about world leaders and more about his voters.\u201cThis is a huge deal to speak to the people who brung you to the dance,\u201d Mr. Norquist said. If Mr. Trump pulls out of the Paris Agreement, he said, the message is this: \u201cI kept my word.\u201dMichael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Diane Cardwell from New York.

{"Headline": "In China, Umbrellas and Basketballs Join the Sharing Economy", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China may be oversharing.Today, Chinese start-ups want to share umbrellas, concrete mixers and mobile phone power banks. One wants to share basketballs.As Chinese entrepreneurs and investors pile in, some skeptical industry insiders are wondering: Has China reached \u201cpeak sharing?\u201d\u201cAfter all these years, China is finally embracing its communist roots,\u201d said Andy Tian, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing. \u201cThat\u2019s the essence of communism: communal sharing.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s a bubble,\u201d he added. \u201cIt may have roots in something valuable, but can you really share everything?\u201dChinese entrepreneurs like Xu Min think that, quite possibly, you can. In March, the 30-year-old serial entrepreneur from Jiaxing, a town in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, came up with the idea of a basketball-sharing service after he heard some friends complain about the inconvenience of carrying a ball around.Just four days later, Mr. Xu set up Zhulegeqiu, which in Chinese is a pun that roughly means \u201cRent a Ball.\u201d It lets users rent basketballs from custom-designed automated lockers at basketball courts around the country. To rent a ball, users scan a code on the locker with their smartphone camera, unlocking a compartment holding a basketball.Zhulegeqiu charges users about one renminbi, or about 15 cents, per hour for rental. A deposit of about $10 is required unless the user has a high rating on Sesame Credit, the social credit scoring system developed by China\u2019s Ant Financial, an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.\u201cIn the long run, it may be more cost-effective to buy rather than rent a ball,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cBut we think Chinese users are willing to pay a little more for convenience.\u201dEarlier this month, Zhulegeqiu received around $1.4 million in venture investment from Modern Capital, a Shanghai-based venture capital firm.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of money bouncing around,\u201d said Zhou Wei, chief executive of XNode, a start-up accelerator and co-working space in Shanghai, \u201cand foolish investments being made.\u201dIn its latest iteration, the sharing economy in China has evolved into something like an internet-enabled rental business. Unlike Airbnb and Uber, which provide a platform that connects users to existing resources, the latest sharing companies in China own the product and rent it out to users.\u201cIn China, average incomes are still very low and the market in many ways is still very price-conscious,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of the technology research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cSo if the technology is there to support it and there\u2019s a viable business model, there are all sorts of sharing economy or pseudo-sharing economy businesses that can potentially do very well.\u201dThe Chinese government sees promise in sharing. It estimates sharing last year accounted for $500 billion in transactions, and projected it would account for 10 percent of China\u2019s economic output by 2020.All that drives ideas that may seem puzzling to others \u2014 including Shen Weiwei\u2019s umbrella-sharing business.Mr. Shen, an entrepreneur, acknowledges that it may be difficult for his start-up, a shared umbrella service called Molisan, to turn a profit. Molisan, which means \u201cMagic Umbrella,\u201d will reap only small profit margins charging one renminbi (15 cents) to rent an umbrella for 12 hours from one of Molisan\u2019s custom-designed kiosks, and customers could end up stealing them.But Mr. Shen said he was confident that others would see the public and environmental benefits of having an umbrella-sharing service. So far, Molisan has already reached agreements with both the Guangzhou and Fuzhou city subway companies to place kiosks there. The goal, he said, is to have an umbrella kiosk within a 100-meter range at all times.\u201cEveryone at home has a lot of umbrellas, but we never have them when we really need them,\u201d said Mr. Shen. \u201cIf we are successful, then users will no longer have to buy umbrellas.\u201dMany remain skeptical. \u201cSharing basketballs, sharing umbrellas \u2014 these are all bad ideas,\u201d said Allen Zhu, Shanghai-based managing director at GSR Ventures, which was an early investor in Didi Chuxing, the popular bike-sharing company Ofo and Xiaodian. \u201cThey\u2019re both very tied to a particular location, which makes it difficult for the company to expand.\u201dEntrepreneurs like Mr. Xu, of Zhulegeqiu, disagree, though they acknowledge challenges.For one, the company does not appear to have found a sustainable way to recover stolen balls. During initial testing, Mr. Xu said, one competitor stole a basketball to analyze it more closely.

Through acquisitions of other hotel companies, including Starwood Hotels & Resorts last year, and introductions of its own new hotel groups, Marriott International now manages 30 brands under its corporate umbrella.Hotel chains have expanded and diversified their offerings to capture more of the travel market. The proliferation of brands under one parent company is a byproduct of hotel company consolidation, the introduction of new brands and the creation of so-called soft brands that gather a group of similar independent hotels into a collection. Companies have aided in the expansion, in some cases, by licensing their names rather than owning each property.Travelers\u2019 needs vary over time \u2014 with travel for business and leisure, alone or with family, locally or internationally, and requiring a short stay or extended stay \u2014 and hotel companies want to capture them all. \u201cWe want a brand for each price point and each occasion,\u201d said Patrick Pacious, president and chief operating officer of Choice Hotels International. The company, known for economy and midrange brands like Comfort Suites and Econolodge, is expanding its Cambria upscale brand.Hotel company expansion and diversification is also a strategic defense against online travel services like Expedia and Airbnb, which offer thousands of varied listings in one place. Like such aggregators, more hotel companies can offer their own spectrum of listings, from a basic night\u2019s stay to a luxury resort.\u201cThe more hotels and choices we can offer, the more competitive we are,\u201d said Tina Edmundson, Marriott\u2019s global brand officer, \u201cand front and center is we want people to book directly with us.\u201d For the hotel companies, guests who book through the company website bring more revenue and opportunities for direct customer contact.Some hotel buildings now house multiple brands under one roof. Hotels near hospitals and military bases often have a mix of overnight and extended-stay guests, Mr. Pacious said. So within the same building, his company might have a Sleep Inn for short-term guests and a MainStay Suites for longer stays. The two sets of guest rooms would share a lobby, housekeeping services and back-office staff.Marriott, which has more than 50 dual-branded hotels, is building its first tri-branded hotel. The new building opening next year in Nashville will house an AC Hotel, a Residence Inn and a SpringHill Suites.But how many brands are too many? Each requires spending on signs, advertisements, websites, social media and customer research. And each brand needs to be nurtured to stay relevant. To revitalize the Comfort Inn brand, Mr. Pacious said that over the last few years, Choice International terminated contracts with 600 lower quality properties and invested $40 million to spruce up the rest, including updates like modern lobbies, flat-screen TVs and faster Wi-Fi. More than 50 additional Comfort Inns are planned or under construction.\u201cI\u2019m just looking for a safe hotel with free Wi-Fi and a comfortable bed and they\u2019re all pretty similar to me,\u201d said Margaret Sharp of Seattle, who travels in the Pacific Northwest and Canada as a technical writer and project manager. \u201cHoliday Inn Express, Candlewood Suites, SpringHill Suites \u2014 they all blend together.\u201dTo educate guests about a large family of brands, hotel websites will list similar hotels together and offer them grouped by travelers\u2019 needs. The distinction between some monikers, like \u201cluxury\u201d versus \u201cmodern essentials,\u201d or \u201cwellness\u201d versus \u201clifestyle,\u201d may be more obvious to some guests than others.\u201cIt is easy for customers to \u2018trade down,\u2019 when similar choices are listed together on a website,\u201d said Dave Reibstein, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.If they get the loyalty points in any case, he added, \u201cwhy not stay at the hotel that is $10 cheaper per night?\u201dAnd despite company efforts to give each brand a unique position, the tiers are not always clear-cut. Damon Igl, a technology-focused business consultant who has traveled extensively for his work, said that in some cases a newly built hotel with a lower-quality brand name may offer a much better experience than a more prestigious brand nearby in a poorly maintained, older building. \u201cIf I have a few choices in the area, I might look to see which opened most recently,\u201d he said.Managing brand reputations within a growing portfolio is another challenge, said Professor Reibstein, who has researched the topic. He said that associating a more luxurious hotel with a lower-scale brand dragged down the value of the more upscale name.\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll never see Marriott call its five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel chain \u2018Ritz by Marriott,\u201d he said.Professor Reibstein said he believed that some brands would be retired. \u201cIt makes sense to have a portfolio of brands to go after different segments,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you need one brand going after each segment, not two or three.\u201cRetiring brands, however, can be difficult. Because hotel companies now lease their names to operators, they have contractual obligations, among other reasons, to maintain existing brands.Marriott performs comprehensive \u201cbrand health\u201d studies, Ms. Edmundson said, and does consider retiring or combining brands. But, she added, \u201cthat bumps up against investment made in the brands, the contracts we have, and loyal guest followings.\u201dMr. Igl, a frequent Marriott guest, said he knew which of its brands have a kitchen, which offer larger rooms and what to expect on the free breakfast buffet from the brands that offer one.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be spending time in a new city and there\u2019s a Courtyard Marriott, Residence Inn, Fairfield Inn and a SpringHill Suites all nearby, I might stay in each of them once to see which I like the best,\u201d he said, \u201cand then book the rest of my stays there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Budget: The Math Is Phony but the Cruelty Isn\u2019t", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byPhony math is a time-honored tradition in the Washington world of budget making, but the first full fiscal plan from the Trump administration breaks new ground.The bottom line: A budget that the White House says will be in balance by 2027 would, in reality, remain deeply in red ink throughout the coming decade and ultimately add trillions of dollars to the national debt.Of course, as John Maynard Keynes wrote, in the long run, we are all dead. But this budget will also inflict enormous short-term damage. While the administration asserts that if the government would just get out of the way, business investment and worker productivity would rise substantially, I don\u2019t buy the argument. Indeed, the proposed enormous cuts to spending would make increasing efficiency harder, not easier.The impact of even more staggering reductions in social welfare spending will hurt millions of needy Americans, perhaps many of the same voters who elected President Trump, as the wealthy receive a vast preponderance of the benefits from a proposed $5.5 trillion in tax reductions (none of which is accounted for in the proposal).All in all, the Office of Management and Budget has bestowed upon us 62 pages of fantasy. Let\u2019s take, for example, the White House\u2019s insistence that the economic-growth forecast of 2.2 percent a year that the O.M.B. had been using can be turbocharged by nearly a full percentage point to 3 percent by 2021.That indeed would be wonderful, but every mainstream economist I know says it ain\u2019t going to happen. For example, the Congressional Budget Office, the legislative branch\u2019s scorekeeper and \u2014 despite what you might have heard \u2014 an honest broker, projects annual growth of 1.9 percent.The implications of falling short of the new 3 percent target are profound. At the lower 2.2 percent rate of increase, the cumulative budget deficit over the next 10 years would be $2.1 trillion higher than the $3.2 trillion that the administration projects.We are mired in low growth because of two simple factors: smaller increases in the labor force and softening improvements in the efficiency of our workers.Increases in the size of our labor force have slowed as our society has aged. The only sure way to reverse that trend would be to allow more \u2014 not less \u2014 immigration. But that runs up against another part of the Trump agenda.Productivity is more mysterious; its ebbs and flows have always been hard for economists to explain. That makes developing policies to improve its performance challenging, but one thing can be said for certain: There is nothing in the Trump budget that would meaningfully improve the productivity picture and much that would cloud it.This budget\u2019s blatant disregard for intellectual integrity is matched by the extraordinary extent to which it seeks to slash social welfare programs, including another $616 billion out of Medicaid on top of $800 billion that would be sliced as part of the Republicans\u2019 health care plan. That\u2019s a 28 percent reduction to the existing Medicaid budget plan.According to current Congressional Budget Office projections, 14 million poor Americans are already likely to lose their health care if the Republican plan becomes law. (The office is scheduled to issue new numbers later today.) This new proposal would only increase that horrific figure.Domestic discretionary spending \u2014 on things like education and transportation \u2014 fares even worse; its allocation would be cut by 43 percent, bringing it down to nearly one-third of its 50-year average share of the economy of 3.8 percent. If we want to improve productivity, we should be allocating more, not less, money to areas like job training and education, as well to investments in research and development.Fortunately, the cuts to discretionary spending would require 60 votes in the Senate, so the Democrats can block them. But under arcane Senate reconciliation rules, only 50 votes (plus Vice President Pence) would be needed to eviscerate Medicaid, food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the other social welfare programs that the Trump administration is targeting.That\u2019s also true for the president\u2019s huge tax cuts, oh-so heavily tilted toward the rich and toward business. But remarkably, the budget office chose to simply ignore the cost of the tax proposal, which has been estimated to total $5 trillion to $6 trillion, in its new projections.If you don\u2019t ignore that cost, the bottom line is a budget picture remarkably different from what the White House is advertising. On top of the cumulative deficits of $3.2 trillion over the next 10 years caused by this budget, we would be shouldered with $7.6 trillion more red ink because of the tax cuts.Measured in relation to the size of our economy, our national debt as a percentage of our economy would grow to 98 percent a decade from now \u2014 the highest in our history except during World War II \u2014 from the current 77 percent.Elections have consequences, and the release of the first Trump budget is a glaring example. Fortunately, some Republicans have joined the Democratic chorus that has already begun pushing back. We need legislators from both parties to keep the Trump budget travesty from going any further.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Dozens of world leaders, including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, attended. Many of them praised Mr. Xi\u2019s vision, which he first voiced in 2013, and were enthusiastic about locating projects in their countries, financing them, building them or managing them. The plan offers many ways countries can participate; Britain and Singapore, for instance, seem eager to handle private financing.China\u2019s leader has advantages in promoting his agenda. He\u2019s in control. (It\u2019s worth remembering that he is hardly a democrat.) His government has lots of money to invest. His propaganda machine is disciplined and relentless. And Mr. Xi himself is a Barnum-like salesman. \u201cDevelopment holds the master key to solving all problems,\u201d he said at the forum, as if One Belt, One Road were the ultimate cure-all.No less important, many countries are desperate for infrastructure investment and jobs. China itself is eager to open new markets to nourish its own growth and to absorb an overproduction of steel, cement and machinery. Completing just a small fraction of the projects could help lift millions of people out of poverty and stabilize poor nations.Still, there are reasons to wonder how much of this grand plan can be achieved. There will be security risks in regions torn by sectarian and political warfare; legal obstacles in nations with different laws; and bureaucratic hurdles in countries with inept governments and corrupt officials.So far, investments have been focused on Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other countries that are geopolitical priorities for China but have weak economies. Conference delegates expressed concern that such countries would find it hard to pay back loans from Chinese companies and banks and emphasized that more projects must be \u201chigh quality\u201d and commercially viable.China clearly aims to dominate the international system. If it succeeds \u2014 shaping how vast sums are spent and where, and which laws are followed or not \u2014 it could upend a system established by Washington and its allies after World War II. And there are military concerns: For instance, many Burmese and foreign experts worry that China could use the Kyaukphyu ports for military purposes.Mr. Trump has already ceded ground to Beijing by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Barack Obama negotiated to ensure that the United States and its allies set the rules for Asian trade. This has led many Asian countries to question America\u2019s commitment to the region and to look more seriously to China.Whatever obstacles lie ahead for One Belt, One Road, it is no exaggeration to say that if the United States and its Western allies turn inward, Mr. Xi could prevail by default.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron Is Inaugurated as France\u2019s President", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported by\u201cI reassure you that not for a single second did I think that everything changed as if by magic on May 7,\u201d Mr. Macron said of the day he was elected. \u201cThis will be slow work, demanding, but indispensable. It will be up to me to convince the French that our country, which seems threatened by the sometimes contrary winds of the world, carries in its heart all the resources to be a nation of the first rank.\u201dBefore week\u2019s end, he is scheduled to visit French soldiers serving in places such as Mali and the Central African Republic.Mr. Macron said his presidency would be guided by two concerns: finding ways to help the French \u201chave confidence in themselves again\u201d and making France prosperous and strong.The country faces persistent high unemployment, especially among its youth \u2014 unemployment tops 40 percent in some places \u2014 and a need for more flexibility in the workplace to encourage employers to create more jobs. There are also concerns about terrorism and immigration, which have led to deep divisions between France\u2019s Muslim minority and non-Muslims.The European Union, of which France and Germany are economically the most powerful countries, faces the most severe criticism since its founding, including by France, with calls for deep reforms. Those resentments run so deep as populism rises across the Continent that leaders throughout the European Union are considering far-reaching changes.Britain voted last June to leave the bloc, and Mr. Macron will be deeply involved with Ms. Merkel in negotiating its exit.According to protocol, Mr. Macron was greeted on his arrival on Sunday at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace by his departing predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, to whom he owes his first experience in politics. Mr. Macron was a counselor to Mr. Hollande when the departing president was elected in 2012, and later became his economy minister.Mr. Hollande, however, proved ultimately unpopular in large part because he could not ameliorate France\u2019s relatively high levels of unemployment. Sensing the political winds, Mr. Macron left the government in August 2016 after forming his own movement in April named En Marche!, or Onward!After greeting Mr. Macron on the steps of the palace on Sunday, Mr. Hollande met with him in private so that the departing French leader could give the incoming one \u201csecrets of state,\u201d identified as a handover of the codes for France\u2019s nuclear weapons.It was also, in many ways, a meeting of a political era that appears to be fading in France with one that is on the horizon. Mr. Hollande is a Socialist Party member who has been in politics his entire adult life. Mr. Macron, in addition to being 20 years younger, is a former investment banker who created a movement that he describes as neither \u201cleft nor right,\u201d essentially an effort to fuse elements of both.Mr. Macron has something of the image of a wunderkind who has leapfrogged his way to the top, while Mr. Hollande comes across as a political character who proceeded step by step and who had the misfortune to come to power at a difficult time and without the mandate for change that Mr. Macron hopes to profit from.That said, Mr. Macron\u2019s aspirations to loosen labor rules, overhaul aspects of the pension system and simplify unemployment benefits are a tall order in a country whose citizens regularly take to the streets whenever any change is perceived as potentially weakening the social safety net.Laurent Fabius, the president of the constitutional council, who proclaimed Mr. Macron\u2019s election official on Sunday during the formal ceremony, referred obliquely to his efforts to forge a new politics for France, citing Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, one of the country\u2019s great intellectuals and conservatives of the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th.\u201cChateaubriand wrote a formula that fully makes sense: \u2018To be a man of his country, one must be a man of his times,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fabius said. He added that Mr. Macron was both, but then urged him to reach out to everyone \u2014 an important exhortation for the new president, who was the choice of only 24 percent of voters in the first round of the election.Mr. Macron won handily in the second round, but many voted not so much for Mr. Macron, but against his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen, who was seen as representing a radical and even fascist departure from France\u2019s traditions.\u201cCalm the anger, repair the wounds, alleviate the doubts, show the road forward and embody the hopes\u201d of France, Mr. Fabius urged.Mr. Macron waved at crowds as he was driven up the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in a military jeep to the Arc de Triomphe, where he attended a ceremony honoring France\u2019s fallen service members at a Tomb for the Unknown Soldier. He then greeted bystanders and shook hands with those who had come to cheer him, before returning to the palace.An earlier version of this article misstated the circumstances of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s victory in 2012. He was elected president of France, not re-elected. The article also misstated when Emmanuel Macron founded En Marche! He formed the movement before he left the government, not after.Aurelien Breeden and Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Government Sells Final Stake in Lloyds Banking Group", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Nearly nine years after a government bailout during the financial crisis, the Lloyds Banking Group is fully private again.The British government owned 43 percent of Lloyds after it injected 20.3 billion pounds, or $26.2 billion at current exchange rates, into the lender. Including \u00a3400 million in dividends, taxpayers recouped \u00a321.2 billion, the bank said.\u201cThe government has sold its last shares in Lloyds Banking Group, receiving more money than was originally invested,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the Lloyds chief executive, said in a news release. \u201cSix years ago, we inherited a business that was in a very fragile financial condition. Thanks to the hard work of everyone at Lloyds, we\u2019ve turned the group around. But the job is not done.\u201dLloyds shares were up about 2.5 percent in early afternoon trading in London on Wednesday.The bank was forced to take its bailout from the government in 2008 after a poorly timed acquisition of the mortgage lender HBOS, the operator of Halifax and Bank of Scotland, as the financial crisis hit.The bank found itself saddled at the time with billions of pounds in bad loans, many from the HBOS acquisition, as the economic environment weakened.When Mr. Horta-Os\u00f3rio joined Lloyds from Banco Santander in 2011, it had returned to profitability, but was still performing below expectations.In 2014, it spun out TSB Banking Group, a move required by European regulators as a condition of the bailout.While the bank\u2019s financial health has improved, Lloyds has still faced several hurdles related to its past conduct.It was one of the biggest providers of so-called payment protection insurance, a contentious product that has cost the banking industry billions of pounds in customer redress.The bank has set aside more than \u00a317 billion to compensate people who were improperly sold the insurance, and it was fined \u00a3117 million in June 2015 for its handling of customer complaints related to the product. Mr. Horta-Os\u00f3rio has called payment protection insurance the lender\u2019s biggest \u201clegacy issue.\u201dLloyds has also faced pressure in recent months over a bribery scandal stemming from a division of HBOS in Reading, England, that focused on helping troubled small businesses. Six people, including two former HBOS employees, have been jailed in the matter.Prosecutors said that bribes, including designer watches, luxury travel and sex parties, were paid in exchange for referrals of troubled HBOS small business clients to a consultancy firm, with many of those companies ultimately going bankrupt.After the sentencing of six people earlier this year, Lloyds said it would conduct an independent review and compensate business owners where appropriate. The bank has set aside \u00a3100 million to cover the compensation.Another question that is lingering for Lloyds is the ultimate impact of Britain\u2019s vote last year to leave the European Union.Lloyds officials have said that they do no expect a major impact on the bank\u2019s business, but concerns remain over the potential effects of any economic slowdown after Britain leaves the 28-nation bloc. That said, the British economy has been more resilient since the referendum in June than many had expected.Selling the British government\u2019s stakes in Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland has been a priority for Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, as it was for his predecessor, George Osborne.But it has been easier for Lloyds than for R.B.S., in which the government owns a 72 percent stake.R.B.S. has struggled to return to profitability as it faces growing litigation costs from past misconduct \u2014 including potential fines by American authorities related to its sale of mortgage-backed securities \u2014 and a difficult business environment.Mr. Hammond has said that the government\u2019s stake in R.B.S. may ultimately be sold at a loss.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Why Should We Worry About the National Debt?\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byAsk The TimesA reader asks:\u201cWill the U.S. ever have to pay off the national debt? If not, why should we worry about it?\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum, a Washington correspondent for The Times, considers the question._____First, borrowing can be an expensive way to raise money. People who have the money to buy a car usually don\u2019t go to the bank for a car loan. But the federal government, which has the power to collect through taxation all of the money it could possibly require, has fallen into the habit of borrowing money instead.Those payments once flowed almost exclusively to Americans, but foreign lenders now hold about a fifth of the debt, so the interest is drained from the economy.And the problem could get worse, quickly. Since the financial crisis, interest rates have remained at very low levels. Investors have lined up to lend money to the federal government. Sometimes they have even agreed to pay for the privilege. But stronger economic growth could create more alternatives for investors, and that could force the United States to compete by offering higher interest rates.The second reason to worry is that the United States must constantly repay its debts. The government borrows money by selling securities \u2014 once ornate pieces of paper, now lines of code \u2014 that entitle investors to repayment after a specified period. Those loan terms range from just 28 days all the way up to 30 years.Even if the United States balanced its annual budget, so the total debt stopped growing, the government would still need to borrow trillions of dollars every month.What if investors balked? Well, there is an escape hatch. The federal government could repay its debts by printing fresh dollars and giving them to its creditors.Inflation is a subtle version of this technique. As the government increases the amount of money in circulation, tax revenues increase, making it easier to repay fixed debts. Economic growth has the same effect. The United States never repaid the huge debts incurred during World War II. But economic growth and inflation gradually reduced the burden of the interest payments on those wartime debts.Have a question for Ask The Times? Submit it using the form below.Advertisement"}

While President Trump shows his ignorance on these matters, glaciers will continue to melt, ocean levels will rise and erratic weather patterns will worsen. With other contentious issues, such as health care, a wrong move might hurt many Americans for a few years but can be corrected by future administrations. But lack of action on climate change causes damage that is cumulative and largely irreversible within our life spans.The United States, as the second largest polluter in the world, after China, must reassert its leadership. Putting the coal industry on life support is not the way to achieve this.Kudos to California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, who is prepared to forcefully stand up to Washington and keep California on the right track. Encouraging innovation and building on the success of renewable energy is the way to a better future with many high-quality jobs that the Chinese would otherwise capture. A time will come \u2014 soon, I hope \u2014 when the truth about climate change will be undeniable, even to the president.To the Editor:As a California environmentalist, I am proud of the efforts of our state to address our most significant environmental and social justice issue \u2014 climate change. Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s meeting with China next month is good news because China and California will lead the technological and manufacturing pioneering needed to transition from fossil fuels in time to avoid bigger problems.But we need the rest of the country, made up of states with much smaller economies, to be engaged and supporting this effort, if for no other reason than to share in the millions of new jobs and businesses that will be created to meet the challenges ahead. It seems so illogical for the G.O.P., the party of business, and the president who wants to create jobs to ignore these realities. We need to put a national price on fossil fuels and return the proceeds to households.To the Editor:You rightly note that China and India are fast scaling up cleaner sources of electricity, particularly wind and solar power, raising questions about the United States\u2019 role. But your contention that \u201cChina and India are finding that doing right by the planet need not carry a big economic cost\u201d misses an important point. These two countries \u2014 like the United States \u2014 have been economically inefficient in many of the key policies and financial tools they have used to scale up renewable energy. The result: Renewable energy has cost more than it should.The writers are, respectively, the scholar-in-residence and executive director at the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, Stanford University.To the Editor:I\u2019m ashamed, but not at all surprised, that the United States is among the few countries defending the fossil fuel industry and rejecting a common-sense conflict-of-interest policy at the global climate talks. After all, President Trump nominated \u2014 and the Senate confirmed \u2014 the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil to lead the State Department.In fact, your article highlights a need for action that extends far beyond the climate negotiations. Here in the United States, corporations pull the strings in nearly every area of our lives, shaping the food we eat, the air we breathe and the medicines we can afford. In the Trump era, many members of our government operate with immense conflicts between their loyalty to the private sector and the public-sector roles they now find themselves in.We would do well to follow the lead of countries like Uganda, whose delegation is calling for a \u201cstronger rule book\u201d to rein in corporate power at the climate talks. We have never needed that rule book more than today.RICHARD A. DAYNARD, BOSTONThe writer is a professor of law at Northeastern University.To the Editor:We find ourselves at an extraordinary moment in history. Climate change threatens to destabilize our planet and is predicted to force millions of people to flee their homes and their ways of life. And yet for too long, governments have not championed the systemwide solutions we so desperately need.One of the reasons policy makers in the global north have been so slow to act on the science of climate change is the stranglehold fossil fuel companies have over policy making. It is clear that the same companies that profit from oil, gas and hydraulic fracturing should not be allowed to write the rule book when it comes to global climate policy.As someone who has worked with many institutional investors divesting and protecting their assets from fossil fuels, I can say with certainty that change will not happen in time if we continue business as usual. We need policy makers operating in service of the global public good. For that reason, I applaud the governments that are calling for common-sense limits to the fossil fuel industry\u2019s access to the United Nations talks. We need their leadership now more than ever.ELLEN DORSEY, WASHINGTONThe writer is executive director of the Wallace Global Fund, a private family foundation that works on environmental, human rights and democracy issues.To the Editor:The evolution of Devon Energy into a major fossil fuel industry force with alarming influence over public health and environmental standards didn\u2019t start with Scott Pruitt\u2019s fox-guarding-the-henhouse takeover of the Environmental Protection Agency.It began decades ago, with wave after wave of deregulation and consolidation in the energy industry steadily building to the pro-polluter reality we see in Washington today.Peer-reviewed science now definitively shows that even tighter regulations on fossil fuel extraction and burning, like those proposed under the Obama administration, wouldn\u2019t be enough to stave off the worst effects of impending climate chaos.The next 10 years are critical for rapidly moving the country off polluting oil and gas, and on to a clean energy future. A logical place to spur this transition would be on federal lands, where fossil fuel extraction should be immediately curtailed, beginning with an outright ban on fracking.The writer, executive director of Food and Water Watch, is the author of \u201cFrackopoly: The Battle for the Future of Energy and the Environment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Luxury Goods Market Will Return to Growth in 2017, Bain Report Says", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Consumers of luxury goods will apparently worry for only so long about the effects of global unrest, economic fluctuations or a volatile political outlook before they start spending again. Or so suggests a new report by the consulting firm Bain & Company, which predicts an upturn in the beleaguered luxury industry this year.\u201cIt is a sad state of affairs, but people are becoming more accustomed to uncertainty being part of their lives,\u201d said Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a partner at Bain who specializes in the luxury and fashion industries. \u201cThe impact of events like terror attacks are becoming less strong on the luxury market.\u201d\u201cThe last several years have been very difficult for the luxury sector,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Arpizio said. \u201cAs recently as last October, we said that the market would continue to stagnate if brands failed to revamp their trading strategies. For those who have, the benefits are now starting to kick in,\u201d she added, pointing to a polarization between \u201cbig winners\u201d and \u201cstrong losers,\u201d particularly in the race to capture the interest of younger customers.The Bain report expects annual sales of personal luxury goods, which include high-end fashion, handbags and jewelry, to total \u20ac280 billion to \u20ac290 billion by 2020.Luxury sales grew 4 percent in the first three months of 2017 from the same period last year, lifted by particularly strong sales in accessories, jewelry and beauty products in mainland China, where the sector had been hampered by a slowing economy in that country, as well as in Europe.While China and Europe are rebounding, however, the so-called Trump bump in the United States \u2014 increased enthusiasm among investors and businesses after the presidential election in November \u2014 appears to be giving way to what some are calling a \u201cTrump slump.\u201dDespite those factors, the Bain report paints a cautiously optimistic global outlook for the sector, with moderate expansion expected in the coming year.\u201cThe peak of the largest nationality wave ever to benefit luxury goods is behind us: There is not going to be another China,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Arpizio said. \u201cThat said, the growth we are seeing now is much healthier and less dependent on any one market or spending trend. The market is still very reactive. But for now, the luxury business looks in a much better place than it was this time last year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Investigates Work at Pacific Island Casino Project With Trump Ties", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Han Dong was operating a crane in China\u2019s rust belt last August when he heard about a chance to make it big in America.Local recruiters told him he could make as much as $2,900 a month, or nearly four times the average wage in China \u2014 and could even eventually apply for an American green card.Instead, Mr. Han said, he ended up working on the construction site of a casino on Saipan, part of an American commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean, where federal officials are investigating working conditions at a project managed by Chinese construction firms. An American green card, which would allow him to be employed legally there or anywhere in the United States, no longer appears very likely.\u201cThey tricked us to come here,\u201d Mr. Han said of the agents that transported him to Saipan, where he put up scaffolding for 12 hours a day in the tropical heat. Before the fees he paid out to middlemen to get hired, he made only half what he was promised, he said.The casino project in Saipan, an island about 3,700 miles west of Hawaii, illustrates a challenge for China, even as it throws an unusual look into the issue of undocumented workers on American soil.For China, high-profile regional construction projects are crucial to programs like President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road.\u201d That program, which envisions economic development across the Asia-Pacific region led by China, would expand the country\u2019s influence and demonstrate its construction and development know-how even as it provides a potential outlet for Chinese industrial overcapacity. So far, despite the promise of subsidies from China, One Belt, One Road\u2019s progress has been slow \u2014 and being outed as an exporter of illegal construction workers to an Asia-Pacific neighbor does not help that agenda.One Chinese contractor at the site, Suzhou Gold Mantis Construction Decoration, ties the project to One Belt, One Road. \u201cThe company will use the Saipan project to fully grasp One Belt, One Road,\u201d it said in a statement on its website.For the United States, the Saipan situation comes as President Trump calls for tougher limits on immigrants working illegally. In that regard, the investigation in Saipan carries a twist of irony: The chairman of the company that is building the casino hotel was once a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Trump\u2019s own casinos in Atlantic City.Before the labor issues became public, the Saipan casino project had already drawn attention from casino industry analysts.Imperial Pacific International Holdings, which owns the Imperial Pacific project, already operates a small temporary gambling facility nearby called Best Sunshine Live, which began operating in late 2015 in a duty-free shop near the larger hotel construction site.Best Sunshine\u2019s high-roller tables far outperform the most profitable gambling palaces in Macau, the world\u2019s largest gambling market, on a table-to-table gambling volume basis. Last year, the tiny temporary casino with 16 tables for so-called VIPs generated about $32 billion in gambling volume, according to Imperial Pacific\u2019s stock exchange filings.Imperial Pacific has not been accused of wrongdoing by federal officials, in either the work investigation or in its gambling business. \u201cWe have very stringent procedures on compliance to prevent money-laundering activities,\u201d Shen Yan, president for global capital markets at Imperial Pacific, said Wednesday evening in a telephone interview. He said the high per-table volumes were because of the limited supply of gambling space when compared with Macau, and the fact that customers, mostly from China, tended to stay and gamble longer when traveling to Saipan.On the labor issues, it said in a statement that its executives \u201cdenounce in strongest terms the harboring and the use of illegal workers by some of its contractors and subcontractors, and the utter disregard on the rights and well-being of these affected individuals.\u201dMark A. Brown, a casino industry veteran who before Saipan worked at properties in Cambodia, Macau and Las Vegas, got his start as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Mr. Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casinos, eventually rising to the position of chief executive of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts.\u201c\u2018Trump prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019 makes for a good story,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an email. But, he added, \u201cthe facts are we have many prominent individuals on our board of directors.\u201dIn the F.B.I. raid that led to the charges, agents discovered corporate spreadsheets listing 150 workers as \u201chei gong,\u201d a Chinese word for undocumented laborers.Mr. Han, the worker from China\u2019s rust belt, worked for the contractor Suzhou Gold Mantis, which was not targeted by the F.B.I. He said that he and other Suzhou Gold Mantis workers had been out of a job since April 2 but continued to wait for payment, occasionally protesting in front of the casino. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anyone from Gold Mantis,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the managers have escaped.\u201dAnother Suzhou Gold Mantis worker, Meng Hongjun, 46, from Henan Province in central China, said he had done stints as an overseas laborer in Dubai in 2010 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012.Mr. Meng heard about the opportunity in Saipan last year, signed himself up on a group tour and arrived in October. \u201cI knew I would be working illegally here,\u201d he said Wednesday in a phone interview. \u201cI knew it.\u201dAn external spokesman for Suzhou Gold Mantis based in Washington said on Wednesday that it was providing help for 91 people who had been working on the project.The company, the spokesman said in a statement, \u201cis working with the authorities to identify individuals who worked on Gold Mantis projects and ensure they receive the wages they are entitled to under the law.\u201dEdith DeLeon Guerrero, secretary of labor for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which includes Saipan, did not return phone calls seeking comment.\u201cWhile Gold Mantis was not subject to the F.B.I. raid,\u201d she said in an email, \u201cthe Department of Justice action shows that the pressure on the construction site, across multiple contractors, was to cut labor costs by seeking out migrant workers least able to complain and then pressuring them to work in substandard conditions.\u201dTwo picture captions with an earlier version of this article carried erroneous credits.

{"Headline": "Rumors on WhatsApp Ignite 2 Mob Attacks in India, Killing 7", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byThe two attacks last Thursday, within an hour\u2019s drive of each other in the state of Jharkhand, underscored the lawlessness that continues to plague India even as it seeks to modernize its economy and society.The attacks were incited by rumors on the messaging service WhatsApp warning of strangers who were abducting children. The stories proved entirely false.The crowds swelled to more than 500 over several hours, and the men who were killed were innocent passers-by, the police said. \u201cNot a single case of child abduction has been reported in this area,\u201d said Shrikant Khotre, the assistant superintendent of police in Ghatsila, where one of the victims lived.\u201cThe mobs have intentionally killed these men,\u201d said Animesh Naithany, the deputy superintendent of police in Jharkhand. \u201cThey knew they were taking the law into their hands, and instead of turning them in to the police they killed them.\u201dMr. Naithany said the police were still investigating who was behind the WhatsApp messages.Episodes of mob violence occur with numbing regularity in India, typically without a great deal of scrutiny except when they are religiously motivated or involve attacks on women.Analysts and officials say the vigilante violence stems from a variety of problems with the police and the judiciary. India has a low number of police officers per capita, and those on the job are often poorly trained, unprofessional and corrupt. Morale is low thanks to meager pay, long hours and little or no vacation time.Moreover, policing in most states is governed by colonial-era laws that allow politicians to control the transfer and appointments of top officials. In practice, this means they are heavily politicized, influenced by governing-party politicians rather than evenhandedly enforcing the law.\u201cAll political parties don\u2019t think beyond their own importance and power, so they don\u2019t reform the police,\u201d said Julio Ribeiro, a former police commissioner of Mumbai. \u201cIt\u2019s only when the people demand real reform that we will have it, and they haven\u2019t done that yet.\u201dThe problems have convinced many Indians, particularly the indigent and illiterate, that if they are to have any justice at all, they must take the law into their own hands.In an interview, Uttam Verma, a survivor of one of the mob attacks last week, recounted the terrifying series of events. Mr. Verma, 31, said he and his younger brother, Vikas, had ridden a motorcycle into the village of Nagadih, on the outskirts of Jamshedpur, the steel-producing city where they live. They were looking for land to start a new business making septic tanks.\u201cA little into the village, the road was obstructed by a pipe, and the villagers were sitting around armed with bows and arrows, axes and swords,\u201d Mr. Verma said.Mr. Verma said that he urged Vikas to turn back but that his brother insisted they continue looking for the land.A group of villagers stopped them and accused them of being child thieves, Mr. Verma said. They demanded to see the brothers\u2019 identification, which he had, but his brother did not.The brothers called home, and another brother, Gautam, and a friend, Gangesh Gupta, rushed to the scene, along with the Vermas\u2019 grandmother.Before long, the crowd began attacking the group with bricks, sticks and swords, Mr. Verma said.\u201cWe just could not comprehend what was happening,\u201d he said. The crowd spoke a tribal language that he and his brother did not understand well.\u201cPeople started coming out of their homes, and the mob kept getting bigger,\u201d he said. Police officers arrived at the scene but did not help them, he said.\u201cThe policemen said: \u2018Are they child stealers? Let\u2019s put them in the vehicle and take them,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Verma said.Mr. Verma escaped, but the others could not.\u201cThe next I saw of my brothers was as dead bodies,\u201d he said, weeping.His grandmother was in the hospital recovering from her injuries.Radhey Shyam Gupta, 38, the uncle of Mr. Verma\u2019s friend Gangesh Gupta, who was killed in the attack, said he was shocked when he saw his nephew\u2019s body.\u201cHis skull had cracked open and there was not a single part of his body which had not been hit and did not have marks,\u201d Mr. Gupta said.\u201cThe police were a silent spectator,\u201d he added.Prashant Anand, the superintendent of police in Jamshedpur, who is leading the investigation, said the mob far outnumbered the police.He said the police had arrested five people and identified 17 as suspects. The head of the village is a suspect, but he has not yet been arrested, Mr. Anand said.There were more than 500 people in the crowd trying to kill the three victims, Mr. Anand said, and only four police officers with the station head at the scene.The same day, about an hour\u2019s drive away, four cattle traders were also attacked by a mob, the police said. At least one of the men, Mohammad Naeem, was in the area to attend a family event, said Mr. Khotre, the assistant superintendent of police in Ghatsila, where Mr. Naeem lived.A video shows Mr. Naeem surrounded by a mob of stick-wielding men. At one moment, his white undershirt covered with blood, he sits on the ground with his hands folded, apparently begging for his life.Mr. Naithany, the deputy police superintendent in Jharkhand, said the vigilante mobs had sprung seemingly from nowhere, prompted by the WhatsApp messages.\u201cRumors of children being abducted spread on WhatsApp like wildfire,\u201d he said. \u201cVillagers started keeping vigil around their villages. Since they are an illiterate lot, they cannot differentiate between a real piece of news and a rumor.\u201dMr. Naithany said 20 people from the mob had been arrested on murder and rioting charges. An investigative team will submit a report within a month. The officers in charge of the police stations near both attacks have been suspended.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Strikes China Trade Deals but Leaves Major Issues Untouched", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The United States has reached a set of trade deals with China covering areas like electronic payment services, beef and poultry, compromising on some Obama administration stances but leaving untouched bigger issues that could still complicate relations between the two major trading partners.The disclosure of the deals on Thursday evening \u2014 which included an announcement that the United States would be represented at a forum in Beijing devoted to President Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitious \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d international investment initiative \u2014 suggests that the Trump administration is trying to smooth relations with Beijing despite President Trump\u2019s harsh anti-China language on the campaign trail.Under the newly announced deals, China set a deadline for fulfilling its promises to allow American beef and said it would speed up consideration of pending American applications to offer bioengineered seeds in China. It will also allow foreign-owned firms to provide credit-rating services in China, publish guidelines to let American firms offer electronic payment services there, and issue licenses to two American financial institutions to underwrite bonds.The trade deal announced Thursday will also allow Chinese companies to export cooked poultry products and offered reassurance to China that it could buy liquefied natural gas from America.The trade agreements did not address areas such as steel, aluminum or auto parts \u2014 areas where Chinese exports have a deep, industrywide impact. Mr. Trump criticized China\u2019s trade practices both before and after the election, saying China was benefiting at the expense of American workers.Yu Jianhua, China\u2019s deputy commerce minister, said the trade deals \u201chave changed others\u2019 anticipation on a potential trade war between China and the United States.\u201dMany of these deals actually consisted of adding new deadlines or details to agreements reached during the Obama administration. Trade officials in both countries had previously agreed that China would resume accepting American beef exports, which China has limited for more than a decade over worries about mad cow disease, but this week\u2019s beef pact set a deadline of July 16.Other deals were a shift from the positions of the Obama administration. It had long refused to allow imports of Chinese poultry, as the Agriculture Department had broad safety concerns about it, including the chemicals the animals are fed and the hygiene at farms and slaughterhouses. Salmonella and bird flu are also widespread problems in China, although the germs that cause them should be killed if poultry is properly cooked.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross praised the deals for providing specific dates for China to act on trade pledges it has made repeatedly but not fulfilled.He predicted that Trump administration policies would start to narrow the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China, which is equal to more than half of the nation\u2019s overall trade deficit.\u201cBy the latter part of the year,\u201d he said, \u201cyou should see something.\u201dMr. Ross and his negotiators were not able to obtain a deadline for when China would issue approvals for eight kinds of American seeds that have been bioengineered to produce hardier and more productive crops.On electronic payment services, which have become a popular alternative to cash in China, both sides appeared to make compromises. The Chinese side set a date, July 16, for permitting foreign providers of these services but would issue further guidelines for how they could be offered. The Obama administration had said China should allow foreign electronic payment services without issuing further guidelines. The United States had already fought and won a World Trade Organization case against China over payment processing.In another American concession, the Trump administration agreed that it would not restrict United States exports of liquefied natural gas to China, except to include them in an overall daily cap on American gas exports. Some American manufacturers, particularly in the energy-hungry chemicals industry, fear China might buy so much American natural gas that the purchases would push up American natural gas prices. The first shipment of American liquefied natural gas to China arrived in China\u2019s southern province of Guangdong last August.On credit-rating services, Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, said on Tuesday in Shanghai that foreign companies were increasingly concerned about such services that are being developed within China. These services appear likely to measure the extent to which companies as well as individuals meet the social and political goals of the Chinese state, he said, and not just whether companies and individuals pay their bills on time.Jeremie Waterman, the executive director for greater China at the United States Chamber of Commerce, cautiously welcomed the trade deals, while noting that he did not yet have the details. \u201cThe administration deserves credit for hopefully ensuring full and timely implementation of commitments China has already made in the areas of beef, biotech and electronic payments,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Macron Won: Luck, Skill and France\u2019s Dark History", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The French presidential runoff transcended national politics. It was globalization against nationalism. It was the future versus the past. Open versus closed.Detailed maps of the French presidential election show how Emmanuel Macron decisively beat right-wing nationalist Marine Le Pen.But Ms. Le Pen\u2019s challenge was different because French history is different. She has spent the last six years as president of the National Front single-mindedly focused on one objective: erasing the stain of her party\u2019s association with the ex-collaborationists, right-wing extremists, immigrant-hating racists and anti-Semites who founded it 45 years ago.She knew \u2014 as her father, the party patriarch Jean-Marie Le Pen, always refused to acknowledge \u2014 that she would always be a minority candidate as long as she reminded the French of perhaps the greatest stain in their history, the four years of far-right rule during World War II. Inside and outside the party this process was called \u201cundemonization\u201d \u2014 a term suggesting the demons still associated with her party. The French do not want them back.\u201cThere was no choice. I couldn\u2019t vote for Le Pen. You\u2019re not going to vote for the extremist,\u201d said Martine Nurit, 52, a small-restaurant owner who had just cast her ballot in Paris\u2019s 20th Arrondissement on Sunday. She had voted for the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round, on April 23, and it was with \u201cnot an ounce of joy\u201d that she voted for the \u201cbusiness-oriented\u201d Mr. Macron in the second.\u201cMostly, I voted against Le Pen,\u201d she said.It was an hourslong tirade against Mr. Macron, laced with name-calling and epithets, and woefully deficient in substance. She appeared lost on subject after subject, fumbling on one of her signature issues \u2014 withdrawing from the euro \u2014 that is opposed by a majority of French. Something essential about Ms. Le Pen, and the National Front, had been revealed to France.Mr. Macron, on the other hand, demonstrated a quality that French voters, unlike many Anglo-Saxon ones, have long found essential in their successful candidates: cool mastery of the critical issues confronting the country. Where Ms. Le Pen repeatedly lost herself in the weeds, Mr. Macron sailed right through them. Whether he will now be able to translate that knowledge into action is another question.So far he has been the beneficiary of spectacular luck.Four months ago he was polling a distant third, an all-but-certain loser whose maverick, nonparty movement was considered promising for the future but unripe. The soaring banality of his rhetoric appeared to turn off as many voters as it inspired. His rallies began in enthusiasm but soon sagged under the weight of his speechifying.But that was before the center-right front-runner Fran\u00e7ois Fillon imploded under the weight of an embezzlement scandal, fueling Mr. Macron\u2019s rise in the general election in April and into the final pairing with Ms. Le Pen. Many Fillon voters turned reluctantly to Mr. Macron on Sunday, rejecting Ms. Le Pen, who had made a concerted pitch for voters of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, the fourth-place finisher, who advocated a similar anticapitalist platform. And Mr. Macron was lucky to face Ms. Le Pen, a candidate considered simply unacceptable by a majority of the French.But he also played his limited hand with great skill from the beginning, outmaneuvering his elders. First, he wisely renounced the man who had given him his break, the deeply unpopular Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, quitting his post as economy minister in Mr. Hollande\u2019s government before it was too late. Then, he refused to take part in the Socialist Party primary in January, rightly judging that party activists would dominate and choose a far-left candidate on the fringes, who would then be devoured by Mr. M\u00e9lenchon \u2014 exactly what happened.Mr. Macron\u2019s final correct bet was that French voters, like those elsewhere, were disgusted by the mainstream parties, having judged the policy prescriptions of both the establishment right and left as failures in dealing with France\u2019s multiple ills. He positioned himself in the center, drawing on left and right, balancing protection of the French welfare state with mild encouragement for business, in an attempt to break through France\u2019s employment and productivity stagnation.Some of the antipathy sprang from his hermetic persona, as a caricature of the elite-educated, know-it-all technocrats, perpetually encased in a dark suit, who have guided France for much its postwar history, usually from behind the scenes, and whose record is mixed.\u201cHe\u2019s not someone I feel a lot of conviction for,\u201d said Thomas Goldschmidt, a 26-year-old architectural firm employee in Paris who voted for Mr. Macron after supporting the Socialist Beno\u00eet Hamon in the first round. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who raises a lot of questions. It\u2019s a vision of society that is too business-friendly,\u201d Mr. Goldschmidt said. \u201cIt\u2019s this whole idea of making working life more uncertain. We just can\u2019t bet on it, that everyone out there can be an entrepreneur. Society isn\u2019t built like that.\u201dMr. Macron seems aware that his large victory isn\u2019t a large mandate, that the pressure is now on to ensure that France\u2019s reprieve from the National Front is not just a temporary one. \u201cIf I fail to solve\u201d France\u2019s problems \u201cor fail to offer a solid start to solving them, in five years it will be even worse,\u201d he told the left-wing news website Mediapart on Friday night. \u201cWhat nourishes the National Front will be even more virulent,\u201d he added.Without an established party behind him, Mr. Macron\u2019s most immediate hurdle will be in June\u2019s legislative elections for France\u2019s Parliament. He has promised to field candidates in all 577 parliamentary districts, but whether he can do so is unclear. Nor is it clear how many Socialists will support his program.The National Front could win as many as 100 seats in the new Parliament, according to some analyses, making it a formidable opposition party. Indeed, even as Ms. Le Pen was soundly defeated on Sunday, she still managed a showing that not too long ago would have been unthinkable. And in her concession, she made it clear that she was already looking toward the parliamentary elections, and the future.Then there is the potential opposition represented by Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, who won in some of France\u2019s biggest cities \u2014 Marseille, Toulouse and Lille \u2014 and is already claiming the mantle of Mr. Macron\u2019s principal opponent on the left. His voters, as much as Ms. Le Pen\u2019s, do not trust Mr. Macron.Mr. Macron, in his uncharacteristically brief and sober victory speech on Sunday night, recognized that he had many people to win over.\u201cMy responsibility will be to unite all the women and men ready to take on the tremendous challenges which are waiting for us, and to act,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cI will fight with all my power against the divisions that undermine us, and which are tearing us apart.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was sold by a company named Moon Juice, which called itself \u201ca healing force, an etheric potion, a cosmic beacon for those seeking out beauty, wellness and longevity.\u201d In other words, a chain of juice stores in Los Angeles. I thought about Brain Dust for weeks.The name alone seemed precision-calibrated to reel me in. It wasn\u2019t \u201cBrain Powder,\u201d which sounds unappealingly man-made \u2014 protein powder, baby powder, foot powder \u2014 but \u201cDust,\u201d which suggests that the ingredients assembled themselves with the spontaneity of snowflakes on a twig. Then there was the label, with its \u201calpha waves\u201d and \u201cadaptogenic potion\u201d and \u201cneuron velocity.\u201d This was language as Impressionist paint daub; not a signifier of meaning but a blurry, mood-inducing gesture. Questions lingered. Can brain waves be toned? Who is the Brain Dust customer? Does she have no grasp on reality, or does she simply aspire to have no grasp on reality? Why do I assume it\u2019s a woman?A short time later, a news release touting a Moon Juice cookbook appeared in my inbox. It described the book\u2019s author and Moon Juice\u2019s founder, Amanda Chantal Bacon, as \u201ca powerful influencer in the wellness space,\u201d which struck me as the most penetratingly of-the-moment group of words I\u2019d ever read. The release noted that Moon Juice had been featured on Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle platform, Goop, and was beloved by celebrities like Shailene Woodley, who is herself known for dispensing peculiar wellness advice (like eating clay and sunbathing the vagina). The words \u201cEastern healing,\u201d \u201cglowing skin,\u201d \u201cnationwide following\u201d and \u201csocial media\u201d made their way onto the page. In the space of roughly 500 words, someone \u2014 a junior book publicist, probably \u2014 had managed to concentrate the zeitgeist of contemporary female celebrity into its purest form. Amanda Chantal Bacon, whoever she was, was like a superextract distilled from a combination of Paltrow, Jessica Alba, Miranda Kerr, Ayesha Curry and every other contemporary lifestyle guru. Unlike the others, she didn\u2019t have an acting or a modeling career (or a famous husband) to vault her into the public sphere. But she had all the right nouns and adjectives: a robust Instagram following, a line of signature products, an aspirational and photogenic home and enough branding talent to ensnare my gaze and capture my imagination, even if I was ashamed of its capture.Here was proof of the extent to which our nascent wellness culture had finally matured: a woman whose lifestyle was extreme to the point of inscrutability and expensive to the point of implausibility. It\u2019s not surprising that Bacon was mocked; the internet backlash practically wrote itself. The amazing thing was that she was also embraced. She expanded her business, published a cookbook, spoke at conferences and appeared in Vogue. As her fame has rippled outward, so has her influence.Most luxury products are pitched to appeal to a sense of decadence or exclusivity in consumers. Products in the wellness category, which also tend to be decadent and exclusive \u2014 Huffington\u2019s phone bed costs $100 \u2014 are instead pitched as tools of right-living. The second time I spotted Brain Dust in the wild was at a coffee shop in the Hamptons, where it shared shelf space with \u201ccruelty free\u201d toothpaste and boeuf-bourguignon-flavored dog biscuits. \u201cWe believe dogs deserve real food,\u201d read the dog-biscuit slogan.Paying fastidious attention to the minutiae of moods, appetites and sleep habits (or those of a pet) is an activity long enjoyed by the rich and underoccupied, from Edith Wharton heroines to the Kardashian sisters. In Wharton\u2019s day, this kind of life was coveted without being heralded as exactly virtuous. Its opposite, meanwhile \u2014 the quotidian physical martyrdom that was the lot of the working class \u2014 was at least given its due as a creditable human quality.Thanks to advances in technology, our economy has transformed since Wharton\u2019s day, albeit not in the way that Keynes predicted. Instead of bringing about a leisure class living in actual leisure, we have wrought a world where the upwardly mobile are instead obsessed with productivity. Indeed, productivity itself has become a kind of class signifier. Even recreation among the elite bears the hallmarks of work, with metrics and documentation governing all activity. As the increasing demands of work sow anxiety among the elite, leisure time has become a zone heavy with contradiction.In our wellness-obsessed era, the idea of working yourself to the bone is no longer a commendable trait but a failure of self-care; recreation is now cast as a divine pursuit. \u201cThere is a cosmic calling and powerful movement here to push us forward as a race,\u201d Bacon writes in her cookbook\u2019s introduction. \u201cA big part of the movement is caring for our bodies, as well as for the health of our planet. Anytime we make a move toward supporting or joining that mission, we tune in to the flow of otherworldly success and abundance.\u201d What Goop (and acolytes like Moon Juice) sell is the notion that it\u2019s not only excusable but worthy for a person to spend hours a day focused on her tiniest mood shifts, food choices, beauty rituals, exercise habits, bathing routines and sleep schedule. What they sell is self-\u200babsorption as the ultimate luxury product.The front door stood open, and Bacon sailed around in the kitchen ahead. An assistant sat at the countertop typing on an iPhone. I am accustomed to New York City kitchens the size of a bathtub, but this one was majestic by any standard. Every surface stretched gleamingly into the distance: the countertops, the professional range, the island with its basket of gourds, French press and sticks of burning Frankincense. I hollered hello and hesitated at the threshold a moment, waiting to be asked in, but the two kept working, so I entered without a summons. \u201cOne thing,\u201d Bacon called out, as a greeting. \u201cShoes.\u201d I removed them.\u201cI\u2019m about to Dust your coffee,\u201d she said, skipping introductions. Bacon, who is 34, wore a wispy white gown that wafted after her, with a thick untied braid trailing over her left shoulder. Her skin was, indeed, glowing; her cheeks had rose-petal qualities. The kitchen windows faced a hillside resplendent with tropical plants. Acorns occasionally scattered to Earth outside, landing at the feet of a stone deity, who sat among moistly dripping ferns.Bacon\u2019s assistant evaporated out the door as her boss set a plate on the kitchen counter: strawberry-rose-geranium bars, tiny \u201cdoughnuts\u201d made with mushroom and quinoa and a cinnamon bun that looked as if it were forged by a chic cave man with primitive tools. All of it was vegan, organic and raw. She poured coffee from a yellow enamel pot and slid onto a stool beside me, curling her bare feet up and arraying gauzy cottons around her. Sunshine glowed through the layers. She was, I was quickly realizing, the kind of woman who always seems backlit.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Power Dust in that,\u201d she said, pointing to the coffee. Power Dust, like Brain Dust, is a formula of stevia-sweetened powdered herbs that Moon Juice sells in an attractive jar. I would describe the taste as \u201csoil-forward.\u201d\u201cIs it possible to overdose on Dust?\u201d I asked. \u201cI had two doses this morning, and I also had two last night.\u201d In an effort to test the products, I\u2019d been guinea-pigging. So far, any effects were undetectable.\u201cNo,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cYou\u2019re good. You\u2019re safe. I mean, is it possible to overdose? You\u2019d probably have severe physical symptoms first.\u201dAs a housekeeper vacuumed nearby, Bacon kicked into her origin story. Growing up in New York City, she was a sickly child (\u201cbronchial stuff\u201d) whose parents took her to doctors (\u201cI got pumped through the Western-medicine chain\u201d) without satisfactory results (\u201cOf course nothing helped\u201d). One day she went shopping with her family at a downtown health-food store, where, the story goes, an Ayurvedic doctor visiting from India overheard Bacon coughing. The doctor came over and posed some questions (\u201cVery typical Ayurvedic ones, like \u2018How often do you poop?\u2019\u2009\u201d) and took the child\u2019s pulse. After examining Bacon\u2019s tongue, the man provided her mother with a list of forbidden foods: cow\u2019s milk, wheat and white sugar, among others. Bacon stopped eating gluten at age 4 and became a vegetarian at around 7.She is aware that these biographical details invite ridicule, but Bacon doesn\u2019t care if people make fun of her. She\u2019s used to it. And anyway, hers was a challenging childhood: \u201cI was told growing up that I had learning disabilities and mental illness. That was all the rage in the \u201990s.\u201d She reflected on her past calmly. \u201cI came from a family that was like: \u2018Yes. Whatever the doctor says is right. Just take the pills.\u2019\u2009\u201d (Bacon\u2019s mother was the C.E.O. of the fashion company Betsey Johnson, and her father was a musician.)At 18, Bacon moved to Italy alone. Why Italy? \u201cIf I thought about all the times I felt connected or alive, it was around the rituals of people gathering and eating and sharing food and slowing down,\u201d she said. In Florence, Bacon discovered that food was her calling. After several years of traveling, she wound up at a culinary school in Vermont. Following graduation, she emailed the Los Angeles-based chef and restaurateur Suzanne Goin and asked for a job. Goin emailed back with an invitation to meet. Bacon hopped on a plane and moved into a garage three blocks from one of Goin\u2019s restaurants, where she hand-whisked aioli and pounded salsa verde with a mortar and pestle until her biceps ached. In early 2012, having absorbed lessons of entrepreneurship from Goin, she opened the first store. \u201cIt really is not my name,\u201d she explained, when I asked where the phrase Moon Juice came from. \u201cIt just dropped down from the universe.\u201dAlong with cucumber-pineapple-jalape\u00f1o juice and almond milk, the first Moon Juice sold organic bananas with walnut butter and cacao cashew snack bites. In 2014, Shailene Woodley was photographed carrying a Moon Juice tote bag. Zo\u00eb Kravitz called it her favorite juice bar. Bacon appeared on Goop to make \u201cspirit truffles\u201d and \u201csex bark\u201d with Paltrow in 2015. New Moon Juice locations opened in Silver Lake and on Melrose Place.Bacon turned her focus inward, toward marketing the herbal remedies she\u2019d been incorporating into her diet for years. In 2014, the company added the line of jarred herb powders that now includes Spirit Dust, Beauty Dust, Power Dust, Brain Dust, Dream Dust and Sex Dust. The formulas sampled Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine; the labels instructed users to mix a teaspoon with hot or cold liquid (\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to double dose!\u201d). The Dusts proved to be what a venture capitalist might call an \u201cinflection point\u201d: unlike raw juices, they were easy to package and ship, had a long shelf life and faced zero competition from the likes of Coca-Cola (which, for example, has invested mightily in juice, including a $90 million stake in a company called Suja Life). They could be marketed as a beauty supplement and sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. The Dusts were scalable.And Bacon insists they work. \u201cPeople really report back: Wow, my skin changed,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said, turbocharging into evangelical mode. \u201cI hear incredible stories from people. There was a young, beautiful woman who approached me at an event. She said, \u2018I\u2019ve been coming into Moon Juice, I had breast cancer,\u2019 and she went through all that hormonal treatment, and by going through it, she no longer had a sex drive. She\u2019s beautiful! She\u2019s our age. She has a boyfriend ... and she said that the Sex Dust\u201d \u2014 along with pomegranate seed lube \u2014 \u201cgot them to be able to enjoy sex despite the fact that her body wasn\u2019t producing any of the hormones enabling her to do so. So the herbs, they work. They all work.\u201d You can now buy them at Urban Outfitters, the Ace Hotel and Net-a-Porter.While she spoke, Bacon finger-combed her hair, pausing now and then to stare critically at the ends. Incense curled out the window in velvety puffs. When I finished eating the pastries, she unfurled herself from her stool and brought out a second course: cloudlike coconut yogurt sprinkled with bee pollen in a pearlescent stone bowl. Fairy food.The housekeeper paused near Bacon holding a wispy white garment. \u201cSucio o limpio?\u201d she asked.By the time I left Bacon\u2019s house, I wanted to scrub off my makeup and swaddle myself in white cottons and let my hair tumble down my back in sun-lightened coils like hers. I wanted to move to California and eat bee pollen, even though I think bee pollen tastes like the reptile section at the zoo and California is the state where I was born and spent 18 years plotting my escape from, and it can\u2019t be denied that I benefit strongly from makeup. But all of that was wiped away within minutes of meeting this woman, whose ability to perform every action with charisma \u2014 whether pouring coconut milk into a pot or requesting a strategy meeting with her staff \u2014 seemed a direct result of her dietary choices. I understand that Bacon\u2019s success is a product of ambition, luck, privilege and stamina. So why did I covertly order a 16-ounce sack of bee pollen from Amazon on my phone during a three-minute break in our conversation? The answer is obvious: Bacon is a lifestyle guru, and this is what lifestyle gurus do. They insist on a connection between what you buy and who you are. And then they sell you stuff. If they are Bacon, they also pronounce the word guru \u201cgoo-doo,\u201d in what I can only assume is the authentic manner.An employee poked her head out the door, holding a phone. \u201cHey! Are you Milky?\u201d she asked.\u201cMolly.\u201d\u201cHa, ha, autocorrect.\u201d She glanced down at her phone. \u201cAmanda\u2019s running just a few minutes late \u2014 she\u2019ll be here soon.\u201dI sipped my Moon-Dusted recovery nectar and gnawed a packet of fermented seed crisps. They smelled like tree bark. Here, about a dozen miles from Bacon\u2019s home, the only sound was of lawns being mowed. This lightly accessorized silence is the sonic backdrop of L.A.\u2019s expensive neighborhoods. Women with Goyard and Mansur Gavriel bags slid in and out of the shop. I eavesdropped on three customers arguing about whether a peanut was a fruit, a vegetable or a seed.Around 11 a.m., Bacon arrived in white denim overalls and C\u00e9line sunglasses to test formulas with the company\u2019s in-house herbalist, Blaire Edwards. Before the tasting, she darted around the store, repositioning a cluster of skin products and switching the electricity back on when it unexpectedly shut off. From a back room, Edwards fetched tasting supplies and set them up on a table outside the store. The table was within inches of customers, and Bacon voted to drag it 10 feet away, beyond earshot. \u201cI feel like customers enjoying our current formulas don\u2019t need to hear about the new formulas,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could cause anxiety.\u201d At the relocated table, Edwards set out baggies of brown powders labeled in Sharpie marker. She mixed a powder into a cup of water and handed it to her boss.\u201cIs that three grams?\u201d Bacon asked.\u201cYes, madame,\u201d Edwards replied.Bacon sipped the brown liquid thoughtfully. \u201cI like it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy only thought is, less stevia.\u201d She passed the cup to me. \u201cYou\u2019re about to get really high.\u201d I swallowed the potion. It was like mild Ovaltine mixed with floor sweepings. When frothed with chai tea, coconut milk and ghee in one of the store\u2019s $6 lattes, it would be scrumptious.\u201cThese are literally ancient herbs,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something Amanda made up out of thin air.\u201d She mixed another sample in a cup while Bacon took calls, greeted fans, sniffed samples and arranged a conversation with a vendor. She possesses a curious quality I\u2019ve seen in other executives: a tendency toward extreme distraction coupled with the ability to laser in on a single task. She is either doing a million things or one thing, but never any number of things in between.This quality of scattered orchestration is illustrated in \u201cThe Moon Juice Cookbook,\u201d which opens its first chapter with a photograph of Bacon kneeling on a shaggy rug strewn with rosebuds and raw almonds. She is surrounded by crystals, a conch shell, an avocado, a flowering shrub, a string of beads and a sculpted owl. Her head is bowed in what looks like reverence. In her hands is an upside-down bundle of calla lilies. The photograph has been styled minutely, but it is hard to extract meaning from the picture. The filmy white garb, the glistening avocado, the melting calla lilies \u2014 all arrayed in Edenic plenitude \u2014 add up to an alluring, sensory glamour. When you sprinkle Beauty Dust on your almond-milk latte, this is what you are summoning.Or you might be summoning exactly the opposite. We tend to think of \u201cwellness\u201d as the province of swoony liberal elites, but it does, in fact, blossom at both cultural poles. The far-right conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones sells some of the same supplements as Moon Juice on his Infowars website. Jones\u2019s organic fair-trade coffee can be purchased in an \u201cImmune Support\u201d variety that includes cordyceps and reishi mushroom extracts; Moon Juice sells cordyceps and reishi powders with similar claims attached. The \u201cSuper Female Vitality\u201d supplement at the Infowars shop shares a number of ingredients with the Moon Juice Dusts: maca, epimedium, shilajit. Alex Jones and Amanda Chantal Bacon each sell probiotics. They each warn against the encroachment of \u201ctoxins.\u201d Bacon has a recipe for strawberry milk with drops of colloidal silver in it; Alex Jones pushes tiny bottles of colloidal silver online for $19.95. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two purveyors is context. Alex Jones sells his merchandise alongside tactical body armor and Trump shirts; Bacon sells hers next to chia pudding.What unifies the two is the subtext of their pitches \u2014 a seeming conviction that widespread forces are acting on benighted consumers, who can thwart harm only by venturing to the fringes and buying non-F.D.A. approved supplements with which to purify themselves. For Jones, the treachery comes in the form of fluoridated water and chemtrails. For Bacon, it\u2019s Western medicine and the standard American diet. One brand is designed to look like an ashram and the other to look like an underground bunker, but you walk away from each with the same conclusion \u2014 that the only way out is way, way, out, in a land of mystical mushrooms and miracle herbs. The valor of separatism, after all, is our founding myth.No place on earth is better suited to nurturing this mass turning-inward than Los Angeles. After I interviewed Bacon at her house the day before, I put my shoes back on and walked downhill toward the ocean, past sage clusters and foamy crests of bougainvillea and signs for a lost cat named India. Dry-cleaning vans made deliveries. Gardeners edged lawns. I passed the most expensive-looking mailbox I\u2019d ever seen, and more varieties of security fence than you could possibly imagine, and houses that looked like every decade\u2019s concept of the future. I was full to the brim of cleansing foods, strolling down a winding road past $6 million homes, each one an island. My sack of bee pollen would arrive in two to four business days.Molly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine. Her book about New York City, \u201cD C-T!,\u201d written with Joana Avillez, will be published next spring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Conservatives Retreat After Backlash Over \u2018Dementia Tax\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byBut on Monday, Mrs. May found that carefully crafted image at risk, as she agreed to revisit a controversial proposal to put a hard cap on the assets that residents who receive long-term care at home may own. The proposal, widely derided as a \u201cdementia tax,\u201d raised such an uproar that Mrs. May was forced to beat a hasty retreat.But the proposal would have required long-term care patients to forfeit all but 100,000 pounds (around $130,000) of their assets, including the value of their property.Widespread criticism of Mrs. May\u2019s plan by the opposition Labour Party among others, reported disquiet within the Conservative Party and a significant drop in the Tories\u2019 lead in opinion polls seem to have prompted her speedy change of heart.The issue is politically delicate because it affects many older people who vote more regularly than the young, and who provide an important electoral base for the Conservative Party.On Monday, Mrs. May retreated by promising that she would consult with lawmakers on an introducing an \u201cabsolute limit\u201d on the amount that people will have to pay out of pocket for long-term care \u2014 known in Britain as \u201csocial care\u201d \u2014 and she added that no one would have to sell their home to pay for care while they were alive.Though Mrs. May\u2019s latest statement did not promise a specific cap, it is nonetheless a significant change to her manifesto.Mrs. May\u2019s about-face awoke a largely dreary election campaign, with her critics claiming that, far from demonstrating the strong and stable leadership she promised, the prime minister was \u201cweak and wobbling.\u201dFor her part, Mrs. May called her shift a \u201cclarification,\u201d and she accused the leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, of scaremongering and making \u201cfake claims.\u201dYet there was no disguising the fact that Monday\u2019s announcement was a setback in a contest in which most analysts still expect the Conservatives to achieve an easy victory.Critics seized on Mrs. May\u2019s latest announcement. \u201cShe is unable to stick to her own manifesto for more than four days,\u201d said Andrew Gwynne, election coordinator for the Labour Party. \u201cAnd by failing to put a figure for a cap on social care costs, she has only added to the uncertainty for millions of older people and their families.\u201dAngus Robertson, deputy leader of the Scottish National Party, described the statement as \u201can utter humiliation\u201d that betrayed the reality of the leadership \u201cof a weak and wobbling prime minister,\u201d while Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said Mrs. May had suffered a \u201cmanifesto meltdown.\u201dMr. Osborne now edits The Evening Standard, a London newspaper, which described the change as an \u201castonishing U-turn.\u201dCritics tend to blame such mistakes on Mrs. May\u2019s habit of trusting only a small circle of advisers, including her two closest aides, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. British news reports blamed Mr. Timothy for introducing the proposal into the manifesto at the last minute, without broader discussion among Mrs. May\u2019s most senior colleagues.But there may be an added element of political miscalculation at work. Given her earlier lead in the opinion polls, she appeared to have concluded that she could afford to seek a mandate for a measure that could be unpopular \u2014 including reducing some of the advantages enjoyed by older voters, whose incomes have been protected in recent years \u2014 while younger Britons have faced growing economic challenges, particularly with high housing costs and stagnant wages.In addition to the changes to social care, Mrs. May proposed a less advantageous system for automatic raises in pensions, and plans to restrict help for older people with their heating costs to the poorest.The debacle also illustrated how the election campaign has so far been dominated by domestic issues, rather than serious discussion of how Britain should confront leaving the bloc, its biggest challenge in decades.In the meantime, the European Union on Monday agreed on its strategy for exit talks, which are likely to begin within two weeks of Britain\u2019s election on June 8.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Value and Virtue of Good Writing (Rule No. 7: Don\u2019t Be a Bore)", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.As a master editor and distinguished author, Evans is well qualified to instruct us on how to write well. But can he delight us in the process? After reading this book, I can affirm that the answer is yes. For the most part. Up to a point.\u201cWhat really matters is making your meaning clear beyond a doubt,\u201d Evans tells us. And the key to clarity, he insists, is concision \u2014 a virtue allegedly less honored in the United States than in the author\u2019s native land: \u201cNewsprint rationing in wartime Britain enforced economy in language, a conciseness not required in American print journalism, where acres of space invited gentle grazing.\u201dOne might observe that Evans\u2019s own guide to writing well is nearly four times the length of its classic counterpart on this side of the Atlantic, Strunk and White\u2019s \u201cThe Elements of Style.\u201d But that would be a cheap irony. Besides, the precepts Evans offers are both edifying and entertaining. In his \u201cTen Shortcuts to Making Yourself Clear,\u201d for instance, No. 7 is \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Bore.\u201d This may sound like an empty injunction, but Evans elaborates it into a discussion of different sentence structures available to a writer \u2014 \u201cloose,\u201d \u201cperiodic,\u201d \u201cbalanced\u201d \u2014 explaining how their varied deployment can avert monotony and even, in the hands of expert prose writers (he cites Roger Angell, Richard Cohen, David Foster Wallace and Barbara Demick), achieve a sort of music.The fun begins to flag, however, when Evans invites us into what he calls his \u201csentence clinic.\u201d There we are suffered to see him in editorial action, applying his surgical tools to specimens of bloated, dull, euphemistic, incomprehensible prose: newspaper articles, academic writing and, later, at coruscating length, the entire 2010 White House report on the \u201cunderwear bomber\u201d (Evans\u2019s analysis/reworking of this document occupies nearly 50 pages). He even has the audacity to operate on a passage from \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d \u2014 asking, in exasperation, \u201cWhat is Jane Austen saying?\u201d With each example, Evans triumphantly reports his hard-won gain in succinctness (\u201cMy edit saves 34 words\u201d).I had to force my eyeballs over a lot of this. But, as a former editor myself, I readily concede its value, and not just for J-school students. Look, writing is hard. It\u2019s like some vile, incurable disease: There are bad days, and there are worse days. And writing well is a two-stage process: (1) write not so well; (2) fix it. Knowing that Stage 2 is coming, you can relax a little during Stage 1; your inner editor will diligently revise the clumsy, turgid bits later. And there is no better way of cultivating that inner editor than following Evans as he plies his craft.For all his skill, he is not infallible. I find him oversensitive about clich\u00e9s \u2014 which, like being oversensitive about table manners, can come from keeping second-rate company. (I owe this insight to my writing hero, Evelyn Waugh.) Evans furnishes us with a list of clich\u00e9s to be avoided that goes on for six pages. Yet when, elsewhere in the book, he himself says that \u201cthe right words are oxygen\u201d and that ugly phrases are \u201cpassed on like a virus,\u201d we do not begrudge him these shopworn but convenient figures of speech.And his passion for conciseness can go too far. Rewriting some Clinton Global Initiative verbiage about empowering women, for example, Evans ends up with this terse sentence: \u201cGirls could increase global G.D.P. by as much as 5.4 percent.\u201d Which left me scratching my head \u2014 why don\u2019t those girls get their act together? Here Evans has pruned away too many words. Sometimes redundancy facilitates communication. (Hmm, better reword that.\u2026)But these are the quibbles of envy. I wish I had the editorial chops to produce such an authoritative guide myself. As Evans shows, the consequences of foggy prose can be grave, ranging from missed Social Security benefits to tragic military accidents to the Great Recession, which \u201chad roots in misbegotten nomenclature.\u201d Writing well is not a mere matter of aesthetics; it is a \u201cmoral issue.\u201d In fact, if I were the current occupant of the White House, I would take on this issue by appointing Sir Harold to be our nation\u2019s Good Writing Tsar. Or Czar.Jim Holt is the author of \u201cWhy Does the World Exist?,\u201d which was one of the Book Review\u2019s 10 Best Books of 2012.Advertisement"}

Ms. Macel has divided the work, installed in two vast spaces \u2014 in the Giardini and the Arsenale \u2014 into nine sections with snoozy, New Age-y titles: Pavilion of Joys and Fears, Pavilion of the Earth, Pavilion of Time and Infinity, etc. She even kicks the whole thing off, in the Giardini, with images of artists napping in their studios.She\u2019s trying to make a point about downtime as dreamtime, a mode of passive-resistant creativity in an era of frantic, art fair-directed production. Unfortunately, the nodding-off image reinforces a second reality: the fact that the current market-addled mainstream art world really is, politically, out of it. And a lot of the work being produced, at least on some of the evidence here, barely rates a second look.Their presence was disconcerting. It revived the \u201cprimitivism\u201d debate of 30 years, its terms unchanged: We in the West continue to import the Other for our pleasure, while remaining complicit in a global economy that is destroying the Other\u2019s world.

{"Headline": "Should Free Markets Govern the Bond Rating Agencies?", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byFair GameWhat hasn\u2019t received much attention is how the bill would change the rules governing credit ratings agencies \u2014 but it should. What the Choice Act would require is bad, both in how it would roll back the law and in what it would keep. But the bill also misses a big opportunity to change the ratings industry for the better.First, a little history. The ratings agencies \u2014 Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services and Fitch Ratings are the major ones \u2014 played a central role in the financial crisis. They assigned high grades to mortgage securities that quickly collapsed, leaving investors with billions in losses. The ratings agencies failed abjectly to assess the credit risk in these securities, which were brimming with poisonous loans. That was their job.The Choice Act fails in two ways related to the credit rating agencies. First, it proposes rolling back Dodd-Frank\u2019s accountability measures over these companies, no longer requiring that the chief executive of a ratings agency attest to the company\u2019s internal controls over the processes it uses to determine credit grades. The bill would also rescind the Dodd-Frank requirement that a ratings agency confirm in its disclosures that a rating was not influenced by its business activities.In an interview, Mr. Harrington was especially critical of the way the bill lets chief executives at the agencies off the hook in attesting to the integrity of the ratings process. He characterized the Choice Act as \u201ca complete disaster.\u201dJeff Emerson, a spokesman for the House Financial Services Committee \u2014 from which the Choice Act emerged \u2014 contended that because raters can already offer services without applying for the government\u2019s seal of approval, the free market is working.\u201cWe do not believe there is a government accreditation or imprimatur by maintaining the regulatory regime over credit ratings agencies that elect to register with the S.E.C.,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThis is why the Choice Act repeals the Dodd-Frank section that allows the S.E.C. to establish a board to assign ratings of structured financial products. We do not need to put the government back into the ratings approval business.\u201dMr. Harrington said he thought the comment from the committee spokesman was evidence of a deep misunderstanding of how the ratings agency business works, especially of how beneficial the government\u2019s designation is to the companies who have it. He is disturbed that the Choice Act would keep ratings agencies entrenched and the S.E.C. as a gatekeeper that inhibits competition in the arena.He took this position in a paper on the topic back in 2013.\u201cIt is important to remember when we talk about investors in the bond market, we\u2019re not talking about Mom and Pop sitting around the dining room table figuring out what to do with their 401(k),\u201d Professor White said in an interview. \u201cThe overwhelming bulk of bond holdings are by institutions that you\u2019d expect would have enough expertise to figure out who\u2019s a good advisory firm.\u201dGiven that institutional investors are the bond market, he added, \u201cThe argument for government certification of who these advisory firms are going to be becomes much weaker.\u201dThe requirement to license ratings agencies, they wrote, puts \u201cthe government\u2019s imprimatur on credit assessments that are too often the result of sloppy procedures and/or commercial bias.\u201d Stripping them of the government\u2019s stamp of approval would allow the market to work by opening up the business to competition.Eliminating the lock that the big agencies have on ratings might also avoid another financial mess, the group contended. \u201cA return to something resembling the pre-2008 status quo, in which a government-sanctioned oligopoly of conflicted companies assess credit quality risks a repeat of the financial crisis,\u201d they wrote.\u201cWhy do we need to have credit ratings agencies receiving some federal license that indicates the S.E.C. approves of what they\u2019re doing?\u201d asked Marc Joffe, a former Moody\u2019s executive who is one of the six former executives calling for an end to the licensing requirements. \u201cTake that away, and anyone who is providing credit assessment can compete on a level playing field with the ratings agencies.\u201d\u201cThe will to make our capital markets more efficient isn\u2019t there,\u201d Ms. Rutledge said in an email to me. \u201cThe only people who will suffer as a result are ordinary Americans dealing with a dysfunctional economy, dysfunctional because capital markets are rigged to pay themselves for paying themselves.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

At the front of lecture halls hang smiling portraits of his father and grandfather, who led the nation before him.While the university\u2019s chancellor, Park Chan-mo, said the arrests were not related to the teachers\u2019 work at the school, the men were accused of \u201chostile acts,\u201d a charge that is often used against people accused of spying or proselytizing.That effectively makes them bargaining chips in the high-stakes conflict between Pyongyang and Washington. As Mr. Kim pursues a destabilizing nuclear weapons program and the Trump administration warns that the time for \u201cstrategic patience\u201d is over, the school gives the regime access to a rare commodity in their country: American citizens.The volunteers\u2019 arrests have also cast a light on the school and the ways in which critics say it has, perhaps inadvertently, aided the regime.Some of those critics say the school is training the future elite of a dictatorial regime that abuses human rights and threatens its neighbors with nuclear weapons. Right-wing activists in South Korea accuse the school of educating future hackers.The school \u201ccannot operate in North Korea without making compromises to the regime \u2014 either in money or information \u2014 and I am uncomfortable with the extent of such a compromise,\u201d said Suki Kim, who taught English at the university in 2011 as a journalist working undercover. She later described her experience in the book \u201cWithout You, There Is No Us.\u201dMany of those compromises are apparent on campus.Students march to the cafeteria singing songs swearing loyalty to Mr. Kim. Course materials have to be approved by the North Korean authorities, who have their own staff members installed on campus. Faculty members must have \u201cguides\u201d with them when they venture off campus.While the foreign faculty has unfiltered access to the internet, most students do not. Teachers have to watch what they say \u2014 students are required to report any subversive comments.One American professor was deported for trying to give a student a Bible.An obelisk at the university, erected by the North Korean authorities and dedicated to Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather and father, has drawn scorn from outside observers.\u201cKorean churches have ended up building a temple of idol worship there,\u201d said the Rev. Lee Ho, the leader of the anti-Communist Holy Korea Network.The university said the monument and other state propaganda were \u201cobligatory,\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d elements of all schools and other official establishments in North Korea.For the staff of about 90 foreign volunteers from a dozen or so countries, teaching at the university is a chance to gain a foothold in an atheistic country by befriending future North Korean leaders and teaching them an international mind-set.The volunteers mingle and eat with the 500 or so handpicked students, who live on the campus. Together with their families, the staff members constitute the single largest foreign community in North Korea.The teachers, many of whom are Korean-American missionaries, are allowed to practice their faith among themselves. But the one inviolable rule is that they are not allowed to proselytize.\u201cWe want to teach the North Koreans how to catch fish, rather than giving them fish,\u201d said Mr. Park, also a Korean-American and a former president of South Korea\u2019s prestigious Pohang University of Science and Technology. \u201cThis will help narrow the economic gap between the two Koreas and the cost of the eventual reunification.\u201dThae Yong-ho, a North Korean diplomat who defected to the South last year, said the university was popular among the children of the elite and taught them market principles in a country desperate to modernize its economy. Mr. Thae also dismissed the allegation that the school was training future hackers.And the university continues to grow, with plans to add a new medical school to the campus in southern Pyongyang.Despite being in the spotlight, the school is trying to play down the significance of the volunteers\u2019 arrests.One of the detainees, Kim Sang-duk, an accounting teacher who is also known as Tony Kim, had frequently visited the northeast, where he distributed humanitarian aid to children\u2019s homes and recently delivered 20,000 blankets to flood victims, school officials said.The other, Kim Hak-song, a Christian pastor, supervised an experimental farm on campus, visiting for a month at a time from China, where he worked as a missionary for a Los Angeles church, according to school officials and the church\u2019s website.Both were detained as they were trying to leave the country. The government has provided no further details on their cases, including whether they are linked.\u201cWe were told that their detentions had nothing to do with what they did at the school and that otherwise they would have been arrested on the school ground,\u201d Mr. Park said during an interview in Seoul, the South Korean capital. \u201cWe are praying for them.\u201dThe school has reminded its faculty of local rules, but otherwise life there continues in a \u201cperfectly normal manner,\u201d the school said in a statement for this article. Several volunteers from the school have left North Korea in recent days, as planned and without incident, it said.The university also says it takes care not to violate United Nations sanctions.\u201cWe are in regular dialogue with officials in the U.S. and other administrations on this point, including sharing details of our curriculum,\u201d the statement said.When the university\u2019s founder, Kim Chin-kyung, who is also known as James Kim, visits South Korean churches to raise money, he asks congregants to \u201cpay a price\u201d for reunification and for their fellow Koreans suffering in the North, an appeal that resonates with many Christians in the South.He argues that reconciliation is the only way to achieve reunification of the divided Korea, and that Christian love can help nurture it.Whether or not that works, the school has surely opened the minds of some students a bit simply by allowing them contact with foreigners.Will Scott, an American computer scientist who taught there from 2013 to 2015, said some of his students admitted to \u201chaving nightmares\u201d when they first met teachers from the United States, a country they had learned to demonize from childhood.But the students were eventually able to channel their hatred toward the American government and came to accept the individuals they met there.But the government tries to reinforce loyalty, requiring the students to take a class on the state ideology of juche, or self-reliance, every Saturday.When Chancellor Park complained that the class would not give students enough time to do their homework, he said, a North Korean administrator had a pointed retort.\u201cMr. Chancellor,\u201d he said, \u201cyou yourself go to church every week, don\u2019t you?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Hollywood\u2019s Most Thrilling Scenes Are Now Orchestrated Thousands of Miles Away", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "The Money IssueThe visual effects industry, and the \u201cmovie magic\u201d blockbuster films spend huge shares of their budgets on, are being lured away from California \u2014 and into two of the most expensive cities in the world.Supported byBreaux, then 21, had just finished his second year at Columbus College of Art and Design in Ohio. Drawing, computers, movies and video games had been his passions since childhood, but it wasn\u2019t until he saw the brachiosaur that he realized all these things could fit together. The dinosaur was created with \u201cvisual effects,\u201d abbreviated in the movie business as VFX, the art of combining real-life footage with hand-drawn or computer-generated imagery. This was a distinctly different field from old-fashioned \u201cspecial effects\u201d \u2014 the illusions, like fake blood or dinosaur puppets, employed on set during filming \u2014 and Spielberg had just elevated it to magical new heights.Breaux spent the next decade trying to get closer to that magic. After college, he took a series of jobs as an animator and as a character developer at video-game companies, first in Minnesota, then Indiana, then Texas. Each new job felt like progress: He was getting closer to Hollywood. Finally, in 2003, he was hired as a staff animator at Rhythm & Hues, an Oscar-winning VFX company in Los Angeles, renowned for its creature animation in movies like \u201cStuart Little\u201d and \u201cBabe.\u201dAbout a month into their work on the short film, Breaux and his team were sitting in their office near Culver City, deep into production, when one of the artists got a phone call. He left to take it, and when he returned it was obvious that something was wrong; Breaux thought he looked as if a family member had died. But it had been Rhythm & Hues\u2019s human-resources department, calling him to come into its office. He was being let go.\u201cWe all felt really bad for him.\u201d Breaux recalls. Then the next guy\u2019s phone rang.One by one, each of the eight team members got the same call. When Breaux saw his phone light up, his heart dropped. After he handed in his badge, he called his manager while driving home on the 405 for the last time. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d he asked. It\u2019s not you, she told him. We just don\u2019t have the work.Breaux\u2019s layoff caught him completely off guard. But in retrospect, the warning signs had been there for months. Every Friday, the company\u2019s owner hosted a meeting to update the staff on what movies the company had bid on, so they could see what might be coming down the pipeline. Breaux attended every week, and he had noticed that they were starting to lose a lot of bids. They weren\u2019t losing to their established competition in Hollywood either. They were being undercut by cheaper labor overseas \u2014 not in India, Korea or any of the other familiar culprits, but in one of the most expensive cities in the world: London.But while visual effects\u2019 role in movie making is growing, its presence in Hollywood is shrinking. From 2003 to 2013, at least 21 notable visual-effects companies went out of business, including Digital Domain, which produced the Oscar-winning effects in \u201cTitanic.\u201d Rhythm & Hues finally filed for bankruptcy protection in 2013, just days before winning an Oscar for \u201cLife of Pi,\u201d though it has since been revived under new ownership, working largely on TV shows like \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dOne factor behind these companies\u2019 failure is a raft of tax-incentive programs that have popped up around the world in an effort to lure cash-starved VFX production companies \u2014 and their high-tech jobs and movie glamour \u2014 out of California. The chief destinations, at the moment, are London and another even more expensive city: Vancouver, British Columbia. The stunning, Oscar-winning spacescape of \u201cGravity\u201d? Created by London\u2019s Framestore. The fantastical jungles of \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d? Most of the credit (and the Oscar) belongs to the London-based Moving Picture Company. The grand, galactic battles in \u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d? That work was led by Double Negative in Vancouver. The companies that make billion-dollar blockbusters possible are barely hanging on, and \u2014 for the most part \u2014 they aren\u2019t anywhere near Los Angeles.The mechanics of this large-scale migration start with the basic business model by which VFX houses are paid. \u201cDuring the golden age, they had visual effects and optical effects in house,\u201d says Scott Squires, an industry veteran who got his start in 1976 on Spielberg\u2019s \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind.\u201d Movies would hire effects artists, who would be paid directly by the film production. But in 1975, George Lucas started a stand-alone outfit called Industrial Light & Magic to work on his passion project, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d and soon moved it north to Marin County. In 1979, Squires and five other visual-effects artists founded a company called Dream Quest. The advantages of independent effects houses were obvious: They could make more money, and maintain more creative freedom, as businesses than they could as individual freelancers.But an unintended consequence was that the labor spent on VFX suddenly became uncoupled from the price the film production paid for the work. When visual-effects teams were working for movie studios, on studio lots, they were usually paid by the hour, like everyone else on the crew. But as independent vendors working on progressively bigger films, visual-effects houses wound up being paid for their work via a bidding system, which pretty much everyone now agrees was a terrible idea. The director or producer presents a plan for the movie, sometimes along with a storyboard. The visual-effects company then puts together a list of shots and a bid for what they\u2019ll cost \u2014 as opposed to billing, after the film is completed, for hours worked or materials needed. One obvious problem is that what the director wants pretty much always changes over the course of making a film, leaving VFX companies stuck with the fixed cost in the contract. Some contracts even include clauses stipulating that if the filmmakers don\u2019t like the effects, they can pull out of the deal \u2014 and ask the effects company to pay all the money back.\u201cUltimately, the visual-effects facility winds up bidding on something that they don\u2019t really fully understand, because they\u2019re often asked to do something that\u2019s never been seen before,\u201d says Scott Ross, a founder, along with James Cameron, of Digital Domain. He compared the process to a building contractor\u2019s bidding blindly on a new project: \u201cWe have no concept of what the house is going to look like. We\u2019re not really sure if it\u2019s going to have five or six bedrooms. We\u2019re not sure whether there\u2019s going to be a swimming pool or not. But you\u2019ve got to give an incredibly competitive price.\u201d The evolution of the industry \u2014 with computers and software growing cheaper, new workers entering the market and barriers to entry steadily lowering \u2014 only made that competition worse.Then came the tax incentives. The practice of dangling tax breaks to attract film production is nothing new, but the fiercely competitive bidding for VFX work makes the industry especially receptive to this pull. And these companies, meanwhile, are especially attractive to the governments that court them: Salaries are higher than they are in many other sectors of movie production, and the high-tech creative work the houses do can (at least in theory) spill over and stimulate a local tech economy. Many places around the world, including several American states, offer incentives targeting the industry. But London and Vancouver have been the most successful.For London, much of that success is owed to the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise. Before the \u201cPotter\u201d films, the city had a healthy advertising and TV industry, but its feature-film industry wasn\u2019t particularly robust. These eight major blockbusters, created in London over 10 years of production, were a huge win for the British film industry, with thousands of people working on each film. The British government didn\u2019t want that to end with \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d and so in 2007, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, announced the U.K. Film Tax Relief program, which offered a 25 percent rebate that covers postproduction costs, including visual effects. The program was intended, in part, to offset an unfavorable exchange rate at the time, but it was made even more generous in 2015: The amount a movie production had to spend in Britain to qualify for the rebate was reduced, from 25 percent of its total budget to just 10 percent.Vancouver, even more than London, has relied on aggressive subsidies to build its VFX boomtown. Beginning in 2003, British Columbia created a labor-based tax incentive that at its peak, when combined with a federal film program, added up to a staggering 58 percent tax refund for all visual-effects labor costs incurred by movies using local workers. The credit has since been reduced to 53 percent, but it\u2019s still one of the world\u2019s most generous: If a studio pays $1 million in labor costs to a Vancouver-based effects house, it will get $530,000 back as a tax refund, even beyond its tax liability. Most of the time, none of this money flows back to the VFX company. But when movie producers are comparing bids from one house in Los Angeles and another in Vancouver, they know which deal will literally give them more than half their labor costs back.As the digital-effects supervisor for Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201cTree of Life\u201d \u2014 an ambitious 2011 film that spanned from the birth of the universe to one boy\u2019s Texas childhood \u2014 Friedman found himself inside a particularly complex system. The work clustered in three groups: \u201cAstrophysical\u201d and \u201cmicrobial\u201d effects were handled by two different houses in London, while \u201cnatural history\u201d effects were led by Prime Focus, which was based in Los Angeles but had most of its workers in Vancouver.The internet makes this kind of remote collaboration easier, but not as easy as you would think. The files involved are so huge \u2014 a typical four-second shot ranges from 1.2 to 9.6 gigabytes, and an effects-heavy film could easily involve more than 1,000 such shots, each in several different versions, along with assets like digital characters, props and backgrounds \u2014 that trying to shove them through the internet is a challenge. For most of the production for \u201cTree of Life,\u201d Friedman and the London and Vancouver teams would send low-resolution videos back and forth. But eventually the fully rendered frames had to be shared. The regular internet isn\u2019t quite up to this task, so the industry relies on private networks of high-speed gigabit fiber, stretching from Los Angeles to Vancouver or across the Atlantic to London. (\u201cIf you look really carefully all over Santa Monica and Venice, you will see that kind of stuff,\u201d Friedman says.) But the \u201cTree of Life\u201d production had its headquarters in a strip mall just outside Austin, Tex. It had to rent space at the head end of fiber cable in a warehouse even farther out of town; when work arrived from Vancouver or London, a production assistant would drive out to physically pick it up.Visual-effects creation is a collaborative process, and its artists are extremely specialized. A worker might spend an entire career just lighting scenes, or adding texture to cloth, or simply simulating water, a complicated task that involves serious physics. The \u201cTree of Life\u201d scene in which a predatory dinosaur appears to take pity on a wounded dinosaur and spares its life \u2014 supposedly meant to represent the moment when altruism first entered the world \u2014 was created by a team including, among others, three riggers (who built the dinosaur bodies), 12 animators (who gave the two creatures movement), two lighters, six compositors (who put it all together) and an animation expert, flown in from London to supervise the work being done in Vancouver. That doesn\u2019t even include previsualization (rough sketches planning the scene) or the clay-model dinosaurs, sculpted and painted by a practical-effects company in Los Angeles, that were laser-scanned, sent to Vancouver and used as blueprints. Each puzzle piece \u2014 each new movement of a dinosaur\u2019s head or glint of light off water \u2014 had to be reviewed in Los Angeles, Vancouver and Austin, assessed and revised as it went up the chain of command to Malick.This is a far cry from the early days of the field, when Squires remembers laboring with a team of around 70 artists on \u201cClose Encounters.\u201d Now, blockbusters rely on hundreds of visual-effects workers per film: \u201cLife of Pi\u201d employed 500 artists in five cities, and IMDB credits nearly 2,000 people for the effects in James Cameron\u2019s \u201cAvatar.\u201d (WETA, the effects company that led the movie, says the actual number may well be higher.) \u201cNow, you\u2019re a cog,\u201d Squires says; with rare exceptions, the director probably has no idea who any given VFX artist is or what he or she is doing.Visual-effects workers want American politicians to step up to protect the industry. But this modern work force doesn\u2019t really fit into many of the solutions created for last century\u2019s workers. There have been attempts at unionizing \u2014 VFX is one of the few major sectors of the film industry that hasn\u2019t \u2014 but now that the market is global, artists are afraid of anything that might drive up labor costs. Daniel Lay, a former visual-effects artist who has become an activist for the industry, once wanted to petition the Commerce Department to add a countervailing duty (essentially a tariff) on visual effects created in subsidized markets, but he couldn\u2019t raise enough support from the industry to pay the legal fees. Even if he could have, the lawyer his advocacy group worked with, David Yocis, admits that it would have been a tricky case to make. First, they would have to persuade the Commerce Department that visual effects constitute \u201cmerchandise.\u201d Then they would have to figure out how to impose a duty on a bunch of data transmitted over the internet, a regulatory puzzle no one seems to have figured out how to crack.It\u2019s worth pointing out that most of the visual-effects artists I spoke to \u2014 in Los Angeles, Vancouver, London and elsewhere \u2014 say they enjoy the international nature of the work. Bob Wiatr, who worked at Sony Imageworks before moving to Vancouver, remembers that when he was beginning his career in the 1990s in Hollywood, the industry was all \u201cwhite American males\u201d; now he has colleagues from Mexico, Germany, Australia and South America. \u201cIt\u2019s like a whole world in one place,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s always something to learn from someone else.\u201dRobb Gardner, a lighting technical artist who has worked on films like \u201cJurassic World\u201d and \u201cRango,\u201d reminisces about living in a hotel overseas for several months while working on one particularly big film. \u201cEvery floor of that hotel had workers from all over the world,\u201d he says. But \u201cthey all had families waiting back where they came from,\u201d he added. There\u2019s a nickname for visual-effects workers\u2019 spouses: VFX widows and widowers. Gardner has moved internationally for work six times over nine years and admits that it\u2019s \u201ca huge stress to your personal life.\u201d\u201cEvery time you hear some sort of speech that\u2019s supposed to inspire you, it\u2019s: \u2018Don\u2019t give up on your dreams. Stick to it,\u2019\u2009\u201d Breaux said. The job in London should have been a dream come true, and his fianc\u00e9e reminded him that moving could be an adventure: He knew people in London, he spoke the language, the transition wouldn\u2019t be too hard.The problem was the uncertainty of it all. Would they be moving for good? Should they sell their house, their furniture, their cars? Or would they be back in Los Angeles within the year? What if the office laid everyone off? Or asked them to move to Vancouver, or Louisiana, or New Zealand, or whatever location offered the deepest labor discount? For every place that decides it can\u2019t afford to pay to keep the movies around anymore, Breaux said, \u201cthere are five more places that are like, \u2018We\u2019re going to get Hollywood here, and we\u2019re going to be next!\u2019\u2009\u201dHe\u2019s right to wonder whether London and Vancouver will keep their places atop the VFX heap for long. Yes, the Oscar for best visual effects has gone to companies based in London for the past four years, and British Columbia, which has invested just over $2 billion to support the film industry since 2003, is now home to 28 visual-effects houses. But Kevin Klowden, an economist at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica who has been studying the visual-effects industry for years, cautions that it might not last. His opinion is that the two cities\u2019 fates may diverge. London already had a strong talent pool, even before the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d films and the tax relief, making it easier for a strong network of companies to develop. And its tax rebates are funded by the British lottery, a stable source of money that is less subject to political whims. Vancouver, on the other hand, \u201chas always had a hard time supplying enough local talent,\u201d Klowden says \u2014 and its generous subsidies could easily be changed or removed by any new government that doesn\u2019t want to hand millions of dollars to movie studios every year.Even with help from the government, visual effects can still be a hard business. Although London\u2019s Moving Picture Company just won an Oscar for \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d one former employee says it recently laid off that film\u2019s entire compositing team. (The company declined to comment.) And many other places \u2014 including Germany, Australia and various Canadian provinces and American states \u2014 now offer incentives programs of their own.The VFX industry \u201chas already shown that it can move within a matter of a few years,\u201d Klowden says. \u201cThe trend is such that you can very easily see it move again.\u201d Digital industries, after all, are much easier to relocate than factories \u2014 as long as the workers are willing to follow.Mallory Pickett is a freelance journalist who covers science, technology and the environment.

{"Headline": "In Rare Unity, Hospitals, Doctors and Insurers Criticize Health Bill", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byThe bill\u2019s impact is wide-ranging, potentially affecting not only the millions who could lose coverage through deep cuts in Medicaid or no longer be able to afford to buy coverage in the state marketplaces. With states allowed to seek waivers from providing certain benefits, employers big and small could scale back what they pay for each year or reimpose lifetime limits on coverage. In particular, small businesses, some of which were strongly opposed to the Affordable Care Act, could be free to drop coverage with no penalty.The prospect of millions of people unable to afford coverage led to an outcry from the health care industry as well as consumer groups. They found an uncommon ally in some insurers, who rely heavily on Medicaid and Medicare as mainstays of their business and hope the Senate will be more receptive to their concerns.\u201cThe American Health Care Act needs important improvements to better protect low- and moderate-income families who rely on Medicaid or buy their own coverage,\u201d Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s trade group, said in a strongly worded statement.Others were even more direct about the effects the bill would have, not only on patients but also on the industry. \u201cTo me, this is not a reform,\u201d said Michael J. Dowling, the chief executive of Northwell Health, a large health system in New York. \u201cThis is just a debacle.\u201dHospitals that serve low-income patients \u201cwill just be drowning completely when this happens,\u201d Mr. Dowling said, noting that more people would become uninsured at the same time that government payments to cover their costs were reduced.In contrast to hospital and doctor groups, insurers had largely remained silent about their reservations, perhaps in the hopes of bartering their low profile in exchange for assurances that billions of dollars in subsidies for low-income coverage would continue. The White House and Congress have gone back and forth about their willingness to pay for the subsidies, prompting anxiety among some companies. Several, including Anthem, have threatened to sharply raise their prices or leave markets altogether without the funding.An analysis of how House Republicans voted on the bill.But a few, including Blue Shield of California, came out in opposition to the bill before the vote. \u201cWe feel compelled to oppose it,\u201d said Paul Markovich, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt raises the specter that the sickest and neediest among us will be disproportionately hit in losing access.\u201dAfter the House passed the bill on Thursday, the industry\u2019s two major trade groups urged lawmakers to increase the tax credits available to help people pay for coverage, and to adjust them to assist those who are older, live in high-cost areas or have lower incomes.But the overriding concern \u2014 for insurers, many workers and officials throughout the health care systems in many states \u2014 is the broad reductions proposed for Medicaid. Even for insurers that have largely abandoned the individual market, like UnitedHealth Group and Aetna, a substantial portion of their business is providing coverage under Medicaid. The same is true for many local nonprofit plans, said Ceci Connolly, the chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans.Employers and others said they were also concerned about the effects on freelancers, who do not have a traditional employer but are self-employed or contract workers in the so-called gig economy.Depending on their income, those workers have shuttled between Medicaid and the individual insurance market under the federal health care law, which offered a greater level of stability, said Nell Abernathy, vice president for research and policy at the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning economic research organization.\u201cA huge swath of Americans are in insecure work arrangements,\u201d she said. \u201cThis repeals that level of security, which was not perfect, but it was a step in the right direction.\u201dIn other people\u2019s view, employees of small businesses would lose out if Medicaid were rolled back or the exchanges became threadbare, because many smaller companies rely on employees\u2019 ability to obtain coverage through the government program or individual market.A step-by-step look at what needs to happen before it can become law.The Main Street Alliance, a group of small-business owners that supported the Affordable Care Act, said four million small-business owners, employees and self-employed entrepreneurs had gained insurance under the law, and that an additional six million small-business workers had signed up for Medicaid through the law\u2019s expansion.\u201cThis bill leaves small-business owners in a terrible position, one they were all too familiar with before the A.C.A.: unable to afford premium hikes year to year, unsure their employees will be healthy and able to work, and uncertain of the future of their businesses,\u201d said Amanda Ballantyne, national director of the Main Street Alliance.The recent amendments to the bill also raised questions about coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions, which has become an emotional flash point for opposition. The bill would allow states to waive some of the current rules banning insurers from charging sick people more or excluding certain benefits, and those waivers could have broad effects if employers are no longer required to provide comprehensive coverage. Before the Affordable Care Act, many employers capped how much they would pay for care over a person\u2019s lifetime at $2 million, said Tracy Watts, a senior partner at Mercer, a benefits consultant.While it is unclear what states would allow under a waiver or when such waivers would go into effect, employers could revisit the limits and drop types of benefits if a state deemed them nonessential.A January survey of 666 employers by Willis Towers Watson, a benefits consultant, found that while many employers planned to keep most of the mandatory benefits, a significant minority were already mulling changes. While half indicated that they were unlikely to reinstate lifetime limits, 15 percent said they would consider doing that.And employer groups generally favored provisions of the bill that would reduce taxes, particularly the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans, which was delayed for several years. Employers favor its overall repeal.Some health care groups, like medical device manufacturers, supported the bill because of specific provisions like the repeal of a 2.3 percent device tax under the Affordable Care Act. That tax was suspended for two years in 2015, but the industry wants a permanent repeal. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry\u2019s largest trade group, said it had not taken a position on the bill.Unlike doctors and hospitals, which would most likely experience an immediate hit if millions of Americans lost insurance, medical device manufacturers and the drug industry would probably feel a more muted effect. The drug industry, for example, might sell fewer products and lose revenue.\u201cFewer patients are treated, so it\u2019s bad for them, but it\u2019s a lot worse for hospitals and the impact on physicians,\u201d said Ronny Gal, an analyst for Bernstein who covers the drug industry. \u201cThey\u2019re a little bit on the tail end of this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Priming the Pump: The Economic Metaphor Trump \u2018Came Up With\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byThe Best WordsExplaining why he seeks tax cuts even if they risk expanding the budget deficit, President Trump said that they might increase the deficit temporarily, but that \u201cwe have to prime the pump.\u201d\u201cHave you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event?\u201d the president said.Yes, the interviewer \u2014 who, again, is an editor of The Economist \u2014 confirmed.\u201cHave you heard that expression used before? Because I haven\u2019t heard it. I mean, I just \u2026 I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good.\u201dHoo boy. Let\u2019s unpack this.What is Mr. Trump talking about?\u201cPriming the pump\u201d is a common metaphor for using government tax and spending to try to boost the economy into a higher level of functioning.The economics metaphor is that the government might increase economic growth by pumping a little extra cash into the system, perhaps by spending money on jobs programs, or, to use Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred policy, cutting taxes. The hope is that the economy then takes off on its own, just as adding a little water to a pump enables water to flow freely.Did he invent the term?The term is most closely associated with the economic theories of John Maynard Keynes, who advocated energetic intervention to try to arrest the depression. By the time Mr. Trump was in school in the 1950s and 1960s, it was widely taught in history and economics courses as part of the story of how the United States emerged from the depression.The concept was widely discussed again in 2009 and subsequent years in the context of the Obama administration\u2019s stimulus package, which aimed to jolt the United States out of the deep recession. A Nexis search shows the phrase \u201cpump priming\u201d or its variants appeared in 1,073 news articles in major publications in 2009 alone, and they are almost all referring to economics, not water pumps.In fact, arguably \u201cpriming the pump\u201d is now a \u201cdead metaphor,\u201d or a metaphor in which the original evocative meaning is largely lost. Not many people have a home water pump they need to prime anymore, after all. Other dead metaphors include \u201cchamping at the bit\u201d (technically a reference to obstreperous horses) or \u201cselling like hot cakes\u201d (an early term for pancakes, which were in high demand in the 19th century).Does Trump really think that he invented it?A more generous reading of the interview with The Economist suggests that perhaps he didn\u2019t literally mean that he came up with the term on his own; he seemed to know that it was a phrase that the editors might have already heard. Still, this fits with a pattern in which the president seems to learn of widely known, widely discussed concepts and view them as novel and revelatory.For example, he seemed surprised when the Chinese president explained why his country couldn\u2019t simply coerce North Korea into more agreeable behavior, and he has expressed wonderment that health care policy is complicated.Is now a really good time to be priming the pump?Perhaps workers who have left the labor force could be coaxed back in with faster economic growth, or the right mix of tax and regulatory policies could unleash higher productivity growth. But those are more esoteric arguments than the standard \u201cprime the pump\u201d concept.To extend the metaphor, it\u2019s hard to prime a pump when the water is already flowing just fine.Are there any other concepts from Keynesian economics the president might wish to learn about?The stock market, Keynes argued, was much like a hypothetical beauty contest in which readers of a newspaper had not simply to vote for whom they found most beautiful, but to predict whom others would find most beautiful. This in turn would create perverse feedback loops that might lead to winners who aren\u2019t actually the most beautiful.For a former owner of the Miss Universe pageant, this would seem to be a financial idea that would be easy to remember \u2014 or maybe to invent all over again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Senators Pull Away From Trump, Alarmed at His Volatility", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, increasingly unnerved by President Trump\u2019s volatility and unpopularity, are starting to show signs of breaking away from him as they try to forge a more traditional Republican agenda and protect their political fortunes.So far, Republicans have refrained from bucking the president en masse, in part to avoid undermining their intense push to put health care and tax bills on his desk this year. And the Republican leadership, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, remains behind Mr. Trump.But with the White House lurching from crisis to crisis, the president is hampering Republicans\u2019 efforts to fulfill his promises.\u201cAll the work that goes into getting big things done is hard enough even in the most tranquil of environments in Washington,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican operative who worked for John A. Boehner when he was the House speaker. \u201cBut distractions like these can become a serious obstacle to aligning the interests of Congress.\u201dWhen Congress and the White House are controlled by the same party, lawmakers usually try to use the full weight of the presidency to achieve legislative priorities, through a clear and coordinated vision, patience with intransigent lawmakers and message repetition. Mr. Trump\u2019s transient use of his bully pulpit for policy messaging has upended that playbook.\u201cIt does seem like we have an upheaval, a crisis almost every day in Washington that changes the subject,\u201d Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has been trying to advance health care legislation, said in a television interview on Thursday night.In the days after Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, the mood was different, as Republicans expressed high hopes that they could move quickly on a conservative agenda that merged with Mr. Trump\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be an enthusiastic supporter almost all the time,\u201d Mr. McConnell said of Mr. Trump in November.Lawmakers are also bucking the president by pushing ahead with bipartisan measures on sanctions against Russia. And this month, Republicans rejected many of the administration\u2019s priorities in a short-term spending measure, including money for a wall along the border with Mexico.Two Republican senators who face potentially tough re-election fights next year \u2014 Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona \u2014 have been unabashed in their criticism of Mr. Trump and his administration, which they have clearly begun to view as a drag on their political prospects.\u201cIn Arizona, we grow them independent,\u201d Mr. Flake said, noting the unpopularity in his state of Mr. Trump\u2019s views on the border wall and Nafta. \u201cI expect people want someone who will say, \u2018I\u2019m voting with Trump on the good stuff and standing up to him on the not good stuff.\u2019\u201dSome Republicans, like Mr. Ryan, have preferred to keep the focus firmly on the good stuff. Mr. Ryan has remained in harmony with the president, last month calling him \u201ca driven, hands-on leader, with the potential to become a truly transformational American figure.\u201dMr. Trump retains the support of about 80 percent of Republican voters, and although his overall popularity is at historic lows at this point in a presidency, it remains well above the depths eventually reached by presidents like George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter. At those levels, larger numbers of lawmakers might start to turn away from Mr. Trump \u2014 though even if they wanted to do so, Republicans would not be able to completely separate themselves from him on issues like a tax overhaul, where his blessing would be needed to move forward in any major way.Any bills that require 60 votes to pass \u2014 almost everything aside from Republicans\u2019 health care and tax measures \u2014 will be impossible to advance without the help of Democrats.Republicans had been counting on Senate Democrats who are up for re-election next year in states won by Mr. Trump to bend to their will. But so far those Democrats, like Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, have been largely comfortable standing against Mr. Trump, especially when their Republican colleagues tell them that they, too, have had about enough.\u201cI\u2019m hearing more and more of them say privately that they are more and more concerned,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cMore importantly, there is a lot less fear of him than there was just a month ago.\u201dAlready, Republicans are talking openly about rejecting components of the budget request that Mr. Trump is expected to release in two weeks. Any new request for money for a border wall would almost certainly be rejected, as would large cuts to drug control programs.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, has spoken in support of the programs on the Senate floor, and Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, which has had large numbers of opioid deaths, issued a news release calling on the administration to \u201cpropose a realistic budget that demonstrates the administration\u2019s commitment to combating drug addiction.\u201dIf it does not, she warned in a letter to Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, \u201cI will lead a bipartisan group of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and in the Senate to reject those proposed cuts.\u201dDuring his campaign, Mr. Trump found a winning message in criticizing trade agreements. But traditionally pro-trade Republicans \u2014 after yielding for a while to his rejection of such deals, including when he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first full weekday in office \u2014 have begun to push back. The president has vacillated on whether to also abandon Nafta.\u201cIf you cancel Nafta, you harm the economy of my state,\u201d said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Mr. Flake concurred: \u201cOur trade relationship with Mexico is a positive, and not just in an economic sense, but in terms of security as well,\u201d he said, citing cooperation between Mexican and American authorities on combating drug trafficking.Mr. Trump should also not expect Congress to give Russia a pass over its actions in Ukraine, Syria and the 2016 American election.\u201cMy sense is that Congress is going to act on sanctions against Russia,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is working on bills now. \u201cWe plan to be very much in the middle of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Walker, a professor at Wesleyan University, wrote in The New York Times Book Review that her authoritative biography of Garvey was \u201can interesting and intelligent attempt to break away from clich\u00e9s and acrimony\u201d over his willfulness and attraction to the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s notion of racial purity. Instead, he wrote, Professor Stein delved into Garvey\u2019s success in moving from \u201cagitation to organization.\u201dIn an Op-Ed article in The Times in 1983 Professor Stein recommended that Garvey be pardoned for his conviction in 1923 and subsequent deportation on trumped up mail-fraud charges involving his Black Star shipping line.\u201cThe record exposes political motivation at every stage of the prosecution,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut the law must not be used for suppression of dissent, and the F.B.I. must not serve the political prejudices of its bureaucrats. Pardoning Marcus Garvey, albeit tardily, is a small step toward reaffirming this.\u201dProfessor Stein\u2019s \u201cRunning Steel, Running America: Race, Economic Policy, and the Decline of Liberalism\u201d (1998), blamed government policy as much as globalization for the steel industry\u2019s demise.In 2013, Professor Stein was named a distinguished professor at City University and was awarded a fellowship to study the expansion of the American economy in the 1990s. She attributed the economy\u2019s comeback in that decade to a \u201cneoliberal recipe for growth,\u201d whose ingredients included market solutions, fiscal discipline, liberalization of trade and deregulation.Judith Susan Stein was born on April 17, 1940, in Brooklyn to George Stein, a stockbroker, and the former Anne Shuchman, who taught history and civics at Erasmus Hall High School.She graduated from James Madison High School and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Vassar College in 1960 and a doctorate in history from Yale in 1967, a year after she began teaching at City College.She is survived by her brother, Jonathan Stein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coal Jobs Prove Lucrative, but Not for Those in the Mines", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byGlenn Kellow, the coal executive who led Peabody Energy through bankruptcy, just collected an estimated $15 million stock bonus. John Eaves at Arch Coal, another recently bankrupt coal giant, got an award valued at $10 million.The view from the coal pits is far less rosy.From 2004 to 2016, the average annual wage for chief executives in the coal industry grew as much as five times faster than those of lower-paying jobs in the industry, like construction or truck and tractor operator jobs. Executive pay averaged $200,000, up 60 percent from $125,000, while paychecks for truck and tractor operators rose just 15 percent, to $43,770 from $38,060. Pay for construction jobs in mining rose just 11 percent, to $35,080 from $31,470.Pay for chief executives in the coal industry also grew much faster, on average, than that of their counterparts across the wider economy, while the average pay for coal industry construction workers failed to keep up with similar jobs in other fields. The data excludes bonuses, share options and other perks, which often inflate executive compensation \u2014 and the pay gap \u2014 many times more. Mr. Kellow\u2019s stock options in the last year, for example, are worth almost 350 times what a typical coal truck and tractor operator makes in a year.The lopsided pay structure in coal is a reflection of an economy marked by widening income inequality, where gains at the top of the income scale have come amid stagnation, or losses, at the bottom. But with coal mining, the yawning gap takes on an added significance. President Trump has made lifting the fortunes of blue-collar and rural Americans a centerpiece of his administration.And the work is a far cry from the stable, well-paying union jobs that were once the industry\u2019s norm. Average pay for a miner under a United Mine Workers of America contract comes out to at least $61,650 a year, and closer to $85,000 a year with overtime, said Phil Smith, a spokesman for the union.Instead, many coal miners now compete for temporary jobs, which pay by the hour and offer few benefits. An online posting for an underground coal miner job in Waynesburg, Pa., offered as little as $17 an hour.\u201cI\u2019m getting guys that used to be in the coal industry who left and went to work in oil and gas, and bringing those guys back,\u201d said Mr. Grose, who places workers at some of Appalachia\u2019s biggest coal producers. \u201cIt went from nothing to something.\u201d\u201cThese small outfits, if you didn\u2019t produce, you were gone,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t say nothing. You had to take what they gave you.\u201dMr. Combs was laid off at least five more times before finally, in 2014, his doctor told him his body was giving out to black lung disease. He now lives with his wife on Social Security and pension payments.\u201cNone of them are worth that,\u201d he said of the coal executives. \u201cThey get that money on the backs of the men working here.\u201dThe steep executive salaries have come despite dismal recent performances by coal companies that have driven a string of former giants into bankruptcy. Coal executives misread the market in China, racing to develop mines there only to see demand falter, which also caused American coal exports to slump. At home, they have been unable to stem a slide in the domestic market, driven by cheaper natural gas.Despite those woes, top coal executives have continued to draw hefty rewards.Peabody paid its executive team around $75 million from 2012 to 2014, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the same period, the company lost nearly $2 billion.In 2016, Alpha Natural Resources secured a $12 million bonus package for its executives during bankruptcy proceedings, saying they should be compensated for navigating the complexities of the process. The previous year, the company lost $1.3 billion.Seven Arch Coal executives received about $8 million in bonuses three days before the company filed for bankruptcy in January 2016, seeking to cut $4.5 billion in debt. An Arch Coal spokeswoman, Logan Bonacorsi, said that the company had consistently given out bonuses in the first quarter of the year, and that they were driven mainly by safety and environmental performance metrics.Some workers at Arch Coal sites, including some truck drivers, are employed by third-party businesses, and the company had \u201cno insights into wage rates\u201d at those companies, she said.Vic Svec, a Peabody spokesman, said that average industry wages were lower than those at Peabody, whose coal miners \u201ccan earn wages and bonuses nearing six figures per year.\u201d He said the majority of stock bonuses would be shared by employees below the company\u2019s executive ranks, though he declined to give a detailed breakdown.An Alpha Natural Resources spokesman, Steve Hawkins, declined to comment.Coal miners face other woes. Mr. Trump has proposed eliminating funding for programs that support laid-off miners in Appalachia. Congress, however, reached a last-minute deal this week to finance health benefits for more than 20,000 retired miners \u2014 miners whose employers have long gone bankrupt, leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to guess who they think most of,\u201d said Bob Cox in Beaver Dam, Ky., who worked in Appalachia\u2019s mine tunnels for 35 years before losing his last coal mining job in 2002, at age 56. Mr. Cox has an early stage of black lung disease.\u201cI feel like I gave them the best part of my life, and they paid me \u2014 guess the way it was supposed to be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the end, it didn\u2019t turn out in my favor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

PHILIP PARISH, BARBADOS \u2014 Almost every room in Sheena Rose\u2019s family home, tucked away on a quiet street here, has played host to her paintings and live performance art.Some visitors may have found her art a little too personal. \u201cI find that people get uncomfortable,\u201d she said during a recent interview at her home studio. \u201cBut they say that it is refreshing because Barbados is a very conservative space.\u201d\u201cThe trick is just to be honest,\u201d Ms. Rose, 31, added. \u201cPeople want to see themselves.\u201dAfter years of creating paintings and drawings in her home studio, and inviting hundreds of footsteps from the public, she is looking forward to a change.\u201cMy parents have been very supportive, but I think we all have outgrown the idea of people walking in and out of our home,\u201d she said, adding that she looks forward to moving into a new studio, which is under construction. Three times larger than her home studio, the space will be hers to use free for a year, courtesy of a patron of her work.The new studio is an encouraging next step for Ms. Rose, who returned home to the island last year after completing two years as a Fulbright scholar at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where she earned a graduate degree in studio art.

Beyond exhibitions, the two years led to a greater sense of identity and purpose as a Barbadian artist, she said.\u201cWhen you live on an island that is majority black, you don\u2019t study your skin color per se; it seems normal,\u201d Ms. Rose said. \u201cI used to paint figures without skin color,\u201d she said, adding that she now paints most of her characters black. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about the skin.

Patterson among the Caribbean artists who have inspired her work.Like almost every facet of life in the Caribbean, the art market here is heavily influenced by tourism, a billion-dollar industry that underpins many island economies.\u201cThe Caribbean is synonymous with this \u2018leave your day-to-day if you\u2019re stressed out and overworked, come and play, drink all you want, lay on the beach, pass the days away,\u2019\u201d said Oshun Layne, manager of exhibitions and programs for the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation, an organization based in New York that works to support emerging artists like Ms. Rose. \u201cWhen you\u2019re coming for leisure, what ends up happening is that the art reflects that nostalgic feeling. You\u2019re not really looking to dig deep enough to see what else is out there \u2014 what is going on in the communities that is being reflected in the art.\u201dIn addition to stand-alone art galleries in Barbados, other exhibition and gallery-like spaces are popping up in unexpected spots like the upper levels of restaurants, particularly along the island\u2019s west coast, where there\u2019s a concentration of luxury hotels and restaurants. Many offer a mix of decorative and contemporary work from local artists like Ms. Rose, Terrence Rupert Piggott and Llanor Alleyne.Still, decorative art reigns supreme.\u201cWorks geared toward the tourist aesthetic are commercially sustainable because they are tapping into this market of people that are coming and going,\u201d said Natalie McGuire, manager of Gallery NuEdge Fine Arts, in Holetown in western Barbados. \u201dThat\u2019s the majority of engagement that the clientele or even collectors at this level have.\u201dSince 2012, Ms. Rose has created versions of \u201cTown\u201d for Miami, New York, Cape Town and Amsterdam. The popularity of the series has helped build interest from collectors overseas, including the tennis star Venus Williams, who acquired a drawing from \u201cTown\u201d at an auction last year. In 2015, Penguin Press used \u201cToo Much Makeup on Her Face,\u201d a painting from \u201cSweet Gossip,\u201d as the cover of Naomi Jackson\u2019s debut novel, \u201cThe Star Side of Bird Hill,\u201d set in Barbados during the summer of 1989.The bubbly Ms. Rose, who is passionate about art advocacy, teaches visual arts at Barbados Community College in St. Michael. Still, she is grappling with whether to remain in Barbados or move abroad to a city like New York, which she said was like her second home.\u201cSome people say: \u2018Man, Sheena, you have so much going on for yourself. Why are you studying Barbados so much?\u2019 And I say: \u2018Barbados is my home. I can\u2019t help it.\u2019 I have this anxiety of \u2018Should I leave? Will things be bigger and better for me?\u2019\u201dThose questions \u2014 and possible answers \u2014 will no doubt continue to play out in her art.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Fiscal Crisis of the \u201970s Shaped Today\u2019s New York", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In 1847, the president of New York City\u2019s Board of Education, Townsend Harris, wrote a letter to the State Legislature laying out his case for a \u201cFree Academy,\u201d the precursor to City College: \u201cOpen the doors to all \u2014 let the children of the rich and the poor take their seats together, and know of no distinction save that of industry, good conduct and intellect.\u201dHarris wasn\u2019t just imagining classrooms filled equally with the city\u2019s haves and have-nots; he was promoting the notion that a first-rate college education, with its promise of social mobility and intellectual fulfillment, was a basic right of citizenship. For decades, the city kept the faith in his utopian vision as the arched gateway of City College became both a literal and metaphorical gateway into the middle class. New York City\u2019s tuition-free college system grew and expanded, even adding a graduate school in 1961.But by the early 1970s, with the city on the brink of bankruptcy, what had once been a symbol of New York\u2019s soaring spirit of liberal idealism had been transformed into a symbol of its excessive and untenable generosity. In 1976, Harris\u2019s dream officially died: New York City\u2019s university system started charging tuition, because of a \u201cnonavailability of funds.\u201dIt was just one example of the great unwinding of the social democratic city. In the years to come, what had taken progressive politicians, labor unions and citizen activists generations to build \u2014 a working-class city with a sense of common public life \u2014 would be refashioned into the two New Yorks of today, one of breathtaking wealth, the other of searing poverty. To many liberals, it\u2019s been an unfortunate trajectory; to some, a tragic one. But was it inevitable?That\u2019s the question at the heart of \u201cFear City\u201d by Kim Phillips-Fein, a historian who teaches at New York University\u2019s Gallatin School of Individualized Study. She offers a very direct answer in the book\u2019s early pages, arguing that the various decisions that set this transformation in motion during New York\u2019s infamous fiscal crisis were not simply ones of practical necessity. They were as much about politics as they were about accounting. As she puts it, \u201causterity remains a political choice.\u201dIt\u2019s a refreshingly counterintuitive point of view. The conventional wisdom has always been that New York had reached a point where it simply could no longer afford such an expansive network of public institutions and services. Sacrifices were necessary. In order to spur financial growth and protect the city\u2019s economic health in the future, the logic continued, its leaders had to empower private developers and profit-seeking industries while scaling back their own efforts to fight poverty and improve social conditions.But, as Phillips-Fein argues, none of this was a foregone conclusion when the city first confronted the fiscal crisis. She revisits the familiar story with fresh eyes, seeing it not as part of an inexorable, if painful, evolution but as a battle between two competing views of the city and its government. \u201cDid its responsibility lie in providing extensive social services and guaranteeing a set of social rights to all?\u201d she asks. \u201cOr should its main commitment be to make the city an attractive place for businesses and corporations by lowering taxes, relaxing regulations and fostering economic development?\u201dCaught in the middle was the city\u2019s hapless mayor, Abe Beame, the son of an immigrant socialist agitator and factory worker. Beame grew up on the Lower East Side in the shadow of the Jewish Daily Forward building, its facade decorated with busts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. A cum laude graduate of City College, Beame was a bookkeeper by training. (\u201cIf you don\u2019t know the buck, you don\u2019t know the job,\u201d was his campaign slogan.) He understood the depths of the city\u2019s financial woes, but was blind to many of the larger forces that shaped how the crisis played out. He assumed, for instance, that the interests of the big banks were too bound up with those of the city for them to cease lending it money, never realizing that these financial institutions were operating in an increasingly global context: \u201cNow the municipal debt was, to them, only an economic proposition \u2014 and New York\u2019s economics did not look good.\u201dBeame also failed to recognize that the political landscape was shifting. President Ford, who had the power to bail out the city, was a moderate Republican, but his party was moving to the right, beginning its migration toward the anti-government, free-market ideology later embodied by Ronald Reagan. In this sense, New York\u2019s problem presented Ford with an opportunity. Some of his closest advisers, including Alan Greenspan, William Simon and Donald Rumsfeld, urged him to make an example of the city, to treat its fiscal crisis as a case study in the broader failure of big-government liberalism.Of course, the definition of liberalism was shifting too. The postwar boom that had enabled the ambitious Great Society programs of the 1960s was over, and so too was the full-throated commitment to progressive bulwarks and principles, to labor unions and an activist government. Many of the men \u2014 and they were almost all men \u2014 who emerged from the private sector to help steer New York out of the fiscal crisis were Democrats, but not of the Beame vintage. A case in point is the financier often credited with rescuing the city, Felix Rohatyn, the master fixer who helped bring together the banks and unions, while persuading the city\u2019s leaders to reduce their spending and rethink their budgets. Here he is portrayed in a less flattering light, not as ill-intentioned but as the most prominent member of a group of unelected financial executives making critical decisions about the future of the city without any input from or accountability to its citizens.What else might have been possible? This is the one realm in which this powerful and involving work of narrative history comes up short. Phillips-Fein makes a convincing argument that the city\u2019s abandonment of its liberal ideals was a choice. What she doesn\u2019t do is offer a different path, imagine an alternative history for New York. What would have happened if the city had simply gone bankrupt and left the courts to sort things out? If the federal government hadn\u2019t been so relentlessly hostile, Phillips-Fein notes, it might have been easier for New York to renegotiate its debts. Maybe, but this explanation feels facile, given the magnitude of the city\u2019s problems. You come away from \u201cFear City\u201d with a clear sense of what was lost as New York left behind one set of priorities and embraced another, but not of what could have been salvaged or rebuilt for the benefit of the poor and working class, or of how this might have been accomplished. For that matter, there is no mention of what has been achieved, of models of public-private partnerships that have worked for all the city\u2019s residents, even in the face of its ever-widening income gap.Still, this is a book that deserves an audience beyond New York City history buffs, and all the more so because of its relevance to our political moment. The young Donald Trump makes a brief cameo appearance as an icon of the new New York, a real estate mogul who leveraged his father\u2019s connections and the city\u2019s desperation into massive tax breaks, starving the city of badly needed revenues for education and other basic municipal functions as he developed properties for the rich. These buildings are symbols too, reminders that the private investment now driving the city\u2019s economy comes at a cost, one often borne by those who can least afford it.Jonathan Mahler is a staff writer for The Times Magazine and the author of \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning\u201d and \u201cThe Challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aleppo After the Fall", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byFeatureThe door opened. A middle-aged man appeared. He had a gaunt, distinguished face, but his clothes were threadbare and his teeth looked brown and rotted. At the soldiers\u2019 encouragement, he stepped hesitantly forward into the street. He explained to them, a little apologetically, that he had not crossed his threshold in four and a half years.The man gazed around for a moment as if baffled, his eyes filling with tears. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad had just recaptured the city after years of bombing and urban warfare that had made Aleppo a global byword for savagery. This frail-looking man had survived at the war\u2019s geographic center entirely alone, an urban Robinson Crusoe, living on stocks of dry food and whatever he could grow in his small inner courtyard. Now, as he stumbled through an alley full of twisted metal and rubble, he saw for the first time that the front lines, marked by a wall of sandbags, were barely 20 yards from his house.Three months later, in March, he sat with me under the tall, spindly orange tree in his courtyard and described how he barricaded himself in when the fighting started. He goes by the name Abu Sami, and he has the mild, patient manners of a scholar; he taught at Aleppo University before the war. In the early days of the rebel takeover, he said, his nephews used to drop by with fresh bread and meat. But starting in 2013, the shelling grew worse, and he would go six months or more without seeing another human face. There was no water, no electric light; he gathered rainwater in buckets and boiled it and used a small solar panel to charge his phone. He made vinegar from grapes he grew in the courtyard. He treated his illnesses with aloe and other herbs he grew in pots. Once, when a rotten tooth became too painful, he yanked it out with pliers. He cowered by his bed when bombs shook the house to its foundation.Most of all, he sustained himself by reading. He carried out a stack of books from his bedroom to show me: treatises by Sigmund Freud, novels by Henry Miller, histories of science and psychology and religion and mythology and cooking, a book on radical theater by the American drama critic Robert Brustein. Some were in Russian, a language he learned as a young man. \u201cI read these things so I wouldn\u2019t have to think about politics or current events,\u201d he said. He read plays \u2014 Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re were favorites \u2014 and in his solitude, he found that he was able to see the entire drama acted out in his mind, as if it were onstage.He led me upstairs to see his dusty study, where the walls and ceiling were shredded with dozens of small shrapnel holes that let in fingers of sunlight. He picked up a bomb fragment, rolled it in his palm and laughed. He pointed to the house next door, where his neighbor, a quiet man who kept pigeons on the roof, had lived until a group of rebels arrived, shouting, and dragged him from the door. They brought back his corpse half an hour later.I asked Abu Sami why he never left. He gave the same answer that so many others gave me: because it was his house. And because day after day, year after year, he kept thinking, Surely this war is about to end.In the United States, the drawn-out siege of Aleppo \u2014 where the Syrian regime and its Russian allies repeatedly bombed hospitals and civilian areas \u2014 was widely deplored as a war crime comparable to the worst massacres of the Bosnian war during the 1990s. The refusal to intervene, some said, was a defining moral failure of the Obama administration. On the other side, regime supporters saw only the rebels\u2019 atrocities and their manipulation of civilians for propaganda. The \u201cfall\u201d of Aleppo, they said, was really the \u201cliberation\u201d of a city from terrorist rule, and a sign that Assad had all but won the civil war.Both portraits are false and self-serving. The Syrian tragedy started in a moment of deceptive simplicity, when the peaceful protesters of the 2011 Arab Spring seemed destined to inherit the future. Chants for freedom turned quickly to insurrection, bullets and war. But it took some time for outsiders to recognize how different Syria was, how its internal schisms \u2014 like tightly coiled springs \u2014 would provoke the fears and ambitions of all its neighbors. The Saudis and Turks wanted to replace Assad with a reliable Sunni client, while Iran and Hezbollah held fast to their one foothold in the Arab world. Russia, which intervened decisively in 2015, had its own motives: flouting American designs and protecting a reliable autocrat. The United States, having expected Assad to fall on his own, dithered over support for the rebels.Aleppo became the rebels\u2019 last major urban redoubt. Its fall reconfigured the Syrian battleground: The Saudis and Turks resigned themselves to Assad\u2019s rule, and their rivals exulted in a victory that seemed to justify years of blood and treasure. The Assad regime happily stepped out of the limelight as the world\u2019s attention turned back to capturing Raqqa, the ISIS capital in Syria\u2019s northeast.One small measure of the regime\u2019s confidence was a renewed willingness to let Western journalists \u2014 including me \u2014 travel the country. I was under the usual police-state surveillance, with a minder from the Information Ministry accompanying me during my travels outside Damascus. But scarcely any Americans had been to Aleppo since the regime\u2019s victory in December. The city had become a symbol of sorts, a sprawling commercial hub where every faction seemed to have left its mark. I had been trying to get back there for years; it was a place I loved when I covered the region from Beirut. I wanted to wind back the clock and make sense of how a city that seemed so averse to politics \u2014 of any kind \u2014 had been torn apart.Even Syrians have trouble answering that question. In March, I met a lawyer named Anas Joudeh, who took part in some of the 2011 protests. Joudeh no longer considers himself a member of the opposition. I asked him why. \u201cNo one is 100 percent with the regime, but mostly these people are unified by their resistance to the opposition,\u201d Joudeh told me. \u201cThey know what they don\u2019t want, not what they want.\u201d In December, he said, \u201cSyrians abroad who believe in the revolution would call me and say, \u2018We lost Aleppo.\u2019 And I would say, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 It was only a Turkish card guarded by jihadis.\u201d For these exiled Syrians, he said, the specter of Assad\u2019s crimes looms so large that they cannot see anything else. They refuse to acknowledge the realities of a rebellion that is corrupt, brutal and compromised by foreign sponsors. This is true. Eastern Aleppo may not have been Raqqa, where ISIS advertised its rigid Islamist dystopia and its mass beheadings. But as a symbol of Syria\u2019s future, it was almost as bad: a chaotic wasteland full of feuding militias \u2014 some of them radical Islamists \u2014 who hoarded food and weapons while the people starved.As for the regime\u2019s victory there, it probably would not have taken place if Turkey had not withdrawn some of its rebel proxies to focus on fighting the Kurds. Aleppo may have helped the regime\u2019s morale, but the war is likely to grind on for years, sustained and manipulated by outside powers. Assad needs them: His army has been decimated by war and desertions. That may help explain his use of chemical weapons in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in early April, which prompted the Trump administration\u2019s slap-on-the-wrist missile strike. With his manpower running out, Assad cares more about reinforcing his rule \u2014 at any cost \u2014 than rehabilitating his reputation in the West, which might have provided loans to help rebuild his shattered country.All the same, Aleppo was a turning point, and in some ways an emblem of the wider war. Its fall appears to have persuaded many ordinary Syrians that the regime, for all its appalling cruelty and corruption, is their best shot at something close to normality. This is almost certainly true for the Trump administration too. President Trump may call Assad an \u201canimal\u201d and hint at more airstrikes, but he cannot unseat him, because he knows that the alternative is not the kinder, gentler place once dreamed of by opposition activists. It is anarchy, where the warlords rule not from the presidential palace but from every town and every street.Everything was gone. Even the copper wiring had been stripped out. The walls were still there, but on the far side some rooms had collapsed into the courtyard after heavy shelling. \u201cYou remember the painting that was here?\u201d Freddy asked. I did. It was of a woman in Renaissance dress, the wife of the first Venetian consul in Aleppo. (Aleppo still has honorary consulships for many European countries.) The painting was memorable because it was painted in the same room where it hung; you could recognize the other objects and the shape of the wall. Freddy explained that the painting had turned up in Turkey, like much of what the rebels had stolen across Aleppo. An Istanbul antiques dealer told them that he would sell it back to them for $20,000. When they protested that it was stolen, Freddy told me, the dealer said dismissively, \u201cI get things from Syria every day.\u201dNow parts of the city were literally unrecognizable. In al-Hatab Square, once one of the prettier spots in the Old City, I found only a giant, uneven mound of rubble and earth that rose 15 feet above the street, with grass growing in it. I almost stepped on an unexploded Turkish gas bomb surrounded by yellow spring flowers. On the square\u2019s edges, half the buildings were destroyed. It was hard to believe this was once an orderly urban setting, lined with restaurants and hotels. The last time I was in Aleppo, in late 2010, I stayed at a beautiful old boutique hotel near the square, the Beit Wakil. I remember the owner taking me down into a dark, earthen-walled subbasement to show me a network of tunnels built centuries earlier. You could travel all the way to the citadel \u2014 the great medieval palace that towers over the Old City \u2014 without going aboveground, he said. They were built during the 17th century, when intermittent wars often made streets too treacherous to walk. \u201cPerhaps we will need them again,\u201d he said.One tragedy of Aleppo is that this rift between rich and poor was slowly mending in the years just before the 2011 uprisings. An economic renaissance was underway, fueled by thousands of small factories on the city\u2019s outskirts. The workers were mostly from eastern Aleppo, and the owners from the west. A trade deal with Turkey, whose border is just 30 miles to the north, brought new business and tourists and optimism. I remember sitting at cafe table with two Turkish traders just outside the citadel in late 2009. Tourists thronged all around us, and the two men talked excitedly about how new joint ventures were melting the animosity between their country and Syria. \u201cErdogan and Assad, they are like real friends,\u201d one of them said, referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.This kind of optimism was one reason the revolution took so long to reach Aleppo. All through 2011, as the rest of Syria erupted in protest, its largest city was quiet. But by 2012, in the villages just beyond the city\u2019s edges, weaponry was flowing in from across the Turkish border and battalions were being formed. \u201cThe countryside was boiling,\u201d I was told by Adnan Hadad, an opposition activist who was there at the time and belonged to the Revolutionary Military Council in Aleppo, a group led by Syrian military officers who defected. The council was eager for more European and American recognition and sensitive to Western calls for the preservation of most of Syria\u2019s state institutions. But local rural people tended to side with a more Islamist and less patient group called Liwa al-Tawheed. Tawheed\u2019s members \u201cconsidered themselves more authentic\u201d and had begun getting their own funding from Persian Gulf donors, Hadad told me. In the spring of 2012, Tawheed\u2019s members began pushing for a military takeover of Aleppo, accusing the council of excessive caution and even secret deals with the regime. The council resisted, saying they should move only when it was clear that the city\u2019s people wanted them to. In July, Tawheed took matters into its own hands. Armed insurgents flooded eastern and southwestern parts of the city, taking over civilian houses as well as police stations in the name of the revolution. Hadad considered the move a \u201cfatal mistake,\u201d he told me, and resigned from the military council.By then, eastern Aleppo had become a rebel stronghold. In early 2013, elections for provincial councils took place, giving the rebels a civilian veneer. But the councils, initially funded by the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, were soon under pressure from the Nusra Front, the Syrian Qaeda affiliate, and other hard-line groups. Later, ISIS forces captured parts of the city and forced residents to live by their rigid code. In theory, Aleppo was an embattled showplace for the Syrian revolution\u2019s aspirations. In fact, most civilians were dependent on a patchwork of armed rebel factions for food and protection. The constant pressure of war left almost no room for a real economy, and many of the city\u2019s factories had been repurposed by the rebels as military bases.Now Aleppo\u2019s great economic engine lies in ruins. One afternoon, a 45-year-old factory owner named Ghassan Nasi took me to the industrial area just west of Aleppo called Layramoon. The sounds of the city dissipated as we drove west, and when the car stopped, there was an eerie silence. An entire district that once hummed with 1,000 small factories was now abandoned, most of its buildings shattered and burned. \u201cIt is a 100 percent loss here,\u201d Nasi said. We walked down a dusty street to his factory, a textile and dyeing house that employed 130 people who worked 24 hours a day in three shifts. The door still had its metal filigree gate and marble steps. \u201cThis is where workers stamped in and out,\u201d he said.Inside, the huge factory floor was burned black and strewn with rubble. The rebels had used it to make weapons, he said. His old office had been used to house prisoners. Nasi told me quietly that he collapsed to his knees upon seeing it again last summer. \u201cI lost $10 million in machinery, $4 million in land,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we rebuild, the machinery is gone, and with the sanctions, we cannot buy new machinery.\u201d On top of that, there is inflation: The American dollar was worth 47 Syrian pounds before the crisis, and now it trades unofficially at about 520. And Turkey \u2014 where much of the Aleppo factories\u2019 machinery was transported and sold, often with the collusion of Syrian owners who wanted to avoid losing everything \u2014 now sells similar textiles for less. Reviving Syrian industry, and the social glue it might once have provided, is next to impossible.I asked Nasi what had become of his workers. He said about 70 percent of them joined the rebels. He didn\u2019t seem bitter or surprised about this. Some lived nearby, so when the area was divided, they had little choice. As for the others, they were poor and ill educated and religious, and the rebels promised them a lot. \u201cThe average salary for workers was about a hundred dollars a week,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rebels paid more.\u201d\u201cI was very scared of both sides,\u201d Yasser told me later. \u201cIf I went to one side, the other would kill me.\u201d He lay there, his limbs going numb, too frightened to move or speak for more than four hours.I met Yasser in March in Sha\u2019ar, the most devastated neighborhood in eastern Aleppo. He was short and solidly built, with a snub nose and a gruff manner. He was selling tomatoes and cucumbers from a stand, on a block where many buildings were in ruins. Across the street was a fruit stand, and next to it, a loud generator, set up by the government to supply electricity. Surprising numbers of people walked the streets. This place had been almost completely empty a few weeks earlier, but now that Russian mine-clearing teams had been through and the rubble was mostly pushed aside, Sha\u2019ar\u2019s residents were returning to their homes. (More than 100,000 went back to eastern Aleppo between January and March, according to the International Organization for Migration.) Yasser said he was one of the first people to come back, right after what he \u2014 like everyone else I met \u2014 called the liberation. It was a gesture of defiance, aimed at the rebels. \u201cWhat we lost, we will get it back,\u201d he said. He wore military fatigues, and he told me he re-enlisted in the military after he got out of the hospital in 2013. \u201cMy blood type is O-Assad,\u201d he said.Later, Yasser showed me the place where he was wounded. It was the first time he\u2019d been back since it happened, and the block had changed, like most of eastern Aleppo. \u201cThere was a checkpoint here, there were sandbags there,\u201d he said. He pointed out the first-floor window where an old man had talked to him through curtains as he lay on the street. He showed me the building where he thought the sniper had been hiding, about 100 yards away. He explained how his ordeal had ended: An airstrike hit the building, and the sniper vanished. A man on a motorbike rescued Yasser, carrying him to a house, where someone cleaned his wounds. Later, he was taken to a hospital, where a doctor told him that his mother was dead. The doctor put a needle in his arm and told him to count to three, and he blacked out.I found Yasser\u2019s story credible, and his uncle later backed it up. But as I stood on the street with him, I found myself wondering: Did he really know who shot him? Bullets were coming from each side. As he lay there bleeding, whom was he more frightened of \u2014 the rebels or the regime? Yasser clearly knew how his government is portrayed in the West and seemed defensive about it. He told me a rebel group tried to blame the regime for his mother\u2019s death. Later, he said, the same group admitted its guilt and offered blood money, which the family refused to take. This seemed less plausible. He walked me down the street to his uncle\u2019s house, where he said we would hear another story about what the rebels had done.Yasser\u2019s uncle was a big, heavyset man with a jowly face and a look of weary resignation in his eyes. He welcomed us into his tiny apartment, where he offered me a stool and sat down on his old brass bed. He sighed and apologized for being unable to offer us tea. Then he showed us his scarred arm and told us the story of how his family was devastated in January 2013. He was driving his pregnant daughter to the hospital when machine-gun fire riddled the car, killing his wife instantly and wounding everyone else. He told me rebels from the Free Syrian Army pulled them from the car and rushed them to a nearby hospital. I asked who fired on them. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.There was a silence. Until that moment, I had not heard anyone miss an opportunity to blame the rebels. With my government minder looking on, Yasser began asking where the gunfire had come from. Wasn\u2019t it from a tall building nearby? Weren\u2019t the rebels in that building? The uncle shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said again. I had the impression that he was profoundly depressed and past caring about what he was supposed to say. Yasser kept pressing. Eventually, the uncle caved in and said, Sure, it was probably the rebels. \u201cMy wife died a martyr,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the F.S.A., I cannot say, because they helped me and my wife. I cannot say how they are with other people.\u201d And then quietly, he began to cry.On my second day in the city, I went to see the Aleppo Eye Hospital, a sprawling compound that the rebels had used as a military headquarters. As we walked through the burned and shattered building, my government minder and the soldiers guarding the place kept picking up markers of the rebels\u2019 Islamist leanings. They weren\u2019t hard to find. A fire-blackened car out front still had the Qaeda logo on its hood. Inside, the rebels had put up paper signs to show how they used the rooms: a room where Shariah rulings were handed out by a religious sheikh, a document about Islamic punishments. There was a prison too, and I later met a woman who seems to have been kept there. She had been captured in a rural village, and the rebels killed her husband and then moved her from place to place, intending to trade her for their own prisoners. There were female jailers who beat and cursed her and called her an infidel. She told me she was given a bottle of water to wash herself with once every 10 to 15 days. During the final battle for Aleppo, she often heard the sounds of bombs and mortars exploding nearby, and her jailers would taunt her, saying Assad\u2019s bombs will kill you.As I walked through those ruins, it was clear enough that the rebels who ruled eastern Aleppo had done some awful things there. Yet the whole hospital tour was designed, at least in part, to mitigate or obscure a very uncomfortable fact. The Assad regime repeatedly and deliberately bombed hospitals in the rebel zone, even when there was no reason to suspect that fighters were based there. No one would discuss this with me during my time in Aleppo, even when I did not have the minder with me. Instead, I had to speak to people who fled eastern Aleppo under the terms of the deal to evacuate the city in December, when the regime recaptured it. They were living in Idlib province, to the southwest, which is held by rebels, and I spoke to them by Skype. One was a young man who worked as a nurse at the Omar bin Abdul Aziz Hospital throughout 2016. He told me that the hospital was rendered inoperable 15 times by regime airstrikes. Each time, engineers and doctors would rehabilitate it, only to see it damaged again. When the regime soldiers got too close, they moved to another hospital, called Al Quds. It was so crowded that they sometimes tended the wounded in the street outside.Stories like this have been amply documented and held up as evidence that the Assad regime is guilty of war crimes on a wide scale. A nongovernmental organization in Europe has been working for years to gather documents that would tie the Syrian leadership to these crimes in a Nuremberg-style trial. That prospect is remote, but there are signs that Assad, too, may be worried about whose eyes are watching him. This month, the State Department released satellite photographs suggesting that the regime is burning the bodies of executed prisoners in a crematory at the Sednaya prison complex, north of Damascus, in an alleged effort to hide evidence. The Syrian regime called these charges a \u201cnew Hollywood plot.\u201dIt is impossible to live in government-controlled Syria without noticing that there are almost no young men on the street. They are in the army, or they are dead. Veterans must carry their military papers with them or risk on-the-spot re-enlistment. At one checkpoint, government soldiers tried to grab the young Spanish photographer I was working with, who is easily mistaken for a Syrian; they wanted to recruit him. In Latakia, a beach town in the regime\u2019s northwestern heartland, I met a 53-year-old businessman named Munzer Nasser, who commands a militia composed almost entirely of older men; there are no young men left in his village. One of its members, he told me, is a 65-year-old whose three sons have all been killed in the war. Behind the Assad regime\u2019s atrocities lies a fear of demographic exhaustion. Its rebel opponents have no such worries: They can draw on a vast well of Islamist sympathizers across the Arab world.These facts translate into a genuine gratitude \u2014 in regime-controlled areas \u2014 toward Russia, whose military intervention in late 2015 may have forestalled a total collapse. Many Syrians say they feel reassured by the sight of Russian soldiers, because they (unlike the army and its allied militias) are not likely to loot or steal. Some of my contacts in regime-controlled areas are even learning Russian. In Latakia, some people told me that their city might have been destroyed if not for the Russians. The city has long been one of Syria\u2019s safe zones, well defended by the army and its militias; there are tent cities full of people who have fled other parts of the country, including thousands from Aleppo. But in the summer of 2015, the rebels were closing in on the Latakia city limits, and mortars were falling downtown. If the rebels had captured the area \u2014 where Alawites are the majority \u2014 a result would almost certainly have been sectarian mass murder. Many people in the region would have blamed the United States, which armed some of the rebels operating in the area. In this sense, the Russian intervention was a lucky thing for the Obama administration too. Andrew Exum, who worked in the Pentagon at the time, told me that the military drew up contingency plans for a rapid collapse of the regime. The planning sessions were talked about as \u201ccatastrophic success.\u201dYet Assad\u2019s popularity is due not only to his role as the guarantor of a secular order. He has also cannily positioned himself as a unique guardian against his own regime. Just before I arrived in Aleppo in March, a high-ranking Republican Guard commander in the city issued a public order declaring a crackdown on \u201cacts of looting, robbery and assaults on public property and on the freedoms of citizens and their private property.\u201d The order was a belated recognition of what had been going on for months: an orgy of looting by the various paramilitary groups that work alongside the Syrian Army, and even by elements of the army itself.The reporter, an Aleppan named Rida al-Basha, described the neighborhoods where this had taken place and named the militias, including the notorious Tiger Forces, whose leaders include well-known thugs. At the end of the interview, Basha said that he had pleaded with the city government and other journalists to expose these crimes, but that everyone was too frightened. After the report, Basha repeatedly said he was threatened with death, and he is said to have fled the country.Late last year, Iran abruptly suspended oil deliveries, which have become a lifeline for Syria. Iran acted because it was angry about the amount of its fuel that was being diverted and sold to rebels by regime-connected middlemen, I was told by a Syrian who has close ties to Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s ally. The suspension created a serious fuel crisis in winter. Iran resumed its supplies in mid-February, but Tehran has little choice: It needs Assad as much as he needs it. There are reports of similar tensions with the Russians, who are more interested in brokering an end to the fighting than Assad is. The Syrian businessman put it like this: \u201cBashar is like a man with two false legs \u2014 one is Russia and one is Iran. He keeps hopping from one leg to the other, because the ground he is standing on is very hot.\u201dAll this may sound awfully precarious for Assad. But in a sense, it is just a more extreme form of the game Assad and his father have played for decades. The Assad regime arose after an unstable period during the 1950s and \u201960s, when Syria was shaken by coups and countercoups. Hafez al-Assad, Bashar\u2019s father, triumphed in part by managing a constellation of rivals who hated one another but were all dependent on him. They knew that without him at the center, chaos would return, and that would be bad for business. This is truer than ever today. And it has a secondary effect, not unimportant: Many ordinary people now see Assad as their only hedge against a far more toxic kind of chaos.My Syrian businessman friend told me that he twice gathered about a dozen people for dinner and offered them a hypothetical in strict confidence. It is up to you to name the next president of Syria, he said. Whom would you choose? The guests were all Syrians, and none supported the regime. To his surprise, almost all of them named Assad. When he asked why, the same answer came back again and again: Assad is the only one who can protect us against his own devils.Anas Joudeh, the Damascus lawyer, told me that the absence of this kind of wisdom is precisely what doomed Syria. For years, he said, he and his friends cast around looking for someone to blame for the failure of the 2011 revolution. \u201cWe often asked, If only this, or if only that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I feel that what happened was destiny. Because there are no political or social forces in Syria. The regime emptied them out. So when the regime looked to make a deal in 2011, there was no one there.\u201d I took Joudeh to be saying that the regime might have been willing to share power, in some limited way, if the opposition had been more organized, more conciliatory. Perhaps it is na\u00efve to suggest that the regime could have offered genuine reforms of its own accord. Police states are not known for voluntarily giving up power in the interest of building a better future. Assad has spoken the language of reform ever since he inherited his role from his father in 2000, and he has never followed through on any of it. Still, there is one story that has haunted me.On March 30, 2011, Assad delivered a televised speech to Syria\u2019s rubber-stamp Parliament that is widely viewed in retrospect as a crucial step in the country\u2019s descent into war. He had kept silent during the previous two weeks of protest and violence. Some of his advisers and proxies had hinted, in the days beforehand, that he would make historic proposals, offering a hand to the protesters and paving the way for genuine national reconciliation. Much of the region tuned in as Assad walked up a red carpet into the Parliament building past a cheering crowd. But his speech quickly turned into a familiar, embarrassing spectacle, with lawmakers chanting his name and interrupting his speech with fawning accolades. Assad delivered a hard-line speech deriding the protesters as dupes of a foreign-backed plot to destroy the country. He closed on an ominous note, saying: \u201cThere is no compromise or middle way in this. What is at stake is the homeland, and there is a huge conspiracy. ... We have never hesitated in defending our causes, interests and principles, and if we are forced into a battle, so be it.\u201dOne former regime official told me that he recalls watching the speech with a sense of shock and dismay. He and other high-ranking officials had heard in advance the details of what the speech was supposed to say. It had been drafted, they were told, by Vice President Farouk al-Shara, and it emphasized reconciliation with the protesters. Shara had received input from several other top officials with similar inclinations. This version of the speech even had the support of Hezbollah\u2019s leaders, who believed that genuine gestures of compromise could head off a war, the former official said. Other people close to the regime have echoed this account, though there are analysts who are skeptical; it\u2019s almost impossible to be sure about what happens in Assad\u2019s secretive inner circle.What is certain is that Assad did not deliver the speech that was expected. Instead, the former official said, he scrapped it at the last minute in favor of a much more aggressive text. \u201cWhen I heard the speech, my feeling was \u2014 we are in for a long fight,\u201d the former official told me. \u201cI was in my office. We looked around at each other and did not say a word.\u201d He remains convinced that if Assad had given the other speech, the past six years would have unrolled very differently, and oceans of blood might have been spared.In my time in Syria, I met one person who seemed to evade both of these traps. I hesitate to use the word \u201chero,\u201d because he would violently reject it. But he held onto a dogged civic idealism that was divorced from hope of any kind. In a sense, he was the inverse of Abu Sami, the professor who shut himself off from the war inside his home. He was a 57-year-old engineer named Tarif Attora, who appeared to be working himself to death running a group called the Aleppo People\u2019s Initiative. He and his teams repair water pipes and electricity lines and supply food and medical aid to people in need. They do this in both regime and rebel areas, unlike the White Helmets, the rescue group that was lionized in an Academy Award-winning documentary. He is the only person I know who has the unreserved admiration of both rebel leaders and die-hard regime loyalists.I met Attora in the initiative\u2019s office, where he sat at a battered desk with a vast map of the city \u2014 east and west \u2014 on the wall behind him. The desk was covered with stacked files and old coffee mugs, and he interrupted our talk several times to bark instructions to site managers. (\u201cDon\u2019t strain the lines. You\u2019re getting 50. It should be 25 to 30.\u201d) He has steel-gray hair that is cut short and flat on the top of his head, and his face \u2014 stark, creased with vertical lines, square-jawed \u2014 looks a bit like Albert Camus\u2019s might have if he lived a decade longer.The initiative started in July 2012, when Attora gathered roughly 30 engineers and other professionals \u2014 all Aleppo residents \u2014 to talk about how they could help protect the city. Some were with the opposition, some were not, and there were arguments. They agreed on one thing: the need to keep the lights on and the water running. So they asked the authorities for permission and began reaching out to all the rebel groups. Soon they had hundreds of volunteers working with them and repair crews going everywhere, even the front lines. The state water company supplied pipes and materials, but apart from that, the initiative is entirely self-funding, Attora said. Six of its members have been killed. Many others have been wounded, including Attora.He told me several harrowing stories about his work in what he called \u201chot zones.\u201d Twice he came close to being killed, and his back is now broken in two places. Jihadi groups were in control of Aleppo\u2019s main power plant for more than a year, so he ended up dealing with them a lot. Once, he saw something that left him traumatized for months. He asked me not to report the details, because it might anger the people involved and limit his ability to work with them. Despite the trauma \u2014 which still haunts him \u2014 he did not want to jeopardize his ability \u201cto continue working in all areas,\u201d he said.I asked Attora why he does it, and he hesitated. He seemed uncomfortable dealing with abstractions. \u201cFreedom doesn\u2019t come from destroying the country,\u201d he said as he put out what must have been his 10th cigarette since our conversation started and lit another. \u201cLook, people consider me opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the way I see opposition \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean I must destroy my country and put us back 100 years. That kind of opposition is a betrayal of the country, a betrayal of the ideals I\u2019ve grown up with.\u201dHe seemed unsatisfied with his words, and he glanced around the room, as if he were looking for an excuse to stop talking and get back to his engineers. It was getting dark outside. \u201cWe all served the politics of other countries in our own land, whether we knew it or not,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has to wake up. To be brave, to admit they\u2019ve made mistakes, to come back to the right way.\u201dI stood up to shake Attora\u2019s hand and say goodbye. His face cracked into a smile, and the phone rang. He picked it up, and instantly he was at home again, supervising repairs on a power line that would probably be blown up again tomorrow.A picture caption on May 28 with an article about Syria referred incorrectly to the ruins shown in Aleppo.

{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron Embraces E.U. to Put France \u2018Back in the Picture\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byFor the past year, and longer, the European Union has been politically radioactive, deemed untouchable by most mainstream candidates for national office in Europe. Yet Mr. Macron, 39, not only embraced the embattled bloc, he proclaimed membership of it to be a necessity for France\u2019s future: needful of reform, certainly, but something to embrace rather than run from. And he defeated the most europhobic of opponents, the far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen.Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute for International Affairs in Rome, said Mr. Macron\u2019s victory had helped the bloc avoid a cataclysm. \u201cThe alternative would have been the end of the European Union,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means France is back in the picture.\u201dIf France is again vital to European affairs, any euphoria is certain to be short-lived. First, Mr. Macron faces many domestic challenges in translating his centrist promises into policy and in assuaging those millions who voted for Ms. Le Pen, cast blank ballots or did not vote at all.The populist threat to the European Union \u201cremains alive and has to be taken seriously,\u201d said Stefan Lehne, a former Austrian diplomat and a visiting scholar with Carnegie Europe. In France, \u201cmore than 40 percent of French voters opted for anti-European populist parties in the first round,\u201d he said, and in Italy, \u201cthe Five Star Movement and Northern League could easily win the general election expected to be held in February 2018.\u201dBeyond that, he added, the existing populist governments in Hungary and Poland \u201cconstantly put the values on which the E.U. is based into question.\u201d\u201cIf Macron manages to stop the populist tsunami, he\u2019ll be rewarded by his European counterparts,\u201d said Florence Gaub, a senior analyst at the European Union Institute for Security Studies in Paris. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to make some demands that other French presidents could not. Because everyone needs him to be a success, and if it stops with France, maybe it stops forever.\u201d\u201cTo be competitive again, France has to reform and kick-start its economy, and the big question is whether Germany and Merkel can help,\u201d said Stefan Kornelius, of the German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, who is a biographer of Ms. Merkel. \u201cGermany has profited from the weakness of France, but France has to do this itself.\u201dThere is serious talk in Berlin of some kind of prize to encourage Mr. Macron, with more German investment in European programs and more flexibility on deficit spending. But Germany has its own elections in September, Mr. Kornelius noted, and Ms. Merkel knows that there is little sympathy among German voters \u2014 especially among the anti-European party Alternative for Germany \u2014 for handouts to France, let alone to southern Europe.\u201cThere will be encouragement but no quick prize for Macron,\u201d Mr. Kornelius said. \u201cJust pouring money into those stagnating economies is something she\u2019s refused to do for eight years, and she won\u2019t change now,\u201d he added, referring to Ms. Merkel.Yet officials in Germany are sensitive to growing resentment in other countries toward their country\u2019s trade surpluses and voting power in the European Union, which will only grow with the British withdrawal. And the French have traditionally spoken up for the bloc\u2019s smaller countries, especially those where the state plays a larger role in the economy.Mr. Macron is pro-European, but he has said that \u201cwe have to listen to our people and listen to the fact that they are extremely angry today, impatient, and the dysfunction of the E.U. is no more sustainable.\u201d If the bloc continues as it is today, he told the BBC before the Sunday runoff, it would be a \u201cbetrayal\u201d that could lead to \u201ca \u2018Frexit,\u2019 or we will have the National Front again.\u201dOn many issues, Mr. Macron will be a natural ally for the Germans, including on European defense. France has been unusually passive in the last six months on the question of European security, whereas it is normally vocal, said Ms. Tocci of the Institute for International Affairs. \u201cHaving France back is essential for European defense, and if Macron could install some ambition, it would be very welcome,\u201d she said.For Britain, Mr. Macron\u2019s election is not good news, at least on the face of things. Prime Minister Theresa May says that Britain wants a strong European Union as a partner even after it leaves. But Mr. Macron, a former banker, has taken a tough stand on the British withdrawal, known as Brexit, criticizing European leaders for trying to make a special deal with former Prime Minister David Cameron before Britons even voted to leave the bloc.Mr. Macron has refused any special post-withdrawal deal for the City of London, Britain\u2019s financial heart. He has also warned that British financial institutions should not be able to sell their services in the eurozone and has called openly for bankers, researchers and academics to leave Britain and move to France.After Mr. Macron\u2019s victory, however, his top economic adviser, Jean Pisani-Ferry, used softer words on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has an interest in a hard \u2018Brexit,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Pisani-Ferry told the BBC. \u201cThere is a mutual interest in keeping prosperity that exists.\u201dStill, he said of Mr. Macron, \u201cThere will be a tough negotiation, and he will be tough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Strength and Its Shopping Lift Alibaba\u2019s Results", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s vast ranks of consumers are finding ways to spend more money online \u2014 and that\u2019s good news for Alibaba.Alibaba\u2019s results offer a positive sign for those tracking China\u2019s efforts to transform its economy to rely less on government spending and more on American-style consumption. But they also show Alibaba is finding more ways to get the businesses that set up shop on its e-commerce platforms to give it more money.But there are challenges. The results show Alibaba has a long way to go before it can diversify its business amid expectations that even China\u2019s online sales boom has its limits. And Alibaba is increasingly dipping its toe into American politics at an uncertain time.Alibaba said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 85 percent to $1.4 billion, thanks to strong sales as well as selling some investments. Sales across its e-commerce businesses rose 47 percent.While that\u2019s good news for the company, full-year results showed a more complex picture. Alibaba\u2019s revenue for the year grew more than twice as fast as its gross merchandise volume, a measure of sales volume, meaning much of the rise did not come from simply selling more stuff. Alibaba also is finding ways to squeeze more money out of vendors big and small, either by offering new services or charging more for existing ones.Because even China can\u2019t grow forever, Alibaba is hoping to find new sources of revenue. One of the most promising, according to analysts, has been to introduce its own business providing back-end computing to businesses \u2014 much like Amazon Web Services. While growth in the business remains strong, it is from a small base, and some analysts have signaled concern about increasing competition. In the quarter, Alibaba\u2019s cloud revenue more than doubled, to $314 million.It has also expanded into online entertainment and film, hoping to make use of its advertising data and customers to become a cultural force. The company\u2019s main online video acquisition, Youku Tudou, has fallen behind rivals in users and time spent per user. While in the long term it could pay off, in the shorter term heavy investment in content could cut into Alibaba\u2019s margins.Over all, the businesses outside Alibaba\u2019s core commerce business were unprofitable in the quarter.Alibaba has said this year will be the year it pushes in earnest outside China\u2019s borders. While the company\u2019s core business is still in China, some signs show that its efforts overseas are starting to pick up steam. In a recent note the boutique investment bank China Renaissance pointed out that Lazada, a Southeast Asian e-commerce company that Alibaba invested in last year, now leads in market share in the six major countries in the region. Alibaba\u2019s primary branded overseas e-commerce site, AliExpress, has also been picking up customers in Brazil, Russia and Eastern Europe, according to China Renaissance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Culprits Behind White Flight", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPrinceton, N.J. \u2014 In Agatha Christie\u2019s \u201cMurder on the Orient Express,\u201d the detective Hercule Poirot proposes an improbable theory to explain an improbable murder: Maybe they all did it. Twelve riders each stabbed the victim once, making it impossible to know who struck the fatal blow.Poirot\u2019s solution offers some insight into a debate among journalists and Democratic strategists: Was Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory due to his voters\u2019 racism or their economic anxiety? The right answer might be that it was both.A similar question of \u201cwhodunit\u201d inspired my research on the history of postwar white flight. White movement to the suburbs coincided with a period of substantial black migration out of the rural South: From 1940 to 1970, four million blacks settled in industrial cities in the North and West. As they moved in, the fraction of white metropolitan households living in the typical Northern or Western central city fell from two-thirds to one-third.Ta-Nehisi Coates refers to the white exodus as a \u201ctriumph of racist social engineering,\u201d and he is not wrong. Many white households moved to suburban towns precisely because black households were effectively excluded from them by real estate agents and mortgage brokers. But that\u2019s not the whole story. Even in cities like Minneapolis-St. Paul that had few black migrants, the suburbs were a magnet for newly prosperous families after World War II seeking larger houses and more open space.And so I found myself caught in the same debate: Did whites leave cities for racial reasons or for economic ones?Some additional data can help. I compared the patterns of black migration into cities and white departures for the suburbs in 70 Northern and Western metropolitan areas from 1940 to 1970. I found that for every black arrival, two whites left the central city. This figure puts a precise value on what contemporaries already suspected: When black people moved in, white people moved out.Yet only a portion of white flight can be traced back to the now-classic dynamic of racial turnover. Cities were simply too segregated by race for many urban whites to encounter black neighbors. Newly available Census Bureau maps show that in 1940, the average white urban household lived three miles away from a black enclave. By 1970, urban areas adjacent to historical black enclaves became majority black, but distant city neighborhoods remained predominantly white \u2014 no different in racial composition from the surrounding suburbs.We can get further insight by focusing on residents of city-suburban borders. The city side of the border was often indistinguishable from its suburban counterpart across the street: It was overwhelmingly white, characterized by tree-lined roads with single-family houses and close to the same parks and shopping districts. There was one difference: By staying within the city limits, households remained part of the urban electorate.City voters were more racially diverse and poorer than the suburban electorate, and thus less able to offer low property taxes or high-quality public services. If border residents also fled the city as black migrants arrived, even though black enclaves were miles away, these departures signaled a concern about broader city finances rather than a dislike of immediate black neighbors.Not surprisingly, houses on the suburban side of the border have always been a little more expensive than their city counterparts. Using data on 100 border neighborhoods in the 1960s and 1970s, I find that this cross-border housing price gap grew by a few percentage points \u2014 to a 7 percent suburban housing price premium from a 5 percent premium \u2014 as black migrants flowed into the city, even though new black arrivals lived miles away. Households in these areas were motivated by concerns about how a changing local electorate would affect property taxes and service levels. In fact, for this set of households, what mattered most about the new Southern arrivals crowding into neighborhoods across town was not their race but their lower levels of income.That doesn\u2019t mean racism wasn\u2019t a motivating factor. For the third of white households near a black enclave in 1940, concerns about new black neighbors was indeed a primary motivation. And those households moved out of the city at a higher rate than others, contributing more than a third to the white exodus. But for the remainder of urban whites, most of whom never interacted with a black family, leaving for the resource-rich suburbs was an economic calculus, one that was accelerated by the steady stream of poor migrants, both white and black, into central cities.Just like Trump voters in 2016, different people in the same group \u2014 white urban households \u2014 took the same action, around the same time, but for different reasons. To complicate the picture, few of them left personal accounts, and they may not have been able to articulate exactly why they moved. We are left reconstructing the pieces through careful detective work. In my own work, I have found that Poirot is often right: Each suspect wielded his own knife.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economists See Little Magic in Tax Cuts to Promote Growth", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byIf one assumption has undergirded Republican economic policy for decades \u2014 and is the foundation of the Trump administration\u2019s first budget proposal \u2014 it is that tax cuts will unleash fantastic growth.The basic idea is that shrinking the government\u2019s share increases what people take home, encouraging workers to work more and investors to invest more. But while taxes can create incentives that can promote growth, liberal and conservative economists alike said there was no evidence that the White House budget announced on Tuesday would do so.The Trump administration promises to cut taxes, keep revenues steady and crank out average annual economic growth of 3 percent, but neither the budget nor the tax reforms previously outlined in sketchy form provide enough detail to figure out if that will happen.While the United States cruised along with 3 percent growth \u2014 and higher \u2014 in the late 1990s and mid-2000s, growth has not reached anywhere near that level since well before the recession. The best showing in the past decade was in 2015, when the annual rate of expansion hit 2.6 percent.Since mid-March, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond have fallen from 2.62 percent to 2.28 percent on Tuesday, a sign that traders are discounting the likelihood of a sudden pickup in growth.Government spending would be cut substantially. See how every budget item would be changed.An analysis of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan by the bipartisan, nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the federal debt would rise by $5.5 trillion over the first decade. Even if lower taxes encouraged people to save and invest more, the huge government deficits created by the budget would crowd out private investors and offset some of those direct effects, several economists said.Alan D. Viard, a tax expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington, said he and other researchers had repeatedly found that \u201cdeficit-financed tax cuts were usually harmful to growth.\u201dCutting the tax on investment income, for example, delivers the most bang for the buck, Mr. Viard said, but unless the lost revenue is made up through increases in other taxes or spending cuts, the deficit will balloon and economic growth will suffer.Previous presidents have not had a lot of success using tax cuts to spur growth. \u201cThe historical record is pretty clear that large tax cuts don\u2019t pay for themselves through economic growth,\u201d said Michael J. Graetz, a professor of tax law at Columbia University.The 1981 tax cut that President Ronald Reagan pushed through did provide a short jolt to the economy, Mr. Graetz said, but he pointed out that the administration was compelled to raise taxes in 1982 and 1984 to keep the deficit under control.Tax cuts championed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 performed even worse. While the cuts temporarily stimulated spending by putting more money in people\u2019s pockets, they did not have much impact in enhancing the economy\u2019s ability to produce goods and services.Both President Trump and the House Republicans\u2019 proposals reserve the biggest tax cuts for the wealthiest. Slashing rates at the top is probably the least effective way of spurring spending, however, because high-income households have the luxury of socking away a financial windfall, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at the research firm IHS Markit. The Trump plan, he said, \u201ccould well end up hurting a lot of poor people without boosting growth.\u201d\u201cIf you tilt the tax cuts toward lower-income households, they will spend more of it,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said. \u201cThere is virtually no debate among economists about that.\u201dAnd the deep cuts in the budget to programs that benefit primarily those at the bottom of the economic ladder will, if anything, reduce their spending.The Trump administration on Tuesday released its 2018 budget, called \u201cA New Foundation for American Greatness.\u201dThe left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that the budget cuts would decrease growth by more than 1 percent by 2020.Many economists on the left and the right agree that the current code as it applies to businesses is misguided: It puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage and encourages corporations to keep income abroad. But fixing that problem isn\u2019t merely a matter of slashing rates.\u201cWith the economy back to near full employment, conventional tax cuts or stimulus spending won\u2019t have that much of an effect,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cWhat is needed are policies that genuinely augment the supply side of the economy.\u201dWhat might that look like? Instead of simply cutting rates, Mr. Holtz-Eakin would opt for incentives for business to invest in new equipment or software, infrastructure investments that speed transportation and ease other frictional costs, and retraining that improves workers\u2019 skills and increases the proportion of prime-age Americans who are employed.Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute added tax relief for child-care expenses to the list of reforms that could bolster growth.There are lots of reasons to tinker with the tax code, many experts say, but the notion that there is a simple cause-and-effect relationship between cuts and growth is faulty. \u201cTax policy is clearly not some overwhelmingly powerful tool that affects growth,\u201d Mr. Viard said. There are simply too many other things \u2014 like technology, worker productivity and aging \u2014 that can either muffle or overwhelm their impact.In the months after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in November, many business leaders and investors thought that the Washington logjam might finally break and that corporate tax reform, more infrastructure spending and other growth-friendly policies would be passed by Congress and signed into law.But with Washington and the White House now distracted by the investigation into possible ties between former Trump aides and Russia, momentum for major tax cuts or a big infrastructure bill has stalled.On Friday, the government will announce revised figures for growth in the first quarter of 2017, but not much improvement from the initial 0.7 percent estimate last month is expected.Advertisement"}

The work sold for $57.4 million with fees after nine minutes of vigorous competition from at least five bidders in the room and on the phones.The head was quickly rumored to have been sold to the media mogul David Geffen over the phone, although the art adviser who won the lot, Tobias Meyer, declined to comment on his way out of the auction room and Mr. Geffen, reached by phone, said he was not the buyer.\u201cIt was a fantastic piece,\u201d Nicholas Maclean, a dealer, said afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the great subjects, was an early cast and was in extraordinary condition. They just never come up for sale.\u201dThe auction, which kicked off this week of spring sales in New York, was respectable despite the room\u2019s low energy (perhaps in part because of the deliberative auctioneer), raising a total of $289.2 million with 78 percent of the 55 lots sold.The auctions are expected to test the resilience of the art market in the Trump economy, although the administration\u2019s tax policies \u2014 which will affect collecting \u2014 remain an open question.The abstract female head was one of six bronze versions of a sculpture first made by Brancusi, a Romanian-born sculptor, in Paris in white marble in 1909-10. The stone version is now in the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.The total for the night\u2019s auction was double the $141.5 million Christie\u2019s took at the equivalent sale last May, which contained 51 artworks.Advertisement"}

Fine Gael currently leads a minority government under an agreement with Fianna Fail, which remains officially in opposition but effectively wields a veto.It is possible, though, that the party will turn to someone else. After protracted discussions over who will lead the party after Mr. Kenny, some Fine Gael members are hoping that a dark-horse candidate will emerge.Mr. Kenny appeared to make his departure inevitable in February, when he contradicted himself in statements to Parliament about what he knew about some aspects of the police scandal and when he knew it. The scandal revolves around efforts by senior officers to smear a police whistle-blower.At just over six years, Mr. Kenny\u2019s tenure as prime minister is the longest in his party\u2019s history. Though he managed to retain power in the general election last year, his coalition lost dozens of seats and could not assemble a working majority, necessitating the \u201cnonaggression pact\u201d with Fianna Fail and the formation of a minority government.His departure could now lead to another election, if Fianna Fail decides not to allow his successor as party leader to also succeed him as prime minister. An opinion poll published last weekend by the newspaper The Sunday Times showed the two parties in a virtual tie; either one would need a coalition of smaller parties and independent lawmakers to govern.Mr. Kenny, a former teacher, has been praised in Europe for his role in stabilizing the Irish economy after the financial crash of 2008, when the government stepped in to absorb at least 40 billion euros (about $45 billion) in banking losses. At home, though, critics say his party\u2019s austerity policies have worsened inequality.Among the difficult issues his successor will face are the consequences of Britain\u2019s coming withdrawal from the European Union. Britain is Ireland\u2019s largest trading partner, and the prospect of a \u201chardened\u201d border is unpopular.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expert Doubts China\u2019s Population Number, Saying India May Be No. 1", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byBut Yi Fuxiang, a Chinese scientist based in Wisconsin, boldly challenged that assumption this week in Beijing. He laid out arguments that India may already be more populous than China, a view that has created a controversy about whose numbers to believe in forecasting China\u2019s demographic and economic destiny.Mr. Yi\u2019s claims met skepticism from demographers, who said he had misread or exaggerated statistical discrepancies. But Mr. Yi said he was not just splitting statistical hairs. China\u2019s birthrate will determine the size of the work force sustaining its economy, and the data indicated that stagnation could occur in coming decades, he said.Family planning policies, sometimes enforced with sterilizations and abortions, have ended, but left a lasting imprint on policies and attitudes, Mr. Yi said.\u201cEven if family planning stopped, habits die hard,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, our structure is where Japan was in 1992, and our economic waning will be a long-term trend.\u201dOther demographers strongly disagreed with Mr. Yi.His findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Some Chinese experts said that Mr. Yi overstated the problems in the official data, perhaps to fit his longstanding criticism of China\u2019s family planning controls.He and other experts scoffed at the idea that China had essentially cooked data to create a phantom population almost as big as Henan Province, which has 94 million people.\u201cAs well, what would their motive be for faking on a major scale?\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cBeing totally dismissive is not objective or scientific.\u201dThis debate has broad implications, but it will also be fought over seemingly slight differences in assumptions and data that population scientists use to study trends.That would be a sensitive issue in any society, but in countries like China and India, which are plowing through tumultuous industrial and social changes, it\u2019s even more difficult. And Chinese officials\u2019 habit of massaging data to show their policies in the best light added distortions, Mr. Yi said.China\u2019s official birthrate \u2014 the average number of children born by each woman \u2014 is much lower than the rate given in state statistics, he said. China\u2019s fertility rate in 2015 fell to 1.05 births per woman, far lower than the rate of up to 1.64 births per woman estimated by China\u2019s National Health and Family Planning Commission, he said in a PowerPoint presentation at Peking University. The commission did not reply to questions faxed to them about Mr. Yi\u2019s claims.China\u2019s demographic stagnation could be worse than Japan\u2019s, he argued. Chinese women show less desire to have more than one child and China has not built a robust welfare net that can protect older Chinese.\u201cYoung people don\u2019t want to have one child, let alone two children,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the future, it will be very hard to achieve an increase.\u201dBut some demographers said Mr. Yi appeared to underestimate the ability of Chinese statisticians to reach reasonably accurate estimates. Mr. Wang, the Irvine professor, said demographers made adjustments when analyzing census data to take into account undercounting of births \u2014 a common problem in censuses \u2014 but he said Mr. Yi unfairly treated \u201call adjustments as unscientific and political.\u201dIn India, too, Mr. Yi\u2019s findings were met with raised eyebrows.Indian people born 20 years ago \u201cwill be getting married now,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cThe population will grow for the next 30 to 40 years.\u201dNida Najar contributed reporting from New Delhi.

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Bill Could Affect Employer Health Coverage, Too", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthIf it becomes law, the American Health Care Act will have the biggest effects on people who buy their own insurance or get coverage through Medicaid. But it also means changes for the far larger employer health system.Whether those changes happen depends on how the Trump administration, states and employers act. The possible effects on the employer health system got little attention during congressional debate.The employer health benefit system existed long before the Affordable Care Act and was little changed by that law, which focused on expanding coverage for people who did not get their insurance from work. But Obamacare did expand some consumer protections for employer coverage. It also included a controversial \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d which required large employers to offer affordable, comprehensive coverage to their workers or face a fine.The Republican health bill, which passed the House last week and faces changes in the Senate, would weaken or eliminate those protections.Employers who do not offer insurance to their full-time workers would no longer be fined. Under a Republican health law, benefits consultants predict that most employers would keep offering insurance so as to retain workers. But smaller employers, particularly in certain industries, may choose to cut back.Employers would also be freed from penalties if their insurance did not meet a certain affordability standard for their workers; that could mean charging workers a larger share of insurance premiums.Zach Hunter, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which helped draft the bill, said that legislators did not intend for waivers to have any effect on the employer market. \u201cAny ambiguity caused by previous administrations\u2019 guidance from H.H.S. could be resolved by Secretary Price,\u201d he said, referring to Tom Price. Alleigh Marr\u00e9, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, told The Journal that the department would write regulations in line with the legislation\u2019s intent.\u201cLifetime limits affect very few people,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a co-author of the Kaiser study, explaining employers\u2019 thinking. \u201cIt allows you to lower your costs without affecting very many people.\u201d But, he noted, such limits can be devastating to those with very costly health conditions.Obamacare rules limiting the total amount patients with catastrophic illnesses could be asked to pay through deductibles and co-payments may also be weakened by the health bill. Currently, individuals can\u2019t be asked to pay more than $7,150 annually for essential care. The limit for families is $14,300.A recent survey of 666 employers from the benefits consulting firm Willis Towers Watson found that 15 percent of the employers would consider imposing lifetime coverage limits if it were allowed. The survey did not ask about raising out-of-pocket maximums.James Gelfand, a senior vice president for the ERISA Industry Committee, a trade group that works with large employers on health benefits, said he thought the return of lifetime limits was extremely unlikely, even if the American Health Care Act became law. He spoke with some members in April about the issue. \u201cThat was an eye roll,\u201d he said.Changes are most likely among employers with fewer workers, or those that tend to pay hourly wages. Those were the types of businesses least likely to offer comprehensive coverage in the years before the Affordable Care Act. The Mercer study found that about 22 percent of wholesale and retail companies offered their workers so-called \u201cmini-med\u201d insurance plans, made illegal by Obamacare, with sharply limited medical benefits.The Republican bill would not allow employers to charge higher insurance prices to those with pre-existing health conditions. That practice was barred by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, and was not changed by the Affordable Care Act. Some people who buy their own insurance might face a return of such health-based pricing under the Republican bill.The bill would also ease a current pressure on employers to lower the cost of their health plans. Enactment of the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive insurance plans will be postponed until 2026 under the American Health Care Act.Even if the law changes, coverage by most large employers is likely to remain widespread and robust, particularly if a strong economy prompts them to compete to attract workers. But even in past downturns, health benefits have proved tricky to take away. In the years before the Affordable Care Act, employers had no requirement to offer coverage and few rules about what benefits they should include. Still, in those years, generous employer coverage was the norm for large companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not likely they would abandon that approach in a post-A.C.A. environment,\u201d said Tracy Watts, the United States health reform leader at Mercer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside VW\u2019s Campaign of Trickery", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "New details emerge in Volkswagen\u2019s broad conspiracy to cover up a campaign aimed at deceiving pollution regulators.Supported by This article is adapted from \u201cFaster, Higher, Farther: The Volkswagen Scandal\u201d by Jack Ewing, the European economics correspondent for The New York Times based in Frankfurt. The book, to be published May 23 by W. W. Norton, reveals new details of a broad conspiracy within Volkswagen to cover up the fact that its cars were designed to deceive pollution regulators.FRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen was a little more than a month away from the biggest crisis in its history when Oliver Schmidt, a high-ranking engineer for the carmaker who dealt with regulators in the United States, wrote a reassuring email to his superiors.Mr. Schmidt had just met with Alberto Ayala, a deputy executive officer of the California Air Resources Board, the state\u2019s air quality enforcer. For well over a year, Mr. Ayala had been pushing Volkswagen to explain why its diesel passenger cars polluted so much more in ordinary driving than they did in California testing labs.Mr. Schmidt\u2019s email, which has not been previously reported, was dated Aug. 5, 2015. Hours earlier, on the sidelines of an industry conference in Michigan, Mr. Schmidt had presented Mr. Ayala with a binder full of detailed technical information which purported to offer a solution to the emissions problem.The meeting \u201cwent very well,\u201d Mr. Schmidt wrote. He cautioned, however, that the information he presented might encounter \u201cheadwind\u201d when it was examined by experts at the Air Resources Board lab in El Monte, near Los Angeles.That was an understatement.The experts soon concluded that the technical information Mr. Schmidt presented was yet another smoke screen \u2014 the latest in a series of maneuvers by the automaker to hide its misdeeds. A few weeks later, having run out of excuses, Volkswagen was forced to admit that the diesels it had sold in the United States since late 2008 had contained software designed to camouflage emissions that vastly exceeded legal limits.Media reports on the scandal have usually focused on Volkswagen\u2019s original sin: the company\u2019s decision in 2006 to equip its diesels with illegal software.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.But the most costly aspect of the wrongdoing for Volkswagen may have been the cover-up that the company orchestrated after regulators first became suspicious.The following reconstruction, based on interviews with dozens of participants and a review of internal Volkswagen documents and communications, shows that the cover-up spanned years and lasted until days before the company\u2019s lies were exposed. Volkswagen employees manipulated not only the engine software, but also generated reams of false or misleading data to hide the fact that millions of vehicles had been purposely engineered to deceive regulators and spew deadly gases into the air.Documents and interviews also shed new light on the role of Mr. Schmidt, the Volkswagen compliance official who is so far the only company executive to be put behind bars. Arrested when he visited the United States for the 2016 Christmas holidays, Mr. Schmidt is being held without bail awaiting trial for fraud and conspiracy in Detroit.Mr. Schmidt maintains that he was misled by other Volkswagen engineers and in-house lawyers. Other suspects, including five individuals indicted on federal charges, are believed to be in Germany, which does not usually extradite its citizens to states outside the European Union.They were a curious sight, the graduate students from West Virginia University, barreling down California freeways in spring 2013.The back end of their car, a Volkswagen Jetta station wagon, sprouted a tangle of pipes and hoses. Flexible tubes sucked exhaust from the tailpipes and fed the gas into a mysterious gray box sitting on a slab of plywood in the car\u2019s cargo area. Bolted to the plywood was the portable generator needed to power the whole mess. It stank and made an infernal racket.The students, Hemanth Kappanna and Marc Besch, were testing the Jetta\u2019s emissions for nitrogen oxides, a family of gases that cause asthma, bronchitis and heart attacks while contributing to global warming and the creation of urban smog. Working with a meager $70,000 research grant, Mr. Kappanna, Mr. Besch and other members of a West Virginia University team set off a chain of events that exposed VW\u2019s massive emissions cheating conspiracy.In May 2014, after examining the study, Bernd Gottweis, Volkswagen\u2019s head of product safety, wrote a one-page report. It was included in the packet that aides gave to Martin Winterkorn, the Volkswagen chief executive, to read over a weekend.Mr. Gottweis reported that a Volkswagen Jetta tested by the team from West Virginia had emitted 15 to 35 times the permitted amounts of nitrogen oxides during road tests. A Volkswagen Passat also tested by West Virginia researchers was five to 18 times over the limit. The same cars were able, however, to pass tests conducted on rollers in a laboratory.\u201cA thorough explanation for the dramatic increase in NOx emissions cannot be given to the authorities,\u201d Mr. Gottweis wrote, using the technical term for nitrogen oxides. \u201cIt can be assumed that the authorities will then investigate the VW systems to determine whether Volkswagen implemented a test detection system in the engine control unit software (so-called defeat device).\u201dMr. Gottweis\u2019s memo delivered a clear warning to the very highest level of management of the risk that Volkswagen had been caught using an illegal defeat device. Although Volkswagen does not dispute that Mr. Winterkorn received the Gottweis report, the company has argued that there was no proof that Mr. Winterkorn read the memo, which was included in a stack of other documents.If Volkswagen had been honest with American officials at that point, the damage to the company\u2019s reputation and finances would very likely have been serious but not devastating. Similar cases suggest that Volkswagen would have paid a fine in the hundreds of millions of dollars.But Volkswagen did not exploit the chance to be transparent.An internal Volkswagen presentation, prepared soon after executives learned of the West Virginia tests, discussed various strategies the company could adopt to allay suspicions. One option was for Volkswagen to simply refuse to acknowledge a problem. Another option was to offer to update the engine software. But the update would not bring emissions down to the required levels, the presentation said. In the worst case, Volkswagen could admit there was a problem and buy back diesel cars sold in the United States.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\u201cIt should first be decided whether we are honest,\u201d Mr. Schmidt wrote a colleague, according to the criminal complaint against him. The comment was cited as evidence that Mr. Schmidt was aware Volkswagen had something to hide.The tests performed by CARB\u2019s team confirmed that something was wrong but did not explain why. At that point, CARB officials say, they were not trying to expose wrongdoing by Volkswagen. They were just trying to figure out what the problem was, so that it could be fixed.It became a slow process.CARB would present the results of its testing. Volkswagen, which has a technical facility in suburban Los Angeles, would perform its own tests. Then engineers from CARB and Volkswagen would meet to compare notes. The meetings were highly technical and lasted hours, sometimes all day.\u201cFor every answer we got, we generated a couple more questions,\u201d Mr. Ayala said.As the back-and-forth dragged on without a solution, Mr. Ayala grew impatient. Volkswagen representatives gave answers that the regulators regarded as evasive, nonsensical or dismissive. CARB\u2019s testing was wrong, Volkswagen complained. The outside air pressure threw off the results. The routes followed were inconsistent.Efforts to figure out what was amiss with the Volkswagens began consuming so much of CARB technicians\u2019 time, as well as space in the agency\u2019s test bays, that other essential work was crowded out. Mr. Ayala also grew concerned that some 70,000 Volkswagen diesels were on California roads, polluting more than allowed.To try to resolve the engineering stalemate, officials from both sides held a conference call on Oct. 1, 2014. The Volkswagen representatives included Mr. Schmidt and Stuart Johnson, an American who was his second in command. The Volkswagen executives unveiled a plan for a recall to update the engine software for diesels starting with the 2009 model year.The planned recall seemed as if it were a concession by Volkswagen, but had the effect of a delaying tactic. The company still did not provide an honest explanation for the excess emissions. Instead, Volkswagen told CARB officials, \u201cThe new software incorporates the latest engineering experiences to enhance the efficiency\u201d of pollution control equipment.Accepting Volkswagen\u2019s assurances that the recall would fix excess emissions, officials from CARB and the Environmental Protection Agency allowed the 2015 diesels to go on sale.Volkswagen eventually updated the software in 280,000 vehicles. Afterward, the cars polluted less than they had, but the upgrade did not remove the illegal software code or bring emissions to within legal limits. In fact, Volkswagen brazenly used the recall to enhance the ability of the software to recognize when a car was being tested.In June 2015, CARB\u2019s tests showed that the recall and software update had not solved the problem of excess pollution. Output of nitrogen oxides rose after about 23 minutes of driving, CARB said, one minute after the end of the standard test cycle.CARB demanded that Volkswagen show it the software code that governed the emissions control system in the new 2016 models, which were already rolling off assembly lines. CARB also wanted to see the code in older models, so it could do a before-and-after comparison. If Volkswagen failed to comply with its request, CARB said, the agency would refuse to approve the 2016 models for sale in California.That was a serious threat. If a company cannot get approval to sell its cars in California, for all intents and purposes it can\u2019t sell them anywhere in the United States. A dozen other states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and most of New England follow California\u2019s clean air standards. No vehicle can be a success in America if it is banned from so many states.In Wolfsburg, a Volkswagen committee concerned with safety and regulatory matters discussed the growing crisis in the United States at a meeting on July 21, 2015. The committee decided to create a task force to achieve \u201cfast and effective de-escalation of the issue with officials,\u201d an internal memo said. Volkswagen should approach the regulators \u201coffensively.\u201dOn July 27, 2015, engineers briefed Mr. Winterkorn, the Volkswagen chief executive, on the diesel problem. In court documents, Volkswagen lawyers maintained that Mr. Winterkorn at that time still did not understand the gravity of the problem.But even according to Volkswagen\u2019s version of events, Mr. Winterkorn was in all likelihood informed that the underlying problem related to \u201csoftware altered to influence emissions performance during testing.\u201d According to Volkswagen, Mr. Winterkorn was not informed at the meeting that the software violated United States law. Mr. Winterkorn has said he did not learn of a defeat device until September 2015.Volkswagen began to belatedly face up to the likelihood that the emissions problem would have legal consequences. In late July 2015, Volkswagen asked the Washington office of Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm with expertise in regulatory issues, for an opinion on the potential penalties.In early August, the firm issued a five-page, single-spaced analysis which stated that Volkswagen would probably not be able to avoid paying civil penalties to the government. But the opinion also noted that the largest fine to date was $100 million imposed the previous November on Hyundai-Kia, the Korean carmaker. Hyundai-Kia had admitted overstating the fuel economy of 1.1 million cars and light trucks.But there was an important distinction between Volkswagen\u2019s behavior and that of other companies caught cheating. In the past, carmakers had almost always acquiesced immediately when confronted with evidence of emissions violations and cooperated with regulators.Volkswagen had taken a far different approach. By August 2015, the company had spent more than a year procrastinating, providing regulators with false, misleading or incomplete information. It had carried out a recall that did not deliver the promised improvements. The company had continued to sell cars with illegal software, including 2015 models.And Volkswagen continued to obfuscate. On Aug. 5, Mr. Schmidt, who the previous March had moved to a job in engine development in Wolfsburg, and Mr. Johnson, who had replaced him as head of emissions compliance in the United States, asked to meet with Mr. Ayala of CARB after learning he was scheduled to speak at an industry conference in Traverse City, Mich.According to Mr. Ayala, Volkswagen booked a meeting room at the conference, which took place at a resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Johnson arrived with a thick binder of technical information and spent two hours going over it with him.To Mr. Ayala, the information looked credible. Despite everything, he still trusted the Volkswagen executives.Mr. Schmidt, in his email to superiors about the meeting, reported that Mr. Ayala \u201cwas pleased that Volkswagen is addressing the problem and taking it seriously.\u201d But, Mr. Schmidt wrote, Mr. Ayala had also expressed dissatisfaction with Volkswagen\u2019s slow response until then. And he had pushed the company to issue a news release explaining its efforts to fix excess emissions \u2014 advice the company did not follow.After he returned to California, Mr. Ayala turned the binder with technical information over to his staff.A week later, the compliance engineers came back to him with the results of their analysis. The information provided by Volkswagen was nonsense. Only one possible explanation was left, the engineers said.\u201cThat was the first time I heard the words \u2018defeat device,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ayala recalled. \u201cIt explained it all.\u201dCARB stepped up the pressure on Volkswagen, obtaining a 2016 model and making plans to test it, raising the risk of additional damaging discoveries.Volkswagen executives realized they had run out of excuses. On Aug. 18, Mr. Johnson approached Mr. Ayala at an industry conference in Pacific Grove, Calif. The gathering took place at Asilomar, a conference center set amid dunes and pine forests adjacent to a broad sandy beach on the Monterey Peninsula.Mr. Johnson admitted to Mr. Ayala that the Volkswagens contained a defeat device. Mr. Ayala was furious. Volkswagen had knowingly squandered California taxpayer dollars, and allowed polluting vehicles to stay on California highways.\u201cThey wasted our time,\u201d Mr. Ayala said. \u201cIt had a very significant, very real impact on us all.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Johnson, who has not been charged, declined to comment. In a statement, David Massey, a lawyer for Mr. Schmidt, said: \u201cAt its core, the government\u2019s case against Mr. Schmidt is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what happened on two occasions when Mr. Schmidt spoke to regulators in August 2015.\u201dAs word spread inside Volkswagen that the regulators knew about the illegal software, employees began trying to cover their tracks. At an Aug. 31 meeting, an in-house lawyer suggested that engineers in attendance should check their documents. Several of those present interpreted the comment as a signal that they should delete anything related to the emissions issue in the United States. In the weeks that followed 40 employees at Volkswagen and the company\u2019s Audi division destroyed thousands of documents.On Sept. 3, 2015, Volkswagen formally admitted to regulators that 500,000 diesel vehicles in the United States had two calibrations, one for tests and one for normal operation \u2014 in other words, a defeat device. Mr. Winterkorn resigned before the end of the month, while insisting he had no knowledge of the wrongdoing.The research begun with a $70,000 grant eventually cost Volkswagen more than $22 billion in fines and legal settlements, far more than the cost of equipping the cars with adequate pollution control equipment in the first place.No one was more surprised at the outcome than the team at West Virginia University. \u201cWe never set out to get crosswise with anyone,\u201d said Dan Carder, who oversaw the Volkswagen research as director of the university\u2019s Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines and Emissions. \u201cWe were just kind of doing our jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Message of Puerto Rico Debt Crisis: Easy Bets Sometimes Lose", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byWhen some of Wall Street\u2019s savviest hedge funds piled into Puerto Rico\u2019s debt in 2014, it seemed like an easy bet: Buy up the island\u2019s bonds at a discount, pocket the high interest and persuade politicians to make decisions that would raise the value of their investments.Even if Puerto Rico\u2019s economy collapsed and its government unraveled, the investment funds figured they had an ace in hand. Puerto Rico was a United States commonwealth, and thus \u2014 like the 50 states \u2014 legally barred from declaring bankruptcy as a way to shed its debts.In taking this drastic step, Puerto Rico asserted that it had no way to pay the $123 billion in bonds and pension debt it owes.The unprecedented legal filing came only a few days after hedge funds and other holders of Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation debt thought they had cut a deal with the government to avoid bankruptcy.The move represented one of the lowest points in Wall Street\u2019s long, torturous history of investing in Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds. The hedge funds have been battling to protect their investments through the administrations of two Puerto Rico governors and across Capitol Hill, keeping an army of lawyers, consultants and operatives gainfully employed.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone bargained for this,\u201d said David D. Tawil, a co-founder of Maglan Capital, a New York hedge fund that had at one point invested in Puerto Rico\u2019s debt. \u201cI think most funds expected there would have been a consensual agreement by now.\u201dIt does not take long to see why a solution to Puerto Rico\u2019s debt problem has eluded the hedge funds and other investment firms that own the island\u2019s bonds: Many of the creditors think they are, or should be, first in line for the money. But the island also has to keep paying its police officers and its teachers while it struggles to raise revenue.Two bondholder groups in particular \u2014 owners of general-obligation bonds and owners of Cofina bonds, which are backed by sales tax revenue \u2014 are at odds. Each of those types of bonds, their investors argue, carries protections that put those bondholders at the top of the pecking order after a default.Puerto Rico\u2019s general-obligation bonds are backed by a provision in the island\u2019s constitution that promises that if there is not enough money in the general fund for all planned expenditures, general-obligation bonds will be paid off before anything else.That sounds good, but investors in the Cofinas say they have an even better claim because they have a dedicated repayment stream in sales tax revenue.The money goes straight from the merchants to a trust \u2014 not to Puerto Rico\u2019s treasury \u2014 so the government cannot lay claim to it and use it for anything else, such as paying the general-obligation bondholders.With both the general obligation bondholders and the Cofina bondholders claiming dibs, it will very likely take a judge to force a resolution.A law passed last summer under the Obama administration, called Promesa, was designed specifically to address Puerto Rico\u2019s predicament. It created a bankruptcy-like process that the island and other United States territories could use to restructure their debts.Bondholders fought vigorously on Capitol Hill to derail the legislation but lost. They did win a few concessions in the makeup of the fiscal oversight board that would oversee the government\u2019s attempts to cut expenses. For instance, it would have to include three members from a list of people picked by Democrats and four picked by Republicans. That way, some bondholders figured, they could expect a more creditor-friendly approach.But the bill that was finally enacted had many elements that could harm bondholders, including a \u201ccramdown\u201d provision, which gives a bankrupt government the power to force a deal on an unwilling creditor.To investors \u2014 who bought the bonds assuming their legal protections were ironclad \u2014 it seems as though the governments in San Juan and Washington are constantly moving the goal posts.Hector Negroni, co-chief executive of FCO Advisors, which is invested in Puerto Rico bonds, said the oversight board had failed to honor constitutional protections for bondholders and to carry out its duty to force the government to tighten spending.The board\u2019s actions, he said, are hurting not only bondholders, but also the people of Puerto Rico, because the island\u2019s access to the debt markets would be indefinitely frozen.\u201cWe were promised Promesa wouldn\u2019t change the rules against creditors,\u201d Mr. Negroni said. \u201cHere we find ourselves with a board that has attempted to force a solution on us that does the exact opposite.\u201dDo not count the hedge funds out just yet. Puerto Rico may have veered from Wall Street\u2019s preferred playbook, but some of these hedge funds employ skilled dealmakers and relentless litigators.The hedge funds are not the only investors in Puerto Rico\u2019s $74 billion in bonds. Those bonds had been a staple of retirement funds across the United States, generating hefty yields for mom-and-pop investors at a time of low interest rates.Those retirement funds had been assured that Puerto Rico had little choice but to honor its debts \u2014 even as the island\u2019s pension costs swelled and its tax revenue ebbed. Mutual fund managers like Oppenheimer and Franklin Templeton are now fighting for repayment alongside the hedge funds.It is too early to say whether the hedge funds will end up losing money on their investments, as they bought many of them at a discount.Before the bankruptcy filing, general obligation bondholders were close to a deal with the government that would have valued their debt at 70 cents on the dollar, according to people briefed on the matter.On Thursday, many of those bonds were trading around 66 cents on the dollar, according to Municipal Market Analytics.Mr. Tawil of Maglan Capital said many investors had made the mistake of comparing Puerto Rico to an insolvent nation. But nations are typically bailed out by the International Monetary Fund before they collapse totally.No such bailout has come for Puerto Rico. As a commonwealth of the United States, Puerto Rico does not qualify for I.M.F. assistance, and there was little appetite in Congress for a wholesale federal rescue. For months, investors and residents have been in a \u201cfive-ring circus,\u201d as Mr. Tawil put it, where bondholders are fighting with the government, the control board and one another.Even so, Mr. Tawil is considering investing in the debt again. \u201cWe are in this unknown territory,\u201d he said. \u201cHow this all ends is unclear.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Markets Swing Upward, Then Settle, in Wake of French Election", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Markets breathed a sigh of relief on Monday after Emmanuel Macron secured the French presidency in the second round of elections, but investor enthusiasm quickly waned as the focus shifted to the scale of the challenge facing him.The euro, which strengthened against the dollar after results were announced, pared its gains in the European morning and was down 0.32 percent to $1.0954 by early afternoon.The CAC 40, the benchmark stock index for France, had inched down 0.86 percent by early afternoon, while indexes across Europe, including Germany\u2019s DAX and the Euro Stoxx 50, were all a little lower.The yield on French government bonds fell, meaning that investors saw the country\u2019s debt as being less risky, reducing France\u2019s borrowing costs.Mr. Macron comfortably defeated his far-right rival Marine Le Pen on Sunday, but analysts said markets were already looking ahead to French parliamentary elections next month. Mr. Macron faces a sizable challenge in obtaining a legislative majority that could enable him to keep campaign promises.Opinion polls had indicated a Macron victory, helping to bolster investor enthusiasm toward the end of last week, so the market\u2019s reaction to the results was limited, according to J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, the chief economist at Commerzbank.\u201cThe biggest uncertainty was before the first round of the elections\u201d in April, when it was unclear whether Mr. Macron would make it to the final round, Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said.\u201cNow there is residual uncertainty,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Macron was \u201cunlikely to implement the tough necessary reforms that France needs.\u201dInvestors were also looking ahead to other elections in Europe, he said, seeing particular risks in parliamentary races in Italy next year.The muted reaction in European markets came after indexes in Asia climbed sharply in the hours after the polls closed in France.The Nikkei 225 share index in Japan and other markets in the region were also reacting to a strong jobs report in the United States on Friday, which suggested the global economy was on solid footing even as it reinforced the case for the Federal Reserve to continue building on recent interest rate increases.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why There Is No \u2018Trump Slump\u2019 on Wall Street", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter a brief stumble, the stock market returned to its upward march last week and hit another high. This optimism has left many people confused, even infuriated. Why isn\u2019t Wall Street being affected by all the crazy news \u2014 including rumors of impeachment \u2014 coming out of Washington? Where is the Trump Slump?So far, there isn\u2019t one, and that\u2019s good news for investors but also even for ideological opponents of the president. I\u2019ve examined stock markets in countries around the world, looking at data over the past three decades. My research shows that a country\u2019s stock market often outperforms its peers when a new leader comes to power in emerging countries.But there is no such positive effect in developed countries. Countries like the United States have structural guardrails in place, like strong independent courts, central banks and other checks on power, that make it more difficult for a single leader to change the nation\u2019s direction.Compare political scandals, for example. In Brazil, the market is struggling to recover after falling nearly 15 percent in dollar value on May 18 perhaps in response to the blockbuster news of a cover-up that could cost the president his job.In the United States, the stock market fell during the Watergate scandal but for reasons that had little to do with Richard Nixon and much to do with the stagnant economy and inflation. And stock prices rose steadily during the investigations and impeachment of Bill Clinton, until the 1998 collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management threatened to trigger a global financial crisis. The same holds for other political scandals, like Teapot Dome and Iran-contra.It is a mistake, then, to view the markets through an ideologically colored lens.The data is decidedly more mixed on whether the United States market does better under a Republican or a Democratic administration. If anything, the market over time seems less and less inclined to care which party is in power.I know plenty of right-wing ideologues who, convinced that President Barack Obama was leading America to ruin, missed out on the market\u2019s long bull run. Similarly many Democrats now think President Trump is taking the country down and assume that stock prices will follow.The stock market is best understood not as a presidential poll but as a barometer of the nation\u2019s current economic mood, and it remains buoyant now for reasons unconnected to the White House.For a few weeks after President Trump\u2019s victory, Wall Street was indeed buzzing over how his plans to cut taxes and red tape would stir \u201canimal spirits\u201d and promote American business, albeit at the expense of foreign rivals. Money was coming back to the United States, driving up the value of the dollar. Six months later, the main reason for the market\u2019s continued rise has more to do with global rather than local factors. The \u201cTrump bump\u201d is long gone.Global growth has picked up over the past few months, and the worst fears that caused a short-term slump in Wall Street last year \u2014 like a possible breakup of the European Union after Brexit or a financial crisis in China \u2014 have not materialized. The American economy continues to grow at a steady clip of around 2 percent, while the economies of Europe and Japan are now stronger than at any time since the crisis of 2008.The American stock market reflects those trends. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of \u201cglobalists,\u201d the more internationally oriented companies have outperformed their domestic peers significantly since Inauguration Day. The global forces lifting the United States market have in the meantime been lifting foreign stock markets even faster this year.Similarly, the American dollar has given up all the gains it recorded in the immediate aftermath of the November election, and the Mexican peso has clawed back most of the losses it incurred when the markets were taking President Trump\u2019s threats against the North American Free Trade Agreement more seriously.On Wall Street today, the chatter about Trumponomics is fading, because many people no longer expect him to accomplish much, for better or worse, whether pushing tax reform or triggering trade wars. Some analysts still worry about how a tax-cut plan based on unrealistic growth assumptions could further bloat the budget deficit, or how limiting immigration could undermine the economy.But those story lines are expected to play out at a glacial pace, well outside the market\u2019s forecast horizon, which is measurable in months, not years. Corporate profits have started to revive in recent months based on a recovering global economy. As long as that continues and the cost of money remains close to zero, courtesy of the Fed, the default path for the market is up.None of this is to suggest that there are no risks to the bull market, now in its ninth year. Stocks in the United States have seldom risen for so long without a major setback and have never been more expensively valued, outside the tech boom of the late 1990s. History shows that bull runs tend to last until the next recession starts, so the question is where the next downturn comes from.If emerging inflation pressures prompt the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly, the economy could stumble and take the market with it. More significantly, there are still threats to the world economy, including China\u2019s debt bubble. If it bursts, it could cause the next global recession, hitting the American market hard.So there is much to worry about in the markets, but it is important to worry about the right things. The cloud of scandal around the White House is not high on the list. Mr. Trump\u2019s mercurial ways may be a source of great concern or indifference, depending on your ideological leanings. But Wall Street doesn\u2019t seem to care one way or other.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Push and Pull on Cuba", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byEditorialIn recent weeks, as the White House has been consumed by loud debates over health care, taxes and trade, there has been another, quieter debate occurring beneath the surface. Government agencies and lawmakers have been pulling the administration in two directions on whether to continue the Obama administration\u2019s path on relations with Cuba.Meanwhile, a large pro-engagement coalition that includes lawmakers from both parties, businesses and young Cuban-Americans, is calling on the White House to build on the foundation of engagement it inherited. By charting out narrow areas of cooperation with Havana \u2014 while agreeing to disagree on human rights issues \u2014 the Obama administration enabled the freer flow of people, goods and information between the countries.Among the fruits of this approach have been bilateral agreements on health care cooperation, joint planning to mitigate oil spills and coordination on counternarcotics efforts. Havana also recently agreed to start accepting some Cubans who have been ordered deported. Regulatory changes have made it easier for most Americans to visit Cuba \u2014 though going there purely for tourism is still technically illegal \u2014 and enabled broader exchanges among scholars, journalists and artists. Google, meanwhile, is negotiating a series of agreements with Cuba that could significantly expand access to the internet on the island, one of the most unplugged nations on earth.Mr. Trump\u2019s public remarks on Cuba policy have been brief and thoughtless. Shortly after being elected, Mr. Trump tweeted: \u201cIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.\u201dThat put Cubans and Americans on notice that Mr. Trump was contemplating reversing Mr. Obama\u2019s easement of American sanctions. The White House began an assessment early this year and agencies, including the Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce, have given their input. It is unclear when, or whether, an announcement of a decision will come. Mr. Trump could undo many regulatory changes with the stroke of a pen. For instance, he could tighten rules on sending remittances to Cubans, suspend the newly re-established commercial flights between the nations and stop American cruises from docking in Havana.If he were to take those sorts of steps, Mr. Trump would make the small pro-embargo coalition in Capitol Hill very happy. But doing so would mean reversing course on a policy change that is widely popular among Americans and nearly universally supported by Cubans.He also would be putting American farmers and businesses at a disadvantage by curtailing their access to a market that is gradually opening to global trade. In 2016, the European Union formally abandoned a policy predicated on pursuit of a democratic transition and struck a broader agreement with Havana that includes cooperation on trade and development and a dialogue on human rights.Most damagingly, putting the relationship with Cuba back on a confrontational track would all but certainly subject Cubans to greater repression and privation. In the past, Havana has ratcheted up its repressive tactics during moments of heightened tension with the United States.Instead of waiting for the Cuban government to \u201cmake a better deal with the Cuban people\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 Mr. Trump can continue to make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba and do business with Cubans. Strengthening ties does not guarantee that Cuba will reform its one-party system or overhaul its centrally planned economy. But it would empower Cubans as they contemplate the future they want for their country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Has a Union of Sorts, but Faces Doubts on Its Autonomy", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byUber was a pioneer in seamlessly connecting passengers and drivers through an app. Now a union-led group meant to represent its drivers is also taking an unorthodox approach \u2014 as well as Uber\u2019s money.The group, the Independent Drivers Guild, was formed roughly one year ago as part of an agreement for the New York City area between Uber and a regional branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Guild officials say the unusual deal was simply the most practical way to improve the lot of drivers, whom the union has a proud history of organizing.\u201cThe drivers need help, and they need help now,\u201d said James Conigliaro Jr., the founder of the guild and a senior Machinists official.And the guild, which says it represents about 50,000 ride-hail drivers in the New York City area, has produced concrete victories. It took the lead in persuading the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission to propose a rule that would require a tipping option on Uber\u2019s passenger app, potentially increasing drivers\u2019 income by hundreds of million of dollars.But the group\u2019s relationship with Uber has also inspired considerable suspicion among labor leaders, activists and experts.The guild has even attacked Lyft, Uber\u2019s top competitor, using questionable tactics.On May 1, the guild sent an email to members urging them to help create an afternoon work stoppage at Lyft. In the email, Ryan Price, the guild\u2019s executive director, instructed members to order rides on Lyft so they could urge its drivers to join a stoppage. If the driver was \u201ca scab\u201d and refused, the email said, the member should cancel the ride.Mr. Price, who previously did advocacy and organizing work for a nonprofit group and a union, acknowledged in the email that the tactic violated Lyft\u2019s terms of service, but said the company\u2019s refusal to negotiate with workers justified the action. Besides, he added, \u201cnothing has ever been won without taking a risk.\u201dThe start-up has undertaken an extraordinary experiment in behavioral science to subtly entice an independent work force to maximize company revenue.The Machinists said they had been in contact with Uber drivers for years before creating the guild by virtue of their work on behalf of the city\u2019s for-hire drivers, some of whom began driving for Uber shortly after the service arrived in New York in 2011.\u201cThousands of drivers were coming to us, and we were building a mailing list we still have today,\u201d Mr. Conigliaro said. The union approached Uber in the fall of 2015 to explore an arrangement.As part of the deal, the guild secured regular meetings between some of its members and Uber officials in New York City \u2014 the only dialogue in the country between Uber and a driver group associated with a union \u2014 and due process for drivers whom Uber has barred from the platform. Uber pays an undisclosed sum to the guild and also agreed to hand over contact information for all of its New York City drivers.Supporters of the guild in the labor movement say such concessions from Uber may be crucial to winning a toehold in a sector where rich, powerful companies, a dispersed worker population, and high turnover make organizing extremely difficult.The guild raised the issue of tipping at its first meeting with Uber last June and, when the company balked, the group decided to wage a vocal campaign aimed at city regulators.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t go back to drivers and say, \u2018The company said they\u2019re not going to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Conigliaro recalled. \u201cSo we took that one issue and moved it throughout the year.\u201dAside from the tipping fight, however, other groups have played a more visible role on wages to date. The commission itself has made exploring the issue of wages a priority since early 2016 and has been soliciting data and suggestions from drivers in an effort to devise protections.\u201cI think fares should have been an issue from the beginning,\u201d said Ronnie Paulino, a driver for Uber and Lyft, who said he was surprised that the survey did not give drivers a chance to highlight their concern about the cuts. Mr. Paulino was active in the guild\u2019s tipping campaign and said the organization had gradually won him over.(Mr. Price, the guild\u2019s executive director, said many drivers believed that Uber would never agree to reverse fare cuts and that it would take regulation to do so.)The guild also regularly takes credit for changes that it appears to have had little to do with, or that the company began making before the guild existed.Skeptics like Rome Aloise, a Teamsters international vice president who has been working to organize Uber drivers in California, question the Machinists\u2019 approach of brokering a deal with Uber without first building a more formal organization of drivers. The alternative approach could have allowed drivers to dictate terms through elected leaders, rather than leave it to a small number of union officials to settle on terms with the company.The Machinists agreed to refrain from challenging Uber\u2019s position that drivers are contractors rather than employees, a top priority for organized labor, for the duration of their five-year agreement, though drivers are free to challenge their status on their own.The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a group representing professional drivers that held discussions with the Machinists on how to help Uber drivers, has filed an unfair-labor-practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board accusing Uber of helping to create a company union.Josh Gold, an Uber spokesman in New York, said that the guild was created to be independent of the company and that \u201cwe often don\u2019t agree with the positions they take \u2014 that\u2019s the point.\u201dStill, the experience of Mr. Paulino, the guild member, highlights the way the group may be susceptible to Uber\u2019s influence.Mr. Paulino said that at the first meeting organized by the guild between drivers and Uber, the drivers challenged the company on issues like tipping and fare cuts. Their aggressive stand made Uber management visibly flustered, he recalled.Several participants say company officials pointed out that some drivers had not worked on the platform recently. After the meeting, the company suggested that attendance should be limited primarily to those who regularly drive for Uber. Mr. Paulino, who had all but stopped driving for Uber after the recent fare cuts, said the guild later told him he would not be invited to future meetings, citing his infrequent driving. A second driver, Steven Savader, said the guild told him he could not attend subsequent meetings because he did not drive for Uber enough.(The guild said that it had hundreds of drivers volunteer to participate and wanted to give others an opportunity, and that less-active Uber drivers had attended other meetings.)Other guild moves, like the attempted work stoppage at Lyft, suggest the relationship with Uber could sway the group\u2019s thinking even if Uber exerts no direct control over it or refrains from providing input.The guild says that it is taking aim at Lyft because the company refuses to bargain with drivers the way Uber has and that the decision came about through a survey of its dues-paying members. But only a small portion of members appears to pay dues \u2014 the guild concedes it is \u201cjust beginning outreach\u201d in this area. In arriving at other decisions, like its tipping campaign, the guild has surveyed its entire membership.Uber said it had nothing to do with the stoppage. \u201cWe learned about this when we saw it publicly and don\u2019t know why they chose to take this action,\u201d Mr. Gold of Uber said.Lyft has no organization comparable to the guild for its own drivers, some of whom drive for both services. A Lyft spokesman, Adrian Durbin, said the company \u201cdoes everything we can, including encouraging passenger tipping, to build great relationships with drivers in the hope that they will partner with us.\u201dAt a monthly meeting between Uber drivers and guild staff members in early May without company officials present, Mr. Price asked drivers how they felt about the potential conflict of being significantly funded by Uber while attacking its rival.Mr. Conigliaro, for his part, insisted he was not concerned about appearing too close to Uber. \u201cWe started the organization to help drivers raise income levels,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I cared about optics, this deal probably never would have happened.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This winter, a group will attempt K2, the world\u2019s most dangerous mountain.Supported byThe mountain rises glistening from an encasement of glaciers in the far reaches of the Karakoram. Pyramid-shaped, an austere link to eternity, K2 yields only to Everest in height and is deadlier. Its walls are vertiginous no matter the approach.Only the most experienced climbers attempt ascents, and for every four who crawl to its peak, one dies.And then there is winter. Fourteen of earth\u2019s mountains exceed 8,000 meters (26,246 feet), and climbers have reached the peak of 13 in winter. K2 is the forbidding exception. Ten Polish climbers hope to make history by reaching the summit next winter.These men will hike through knee-deep snow to a base camp at 18,645 feet, surpassing all but one mountain in the United States. Atop K2\u2019s near-vertical slopes, glacial icefalls dislodge car-size hunks of ice. Winds at the summit reach hurricane strength, and temperatures can fall as low as minus 80 Fahrenheit.The climbers could wait two months in their tents, in hopes the gales relent for a few days. They have no margin for error; K2 routinely kills those trapped on its flanks.This is the way of the Polish climbers, who for reasons of history and culture have earned reputations as the greatest climbers of the Himalayas in winter. They are prisoners of their dreams.Janusz Golab is a long-limbed lion of a climber with curly hair that goes here and there like an ethereal nimbus. He is 49, still in his prime for a great climber, and he will be one of those charged with making it to the summit of K2 next winter. We talk as he stands in the darkened attic of a lodge in the Morskie Oko valley in Poland, looping purple rope in preparation for a training climb in the subzero of the Tatra Mountains.To scale K2 in winter is not such modest madness. He has children and at least one girlfriend, and he appears filled with a love for life. It so happens he enjoys its deadly challenges. He has climbed in Antarctica, Greenland and the Himalayas. \u201cWinter is the best season.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s more challenging. It\u2019s obvious it\u2019s the best.\u201dThere\u2019s so much to unpack about this climb to the most hostile tip of the planet, a mountain that is 28,251 feet high and sits in the Karakoram range on the border of Pakistan and China. There are the technical and strategic challenges, and the task of picking a team in the individualistic world of high-altitude climbing. These men will live and work in the worst possible conditions for months. Each knows he may not return.Four climbers will make the final push to the summit without oxygen. Each has lost partners on climbs.There is, too, the power that history exerts on the Poles. A decade ago, what remains of the old guard challenged a younger generation to test limits of flesh, endurance and creativity in the Himalayas. Their story, embedded in the urge of free spirits to slip the unsmiling bonds of a Cold-War communist government, offers our starting point.Generations of Poles flocked like homing pigeons to the dark and jagged peaks of the Tatra Mountains, which rise on Poland\u2019s southern border with Slovakia. Men and women scaled its granite walls in summer heat and in the belly of winter. When the photographer Max Whittaker and I accompanied five Polish Himalayan climbers to the Tatras in January, snow piled swollen on steep mountainsides and the temperature hovered near zero.After World War II and its slaughters, the Communists imposed a controlling regime. Its bureaucrats held all passports. Whether factory worker, engineer or mathematician, everyone scuffled for money. The mountains offered freedom from all that.Poland\u2019s climbing clubs swelled with members. The most famous was found in Katowice, a steel town a few hours drive from the Tatras.The Katowice club overlooked Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin Street; its coat of arms is an eagle and an ice pick. Many dozens of climbers each night talked mountains, life, and more mountains, and sang songs and drank vodka. To gain admission at that time, a young climber had to demonstrate technical prowess, sleep outside on a mountain ledge (known as a bivouac), pass written tests and show a command of mountaineering history, art and literature.The blue-eyed Krzysztof Wielicki, who at 67 is among the most accomplished Himalayan climbers alive, will lead the K2 expedition. He remains limber and lively in his seventh decade, with a second wife and young children. He has climbed three Himalayan peaks in winter, including Everest, and has the bowlegged amble of a man with little left to prove. His eyes glisten when asked about his youthful hunger. \u201cWe climb here, and here, and here,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd if you climb O.K., they say, \u2018O.K., you have passed summer Tatra.\u2019\u201dHe lifts his finger high in imitation of the hardened club members. \u201c\u2018Now you have to do winter Tatra.\u2019\u201dWhen Polish climbers obtained permission to climb the peaks of Western Europe, they discovered another problem: The West was terrifically expensive.One night in January, I sit in the village home of Janusz Majer, 70, a burly climber who is working to obtain the $335,000 in government and private financing needed to underwrite the assault on K2. His friend and climber, Wojciech Dzik, joins us.Over salamis and cheeses and a prodigious amount of wine, we talk of long-ago mountaineering adventures. They had finished a climb in the Dolomites in the 1970s when they saw a sign for cappuccinos. Dzik, a mathematician, did the mental currency conversion. \u201cMy God! It was one-tenth of my salary,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAfter that, we lived like Jesus, on bread and wine.\u201dThe Poles turned to the mountains of Asia, where the technical challenge was magnitudes greater and the cost magnitudes less. In search of money, they walked into factory offices in Katowice and pointed to towering industrial chimneys. We\u2019ll paint these at half your usual cost.The factory managers winced. A scaffold, they said, costs more than your price.We work Alpine-style, the climbers replied. Soon engineers and mathematicians and electricians rappelled down chimneys from dawn to dusk.Then they hopped into old vans, Jack Keroaucs all, and set off for the Hindu Kush. No fancy equipment, no endorsements, no publicity; just freedom from the strictures of life in Poland. \u201cBack then, to leave a job was O.K.,\u201d Wielicki tells me. \u201cYou\u2019re making just $50 a month. No big deal. Bye-bye.\u201dBy the time the Poles reached Asia in great numbers, climbers from other nations had scaled all the 8,000-meter peaks.The Poles decided to find fame Tatra-style and climb those peaks in winter or by risky new routes. The audacity of their ascents was legendary. Their ranks produced Wanda Rutkiewicz, the first woman to summit K2, and the first man to scale three giant peaks in winter, Jerzy Kukuczka. That climber and a partner scaled K2 in summer along a route so dangerous, even suicidal \u2014 it passed beneath unstable ridges of ice \u2014 no one else has attempted it. To this day, it is known as the Polish Line.Some climbers were artists who specialized in free climbs, with as little gear as possible. Others were expeditionary geniuses who plotted climbs like military assaults. Polish newspapers chronicled this as American newspapers do baseball.To sit now with the Polish mountaineers, old and young, is to hear voices rise and laughter roll in like ocean breakers. They tell tales of supplies piled atop camels and flirtations with entrancing local women and negotiating with turbaned mechanics to eke a few more miles out of wizened vans. They recall Silesian dumplings and vodka in base camp and frozen bivouacs at 22,000 feet and fogged brains and hallucinations (they do not use oxygen when climbing). Always there were other worldly vistas.\u201cUp there at night, to hear glaciers calve: Boom. Boom. Boom. My God,\u201d recalls Dzik, the white-haired mathematician. \u201cI was just a poor bored lecturer in Poland. It was like going to heaven.\u201dAnother visitor accompanied them: death.The grand climbers perished at a frightful rate. They were trapped by swirling tempests; died of altitude sickness; slipped and catapulted into the abyss. There is no field of athletic achievement where death rides so insistently on your shoulder.It is tempting to wonder if these men harbor a romance with two lovers, life and death. Wielicki, the leader of the upcoming expedition, was renowned for his solo ascents of Himalayan peaks. His stamina was unmatched. (As expedition leaders must, he will remain at base camp during the ascent of K2.)I put the question of death\u2019s allure to him and he shakes his head. He wanted to live, always, even if along the serrated edge of a knife. He noted an axiom of climbing: A young climber is the most endangered, as he does not know enough to worry. To that, he adds another: An older climber should not draw too much comfort from mastery of technique. That can prove a frail shield in the high Himalayas.\u201cYou need luck,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes.\u201dRough sleep precedes a climb. It\u2019s as if the dark imaginings of Hieronymus Bosch scamper through the cranium. A climber clings to a crumbling wall. Another sees a friend fall past him. Another feels creatures pulling at his feet.On the mountain, climbers escape into concentration as pure as a monk\u2019s repose. Life becomes detail: Click into the rope and unclick; secure boot crampons and dig for footholds. There is a whack of the ice pick and another one, and one after that. They scale 27,000-foot-high puzzles. Sometimes climbers go a day or two without food; sometimes they fail to notice.Kacper Tekieli is one of the climbers whom Max and I accompany to the Tatras. He has a tangle of dark curls and a mischievous smile, and is a philosophy major with a love of mountain literature. At 32, he has built a considerable mountaineering reputation, although he cannot afford to give up working as a barista in the old quarter of Krakow. He watched a friend slip to his death last year in the Himalayas; he\u2019s not sure he needs K2.Tekieli talks of the singular focus needed to summit a Himalayan peak in the maw of winter. The universe narrows to a meter or two. \u201cThere\u2019s something mystical. It\u2019s not about the mountain, which is inert. It\u2019s you. It\u2019s what you discover about yourself in all those hours of concentration.\u201dSix K2 climbers gather on a winter afternoon in a Warsaw gym under the eyes of a trainer, Karol Hennig, who works with state health institutes. He invites me to join. I decline, pleading a sore Achilles and a severe attack of common sense.The climbers range from their 30s to 63, and most are of modest build. They fill backpacks with iron bars and work stair-climbers. They do tortuous lifts and pull-ups.Their fingers and toes are as adhering as those of a gecko. They retain one-third more oxygen than a well-conditioned adult. After the workout, their heart rates return to baseline as easily as an elevator descends from one floor to the next.Two nights later, the Himalayan climbers are deep in the Tatras, taking a conditioning climb up the Monk, a saw-toothed 6,781-foot peak. Max the photographer is a skilled climber and accompanies them; I hike to an ice fall and wave goodbye. Janusz Golab is a force unto himself, climbing with precision and economy of motion, a strong-limbed cat.Marek Chmielarski, 40, is one of the Tatra climbers and will join the K2 team. He paints oil platforms from the North Sea to Azerbaijan. He chuckles at the mention of their oxygen-retention scores: \u201cJanusz scores pretty much at the bottom. And he has been to the top of K2 and is the best climber in Poland.\u201dThe climbers also monitor levels of vitamin D and iron, which help stave off hypobaric hypoxia, the process by which thin air deprives the body of replenishing oxygen.No one can be certain how a body will react at the top of the world. At K2 base camp, the air has half the oxygen found at sea level. At 26,000 feet, climbers enter the Death Zone; it is devilishly difficult to draw a breath, and the heart strains to pump blood. When climbers reach the summit, their breathing will be a shallow, fast pant. They will vomit and suffer dehydration and begin to hallucinate.Wielicki recalls a past-exhaustion night on a solo Himalayan climb. He huddled inside a tiny tent and made tea for two: himself and his companion, whose presence was no less intense for being imaginary. \u201cI felt him,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, of course, he was not there.\u201dK2 is a northern loner; it sits 800 miles northwest of Nepal\u2019s grand Himalayan peaks, exposed to winds that gust from the Arctic Circle. In February, its walls are colder and more wind-blasted than those of Everest.All of which brings us to climbing strategy.The favored mountaineering style today is Alpine, which is to say, going solo or with a partner, and without fixed ropes. A premium is placed on daring routes or the speed of the climb.None of that would work on K2 in February.The Poles mastered the dominant expedition style a half-century ago. It requires a willingness to subsume ego in the collective. If a team numbers 10 climbers, six will take the role of worker bees, laying pitons and ropes and tents at camps higher on the mountain.These men will scale cliffs of pre-collisional granite to 25,000 feet, even as K2 threatens a rain of avalanches. The summit team will pull up those ropes and sleep in those tents. As they draw within 3,000 feet of the peak, they will go forward without oxygen.How to prepare excites debate. I talk about this with Adam Bielecki, a tall drink of water with dreadlocks and a boyish ebullience. Age 33, married with a toddler and another baby on the way, he began climbing as a teenager. He is one of the elite, and a candidate to join the summit team.He overflows with ambition and chafes at old ways. Bielecki favors a bottom-of-the-world strategy to prepare: Send summit climbers to Chile, where it is summer, and climb a 22,000-foot Andean peak. Stay put until bodies accommodate to the thin air. Then fly to Pakistan and trek quickly to base camp.\u201cAll we need is three days of good weather and we will get to the top of K2,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be a revolution in high-altitude climbing.\u201dBielecki attempted that strategy during a winter ascent of Nanga Parbat, a 26,660-foot mountain in Pakistan that goes by the self-explanatory nickname Killer Mountain. The climbers arrived acclimated, but a winter storm front descended and would not lift.The younger generation of climbers view Bielecki\u2019s strategy as a good gamble. When I put the question to Wielicki, the old legend sounds distinctly unconvinced. He sees a young climber too sure of himself. \u201cYou need super luck to come from South America and find the weather to your liking,\u201d he says.He offers a thin smile. \u201cYou cannot rely on super luck.\u201dPolish Himalayan exploration all but ended in 1989. Its greatest climber, Jerzy Kukuczka, fell to his death, and an avalanche on Everest swept away five other well-known Polish climbers.The Communist government collapsed. As that wounded nation rebuilt, an age of entrepreneurs dawned. The life of a vagabond climber seemed frivolous.Artur Hajzer was among the prematurely retired. Intense, a man of many faces, he had been a partner of the famed Kukuczka. After his friend died, he could face no more mountains. He opened a chain of climbing and outdoor stores.Restlessness welled; he yearned for the Himalayas. He began to run and lost his pot belly. He and Wielicki issued a manifesto: \u201cYoung, angry, ambitious\u201d Polish climbers should embrace \u201cpositive suffering\u201d and return to winter Himalayan climbing.Wielicki speaks of daily life as drained of excitement. \u201cJob, home, eh, O.K.,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to feel great emotion, you must write a story.\u201dThey offered traditional training: winter in the Tatras, then the Alps, then the Himalayas. Their obsession was very Polish: to conquer K2. They were not hand-holders. Bielecki courted Hajzer, emailing a list of his ascents, including climbs up 20,310-foot Denali in Alaska.\u201cYour list does not impress me at all,\u201d Hajzer wrote back.Bielecki sent a longer list. Hajzer relented, a little: \u201cO.K., it looks better than I thought.\u201dBielecki had found a mentor. \u201cHe could get angry really fast. He never said he was sorry, but he was fair,\u201d Bielecki says of his teacher. \u201cWe were generational orphans and he introduced us to Himalayan climbing.\u201cI loved him.\u201dGenerational tensions bubbled. The younger climbers had trained less and came of age in a time of individual branding. When apprentices returned from a Himalayan foray with severe frostbite, veteran mountaineers scoffed at the \u201cpreschool\u201d climbers.Success came rapid-fire, as did sorrow.In the winter of 2013, Bielecki and three others set out to ascend the 26,414-foot Broad Peak. Two grew exhausted near the top, and Bielecki noted that nightfall and still more crushing cold approached. Perhaps they should retreat. The others disagreed.Bielecki and his partner made it back to their tents, badly frostbitten. The slower duo perished.A Polish mountaineering commission assailed Bielecki: You violated the brotherhood of the rope and deserted comrades. This was a too-harsh indictment. To wait for others at 25,000 feet in minus-25 degree temperatures is deadly. Ice forms thick on nostrils and goggles. Water and power gels freeze solid. Hands, feet and arms go numb.A tomb forms around you.Bielecki\u2019s voice is plaintive. \u201cOn top of a mountain in Karakoram in winter, your state of mind eludes words,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are beyond the edge of what people call fatigue.\u201dMountain deaths are dominoes; one precipitates another. Soon after, Hajzer flew to the Himalayas intent on finding peace by climbing. He carried the weight of too many deaths.A storm coiled like a snake around a mountain. Hajzer lost sight of his young partner and descended quickly, looking for him. He lost his balance and fell 1,800 feet to his death.He was 51. His body remains in a Himalayan crevasse.\u201cIt was Artur\u2019s last lecture,\u201d a climber said at his funeral in a grand cathedral in Katowice. \u201cPeople die in the mountains, even the best ones.\u201dWielicki is the remaining master. He must choose among their climbing children, and his eye is unsparing. For the summit, he must choose the elect of the elite. There is Golab, the climber who was with us in the Tatras.Bielecki, the man-child with the otherworldly endurance near the summit, is another natural choice. But his hunger for fame is a bonfire, and that worries the older man. Wielicki defended the young climber after the deaths on Broad Peak. To listen to him is to wonder if he harbors doubts.\u201cHe is a very good climber, but he has climbed for himself,\u201d the older climber says. \u201cHe is pursuing me, I. Maybe it is a little strange on our team because we all must work together.\u201dIf a storm approaches, if darkness descends, the climbers must turn back, even if within sight of that fabled summit. \u201cIf I say, \u2018No, come down\u2019, they must listen,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone wants to be the best, and that is how we die.\u201dHe gives to ambition a nod of self-recognition.\u201cLogic competes with emotion. Everyone wants to write their own story.\u201dWe wander the medieval streets and bars of Krakow with the Himalayan climbers. The question of K2, to risk all for history, falls unevenly across their shoulders. Marek Chmielarski, that painter of oil platforms, will go, although his wife, a teacher, worries.\u201cThey think we are crazy.\u201d he says. \u201cThey are right, of course.\u201dGolab is in: \u201cSometimes I wonder why I am doing this. I don\u2019t like to connect nationalism and climbing. But these are my friends and we are on a mission.\u201dWe run into Kacper Tekieli, the other Tatra climber, making cappuccinos in a coffee bar off Krakow\u2019s grand square. He could join the elite four who summit K2. That mountain, mythical and moody and deadly, once consumed him.\u201cI was captivated,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew the Polish specialty is suffering.\u201dHe grew up in Gdansk, a shipyard city, and came to climbing as a philosophy student. He took solo trips (known in Polish as the lonely style) across the high Tatras in winter. He climbed Alpine and Himalayan peaks. Last summer he lost a friend in the Indian Himalayas, watching him slip away as rescuers neared.\u201cI was very, very close to him when he fell.\u201d Tekieli\u2019s dark eyes flicker and he fingers his wedding band, which hangs on a leather cord around his neck. \u201cI will keep climbing, but I think I don\u2019t know the result of that yet.\u201dAnd K2? He shrugs. \u201cMountains are very important to me, it\u2019s the original world, a place of passion. I want to keep finding beautiful paths up mountains.\u201dHe pauses. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I need K2 in winter.\u201dDays later, Wielicki, the old legend, and I watch snow fall on a frozen lake. He acknowledges the age of winter climbing could draw to a close. Danger weighs on him as it did not decades ago. His wife is adept on cliffs, and he twitches as she moves up a rock face. He is pleased his children have not inherited his passions.And yet, God, that mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the problem of the people in the Katowice club, but of the people of Poland. Always they ask: \u2018You go? Why not? You should write something historic. Finish your story\u2019.\u201dThose who stand within the shadow of that monolith in winter describe a sensation akin to having landed on an extraterrestrial world. All is black and white and gray with periodic wild flashes of razor-blue sky and sun. K2 sits 70 miles from the nearest village, at the end of a path that threads across the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers. Periodically these ice flows disgorge the bones of dead climbers.K2\u2019s fastness is so complete, it acquired no dependable name from the Balti tribes, who for millenniums did not know of its existence. A British geographer making a trigonometric survey gave the mountain its name, a clipped abstraction capturing its indifference to life and time.The Polish mountaineers will arrive in late December and will wait days and weeks and months in hopes that incessant winds do not rend their tents. Here and there, they will climb that fantastically steep mountain and lay rope lines on its sides. Then they will slip into sleeping bags in 30- and 40-below temperatures. They will update expedition pages on Facebook and send emails to wives and girlfriends and children.They will pray for a three-day break in the weather.Why climb it? I put the question to Bielecki. He knows better than most that glory is not the inevitable reward of the Himalayas.\u201cClimbing is about pleasure and pain \u2014 in winter that balance is lost,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no pleasure to be found in Karakoram in winter. You are uncomfortable every minute of every day. But the great emotion of making history, of making an accomplishment no one else did, that is immense, almost spiritual.\u201dIt\u2019s the allure of that diamond-hard and deadly pyramid in the deepest reaches of the Karakoram range.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Sends Nafta Renegotiation Notice to Congress", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration gave Congress official notice on Thursday that it plans to renegotiate Nafta but provided only the vaguest of hints about modest changes President Trump would seek to an agreement that he has called \u201cthe worst trade deal ever.\u201dTrade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.\u201cToday, President Trump fulfilled one of his key promises to the American people,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said on Thursday. \u201cFor years, politicians have called for the renegotiation of this agreement, but President Trump is the first to follow through with that promise.\u201dThe move was met with skepticism by organizations that have long pressed for major changes to Nafta and have argued that Mr. Trump had already fallen short of his promises on trade.\u201cDonald Trump promised that he\u2019d fix Nafta on his first day in office,\u201d Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental group, said in a statement. \u201cOne hundred and nineteen days later, he has managed to send Congress a two-page letter that fails to include any real plan to fix a deal that has undermined environmental protections, eliminated jobs, undercut wages, polluted our air and water, and fueled climate change.\u201dTo redo the trade deal, the U.S. may have to make concessions that the Trump administration will be wary of offering.The notice sent on Thursday instead mentioned repeatedly that any changes would be the result of congressional consultation, and it pledged close coordination and \u201ctransparency\u201d with lawmakers throughout the renegotiation process. It laid out the framework for the talks in only the most general of terms. The letter was required under a law that mandates that the president give Congress at least 90 days\u2019 notice before opening a trade negotiation.\u201cIn particular, we note that Nafta was negotiated 25 years ago, and while our economy and businesses have changed considerably over that period, Nafta has not,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said in the letter.He noted that \u201cdigital trade\u201d had barely begun when the agreement took effect. And new provisions will be needed, he said, to address intellectual property rights, state-owned enterprises, and labor and environmental measures.\u201cMoreover, establishing effective implementation and aggressive enforcement of the commitments made by our trading partners under our trade agreements is vital to the success of those agreements and should be improved in the context of Nafta,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said.Republicans and Democrats welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts at renegotiating the deal, but many also expressed deep skepticism about the president\u2019s intentions. Republicans warned against a wholesale overhaul of Nafta, and Democrats pressed him to do just that.\u201cGiven that the agreement is more than two decades old, there are areas in which Nafta will benefit from strengthening and modernization,\u201d wrote a group of 18 Republican senators led by Jeff Flake of Arizona and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. \u201cOn the other hand, efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences.\u201dRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, pronounced Mr. Trump\u2019s letter \u201cweak\u201d and suggested he was backing off his fiery language on trade. \u201cThe president\u2019s vague Nafta letter is a stark contrast for the aggressive promises he made to hard-working families during the campaign,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said. \u201cFor all of his rhetoric, President Trump looks to be sorely disappointing American workers on trade.\u201dA coalition of labor and environmental groups said they would press for major changes to Nafta, including eliminating its secretive arbitration tribunals, which allow corporations to seek compensation from foreign governments for laws or regulations they believe hurt their business.Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, said Mr. Trump would have to choose whether to honor his campaign promises of major changes to Nafta \u2014 \u201can agenda that is as appealing to the Republicans in Congress as eating ground glass\u201d \u2014 or produce a deal that resembled the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the sweeping trade deal he has scrapped and which she argued would be disastrous for American workers.\u201cModest tweaks are not going to stop Nafta\u2019s ongoing damage, much less deliver on Trump\u2019s promises,\u201d Ms. Wallach said.Mexico\u2019s Economy Ministry released a statement welcoming the announcement. \u201cMexico reaffirms its willingness to update Nafta to face the challenges of the 21st century,\u201d it said. \u201cThe countries of North America deserve a modern instrument to regulate their trade relations.\u201dMexican officials have been eager to begin the negotiations with an eye to concluding them before Mexico\u2019s presidential election campaign begins next year.Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, has repeatedly said that Canada welcomes the opportunity to renegotiate and modernize Nafta. \u201cWe are at an important juncture that offers us an opportunity to determine how we can best align Nafta to new realities \u2014 and integrate progressive, free and fair approaches to trade and investment,\u201d Chrystia Freeland, the minister of foreign affairs, said Thursday.Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa, and Elizabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Threat to Wolves in and Around Yellowstone", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byYELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. \u2014 The vast, sagebrush-studded valleys in this huge chunk of wild country, teeming with herds of elk and bison, are home these days to 10 packs of wolves.Once among the first species to be listed as endangered, the gray wolf has made a healthy comeback within Yellowstone National Park and its bordering states. Since 1995-96 when 31 wolves were trucked into the park from Canada, their numbers have grown and stabilized to the point that officials could essentially post a \u201cno vacancy sign\u201d at Yellowstone. That\u2019s because the park\u2019s wolf population has hovered for the last decade at 100, give or take, which experts consider Yellowstone\u2019s carrying capacity.Protected on parkland, gray wolves show little fear of humans, often living out their lives within view of roads. They attract thousands of tourists a year who sometimes become witnesses to the life-or-death dramas between predator and prey.And some catch a glimpse of a rare white wolf.\u201cYellowstone is the best place in the world to view wolves,\u201d said Douglas Smith, the park\u2019s wolf biologist, as he hiked up a fog-shrouded hill searching for one of the packs.The sprawling 2.2 million-acre park acts as a laboratory for Dr. Smith and other scientists, who are conducting a long-term study of this very rare population of wolves \u2014 unusual because they are neither shot nor trapped. And it turns out a wolf protected from human killing is a very different animal from those that are hunted.That may change, researchers say, as more hunting is allowed in the states that surround the park.As the packs grew, many wolves roamed outside the national park, replenishing the wild lands. Wolves now number about 1,700 in the Western states of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington. Threats to livestock have intensified in recent years, pitting ranchers against conservationists and prompting some states to permit limited wolf hunting again at certain times.In March, a United States Court of Appeals paved the way for Wyoming to join Idaho and Montana in allowing wolf hunting. Wildlife officials are now planning a hunting season on gray wolves for this fall, based on the court\u2019s ruling that the state\u2019s plan to manage wolves was adequate to ensure that the once-threatened species would not be imperiled again by hunting wolves near the park or those that leave it.Experts say that the gray wolf is no longer in danger of being completely wiped out by hunting. Their extirpation by the 1920s or so was caused by unregulated killing.But expanding the hunt for wolves around the edges of the park poses several issues at Yellowstone Park, where the management protects wildlife so people can watch and study it.\u201cWhat will hunting wolves nearby do to that?\u201d Dr. Smith asked.If the wolves become less visible, that could diminish the steady flow of tourism dollars, given that wolf watching in Yellowstone alone is estimated to generate $35 million a year for the regional economy.Officials in Montana have already placed a quota on the number of wolves that could be shot by hunters north of the park \u2014 four each season \u2014 to minimize the impact on wolf watching in the park.Yet another possible effect of expanded hunting would be the disruption of a historic long-term wolf research project.Yellowstone\u2019s vast wilderness provides the only place in the world where many packs of wolves, free from human hunting, live in full view of groups of biologists equipped with high-tech research equipment.Ten of the park\u2019s wolves wear GPS collars that beam their whereabouts as many as 48 times a day to a satellite, providing researchers with unprecedented detail on what wolves do all day.A team of up to 20 researchers and volunteers, sitting on a hilltop with spotting scopes or peering down from aircraft, witness the daily goings-on year-round. Camera traps record remote wolf activity. And because they have lived without the threat of being shot and with near daily tourist traffic \u2014 the wolves ignore the researchers and are readily observed.As a result, a complex and in some cases unprecedented portrait of wolves is emerging.For example, protected wolves regard humans very differently. \u201cWolf hunters talk about seeing a pack of park wolves outside the boundary, and being able to pick the one they want,\u201d Dr. Smith said. \u201cThey just stand there and have no fear.\u201dWhile all wolves are very social with a hierarchy, those pack rules are often corrupted when human hunting enters the picture. In the park, researchers are getting a thorough look at pure wolf social dynamics \u2014 within and between packs.For the first time, pack longevity has been studied in depth, the life span of a pack is eight to 10 years in the park. One pack called the Druid is more than 20 years old. Hunted wolf packs, on the other hand, often last just two or three years. When one or two of the wolves are shot or trapped, members of the pack often scatter and reform with different members.Park wolves live to be about five, double the life span outside its borders. Yellowstone\u2019s oldest wolf reached 12 \u00bd years.Group dynamics also change significantly, sometimes in mercurial ways, when membership shifts or a pack loses individuals. \u201cPersonalities matter,\u201d Dr. Smith said, noting that science doesn\u2019t have a good way to assess the effect. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard.\u201dThen there is the role of the wise wolf to consider. During pack warfare, a deciding factor can be the presence of an elder, a single wolf older than five, that is even more important than the number of wolves, researchers found.Research here also leads Dr. Smith to believe that wolf packs are matrilineal. Males come and go, he said, but \u201cGramma, Mom and the daughter are the ones that stick around\u201d and carry on the pack through generations.There is some evidence that the increase in hunting could alter this research. When the alpha female in the Lamar Canyon pack left Yellowstone in 2012 and was shot, the pack split into two and the alpha male left because the new alpha female was his daughter. (Wolves avoid inbreeding.)Of course, the life of a wolf is a high-risk occupation and natural deaths occur all the time, especially when a pack tries to kill animals with hooves and horns 20 times their size. In early April, an alpha female with \u201ca belly full of pups\u201d was killed either by an elk or a bison, Dr. Smith said. Because only the alpha female in a group reproduces, \u201cthat means the pack won\u2019t have pups this year,\u201d he said.Outside the park, ranchers have been vocal in their support of expanding hunting, citing real threats to their livestock.Jon Robinett of Dubois, Wyo., says he has lost hundreds of cattle, several horses and six dogs to wolves over the last 20 years. While there are 50 wolves in his part of the Dunoir Valley, allowing hunters to take out five won\u2019t accomplish much, he said.\u201cKilling is what wolves do,\u201d he said, adding that even with reduced numbers, \u201cthey aren\u2019t going to quit their home range.\u201d The state compensates him for lost cattle, he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t make you whole.\u201dSome biologists say there are legitimate reasons to allow hunting, perhaps most important to placate residents. \u201cA little blood satisfies a lot of anger,\u201d said Ed Bangs, a retired Fish and Wildlife biologist who led the effort to restore wolves to the northern Rockies.\u201cThe wolf most likely to get harvested by a hunter is one that is in open areas with road access,\u201d the interface between ranches and wild land, Dr. Bangs said. \u201cSo hunters are removing the animals with the highest probability of getting in trouble with livestock.\u201dDr. Smith says the wolf personality is not the only wild card in the Yellowstone frame \u2014 humans figure in as well.Last year, the famed white wolf left the park and went into Montana for a few days. Dr. Smith said a hunter who hates wolves sought the 11-year-old female out as a prize trophy. But the animal returned to safety in the park.Just last month, the wolf was found with severe injuries and was euthanized. Law enforcement is investigating her death. She was almost twice as old as most wolves here, but will be missed. \u201cShe was the most coveted wolf to see,\u201d Dr. Smith said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Battle Over Bears Ears Heats Up as Trump Rethinks Its Monument Status", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byBEARS EARS NATIONAL MONUMENT, Utah \u2014 Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the interior, stepped into the desert last week at the edge of the 1.3-million-acre red-rock expanse that is roiling the West.All of the newly protected acres are in San Juan County, population 16,895, where the federal government owns roughly 60 percent of the land, and where arguments over who can use those acres \u2014 and how \u2014 have long held the fervor of religious conflict.Here, the terrain that is now a monument has fed bellies and souls for generations, its pastures sustaining cattle, its mountains turning rowdy children into rugged outdoorsmen, its juniper and sage used in native ceremonies with names like Beauty and Enemy Way.The monument designation comes with new rules, and Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to rethink the conservation area has hit like a lightning bolt, intensifying an already heated debate over who gets to control the land.\u201cWe fought, we won the century-year-old fight: the monument. And now we\u2019re up for another fight,\u201d said Mr. Adakai, 52, shielding his face from the sun with a pro-monument sign on a recent day. \u201cAnd everybody is against us. The Utah congressional delegation, the governor, the State Legislature, the county. They have a different plan.\u201dTo those like Phil Lyman, whose Mormon great-grandfather first traversed the Bears Ears during an expedition that began in 1879, Mr. Obama\u2019s designation was just the latest federal land grab, a move he believes will lock him and his neighbors out of their own backyards.\u201cYou just don\u2019t take something from somebody,\u201d said Mr. Lyman, 53, equating the monument designation to grand theft. \u201cFrom a principle standpoint, this needs to go away. I agree with President Trump: This never should have happened.\u201dBears Ears is the name of two ponderosa-studded buttes that tower over much of the region. From them sprawls the monument, a crinkled blanket of deep sandstone canyons, twisting rivers and high red mesas. In the folds of the monument sit about 100,000 archaeological sites, including wall etchings that some have called as culturally significant as the Sistine Chapel.The secretary of the interior has until June 10 to make a recommendation on Bears Ears to Mr. Trump, whose options include doing away with the monument designation, shrinking the conservation area\u2019s borders or keeping it intact.An executive order by Mr. Trump in April calls for the review of 27 monuments, most in the West, including the striated vistas of Arizona\u2019s Vermilion Cliffs, the slot canyons of Utah\u2019s Grand Staircase-Escalante and the towering forests of California\u2019s Giant Sequoia.\u201cI always get concerned about what the legacy is going to be 100 years from now,\u201d he said in a short interview, wearing a cowboy hat and a rodeo jacket as he toured the monument. \u201cI want to make sure that your children\u2019s children and mine look back at this moment and say: \u2018You know what? We did it right.\u2019 And so we\u2019re looking at innovative ways to change the way that Interior runs.\u201dThe monument has divided people in Blanding, Bluff and other Utah towns that skirt its border, and some members of families that are split on the issue have simply stopped speaking to each other. Signs reading \u201c#rescindbearsears\u201d stretch across gas stations and front lawns, which are strategically avoided by people who have taken to wearing pro-monument T-shirts.San Juan County is roughly the size of New Jersey, an 8,000-square-mile region whose contemporary tensions embody the struggles of much of the rural West, with competing and overlapping groups \u2014 Native Americans, the grandchildren of white settlers, corporations, environmentalists, the federal government \u2014 continuously jockeying for control of the land and its history.Today, San Juan\u2019s population is roughly half Native American and half white, but whites hold much of the political power. Navajo residents have spent more than 40 years suing the county over civil rights violations and fighting to get officials to pay for things like running water and rural schools in heavily native areas.For this reason, some people saw Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order as a painful rollback of recent gains.\u201cI worry that other native peoples will take this as another boot to their face,\u201d said Jim Enote, 60, a monument proponent and the director of a Zuni cultural museum. \u201cAnd it will be a kind of additive layer building up on depression of many native peoples.\u201dAt the same time, many people in San Juan County have long railed against the federal government, which decides where, when and how residents graze cattle, cut timber and extract minerals on the county\u2019s vast public acres.San Juan is the largest but poorest county in the state, a fact that is frequently blamed on federal regulations.\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be \u2018just pretty to look at,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cBut we have to be able to survive here.\u201dIn Utah, monument opponents include not only the governor and the state congressional delegation, but a sizable number of local native people.\u201cI fear it\u2019s not going to be what the government promises,\u201d said Eddie Jim, a Navajo man. He said he worried that federal officials would renege on a promise to allow traditional herb gathering in the protected area.Bears Ears, if all remains the same, will be managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, with guidance from two advisory committees. One committee includes state and local governments, outdoor enthusiasts and business owners. The other consists of elected officers from five native nations: the Hopi, the Navajo, the Ute Mountain Ute, the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, and the Zuni.The monument proclamation preserves existing mineral and grazing rights, as well as wood and herb gathering by native peoples, but prevents future mining and drilling and limits new road and trail development. No president has ever rescinded a monument, and a reduction in borders would almost surely spur a legal battle.On Mr. Zinke\u2019s monument tour, he tried to play down the divisiveness of the issue. But in the background, monument supporters handed their children signs bearing \u201c#monumentsforall,\u201d while opponents wore hats urging the secretary to \u201cMake San Juan County Great Again.\u201d There was little conversation between the two sides.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Next President: A Look at the Leading Candidates", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byFor more than half a century, South Korean voters have had to pick leaders capable of navigating fraught diplomatic waters. Presidents there need to balance the demands and challenges of China, its biggest trade partner; the United States, its principal ally; and North Korea, a hostile rival with a growing stockpile of nuclear weapons and missiles.Here\u2019s a look at South Korea\u2019s three leading presidential candidates and how they might approach Mr. Trump.Moon Jae-in, 64, a human rights lawyer, leads the latest polls by a wide margin. A former student activist, he also served in the government of his friend Roh Moo-hyun, who was president from 2003 to 2008.Mr. Moon supports South Korea\u2019s alliance with Washington, but he has contended that the country needs a more balanced diplomatic approach to the United States and China.\u201cI will create a government most feared by North Korea, most trusted by the United States and most reliable for China,\u201d Mr. Moon said in a nationally televised campaign speech in April.In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Moon accused Mr. Trump of acting \u201cunilaterally and without close bilateral consultations\u201d after suggesting that South Korea should pay for Thaad.Ahn Cheol-soo, 55, a centrist and founder of the People\u2019s Party, was polling around 10 percent as recently as March, but he has seized on growing anxiety over North Korea to become a serious contender for the presidency.Mr. Ahn initially opposed the Thaad deployment, but he has since reversed that position and said it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d to alter an agreement with an ally. That has been viewed as an attempt to woo conservative voters, who support the deployment.\u201cWe should never recognize North Korea as a nuclear power,\u201d Mr. Ahn said recently. \u201cIf the North is about to launch a nuclear attack, we should first strike the source of attack.\u201dIt remains to be seen how successful Mr. Ahn\u2019s play for the conservative vote will be. The latest surveys have shown his surge in popularity fading, as Hong Joon-pyo, the candidate of Ms. Park\u2019s conservative Liberty Korea Party, has narrowed the gap with him. That is the last snapshot of the public mood until the election; under election law, no polls conducted after Tuesday can be published.A former physician who became a software mogul before entering politics, Mr. Ahn, like Mr. Trump, is from a wealthy, well-connected family and is often characterized as a populist. The men have something else in common: an alma mater.Both Mr. Ahn and Mr. Trump attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. During a debate in April, Mr. Ahn said he would use his school connections and business background to build a rapport with the American president.Mr. Hong, 62, bills himself as the true representative of conservatives, who suffered a political body blow with Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment and have been looking for a new standard-bearer.A cantankerous ex-governor and former prosecutor, Mr. Hong has employed rhetoric that has been compared to Mr. Trump\u2019s. He has said he would order the first executions in the country in two decades and crack down on \u201caristocratic unionists\u201d whom he accuses of slowing the economy.\u201cIf I am elected, the first thing I will do is to propose a summit meeting with President Trump on board the Carl Vinson,\u201d Mr. Hong said this week, referring to the American aircraft carrier sent to the region in a show of force against North Korea.Mr. Hong has angered many people with his views on social issues \u2014 promising, for instance, to \u201ccrack down\u201d on homosexuality, on the grounds that it spreads AIDS. (Homosexuality is a sensitive issue in South Korean politics, largely because many churchgoing voters oppose it, and Mr. Moon has said that he does not approve of it.)Mr. Hong also recently said that \u201cwashing dishes is women\u2019s work.\u201d And in a passage from his 2005 memoir that recently came to light, he describes participating in what appears to be an attempted date rape while in college.In the book, Mr. Hong writes that a roommate asked him and other friends to obtain a supposed aphrodisiac, which the roommate mixed into a beer that he gave to a girl. \u201cHe said the drug did not work,\u201d Mr. Hong wrote. \u201cShe woke up and put up strong resistance, biting and scratching him in the face.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It could be anything. Tail fins. Comfort. Pink. Cimarron. Really, it\u2019s time to let that last one go \u2014 it\u2019s been nearly 30 years.Cadillac is a different company from what it was even 10 years ago and the 2017 CT6 is a perfect example. Fins, seasickness and the blatant lineage to lesser General Motors products have been banished. If there is a brand that premium buyers overlook, this is it.Meant to rival Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Mercedes S-Class, the CT6 is more affordable, in some cases by over $25,000 when comparably equipped. Starting at $54,790, my tester, a loaded all-wheel-drive Platinum model that cracked $91,000, can be considered the bargain of the segment, unless it\u2019s compared with the Genesis G90.Caddy\u2019s flagship is a bit different from the Germans\u2019 since it\u2019s not quite as large. And while the rivals coddle, the one word I would use to describe the CT6 is sporty.Yes, sporty.I think Cadillac builds some of the best-handling cars on the planet, something G.M.\u2019s marketing machine doesn\u2019t telegraph well to the masses. The CT6 is a big boy, but its adaptive suspension and the active rear-wheel steering found on all-wheel-drive models give this sedan a controlled and planted dynamic when cornering. That old spongy ride? If anything, the ride quality feels a tad too firm for the class.The base rear-wheel-drive CT6 comes with a turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder (not a typo) engine. The plug-in hybrid model travels about 30 miles on electricity alone before switching over to gas/electric operation. There is a 3.6-liter V6, too. I\u2019m driving the twin-turbo 3-liter V6 with 404 horsepower and 400 pound-ft of torque. It is a $4,000 premium over the nonturbo V6.Drive modes sharpen or relax the driving reflexes.The 8-speed transmission gets an old-school analog-type shift lever (yay!) to go with steering wheel paddle shifters. If only the gearbox were calibrated as flawlessly as BMW\u2019s 7 Series.The turbo V6 propels this luxury liner from rest to 60 miles an hour in five seconds flat. The Environmental Protection Agency rates this engine\u2019s fuel economy at 18 miles per gallon in the city and 26 highway. A cocoon of silence keeps the faint engine snarl distant. The CT6\u2019s stout chassis structure uses a lot of aluminum. A lighter car is a faster car.All but the base model come with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. The Platinum adds night vision to the gauge cluster, highlighting the heat signature of pedestrians, cyclists and animals long before the naked eye spots them. If you enjoyed the movie \u201cPredator,\u201d you will love the visual.The rearview mirror provides a glimpse into the future. Flicking the tab that normally switches it to night mode instead displays a high-definition image from a rear-mounted camera. It is wide enough to show cars in traditional blind spots since the display eliminates the back pillars. One caveat: Unlike mirrors, the video image requires you to refocus your eyes.The spacious cockpit uses quality wood, leather and carbon fiber. But this is where the Cadillac loses ground to other premium marques. A few plastic choices give this space a faint General Motors vibe. And the leather seating isn\u2019t as crisply stitched as a Coach purse (or a Mercedes or Lexus, for that matter). The seats do provide heat, venting and massage action, though.Along those lines, luxury cars are often perfectly crafted down to engine bays graced with structure braces that double as art. Few owners pop the hood these days, and Cadillac saves money by trimming out the engine bay like a Chevy. In the right light, a couple of the panels on my tester seemed off by a micrometer. I point out these fussy details since that is the state of the fierce competition at this level.An impressive Bose Panaray audio system sings with 34 speakers (again, not a typo). Its sound stage is crisp, detailed and wide. It does not clip or distort, even at earsplitting volumes. If only that splendid pain came with a knob to control the volume instead of a touch slider.Platinum\u2019s spacious back seat offers video screens that rise from the front seat backs, a fully separate dual-zone climate system and outboard seating positions that heat, cool, massage and recline. The decision to drive or be driven would be tough. Panoramic roof glass adds drama, but the headroom is pinched in the raised center seat.The back-seat hardware eliminates folding seat backs that would expand the trunk. There is a small pass-though and a spare tire (something BMW leaves out). The trunk does not match the car\u2019s large size \u2014 it holds a little less than a Chevy Cruze.Cadillac\u2019s Art and Science sharp design language looks good on the large 6 with a visual aggression that increases when the car is in motion. That sharpness sets this car apart from its competitors. And while the CT6 (which is less expensive, remember?) doesn\u2019t fully compete with A8, 7 Series and S-Class, it offers a distinct dynamic that drivers will appreciate. That is hard to sum up in one word, but it is worth a test drive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of the Fat Start-Up", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn 2003, Keith Rabois, a longtime Silicon Valley investor and executive, had an ambitious idea: He wanted to start a website that would instantly offer a fair price for your home. If you accepted the offer, the site would agree to buy your house immediately, closing the deal in a matter of days.To Mr. Rabois, the plan seemed obvious: Homes are the most expensive possession many of us own, and yet they are also the most difficult to trade on \u2014 to sell in a hurry if you need to relocate or are otherwise looking for quick cash. But tech could solve that. By analyzing lots of sales data, a company could come up with an accurate price for most homes; then the start-up could buy houses quickly, charge people a convenience fee and sell the homes over a longer period of time.There was just one problem: Back then, Silicon Valley was in the middle of a post-dot-com bust and nobody would fund such an expensive plan. So Mr. Rabois sat on the idea for more than a decade. Then in 2014, amid flusher times, he and several partners opened the home-buying company, called Opendoor. Opendoor has since raised more than $300 million in equity and has also taken out more than $500 million in debt. It plans to be in 10 markets by year\u2019s end.In the process, Opendoor also has become a model for a new kind of tech upstart: Call it the fat start-up.But modern capital markets have since unlocked far grander opportunities for tech entrepreneurs. They are blessed with essentially unlimited access to money, and ideas that once seemed too expensive, too risky or just too crazy are now getting off the ground. These start-ups are fat \u2014 with capital, with industry-altering ambition and, to their critics, often more than a little hubris.Opendoor fits that mold. Its plan is precarious: It faces rising competition, high operating costs and \u2014 because we are talking about the market that caused the global financial crisis \u2014 the possibility of an unforeseen blowup. But if it works, Opendoor could be transformative; by making buying and selling houses as easy as buying and selling cars, it might thoroughly alter the American economy and change how we think of homeownership.\u201cReal estate is a $25 trillion asset class \u2014 people spend more on housing than food, transit, health care and education,\u201d said Eric Wu, a founder and the chief executive of Opendoor. \u201cWe think we can make it work much better than it does now.\u201dSo far, Opendoor is growing quickly. In broad strokes, the service works exactly like Mr. Rabois\u2019s original vision. If you want to sell a home in Opendoor\u2019s price range, you go to the site, type in your address, answer a few questions and then wait for an email.The company has data scientists who have developed a sophisticated system for modeling home prices. Opendoor focuses on the middle of the market, and will neither buy distressed homes nor luxury homes, for which pricing dynamics aren\u2019t predictable. If your house meets its criteria, it will send you an offer meant to reflect the best estimate of your home\u2019s value.The offer comes with costs. If you use a traditional real estate agent, you pay a commission of around 5 percent to 6 percent of the sales price (the commission is split between the buyer\u2019s agent and the seller\u2019s agent). Opendoor charges an average commission of around 7.5 percent (it pays a portion of it to real estate agents).For the extra fee, you get certainty: Opendoor will close on the sale of your house in three days, clearing the way for you to relocate, buy a new house or, who knows, leave the country in case of political instability. It will also let you lease back your house if you need extra time, a convenient feature if, say, your new house needs some work.A surprising number of people are saying yes to Opendoor\u2019s offer. Mr. Wu said that about 30 percent of people who request an offer decide to take it. Opendoor declined to provide revenue or growth numbers, but because housing sales data is public, outside analysts have been able to track the company\u2019s progress. Once it buys your house, the company makes necessary repairs and then puts it up for sale. On average, it sells the house within about 90 days.The company has been streamlining other parts of the real estate process. The houses it sells are fitted with internet-enabled cameras, sensors and door locks, allowing potential buyers to unlock the home with Opendoor\u2019s app and come and go as they please. (I tested this on a visit to Phoenix in December; it was quite handy.) It also started a mortgage brokerage operation, so buyers can speed up their access to capital \u2014 a potential precursor to offering home financing on its own.Opendoor is aiming to stay ahead by offering a more customer-friendly service and by rapidly expanding. Mr. Wu argues that as the company grows, Opendoor will be able to unlock more efficiencies in its business, allowing it to reduce its commission much further \u2014 even approaching parity with the traditional sales process.\u201cThere is obviously substantial appeal for this product,\u201d Mr. Mahapatra said. \u201cBut my question would be, \u2018Is there a way that other players in this space might reproduce this seamlessness, but be less expensive?\u2019\u201dFinally, there\u2019s the nightmare scenario: a real estate crash. Part of the reason Opendoor is expanding to new markets is to avoid the vicissitudes of the business. Opendoor\u2019s biggest liability is all the houses it owns; if some kind of disaster were to befall Phoenix and home sales cratered there, Opendoor would find itself holding hundreds of houses it couldn\u2019t sell. By operating in several markets, Mr. Wu said, the company could insulate itself from local crashes.What if there\u2019s a nationwide correction? Mr. Wu said his team had run simulations on previous crashes, including in 2008, and had found one of two scenarios: On the one hand, the business might slow down for a few years, then pick up as the market does. Or it might even do better, because sellers would decide to pay a higher premium to get a certain offer.\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that we might thrive in times of volatility,\u201d Mr. Wu said.Sound crazy? Yeah, well, we\u2019re talking about a website that will make an offer on your house, sight unseen. Everything about it is crazy. But that\u2019s the tech business these days, and who knows \u2014 it could work.An earlier version of this column misstated Opendoor\u2019s operating procedure. It will make an offer on your house sight unseen, but it will not close the deal without seeing it.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Catalonia Should Stay With Spain", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 \u201cGarc\u00eda,\u201d my second name, is the most common surname in Spain. It is also the most common surname in Catalonia, in each and every one of its four provinces. Culturally, too, Catalonia and the rest of Spain are basically the same: We mostly watch the same TV shows, listen to the same music and enjoy the same movies.Our shared history, too, is long and deep. Catalonia has been an integral part of Spain since the nation\u2019s inception. To be sure, Spain is also a country with a complex history formed by the joining of different medieval kingdoms. The Catalans actively participated in that process, helping to draw up the first Spanish Constitution, the C\u00e1diz one in 1812, which established Spain\u2019s modern nationhood.Spain\u2019s complex history is reflected in language. While Catalan, Galician and Euskara (or Basque) are all languages spoken by the Spanish, Castilian Spanish is the mother tongue of most Spaniards, about 82 percent of the population, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer survey. Spanish is also the mother tongue for a majority of Catalans, about 55 percent.In short, Catalan society is fully a part of Spanish society, and it is easy for Catalans to identify as compatriots with all other Spaniards. Spain\u2019s economy and Catalonia\u2019s are likewise inextricably linked \u2014 about 40 percent of Catalonia\u2019s exports go to the rest of Spain.I insist on these ideas because the Catalan separatist movement likes to highlight the presumed differences between Catalonia and Spain, as if they could be considered two different realities. Only a minority of Catalans shares that view: According to polls, less than 23 percent of the population feels exclusively Catalan; more than 72 percent of respondents identify as Spanish to some extent.The current Constitution of 1978 was successful in setting up a country that, while maintaining unity, allowed for the creation of \u201cautonomous communities,\u201d which let the different regions of Spain gain limited rights of self-government. The system of governance is far from simple, since not all of these autonomous communities enjoy the same powers, and there are shared powers between the central state and the regions. But the arrangement is probably the one that best responds to the country\u2019s characteristics.Since the establishment of the 1978 Constitution, the Catalan community has acquired considerable autonomy. At present, the regional government oversees education, health, some infrastructure, policing and prisons. The Spanish government retains authority over customs, borders and international relations, although this doesn\u2019t prevent the Catalan government from carrying out what is referred to as \u201cexternal action\u201d \u2014 involving dealings with other countries \u2014 provided it doesn\u2019t interfere with the state\u2019s prerogatives. Many Catalans are perfectly satisfied with the current situation, which includes, through Spain, membership in the European Union.That is why many Catalans like me have concerns about the secessionist movement that now controls the government and the regional Parliament. We do not want a movement to full independence that would separate us from Spain, turning Catalonia into something different from what it is now.We are also worried that such a separation would distance us from the European Union. Despite the secessionists\u2019 mantra that independence for Catalonia would not lead to exclusion from the European Union, the practical matter is that if Catalonia became a new state, it could not be a member of the European Union until the member states approved its incorporation. That would take years of negotiation, at best \u2014 a scenario of uncertainty and risk that is neither justified nor desirable.Many Catalans are also concerned about the regional government\u2019s use of the powers it already has. In its push to create a new state, the regional government is already breaking the law, defying the courts and usurping state powers. For example, public schools give most classes in Catalan, including to those children who speak Spanish as their mother tongue.These actions by the regional government threaten the democratic guarantees of Catalans under the Spanish Constitution. If the secessionists in the Catalan Parliament and executive branch continue their reckless push for independence, it will threaten all the advantages of stability, prosperity and security that Catalans have enjoyed for decades by being part of the European Union, and for centuries by being part of Spain.Rafael Arenas Garc\u00eda is a law professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Light for Science, and Cooperation, in the Middle East", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byIn what they hope will be a spark of light in years of darkness, a group of scientists circulated a beam of electrons around a ring in Allan, Jordan, in January.The group, called Sesame, is made up of physicists from several countries that rarely talk to one another \u2014 Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Turkey and Pakistan \u2014 and also from the Palestinian Authority, but whose scientists are determined to collaborate.Chosen for its resonance in the region\u2019s culture, the name Sesame now works as an acronym for Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East. The Sesame institute is set to open its doors on May 16, in a ceremony to be attended by King Abdullah II of Jordan.There are about 60 such light sources in the world, which have been become increasingly valuable as tools in medicine and engineering. In April, for example, scientists using X-rays from a light source at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California discovered new details about the structure of proteins that regulate blood pressure, raising the possibility of better treatments for hypertension.Sesame, in short, could bring world-class modern physics to a region of the world lacking much in the way of facilities or research money, its proponents say. \u201cSomebody with a bright idea could get a Nobel with this,\u201d said Christopher Llewellyn Smith, an Oxford University physics professor and president of the Sesame Council, the governing body of the project.But perhaps that might be the least of it, according to Eliezer Rabinovici, a theoretical physicist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem who has been pursuing a dream of Arab-Israeli cooperation, walking a political and technical tightrope past wars, treaties, negotiations, ultimatums, assassinations and other crises with his friends and collaborators for more than 20 years.This is the story of an impossible dream, a journey to what Dr. Rabinovici calls a parallel universe of peace and cooperation in the Middle East. \u201cWe call it the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he said recently.Sesame is following a path blazed by CERN, which was birthed by Unesco with the aims of reviving European science after World War II and fostering a spirit of cooperation on the Continent.The only difference today, Dr. Llewellyn Smith noted, is that in Europe hostilities had already ended, while in the Middle East they are still very much alive.Dr. Rabinovici traced the origins of Sesame to the 1993 Oslo Accords, when Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat shook hands in front of President Bill Clinton.At the time he was working at CERN. A short while later, he recalled, an Italian colleague, Sergio Fubini, walked into his office and told him it was time to put his \u201cna\u00efve idealism\u201d to the test.Science is a natural way to build bridges between cultures and nations, Dr. Rabinovici said, because of its common language.He and Dr. Fubini went on to create a self-appointed Middle Eastern Science Committee, which in turn led to a meeting in November 1995 in a big red tent at Dahab, Egypt, in the Sinai Desert near the Red Sea, attended by scientists from around the Middle East and beyond. They escaped uninjured from a 6.9-magnitude earthquake. \u201cWe saw Mount Sinai shake,\u201d Dr. Rabinovici said.In another telling moment, the Egyptian minister of scientific research Venice Gouda, asked everyone to stand for a moment of silence in honor of Mr. Rabin, who had been assassinated just two weeks before.\u201cThe silence echoes in my ears still today,\u201d Dr. Rabinovici said.The group got a mission when German scientists offered it an old accelerator known as Bessy, that had served as a light source in Berlin and was being replaced after the country was reunified.While the group was hesitant to accept such a relic because it might not attract first-class research, \u201cit was clear that one has to take it because you cannot build a coalition of Arabs and Israelis around something which is air,\u201d Dr. Rabinovici said.Bessy was dismantled and shipped in boxes to the Jordanian desert, which had been chosen as the site for what was now called Sesame. \u201cJordan was the site. It was where everybody could come,\u201d he said.There, plans evolved. Bessy would become the booster, or first stage, of a newer, more powerful synchrotron propelling electrons to energies of 2.5 billion electron volts. (By comparison, the protons in the Large Hadron Collider are bumped to energies of about seven trillion electron volts.)The idea behind synchrotron light sources is to turn what was once a liability and wasted energy into a scientific tool. As charged particles, in this case electrons, are accelerated around an electromagnetic racetrack in machines like the Large Hadron Collider, they radiate energy, so-called synchrotron radiation. The output of the machine can be tuned by inserting arrays of magnets called wigglers and undulators to make the electrons dance and produce very powerful pencil beams of any type of light.How these beams are reflected or absorbed by the target materials can reveal the arrangements and shapes of molecules the way the double helix of DNA was revealed by X-ray photographs taken by Rosalind Franklin back in the 1950s.As built, Sesame has room for seven different such beams, providing energy from X-rays to infrared, or heat radiation, to experiments.When it opens for business, however, there will be only two.The first is an X-ray beam that will be used, among other things, to study pollution in the Jordan Valley, by ascertaining the amounts of metals like chromium and zinc in soil samples.Another beam will supply infrared waves for an infrared microscope that will employ the same principles as the night-vision goggles worn by soldiers or snipers to study, say, cancer cells and other biological tissues.A third beam planned for the end of the year will supply X-rays for crystallography, the study of the structures of proteins and viruses.The group has already received 55 proposals for the use of those beams \u2014 more than they can accept, Dr. Llewellyn Smith said.To the scientists, money has been as big a problem as politics. Dr. Rabinovici said, \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that we have all these people together \u2014 that\u2019s nice. But ultimately this is going to be decided by the quality of the science. And this is where we need help.\u201d\u201cWe are working on a shoestring budget,\u201d he added. \u201cGood science costs money.\u201dIn all, about $90 million has gone into getting the project going so far, according to Dr. Llewellyn Smith. That includes $5 million apiece pledged by Israel, Jordan, Turkey and Iran and another grant of 5 million euros from the European Union, which enabled CERN to help build the magnets and supervise construction of the Sesame machine.\u201cI saw that crew of Europeans working on it, and they were excited. You could see it in their eyes; their eyes were shining,\u201d Dr. Rabinovici said. The latest piece of largess was a $7 million grant from Jordan for a solar power plant, which will make Sesame the first accelerator in the world powered by renewable energy.One likely contributor to the cause is missing \u2014 the United States \u2014 much to the chagrin of many scientists and bureaucrats.Franklin Orr, under secretary for science and energy in the Department of Energy during the Obama administration, and now a professor at Stanford, said the administration had tried to find funding.\u201cIt didn\u2019t jell, we didn\u2019t have a source of money,\u201d he said. The budget issues are not likely to get easier, he added. \u201cGetting an appropriation through Congress would be tricky at best.\u201dAs with CERN, members pay dues based on the size of their economies for operating expenses estimated to be somewhat less than $6 million a year.Originally formed through Unesco, the nine Sesame members each hold two seats, typically a scientist and a diplomat, on its council, which is led by Dr. Llewellyn Smith. The council appoints a director, presently Khaled Toukan, who is also head of the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission.Neither Dr. Rabinovici, who said he had met Dr. Alimohammadi once, nor Dr. Llewellyn Smith said they could see any connection between Sesame and the killings. The Sesame Council condemned the murders, insisting that its project had no military connections.At present Sesame consists of about 50 scientists and technicians working in a building surrounded by a secure cyclone fence. Italy is building a hostel that will provide a place for visitors to stay and include that key ingredient of scientific life, a cafeteria. Accidental encounters and gossip glommed over lunch or coffee loom large in the mythology of scientific discovery.In that regard, behind its secure fence, Sesame will be no different than any lab in the world, Dr. Llewellyn Smith said. \u201cWorking 20 hours a day and meeting in the cafeteria, that\u2019s where a lot of science and discussion happens.\u201dAs a theoretical string theorist Dr. Rabinovici won\u2019t be found in the cafeteria or manning a beam line this summer; indeed he professed ignorance of the details of how they work. So why, he was asked over tea during a visit to The New York Times recently, has he been doing this?The answer, of course, comes from string theory, where, he explained, it often (and controversially) comes out that there are many possible universes. \u201cI must say that personally, I always wanted to visit some of these other universes, just to see how things are there.\u201dSo with the Sesame project, he went on, \u201cI actually got to live in a universe where Arabs, Israelis, Iranians, Pakistanies work together for the same cause for their own people, for humanity. And that definitely feels good.\u201dIt is too grandiose, he said, to call Sesame a beacon of hope, \u201cbut we have shown a way.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East, or Sesame, project erroneously included one country on a list of those participating as members. While Bahrain was involved in the project initially, it is not currently a member.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Adds Another Chinese Trademark to His Portfolio ", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China has granted President Trump preliminary approval for another trademark in apparel, expanding business interests that have already generated criticism over potential conflicts.Mr. Trump, the businessman, has collected trademarks that span a broad range of countries and industries, including soap in India and vodka in Israel. With the latest approval in China, Mr. Trump could bring his total trademarks in the country to 116, giving his business empire greater access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy.But the globalist approach runs counter to a populist president who has pushed a nationalistic agenda. The portfolio of trademarks could also leave Mr. Trump vulnerable to perception problems, as well as potential conflicts.Alan Garten, executive vice president and chief legal officer at the Trump Organization, said the application \u201cwas filed months before the election as part of an action to cancel an infringing mark, and the registration has since been assigned to DTTM Operations,\u201d a holding company.China\u2019s Trademark Office granted Mr. Trump preliminary approval for the trademark \u2014 which can be used in clothing like trousers, underwear and suits \u2014 on May 6. The trademark will be formally registered three months later, if the agency receives no objections.It is unclear how Mr. Trump plans to use his trademarks. Unlike in the United States, people who file for trademarks in China do not have to give a reason for their application.That lack of a disclosure requirement has given rise to a crush of people registering the names of well-known brands, a practice known as \u201ctrademark squatting.\u201d Trademark lawyers in the country often advise celebrities and overseas companies to file for trademarks across many sectors in a strategy known as \u201cdefensive filing\u201d because litigation is an expensive and time-consuming process.\u201cAs a legal matter, the trademark itself is a thing of value, as proven by how hard the president has fought for some of these trademarks over the years, in China and elsewhere,\u201d said Norman Eisen, who was an ethics lawyer for former President Barack Obama. Mr. Eisen is part of a group that sued Mr. Trump, alleging that his business interests violate the emoluments clause in the Constitution that bars presidents from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments.\u201cThe Constitution simply does not allow him to collect foreign tributes of this kind while he sits in the Oval Office,\u201d he added.The Trump Organization has said it will not do any further international deals. The business is now being run by the president\u2019s two adult sons.Senators have expressed concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s trademarks in China, saying Beijing could use them to sway policy decisions. In March, Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said \u201cofficials in Beijing have come to appreciate the potential return on investments for China in having a positive, personal business relationship with the president of the United States, who has not taken appropriate and transparent steps to completely sever his relationship from the corporation that bears his name.\u201dChina has said it has acted in accordance with the law regarding Mr. Trump\u2019s trademarks.Zhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Question Isn\u2019t Why Wage Growth Is So Low. It\u2019s Why It\u2019s So High.", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewOne of the economy\u2019s biggest mysteries is this: The labor market is the strongest it has been in a decade, yet wages are rising barely faster than inflation.For some reason, the booming job market and ultralow unemployment rate, which fell to 4.4 percent in April, haven\u2019t led employers to raise pay in a meaningful way. That flies in the face of a basic assumption of how the economy works: A tight labor market is expected to lead to pay increases that in turn fuel broader inflation.But the mystery of the missing pay raises may have a surprisingly simple solution, and one that sheds light on the larger economic challenges of our age.Consider a simple model for how much the average worker\u2019s pay ought to be rising: You could simply add together the productivity growth rate \u2014 how rapidly the output generated by each hour of labor is increasing \u2014 and the inflation rate, which tells us how quickly prices are rising.Over the last 24 months through March, inflation has come in at 1.4 percent a year, and productivity growth at 0.6 percent. Those are very low numbers. And in our supersimple model, you may expect average worker wages to have risen only 2 percent.In fact, the average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial private sector workers rose 2.4 percent a year in that period. You may not feel like cheering about that, but it\u2019s more than we might have expected, with inflation and productivity so weak. The real mystery, then, isn\u2019t why wages are rising so slowly, but why they\u2019re rising so fast.If anything, the numbers show that workers are capturing more than their share of the spoils from a growing economy. And that, as it happens, is the reverse of a decades-long trend. For most of the last half-century \u2014 84 percent of the time since 1966 \u2014 average wages have grown more slowly than would be predicted based on productivity and inflation growth. The rise in the share of employee compensation that takes the form of health benefits instead of wages is a factor, but doesn\u2019t explain the whole gap; for long stretches, that gap exceeded 2 percentage points a year.That means the labor share of national income was shrinking, or, more plainly, that workers\u2019 slice of the economic pie got smaller while the part taken by shareholders and other owners of capital grew.Why? Minimum wage increases in several states probably contributed. Obama administration efforts to shift the playing field toward workers may have helped, too. But we don\u2019t know whether this is a temporary blip or the beginning of a trend, in which employee paychecks will swell with a greater share of the fruits of economic growth.Surely, the low unemployment rate is an important factor. Economic theory tells us that when workers are scarce, employers have to raise wages, though it hasn\u2019t always worked out that way: Wage growth underperformed productivity and inflation during some periods of low joblessness, including in the mid-1980s and mid-2000s.Indeed, economists at Goldman Sachs recently studied which factors drive wage trends in 10 major economies, and identified low productivity growth as the main culprit behind the recent weakness in wage numbers around the world. (Low inflation, Jan Hatzius and Sven Jari Stehn found, has been \u201ca negative but more temporary factor.\u201d)Recently, labor costs have begun to grow faster than revenue for some companies, which attribute that development to a mix of government policy and general good times.Even if we don\u2019t have complete answers, that much is relatively straightforward. But the wage question quickly leads us into more difficult economic questions.Or at least that\u2019s the theory, and one that is a starting assumption for a great deal of policy making. The Federal Reserve Board reckons it can\u2019t let the unemployment rate get too low, or a burst of inflation will come. In reality, though, the relationship between unemployment and inflation is not straightforward and seems to be always moving.Even less is known about the ties between wages and productivity. This is particularly important if, as our analysis of wage trends suggests, low productivity growth is the culprit behind Americans\u2019 small inflation-adjusted pay increases during the last few years.One way of thinking about productivity growth is that it is rooted in unpredictable innovations that have little to do with anything else in the economy. Say a genius inventor creates a robot that mows your lawn perfectly. Human landscapers might lose their jobs, but if they find something worthwhile to do, the productive capacity of the economy will grow.Unfortunately, the picture isn\u2019t entirely clear. The process by which businesses and their workers become more productive is something of a black box, deeply important yet not really understood. But perhaps we can at least ask better questions: The real mystery isn\u2019t why wage growth is so low, but why productivity is so low. And solving it could leave both workers and their bosses better off.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Census and Right-Wing Hysteria", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byOpinionSeveral years ago, the Census Bureau began to predict that the United States would become a majority-minority nation by the 2040s \u2014 that African- and Asian-Americans, as well as Latinos, would outnumber non-Hispanic whites. Last year the census underlined its prediction by announcing that non-Hispanic white babies under the age of 1 were already in the minority.These numbers have become a handy data point for whites fearful that they are being threatened and overwhelmed by a growing tide of darker-skinned people. In this way, the census may have unintentionally increased white racism, thereby justifying the longstanding Republican strategy of turning itself into a whites-first party. White fears probably even helped Donald Trump win the 2016 election.Nonetheless, the \u201cminority-majority\u201d forecast, as it is commonly interpreted, is likely to be proven wrong. Not only could whites remain a majority well past midcentury, but they will retain political, economic and cultural control of the country long after that.In the 19th century, the Irish, particularly poor ones, were described as black or swarthy, as were the equally poor Eastern and Southern European immigrants who followed. But by the 1960s, their grandchildren were called white ethnics.The same whitening is now taking place among the descendants of Asian and light-skinned Latinos, particularly those already in the middle class. But native-born African-Americans, Afro-Caribbeans and African immigrants are still excluded.The question is whom whites will still identify as nonwhite by the 2040s. Most likely, ever-larger number of whites will see people of mixed races and the children of intermarriages as white, increasing the white population.But the three populations differ in many ways. Moreover, they compete against one another for jobs and other scarce resources, including political power. They may discriminate against one another when they want or need to, and can do so.Each racial group is diverse in many ways, to begin with by initial national origin. Chinese immigrants are culturally different from Japanese ones, Mexicans are unlike Peruvians and West Indian blacks do not share the same experience as African-Americans, even though both were once enslaved.Each is also internally stratified. Rich members keep their distance from the rest, and descendants of earlier immigrants sometimes exploit the later arrivals. They may even discriminate against one another by region of origin and shades of skin color.Because of all this, even beyond the 2040s, the populations are unlikely to act together as a unified group, a cohesive voting bloc or any kind of cultural majority.In all fairness, the Census Bureau\u2019s majority-minority forecast reports have always been brief and strictly limited to the numbers. They never considered possible changes in the perception of race in the next two decades. Perhaps the demographers never even imagined that their findings could be interpreted to demonstrate that nonwhites would \u201coverwhelm\u201d whites.Had that idea come up, they might have suggested that non-Hispanic whites\u2019 becoming a minority said nothing about whether they would still control the country socially, economically, politically and almost every other way. After all, states like California and Texas are already majority-minority, and others, including Georgia, Maryland and Nevada, will soon join them. Whites remain dominant in all of them.The census cannot say this, but whites should fear instead that many of them are increasingly suffering some of the same economic and political pains as nonwhites. All are victims of an economy that has computerized many jobs and sent others overseas. All are victims of a political system that is ever more dominated by business and a donor class that funds many election campaigns.However, most whites do not see their common victimhood and too many blame blacks, Latinos and now Middle Eastern and other recent immigrants for their troubles.The Census Bureau\u2019s majority-minority prediction could be interpreted as contributing to this blaming practice. The bureau will need to address this in case the forecast becomes a weapon in the country\u2019s political battles, impairing its credibility.The census could start by pointing out that rising intermarriage, whitening and other cultural changes could affect and even invalidate its prediction for the 2040s.Or it could go further and abandon that forecast and the entire majority-minority idea. The country will be better off if the Census Bureau does so as soon as possible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration\u2019s Push for Gas Exports Faces Market Glut", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 The Trump administration is moving to make the United States the world\u2019s leading exporter of natural gas as a central component of both energy and trade policy.The administration\u2019s ambitions were explained emphatically last month by Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and they were followed up by the Energy Department\u2019s authorization last Tuesday for a Texas export terminal that Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum have pursued for years. Other administration plans include opening the way for more gas exports from Oregon to serve Asia.In recent years, there was strong domestic opposition to the exports, from manufacturers and others, out of fear that domestic gas prices would rise, and the Obama administration moved cautiously before increasing the pace of export terminal permit approvals during its second term.With supplies appearing bountiful, and other countries aiming to increase their own production, opposition has mostly abated, except in pockets of the East Coast and Pacific Northwest. There remains enthusiastic support along the gulf coasts of Louisiana and Texas, where there is substantial room for more growth.For the Trump administration, the economic benefits of gas export infrastructure are paramount. Each natural gas export terminal can require an investment of $10 billion or more, produce thousands of construction jobs and consume millions of pounds of steel. Then there is the additional drilling and production of gas, which is then cooled to minus 260 degrees, condensing it to a liquid known as liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., to be shipped on giant tankers to Asian, European and Latin American markets.\u201cExporting L.N.G. meets many objectives, including helping to address the trade imbalance,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit, a consultancy. \u201cThis supports jobs, this supports investment in energy, this supports exports, a whole host of administration objectives.\u201dOnce six facilities under construction or being expanded are completed over the next few years, the additional liquefied gas exports could amount to as much as $50 billion in annual revenue, depending on gas prices. Much of that would help balance the trade deficit with China, an administration objective.Additionally, four big pipelines are being built this year to take more gas to Mexico, and at least two more are slated to begin transporting gas by the end of 2018. With Mexico converting its power sector to natural gas from fuel oil, the country already imports more than 5 percent of United States gas production, which particularly helps Texas gas producers and pipeline companies.To some extent, even American coal companies could benefit from more gas exports, because exporting natural gas tends to support its price. That is important because inexpensive gas has been the leading enemy of the shrinking coal industry, a head-to-head competitor.Proponents in the State and Energy Departments have also long argued that more gas exports can provide better security to energy-hungry allies like Japan; lessen the dependence of Europe on Russia, which has been known to use gas as a political weapon; and speed up the replacement of coal with gas to curb climate change.But construction has begun on so many terminals in recent years in Australia, Malaysia, Russia and the United States that supplies of liquefied gas shipped in tankers are expected to increase by nearly 50 percent over the next five years while global gas demand is increasing by less than 2 percent a year.In the United States alone, where Cheniere Energy began major liquefied gas exports only last year, shipments are expected to jump to nearly six billion cubic feet a day from the current 1.5 billion cubic feet a day by the end of the decade as a cluster of projects are completed on the gulf coast.The momentum for start-ups hit a wall over the last two years worldwide, and four United States projects approved in recent years have not yet begun construction. Companies have been content to complete the permitting process, seek financing and markets, and develop construction plans in the hope they can act fast in case the market turns around.\u201cThe pace follows the market and not the wishes of the U.S. government,\u201d said Nikos Tsafos, president and chief analyst at the consultancy Enalytica. \u201cNo one is really out there fishing for new projects right now.\u201dThe gas business is cyclical, and proponents say it is only a matter of time before demand picks up. China and India are increasingly turning to gas to replace coal and improve the air quality of their cities. Gas demand for transport is growing in Iran, Pakistan and Argentina. Germany has largely given up on nuclear power, and it needs natural gas to replace some of the lost power.Some L.N.G. executives say that the global demand for gas will grow as more export and import terminals are built and that the United States will continue to have a cost advantage over other major producers, including Qatar and Russia, because of the abundance of American gas production.\u201cIt\u2019s been demonstrated over the last two years that when you have low natural gas prices, demand increases much faster than what people think,\u201d said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian, a Houston company developing a $15 billion L.N.G. export project south of Lake Charles, La.\u201cThe Trump administration has discovered the power of natural gas,\u201d Mr. Souki added. \u201cToday, we are the top gas producer in the world, and in another three or four years, we\u2019ll be one of the top two gas exporters in the world, right up there with Russia.\u201dThat is certainly what the Trump administration is hoping for, although its policies may not have much of an immediate impact.\u201cWe could be and should be the largest exporter of L.N.G. in the world,\u201d Mr. Cohn said at a Washington conference in April. He said the first thing the administration would do was issue a permit for an export facility in the Northwest, a reference to the Jordan Cove L.N.G. terminal in the Oregon port of Coos Bay, where a Canadian company, Veresen, has proposed to build.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last year denied a permit to the terminal as well as a pipeline to link it to production, saying the pipe would have \u201cadverse effects on landowners.\u201d There was also strong opposition from local environmental groups.The commission can reconsider the issue, but not any time soon, because three of its five seats are vacant and the Senate has been known to take months to confirm commission nominations.With additional fanfare, the Energy Department last week authorized Golden Pass Products, a partnership between Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum, to export domestically produced gas from the Texas coast.\u201cThis is not only good for our economy and American jobs but also assists other countries with their energy security,\u201d said Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who championed the oil and gas industry as Texas governor.The Golden Pass facility, originally designed for gas imports before the shale production boom created a glut, has largely remained dormant for the last six years. With an additional investment of $10 billion or so, the plant could become a force on international markets and export two billion cubic feet of gas a day, nearly 3 percent of current American gas production.Golden Pass claims construction of the facility would mean 45,000 direct and indirect jobs over five years, and 3,800 direct and indirect permanent jobs.The partnership released a one-line statement in response to the administration announcement: \u201cGolden Pass Products is pleased to have achieved this important regulatory milestone as we continue to work to develop the export opportunity.\u201dBut executives noted that the companies had not yet made a final decision on whether to go ahead with the investment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emboldened by Rouhani\u2019s Win, Iranians Seek Further Reforms", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byEmboldened by the election results, others gathered in the capital, Tehran, to begin demanding what they hope a second term for Mr. Rouhani will bring: the release of opposition figures, more freedom of thought and fewer restrictions on daily life.For those who had voted for Mr. Rouhani, there was a feeling of tremendous relief that his challenger, the hard-line cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who criticized the nuclear deal with the United States and other Western powers, had lost.\u201cBye bye, Raisi,\u201d the crowds chanted during the street gatherings.The election outcome was widely seen as evidence that Iran\u2019s society has changed radically over the past decades. Influenced by satellite television, cheaper international travel, the internet, waves of migration to big cities and access to higher education, most of Iranian society now adheres to middle-class values.This collides with the reigning anti-Western ideology and strict interpretation of Islam that was represented by Mr. Raisi and promoted by state organizations.The big question now is whether Mr. Rouhani will use his second term to focus on the economy, as he did after being elected in 2013, or whether he will also try to push the social reforms that his supporters are asking for.\u201cHe faces a difficult task,\u201d said Fazel Meybodi, a Shiite Muslim cleric from the city of Qom who supports reforms. He suggested that there were many more demands than Mr. Rouhani could handle.But people in the capital wanted to celebrate the victory \u2014 and voice a call for action.The middle-class Iranians in the Tehran neighborhoods who brought Mr. Rouhani his victory, often by waiting for hours in long lines at polling stations, drove their cars and played loud music in jubilation, often stopping to get out and dance, ignoring a ban on such gatherings.Police officers simply stood by, often smiling. One officer, stationed in the northwestern Saadat Abad neighborhood, told people in a passing car that this evening, everything was allowed.Pumping their fists in the air, the group \u2014 including middle-class families pushing baby strollers, hipster youths wearing John Lennon-style glasses and unemployed men with holes in their shoes \u2014 snaked through the streets in long lines. Here, too, the police stood by and did not interfere.Thousands of others gathered at Tehran\u2019s central Vali-e Asr Square, shouting political slogans and calling for the release of former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi; his wife, Zahra Rahnavard; and Mehdi Karroubi, a former speaker of Parliament. Those opposition leaders have been under house arrest since 2011, without trial, after their involvement in the 2009 protests that disputed the election victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\u201cNow he must provide more freedoms, break the hard-line monopoly on the state-run radio and television, and increase freedom of press,\u201d Mr. Meybodi said of Mr. Rouhani. To achieve all that, the president must persuade the hard-line-dominated judiciary and security forces to change their outlook, Mr. Meybodi said. \u201cIf he fails to deliver on at least 70 percent of those promises, his future is dark.\u201dOn Friday, during the voting, many people said they were determined to keep Mr. Raisi out of office.\u201cWe are afraid he will laud in the return of the dark and difficult times we had before Mr. Rouhani,\u201d said Shaghal Akhari, 65, referring to the presidency of Mr. Ahmadinejad, whose two terms were defined by international crises and an atmosphere of heightened security inside the country. \u201cWe want to go forward, not backward,\u201d she said.At one point on Saturday, on Vali-e Asr Street, a woman with her 2-year-old daughter led hundreds of people, egging them on to call for the release of the opposition leaders. Ever since the mass demonstrations of 2009, the woman said, she had felt suffocated.The woman, who did not want to be identified for security reasons, said she had long lived with simmering anger over the state\u2019s handling of the protests. This night, she said, all emotions came to the surface.Iran\u2019s Interior Ministry released a statement on Sunday emphasizing that all street gatherings were banned, and called on those who wanted to hold victory celebrations to obtain permits for gatherings in closed-off venues.The director of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s campaign, Morteza Haji, also called on people to stay off the streets. \u201cIf there are plans for gatherings, after going through the necessary steps, we will announce the details,\u201d he told the Iranian Student News Agency.As Iran elects a new president, I drove 550 miles from its holiest city to the capital to see how people are divided.For those who voted for change, there was more to celebrate. Iranian reformists and moderates swept the Tehran City Council elections, winning all 21 seats and removing all hard-liners, the Iranian news media reported on Sunday. This will probably mean that the mayor, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who had challenged Mr. Rouhani in the presidential elections, will be removed in the coming months, analysts said. Reformists are also sweeping council seats in Mashhad, home to Mr. Raisi; in Karaj, a satellite city of Tehran; and in Yazd and Zahedan.By now, Iran\u2019s hard-liners are used to not winning the popular vote, but they are able to impose their views using centers of power under their control. Iranian activists are already bracing for a possible wave of arrests, as happened after Mr. Rouhani was elected in 2013.But the widespread popular support for Mr. Rouhani will no doubt be a boost for the re-elected president and his backers.\u201cThere will be no reason for the judiciary to create obstacles for Mr. Rouhani if he manages to improve the economy,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist who supports the president. \u201cIf he manages to appease the grass roots and poor, there is no way they can stop him from implementing other changes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It Possible to Resist Deportation in Trump\u2019s America?", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "FeatureLiving under draconian state laws, Arizona activists honed an effective strategy for keeping undocumented immigrants in the country. Can the same tools still work today?Supported byGarc\u00eda Aguilar and her family \u2014 her husband and two children \u2014 squeezed together with four Puente staff members into the cramped little office that the group uses for private consultations. Carlos Garcia, Puente\u2019s executive director, had bought a fresh pack of cigarettes right before the talk; he needed nicotine to carry him through the discomfort of telling Garc\u00eda Aguilar that she would almost certainly be deported on Wednesday. Until that moment, she and her family had not wanted to believe that the executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 25 had made her expulsion a priority. She had been living in the United States for 22 years, since she was 14 years old; she was the mother of two American citizens; she had missed being eligible for DACA by just a few months. Suddenly, none of that counted anymore.Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s troubles with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began in 2008, after police raided Golfland Sunsplash, the amusement park in Mesa, Ariz., where she worked. She spent three months in jail and three months in detention. (ICE booked her under the last name \u201cGarc\u00eda de Rayos.\u201d) In 2013, an immigration court ordered her removal. Yet under pressure from Puente, which ultimately filed a class-action lawsuit contending that Maricopa County\u2019s work-site raids were unconstitutional, ICE allowed Garc\u00eda Aguilar (and dozens of others) to remain in Arizona under what is known as an order of supervision. ICE could stay her removal because the Obama administration\u2019s guidelines for the agency specified terrorists and violent criminals as priorities for deportation. But Trump\u2019s January orders effectively vacated those guidelines; one order specifically instructed that \u201caliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed.\u201d Garc\u00eda Aguilar, who had a felony for using a fabricated Social Security number, was unlikely to be spared.Orders of supervision are similar to parole; undocumented immigrants who have them must appear before ICE officers periodically for \u201ccheck-ins.\u201d Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s next check-in was scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 8. She had three options, Garcia explained. She could appear as usual and hope for the best. She could try to hide. Or she could put up a fight, either from a place of sanctuary or by appearing for her check-in amid media coverage that Puente would organize on her behalf. Whatever she decided, he said, she would be wise to spend Tuesday preparing for separation from her children.The family was devastated. Garc\u00eda Aguilar left the meeting red-faced with tears.The next day a dozen activists gathered at Puente to strategize for Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s case. After reviewing the logistics for the usual public maneuvers \u2014 Facebook post, news release, online petition, sidewalk rally, Twitter hashtag, phone campaign \u2014 they debated the pros and cons of using civil disobedience. In the final years of the Obama administration, activists in Arizona had come to rely on \u201cC.D.,\u201d as they called it, to make their dissatisfaction known. Puente members had blocked roads and chained themselves in front of the entrance to Phoenix\u2019s Fourth Avenue Jail. Yet Francisca Porchas, one of Puente\u2019s organizers, worried about setting an unrealistic precedent with its membership. \u201cFor Lupita we go cray-cray and then everyone expects that,\u201d she said. What would they do if Puente members wanted them to risk arrest every time one of them had a check-in?Ernesto Lopez argued that they needed to take advantage of this rare opportunity. A week earlier, thousands of people had swarmed airports around the country to protest the executive order barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of conversation about the ban, but for everything else it\u2019s dead,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cNobody is talking about people getting deported. In a couple of months, it won\u2019t be possible to get that media attention.\u201dGarcia wasn\u2019t sure a rally for Garc\u00eda Aguilar would work. \u201cWe\u2019re literally in survival mode,\u201d Garcia told me that week. It was too early to tell how ICE would behave under Trump, but they were braced for the worst. Nobody had a long-term plan yet. Even as he and his staff moved to organize the news conference, his mind kept running through the possibilities: Would it help Garc\u00eda Aguilar stay with her family? Would it snowball into an airport-style protest? Would it cause ICE to double down on her deportation? He decided it was worth trying.That night a handful of protesters tried to block several vans as they sped from the building\u2019s side exit. More protesters came running from an ICE decoy bus that had initially distracted those attending the vigil out front. Manuel Salda\u00f1a, an Army veteran who did two tours in Afghanistan, planted himself on the ground next to one van\u2019s front tire, wrapping his arms and legs around the wheel. The driver looked incredulous; if he moved the van forward now, he would break one of Salda\u00f1a\u2019s legs. Peering through the van windows with cellphone flashlights, protesters found Garc\u00eda Aguilar sitting in handcuffs. The crowd doubled in size. \u201cThose shifty [expletive],\u201d Ybarra Maldonado said as he stared at the van. ICE, he said, had never notified him that her stay of deportation had been denied.Four hours later, Garc\u00eda Aguilar was gone. After the Phoenix Police arrested seven people and dispersed the crowd, ICE took her to Nogales, Mexico. By then images of Garc\u00eda Aguilar and the protest were already all over television and social media. She and her children became celebrities within the immigrant rights movement. Carlos Garcia, who was with her in Nogales, told me that Mexican officials stalked her hotel, hoping to snag a photo. \u201cEveryone wanted to be the one to help her,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wanted a piece.\u201d Later that month, her children \u2014 Jacqueline, 14, and Angel, 16 \u2014 sat in the audience of Trump\u2019s first address to Congress, guests of two Democratic representatives from Arizona, Ra\u00fal Grijalva and Ruben Gallego.During the Obama years, most immigrant rights organizations focused on big, idealistic legislation: the Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform, neither of which ever made it through Congress. But Puente kept its focus on front-line battles against police-ICE collaboration. For Garcia, who was undocumented until a stepfather adopted him at 16, the most important thing is simply to contest all deportations, without exception. He estimates that Puente has had a hand in stopping about 300 deportations in Arizona since 2012.Ever since Arizona passed Senate Bill 1070, one of the toughest anti-undocumented bills ever signed into law, the state has been known for pioneering the kind of draconian tactics that the Trump administration is now turning into federal policy. But if Arizona has been a testing ground for the nativist agenda, it has also been an incubator for resistance to it. Among the state\u2019s many immigrant rights groups, Puente stands out as the most seasoned and most confrontational. In the weeks and months following Election Day 2016 \u2014 as progressive groups suddenly found themselves on defense, struggling to figure out how to handle America\u2019s new political landscape \u2014 Garcia was inundated with calls for advice. He flew around the country for training sessions with field organizers, strategy meetings with lawyers and policy experts and an off-the-record round table with Senators Dick Durbin and Bernie Sanders in Washington. A soft-spoken man with a stoic demeanor and a long, black ponytail, Garcia was also stunned by Trump\u2019s victory. But organizers in Phoenix had one clear advantage. \u201cAll the scary things that folks are talking about,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen before.\u201d On Nov. 9, he likes to say, the country woke up in Arizona.That year Arizona\u2019s undocumented population reached roughly half a million people. In Maricopa County, Sheriff Joseph Arpaio aimed to make that number plummet. He directed police to conduct \u201ccrime suppression\u201d sweeps in predominantly Latino neighborhoods and to raid businesses. During sweeps, police would often detain Latinos for minor offenses like honking a car horn, then demand proof of legal residence.Maricopa County voters appeared delighted with his tactics; for a time, \u201cSheriff Joe\u201d was the most popular elected official in the state. Support for him may have been abetted by Arizona\u2019s dismal economy. Phoenix had been one of the centers of the building boom; in 2006, business owners in the state said they needed a Mexican guest-worker program to meet the demand for cheap manual labor. But in the spring of 2007, Arizona\u2019s housing market began to crater. In 2008, the state had 117,000 foreclosures, the third-\u200bhighest number in the country.For readers of Mexican-American history, this sudden hardening of attitudes toward the undocumented was unsurprising: America has long maintained a love-hate relationship with Spanish-speaking labor. During the Great Depression, at least one million Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans were forcibly repatriated. The following decade, the United States began importing 4.6 million Mexicans to satisfy labor shortages in agricultural fields. But even as that program continued in the 1950s, President Eisenhower\u2019s administration sent another one million back to Mexico by truck, train and ship in a roundup known as \u201cOperation Wetback.\u201dNear Miami, Ariz., a young Alfredo Gutierrez and his family escaped capture by camping in the mountains. \u201cOne of the reasons they got away with repatriation and they got away with Wetback was because there was no resistance,\u201d Gutierrez, who later became an Arizona state senator, told me. \u201cEveryone of that era will tell you how they hid.\u201d But when Arpaio came for the undocumented, many of them argued for their right to stay. This transformation was due, in great part, to Puente.During its early years, Puente planned protest marches, organized boycotts against local businesses that supported Arpaio and ran know-your-rights classes in Spanish. When Arizona Republicans passed S.B.1070 in 2010, Puente and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network began a national boycott that was estimated to cost Arizona over $200 million in canceled business conferences; 100,000 people marched against the bill in Phoenix. T-shirts with the slogan \u201cLegalize Arizona\u201d popped up in places like Chicago and New York.But after S.B.1070\u2019s \u201cpapers please\u201d law overcame court battles and went into effect in September 2012 \u2014 three months after the Obama administration created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \u2014 collaborations between Puente and ADAC increased. In Arizona, the police were now obligated to question anyone that they had \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to believe was undocumented. As a result, a new wave of undocumented residents, including many Dreamers\u2019 parents, found themselves snared in deportation proceedings.Andiola\u2019s own mother, Maria Guadalupe Arreola, was stopped while driving in Mesa in September 2012; the police passed her information along to ICE. Three months later, ICE agents appeared at the family\u2019s home and took Arreola away in handcuffs. Andiola responded by flipping open her laptop and filming a video that she posted to social media. Within hours of her mother\u2019s arrest, the hashtags #WeAreAndiola and #SomosAndiola were rousing people over Facebook and Twitter. ICE\u2019s office in Phoenix was flooded with calls. Messages also poured into the Department of Homeland Security from Washington; hours before ICE had banged on her door, Andiola was hired by an Arizona congresswoman, Kyrsten Sinema.The next morning, as Arreola sat on a bus headed for Nogales, protesters rallied outside of ICE\u2019s Phoenix office, drawing television crews. The bus driver received a phone call. The bus turned around. A few hours later, Arreola was released with an order of supervision signed by ICE\u2019s field-office director, Katrina Kane. Jose Luis Pe\u00f1alosa, the lawyer who represented Arreola at the time, believes the directive to reverse the deportation must have come directly from Washington.Under Obama, Andiola told me, the primary strategy had been to create a well-publicized \u201cmoral dilemma\u201d between Obama\u2019s pro-immigrant rhetoric and his aggressive immigration enforcement \u2014 exactly what she had done with her mother. Such dilemmas could provoke ICE to use prosecutorial discretion to stop a removal.By 2014, however, such maneuvers rarely worked. After Obama won re-election and Democrats lost the midterms, Washington was less susceptible to public shaming. Phone campaigns and news conferences no longer resulted in release. \u201cWe got to a point where the legal strategy, the political strategy wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Andiola said, \u201cso we had to begin using our bodies in civil disobedience.\u201d In August 2013, ADAC stopped an ICE bus full of deportees in Phoenix, delaying their removal. In 2014 Andiola and Garcia were arrested together during a hunger strike outside ICE\u2019s field office.By then Andiola had left her leadership position at ADAC, whose board at that time disapproved of its members\u2019 involvement in non-Dreamer cases. She also abandoned the job as a congressional staffer, frustrated by the lack of movement on comprehensive immigration reform. When people facing deportation petitioned her for help, as scores did through Facebook, she sent them to Puente, which her own mother joined. \u201cPuente and us were trying to do the same thing with parents,\u201d Andiola said. ADAC could no longer help them, but Puente would.But after what happened with Garc\u00eda Aguilar, Andiola knew that the tactics she used to stave off her mother\u2019s deportation in 2013 would no longer work. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to listen,\u201d Andiola said of Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to care.\u201d The week ICE deported Garc\u00eda Aguilar, more than 600 undocumented immigrants were picked up in raids across the country. This in itself wasn\u2019t unusual: ICE surges had occurred many times during Obama\u2019s presidency, including, notoriously, over New Year\u2019s weekend 2016. Yet because Trump\u2019s presidential campaign had promised millions of deportations, the surge could now be spun as a change in federal policy. Trump himself basked in the news. \u201cThe crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise,\u201d he tweeted that Sunday. \u201cGang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve always had these really broad laws so what the history really is about is what the executive wants to enforce,\u201d Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at U.C.L.A., told me, recalling the Palmer Red Raids of 1919 and 1920 and the Japanese internment camps of the 1940s. \u201cRight now, we see the swing of the pendulum back to the harshest possible interpretation.\u201d The velocity of this swing is possible because most of the victories achieved by the undocumented during Obama\u2019s administration depended upon the use of prosecutorial discretion.Until the 1970s, immigration officials staunchly denied that they ever allowed any illegal immigrant to remain in the country with their approval. Prosecutorial discretion was exposed only after President Richard Nixon tried to throw John Lennon, the former Beatle, out of the country before the 1972 elections. (Nixon feared that Lennon, who opposed the war in Vietnam, might turn younger voters against him.) In the course of defending Lennon \u2014 as the Penn State law professor Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia details in her book, \u201cBeyond Deportation\u201d \u2014 his lawyer, Leon Wildes, unearthed a trove of documents proving the existence of a hidden \u201cdeferred action\u201d program, which allowed immigration officials to use prosecutorial discretion to grant \u201cnonpriority\u201d status to individuals on humanitarian grounds. After Wildes spotlighted the program, he won deferred action for Lennon, allowing one of the world\u2019s most famous musicians to stay in the United States long enough to gain lawful permanent residence.Until Obama came into office, gaining \u201cdeferred action\u201d or \u201cnonpriority\u201d status required the help of a savvy immigration lawyer. \u201cI used to call it the invisible sword,\u201d Wadhia told me, noting that, outside the DACA program, there has never been any official form to fill out or fee to pay in order to win deferred action. Obama did not invent prosecutorial discretion, but he did make it more transparent and accessible, standing in the Rose Garden to announce how his administration had used it to create a deferred-action program for Dreamers. Trump cannot destroy prosecutorial discretion \u2014 it\u2019s what allows a district attorney to ignore shoplifting so she can focus on murders \u2014 but his administration can pressure ICE officials to resist appeals to exercise it favorably.And that\u2019s exactly what many believe has happened. In the past, when Washington-based officials pressured ICE supervisors to reverse decisions, as seems to have happened in Arreola\u2019s case, ICE agents had little recourse. Even immigration judges could find their orders for deportation halted by prosecutorial discretion, as in the case of Garc\u00eda Aguilar. But those roadblocks have been undone. \u201cSome 60,000 agents, they have been chafing at prosecutorial-discretion memos,\u201d Paromita Shah, the associate director of the National Immigration Project, told me in November.In fact, Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s deportation was just the first of many cases in which undocumented residents who were granted nonpriority status found themselves deported when they appeared for routine check-ins. ICE now commonly instructs people to appear for check-ins with passports, which makes their deportation easier. With prosecutorial discretion held out of reach, Garcia told me, \u201conce ICE decides to deport someone, it\u2019s nearly impossible to get them out of their grasp.\u201dAfter Arpaio fully lost his 287(g) status in 2011 amid allegations of abuse, he allowed ICE to install an agent inside central booking at the Fourth Avenue Jail in Phoenix. Because that agent could question anyone charged with any offense right after fingerprinting, Castro told me, most undocumented people who are arrested in Maricopa County have an ICE hold on them by the time they are arraigned. Last year, ICE requested the detention of 3,483 people in Maricopa County jails. The signs lying around the room were for Puente\u2019s May Day march, the theme of which was \u201cICE out of Fourth Avenue.\u201dLast fall many assumed that Trump would instigate huge roundups of the undocumented, \u00e1 la Operation Wetback. Yet so far, the process for deportations in Arizona has mostly followed the pattern set by Arpaio; the undocumented are first caught by the police. (Nationally, however, ICE\u2019s noncriminal arrests have increased 157 percent compared to the first four months of 2016.) \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have to do much to deport anyone he wants to because Obama has already built this machinery for him,\u201d Garcia told me. Under Obama, 287(g) agreements proliferated. In 2006, ICE was allocated $5 million to implement such agreements. A year into Obama\u2019s first term, that number shot up to $68 million, though it was reduced to $24 million in 2014.Obama deported nearly three million undocumented immigrants, more than any president in American history. For Puente, one of the stranger outcomes of Trump\u2019s election is that, for the first time, they stand a chance of dismantling some police-ICE collaborations. Fighting individual deportation cases has become harder, but policy battles have gained traction in Phoenix, where Democrats still hold significant power. \u201cNow it\u2019s convenient for Democrats to shame a deportation,\u201d Garcia told me.Under Obama, he speculated, many Democrats were reluctant to oppose any of the president\u2019s policies. Under Trump, they saw political advantage in talking about deportations, sanctuary cities and immigrant rights \u2014 especially now that the undocumented had found new allies. When Garcia helped assemble the coalition United Against Hate after Trump\u2019s victory in November, 56 groups signed up. That same month, Paul Penzone defeated Joe Arpaio at the polls. For Garcia, who began his activism under President George W. Bush, one great lesson of the past eight years is that Democrats are unreliable allies, willing to place other policy goals, like the Affordable Care Act, above the needs of the undocumented. \u201cNeither party is our friend,\u201d he said. But the two-party system, he knew, could be played to Puente\u2019s advantage as it pushed for Phoenix to do more cite-and-release actions instead of arrests and as it argued for school boards to reduce the number of police officers in schools.I heard anecdotal accounts that more people were, in fact, choosing the option that his wife had declined. Some were moving to new addresses. Others were looking for sanctuary in churches or simply shutting themselves up in their homes, essentially becoming fugitives when their check-ins passed. The full extent of these changes won\u2019t be clear until this summer, said Petra Falcon, the executive director of Promise Arizona (PAZ). During past crises in Arizona, she said, undocumented parents had often waited for classes to end before moving with their children. But a recent report from the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System showed that the percentage of Hispanics participating in Arizona\u2019s state health care system had fallen by more than half between October 2016 and April 2017. Some Hispanics, it appeared, might be trying to retreat into the shadows again.Legomsky said that the sweep of Trump\u2019s priorities has also given ICE cover for the use of targeted deportations against activists. The agency doesn\u2019t need to explain why the deportation of a DACA activist or an undocumented organizer is consistent with their announced priorities, he said, \u201cif the announced priorities cover almost everybody.\u201d In February, the Department of Homeland Security seemed to give its blessing for such retaliations when it issued a memo that gave ICE officers the authority to prioritize the deportation of anyone they believed posed \u201ca risk to public safety.\u201d Andiola, who is now the political director of Our Revolution, the 501(c)(4) that sprang from Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential bid, didn\u2019t know if her mother had been targeted or if the letter ordering her to report for removal was simply a consequence of Trump\u2019s redefined priorities.After Arreola received the letter, Andiola worked her extensive professional network, calling organizers, lawyers and activists to gather opinions about what she should do. \u201cIt\u2019s great that there are so many perspectives,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s difficult to sort through all the differing kinds of advice.\u201d Eventually, she realized there was no single solution. With a diversity of tactics in her pocket, she would deploy one after another in hopes of reaching success. What she needed first, she decided, was a legal strategy.Even though Arreola fled to the United States to escape domestic abuse, it never occurred to either woman that Arreola might be eligible for asylum. In Andiola\u2019s mind, asylum seekers came from Central America or the Middle East, places with extreme political turmoil. After Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s deportation, though, Andiola began to take the option seriously. She knew it was a long shot: It has never been easy for Mexicans to gain asylum in the United States. And though several lawyers told me that asylum applications are now rising, the process is likely to become even more difficult soon. The Jan. 25 order on border security includes an entire section declaring Trump\u2019s intention \u201cto end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the same political agenda that is behind banning Muslims and refugees from coming to the U.S.,\u201d says Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center.A successful asylum application, Andiola learned, depended upon documentary evidence. Arreola recalled that a newspaper in Durango once published her ex-partner\u2019s photograph, noting that he had been charged for the kidnapping and rape of a minor: her. In Durango, Arreola\u2019s brother-in-law found a copy of a 1991 police report detailing one of her ex-partner\u2019s rages. These two documents formed the backbone of the asylum application Arreola used to request an interview with U.S.C.I.S. in April. Within a week, she had an appointment for a \u201creasonable fear\u201d interview to determine if her case merited serious consideration. Three days after the interview, Arreola received good news: ICE had canceled her scheduled removal on May 3. She had passed the interview, the first of many steps in gaining asylum. Her lawyer, Ray Ybarra Maldonado, who also represents Garc\u00eda Aguilar, says there is still a fair chance that Arreola\u2019s application for asylum may be denied, but she was now safe to report for her check-in on May 23.On May 3, the day Arreola was to have been deported, Arreola and Andiola gathered with friends, family and supporters for a prayer breakfast at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Phoenix, which had offered to house Arreola if she chose sanctuary. Pastor James Pennington had been active in the fight for gay rights. The patio of First Congregational was decorated with several flags, including a rainbow flag, an Arizona state flag and an American flag. Inside the church, members of Puente and former members of ADAC formed a circle with several non-Hispanics who had only recently allied themselves with the undocumented. Standing together they recited Psalm 30 in Spanish:Te ensalzar\u00e9, oh Se\u00f1or, porque me has elevado, y no has permitido que mis enemigos se r\u00edan de mi.Yet their enemies remained hard at work. A week later, Marco Tulio Coss Ponce, who had been living in Arizona under an order of supervision since 2013, appeared at ICE\u2019s field office in Phoenix with his lawyer, Ravindar Arora, for a check-in. ICE officers, Arora said, knew that Coss Ponce was about to file an application for asylum \u2014 several of his relatives had been recently killed or threatened by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico \u2014 and they had assured Arora several times that Coss Ponce would not be removed. They said he simply needed to wear an ankle monitor to make sure he didn\u2019t disappear. The fitting was delayed several times until finally Arora had to leave to argue a case in court. After he departed, ICE officers handcuffed Coss Ponce and put him in a van, alone. Three hours later, he was in Nogales.An article on May 28 about the deportation of undocumented immigrants misstated the year that Marco Tulio Coss Ponce, a deportee, began living under an order of supervision. It was 2013, not 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tillerson: It\u2019s Time to Restore \u2018Balance\u2019 With Other Countries", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In his first address laying out his vision as secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson said Wednesday that the United States had been far too accommodating to emerging nations and longtime allies and that \u201cthings have gotten out of balance.\u201dRighting those imbalances, he said, will be the mission of the State Department as it fulfills President Trump\u2019s promise to put \u201cAmerica first.\u201d\u201cWe were promoting relations. We were promoting economic activity. We were promoting trade with a lot of these emerging economies, and we just kind of lost track of how we were doing,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cAnd as a result, things got a little bit out of balance.\u201dPacing around a stage in the department\u2019s auditorium, Mr. Tillerson then discussed a series of specific challenges facing the United States.On reining in the nuclear program in North Korea, he described the effort to apply international pressure to further isolate Pyongyang as \u201ca pressure campaign that has a knob on it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re at about dial setting 5 or 6 right now, with a strong call of countries all over the world to fully implement the U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding sanctions, because no one has ever fully implemented those,\u201d he said.He said the next higher settings could involve penalizing countries that continue to defy United Nations sanctions on trade with North Korea. But he said a big part of the campaign is \u201cleaning hard into\u201d China, and testing how much influence China has on Pyongyang.As for speaking directly with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as President Trump recently suggested he would be willing to do, Mr. Tillerson said North Korea needed to demonstrate its readiness for such a dialogue.Mr. Tillerson said the United States and China would soon begin a high-level dialogue. Mr. Tillerson said he and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would lead negotiations in June with high-level Chinese officials on diplomatic and security issues, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross would oversee talks on economic and trade issues after that.\u201cWe want to take a fresh look at where\u2019s this relationship going to be 50 years from now,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.On Russia, Mr. Tillerson was far less optimistic, describing a relationship that has reached a low ebb. Speaking less than 24 hours after Mr. Trump spoke on the phone with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia about working together to broker a cease-fire in Syria, Mr. Tillerson set his sights low, saying that resolving even small irritants would be progress.\u201cToday, there\u2019s almost no trust between us,\u201d he said.Mr. Tillerson said many global organizations had not truly adjusted to the end of the Cold War \u2014 and he seemed to include the State Department on the list of institutions stuck in the past.He urged employees to help him streamline the department so it could deal better with the world today, rather than as it was during the Cold War.But Mr. Tillerson offered few specifics for a staff deeply anxious about a proposed budget that would cut outlays 31 percent and that aides to Mr. Tillerson have said could eliminate about 2,300 jobs, or about 3 percent of the department\u2019s 75,000 employees. The reductions are expected to be achieved through attrition.Mr. Tillerson said he had yet to settle on even a basic organizational structure. An employee survey and hundreds of employee interviews over the coming weeks will be needed before he can begin filling the department\u2019s top leadership positions, he said.Mr. Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has suffered embarrassing stumbles and surprising reversals in his brief tenure at the State Department. But on Wednesday, he touched on a range of issues as he walked confidently around the stage, and he received thunderous applause when he was done.The remarks were the bookend to his first speech to the department, which he delivered the first time he entered its Foggy Bottom headquarters after being confirmed. In that address, Mr. Tillerson promised to explore ways to make the department more efficient.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grammy Awards Returning to New York After 15 Years Away", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio and executives from Madison Square Garden, CBS and the Recording Academy announced on Tuesday that the Grammy Awards ceremony would be held in New York on Jan. 28, returning the event to the city for the first time in 15 years.\u201cThere is no better place for music\u2019s biggest night than the world\u2019s greatest city,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. \u201cBringing these awards back to the city will allow us to further support and foster the music industry in New York.\u201dThe news \u2014 which most in the music industry had expected \u2014 came after months of negotiations among the city, the Garden, its labor unions and the academy, which presents the awards.\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important that we have one agency that soup-to-nuts is dealing with all of these various media and entertainment industries,\u201d Ms. Menin, previously the commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Consumer Affairs, said in a recent interview.In just over a year on the job, Ms. Menin, 48, has ordered a study on the music industry\u2019s economic impact on New York, arranged for the city to underwrite $30,000 in free rehearsal space for musicians, and announced a conference at New York University in June that will examine two of the biggest forces on music in the city: technology and real estate.But her biggest task by far has been helping to bring the Grammys back to New York, a process that has introduced her to the delicate politics of the music industry.In her first week on the job, in February 2016, Ms. Menin met in Los Angeles with executives at the Recording Academy, she said. The Grammys have been held at Staples Center there for 17 of the last 18 years \u2014 a visit to Madison Square Garden in 2003 was the only interruption \u2014 and the awards are closely intertwined with the location, through a walk of fame and the Grammy Museum nearby.The higher costs to stage the event in New York have been a longstanding obstacle, as has a lack of political will. Expenses for facilities, labor and housing the Recording Academy\u2019s staff contribute to a total price that is $6 million to $8 million higher than in Los Angeles, according to Ms. Menin and others involved in the talks. To accommodate staging and rehearsals, the Grammys can require a venue for as many as 11 days.\u201cThere was a tough relationship in the past,\u201d Ms. Menin said in her office above Broadway as sirens blared outside. \u201cI wanted them to know there was an extremely hospitable agency that was looking to work with them as a partner.\u201dTo that end, she arranged for millions in sponsorship dollars, nudged labor unions and, in early November, assembled a host committee, including representatives of Spotify, Adidas, the Partnership for New York City and other business groups, to help raise nearly $3 million in a final 72-hour push. (Spotify is no longer on the committee.)Labor concessions amounted to only about $250,000, mostly through scheduling adjustments, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks who were not authorized to speak about them publicly. Still, labor leaders and others in the music industry are quick to credit Ms. Menin with pushing the deals through.\u201cThe Grammys do not come here without Julie Menin,\u201d said James J. Claffey Jr., the president of Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. \u201cA lot of us even doubted she could do it. She proved us wrong.\u201dIn an interview, Neil Portnow, the chief executive of the Recording Academy, praised Ms. Menin for her work and enthusiasm, calling her \u201ca pistol.\u201d But he said the initial discussions with the Garden preceded the city\u2019s involvement.\u201cWe have to be careful about any entity or individual claiming credit,\u201d Mr. Portnow said. \u201cCredit for the Grammys coming to New York is with the academy.\u201dAmong its findings were that the broader music business \u2014 including not only musicians and record companies but also studios and technology companies \u2014 was responsible for 31,400 jobs and $2.8 billion in wages, with billions more attributed to ancillary spending and tourism.\u201cThe music industry has never gotten the recognition at the city and state level for the impact that it has in New York\u2019s broader economy,\u201d said Justin Kalifowitz, the chief executive of Downtown Music Publishing and a founder of the advocacy group New York Is Music. \u201cThis study finally quantifies that impact.\u201dAccording to the economic impact study, overall employment in music has been growing since 2000. But while it may be increasing for concert promoters and technology companies, the number of performing groups and record label employees has been dropping.\u201cWhile the report shows that the industry is doing fine,\u201d Ms. Menin said, \u201cwhat it does show is that for musicians, it\u2019s still tough for them in New York because of the cost of living.\u201dMs. Menin said that before the study was completed, she heard many anecdotal complaints that the music industry was abandoning New York for Los Angeles and elsewhere. The study, she said, refutes that.\u201cNew York,\u201d she said, \u201cis the music capital of the U.S., and the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is Student Debt So High?", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:Hand-wringing over the cost of a college education, which is two and a half times what it was in 1978-79, adjusted for inflation, while median income has risen only 20 percent, is certainly warranted. And your suggestions for easing the burden of student loans \u2014 better repayment plans, enabling wage growth for debtors \u2014 make good sense. But we\u2019ve heard this song many times before to no avail.Focus on the consequences of crushing debt doesn\u2019t address the root problem: Why are college costs out of control? Let\u2019s take a look at a range of institutions of higher learning, public and private, to see exactly why they have become out of reach for so many Americans.Is the education two and a half times better? Are there ways to cut costs without sacrificing the core mission? What is the role of large endowment funds?Too often, preoccupation with the effect of a problem ignores its cause.LILA S. ROSENBLUM, NEW YORKTo the Editor:As a result, women hold almost two-thirds of student debt in the United States and have a harder time making ends meet while repaying their student loans.Women and men both use higher education to start careers that lead to economic security, but women are particularly reliant on education as a leg up. Student debt is threatening to turn that education from an opportunity into a trap.KEVIN MILLER, WASHINGTONThe writer is a senior researcher at the American Association of University Women.To the Editor:In the countless discussions about student debt, why isn\u2019t anyone talking about the schools to which all of this money is being paid?The lavish capital improvement projects at both my alma mater and my daughter\u2019s university ($66,000 a year) make me wonder if tuition really has to be as high as it is.It seems to me that the schools should be taking steps to tighten their belts and figuring out ways to reduce student debt instead of just spend, spend, spend.To the Editor:The solution to the millstone of student debt is to accord vocational education the respect it deserves. For example, welders earn salaries in the high five and low six figures without having to repay four-year loans for their education.The reality is that college is not for everyone. But as long as we persist in the fiction that the absence of a bachelor\u2019s degree means substandard salaries for life, too many students will be victimized.WALT GARDNER, LOS ANGELESAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Vulnerable Voices\u2019 Lash Out as Companies Sway Climate Talks", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byDeveloping nations and environmental groups are challenging some of the world\u2019s biggest companies and wealthiest countries over the role corporate lobbyists play in United Nations climate change negotiations.The dispute opens an additional battle in the struggle over how to fashion a global response to climate change, one that corporate interests appear to be winning, for now.Though companies are not permitted to participate directly in the climate talks, representatives from almost 300 industry groups are free to roam the negotiations in Bonn, Germany, as \u201cstakeholders,\u201d and to lobby negotiators on behalf of corporations that may seek to slow action, the developing nations and their allies say.Chebet Maikut, the delegate for Uganda, an East African country recently hit by drought, said undue corporate influence could derail the talks by weakening or delaying emissions goals.\u201cThese corporations are so powerful,\u201d Mr. Maikut said. Uganda\u2019s economy is less than a tenth of the market capitalization of the fossil fuel giant Exxon Mobil, for example. \u201cWe need a stronger rule book,\u201d he said.At a heated session at the latest round of talks on Tuesday, delegates from the United States, Russia and Australia made a last-minute defense of the corporate presence, suggesting that a wider discussion of the issue be delayed.An American delegate argued that it would be \u201cpremature\u201d to continue the discussion over corporate participation at the meeting, said someone at the session, which was abruptly closed to outside observers.The talks risked becoming \u201can endless ideas factory,\u201d the American delegate said.After four hours of debate, delegates agreed to call for suggestions from member nations on how to address the issue, and to take them up next year.Outside the negotiations, a handful of protesters held signs that read, \u201cStop Corporate Capture\u201d and \u201cPolluters Out, People In.\u201dSome environmental groups have argued that the Paris accord does not go far enough, having been watered down by corporate interests that opposed stronger emissions restrictions.That is a move even corporations have warned against.But there may be more to American companies\u2019 support of the Paris process than meets the eye.\u201cIt makes complete sense to be at the policy making table than to be on the outside,\u201d Ms. Lawrence-Samuel said. \u201cFor years, these talks have been overrun by the very industries at the very heart of the problem.\u201dThe tussle over corporate influence is occurring at a delicate time.Industry groups are already seeking a reconsideration of the United States\u2019 commitments.A better alternative was \u201ca revised pledge more in line with reality\u201d that would be \u201cmuch less ambitious,\u201d Mr. Eule said.At least one participant appeared stunned.In a statement, the chamber contended that a market-based approach and new technologies would continue to lead to carbon emission reductions.Dow and Cargill said they supported overall measures to reduce emissions.It could also ban \u201crevolving door\u201d appointments of industry officials to policy making posts and impose other rules to prevent conflicts of interest.Any changes would require the support of a majority of the almost 200 nations and regions that are party to the climate talks.\u201cThe reason we were able to get the Paris agreement in the first place was that the U.N. was willing to open their doors to a whole range of stakeholders, including businesses,\u201d she said.Many of the biggest polluters at the talks, including the United States, Canada, the European Union and Japan, have been receptive to those concerns.Trigg Talley, the United States deputy special envoy for climate change and the senior American negotiator in Bonn, called the proponents of the effort to rein in corporate influence \u201cwell intentioned but deeply misguided.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a good path to go down,\u201d he said.Another important backer of the effort has been China, which is increasingly replacing the United States as a defender of an ambitious climate change policy. Critics note that China\u2019s biggest enterprises are state-owned, and already have a voice at the negotiating table.Still, powerful companies are \u201cdrowning out the voices of developing nations,\u201d a Chinese delegate argued at a committee on Saturday. \u201cVulnerable voices must be heard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Today: The Times Visits Toronto, and a Possible Gain From Trump", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byThis week, The New York Times held a special event that allowed our Canadian subscribers to meet some of our journalists and peek behind the curtain at how a great series is made. Times Insider Events brought my colleagues Jodi Kantor and Catrin Einhorn to Toronto to discuss how they put together their deeply reported and insightful group of stories, \u201cRefugees Welcome,\u201d on Canada\u2019s unique citizen sponsorship program.The next day Ms. Kantor, Ms. Einhorn, and their editor, Rebecca Corbett, reunited with some of the refugees and sponsors featured the series. Ms. Kantor and Ms. Einhorn offered this description of the experience:We came to Toronto one last time \u2014 not to report on the Canadian sponsors and Syrian refugees whose stories we told but to present our work in person.Many of you have asked us whether we will continue to chronicle these sponsors and families. Perhaps we\u2019ll return to them in the future. But on this trip, we were able to spend some quiet time catching up with them.More than a year in, the milestones continue.In fact, Mrs. Mohammad may have been the star of our event on Tuesday evening in Toronto. She only landed in Canada 15 months ago. But when we asked her a question from the stage, she brushed off an interpreter and addressed the crowd of hundreds in her newly learned English.Mr. Hussen took to the stage to answer questions from both my colleagues and the audience. His department is in the middle of setting next year\u2019s immigration targets. While Mr. Hussen didn\u2019t disclose specific figures, he did confirm that the total wouldn\u2019t be lower than the 300,000 for this year, itself a record.That went over well with many people in the crowd, which included a large number of refugees, refugee sponsors and advocates. Judging by their questions, however, there was less satisfaction with the government\u2019s decision to temporarily limit the number of Syrian refugees who can come in through private sponsorships.The minister said the measure would allow the government to clear up a backlog of applications, for which he blamed the previous Conservative government. \u201cThere have been many thousands of people who are waiting in line who are vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Hussen said. Once that\u2019s accomplished, Mr. Hussen said, future applications for private sponsorships will make their way through the bureaucracy in less than a year.The worst fears of Canada and other nations weren\u2019t realized at the meeting of the Arctic Council in Alaska this week. Rex W. Tillerson, the United States Secretary of State, did not announce that the Trump administration was about to pull out of Paris accord on climate change. But Mr. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, offered little insight into American plans for mitigating global warming, something President Trump once called a hoax fabricated by China.President Trump\u2019s administration has floated a number of trial balloons that have raised fears of a trade war that would likely not do Canada\u2019s economy much good. But the president\u2019s immigration policies may be a potent weapon for Canadian efforts to make the country a world leader in artificial intelligence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Trump and G.O.P., the Welfare State Shouldn\u2019t Be the Enemy", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byEven Republicans hotly critical of Donald Trump\u2019s brand of populist nationalism were a little giddy with excitement when he won the presidency with healthy Republican majorities in both houses of Congress.Fond partisan fantasies of unified conservative government have given way to night sweats. Congressional Republican resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s new budget, which combines big increases in military spending with deep cuts to Medicaid and nutritional support for the poor, is one piece of evidence that the party\u2019s legislative agenda is a mess.The small-government fanatics of the Freedom Caucus and its former member Mick Mulvaney, now director of the Office of Management and Budget, may think huge tax cuts financed by reducing health benefits for millions of voters \u2014 23 million if the American Health Care Act is enacted, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office analysis \u2014 is a great idea. But it\u2019s wildly unpopular with the public, including Republican voters, many of whom rely on Medicaid. Moderate Republican legislators thus find themselves forced to pick their poison. Is it better to suffer electoral blowback for cutting popular programs or for fecklessly impotent unified Republican government?Republicans need a fresh formula that can both win elections and govern. Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination was a triumph of bread-and-circuses populism over reheated Reaganism. Yet the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party remains zealously committed to the idea that tax and spending cuts are the magic key to economic growth.Mr. Trump\u2019s toxic nationalism certainly isn\u2019t the answer to his party\u2019s need for a new governing philosophy. There is a strand of thinking implicit in some Trumpian pronouncements that combines support for the welfare state with antiregulatory free-market zeal. Republicans would do well to draw it out.For decades, Republicans have traded on confusion in the meaning of \u201cbig government\u201d and \u201cfree markets.\u201d The regulatory state and the size of government are intertwined, but they contain logically and practically separable strands.But this is a false choice. Regulatory policy and fiscal policy are independent dimensions, and they can be rebundled in different packages. Mr. Trump\u2019s gestures toward a big-government, low-regulation package \u2014 rooted more in instinct than intellect \u2014 proved popular with Republican voters. The free-market welfare state may seem like an oxymoron \u2014 especially from the perspective of today\u2019s conservative ideologues \u2014 but it\u2019s in fact the best idea for a fractious, cornered Republican Party.Let\u2019s start with the regulatory state. Federal, state and municipal regulations add up to a serious drag on innovation, business formation, job creation and economic mobility. Republicans routinely rail against regulation but have undermined the credibility of their free-market ideals by using them as cover to help allies in the financial and energy sector. They rarely do anything significant to reduce the regulatory frictions that hold back growth.Instead, stuck in the grip of stale \u201csupply side\u201d dogma, Republicans consistently choose to spend down their political capital by cutting taxes and struggling in vain to reduce spending. Tax and spending cuts are supposed to increase growth by rewarding work and returning resources to the private sector. And this can work, especially when tax rates are counterproductively punitive.But economists have struggled to find empirical evidence of the negative effects of bigger government on growth. And indexes of economic freedom produced by free-market think tanks like the Fraser Institute and the Heritage Foundation show that big government and high levels of economic freedom often go hand in hand \u2014 despite the fact that such measures are specifically constructed to illustrate the evils of big governments.Republicans need to recognize finally that secure property rights, openness to global trade and a relatively low regulatory burden are much more important than fiscal policy for innovation, job creation and rising standards of living.To be sure, a deregulatory agenda in the hands of Mr. Trump and Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, is likely to be deployed as a mechanism for delivering favors for cronies. But a principled and effective regulation-reducing agenda will strengthen, not weaken, the rule of law.Republicans make a critical mistake, both factual and strategic, when they cast the welfare state as the enemy of prosperity and freedom. Far and away the biggest items in the budgets of advanced countries are \u201cwelfare state\u201d social programs, like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which account for nearly half the federal budget. This creates three huge problems for Republicans.Mr. Trump is president in part because he has \u2014 or had \u2014 better political sense than more ideological Republicans who are implicitly or explicitly committed to cuts to popular programs as the foundation of their economic agenda.Second, dynamic, competitive markets drive growth and opportunity through \u201cdisruptive innovation,\u201d which necessarily destabilizes industries and displaces workers. The lack of a robust safety net capable of keeping people from becoming collateral damage of routine creative destruction, such as the automation and offshoring of jobs or the closing of local plants, generates anxiety and hostility to the sort of economic policy that produces growth and employment. So not only are sound safety nets popular, but they also increase the public\u2019s tolerance for the dislocations of a dynamic free-market economy.Third, the idea that reducing taxpayer-financed government spending is the key to giving people more freedom and revving up the economy encourages conservative hostility to government as such. Republicans for whom it\u2019s definitional that greater liberty and prosperity come from less government tend to distrust it as a matter of principle. Democrats in turn come to distrust that Republicans who believe this can govern in good faith.This leads to an overall decline in trust for institutions and contributes to the polarization and dysfunction that lead voters to clamor for populist outsiders who will shake up the system. But populist politicians like Mr. Trump, who cater to discontent, never make the system work better, because they don\u2019t know or care how it works.The Republican legislative agenda is stalled because party members have boxed themselves in with their own bad ideas about what freedom and rising prosperity require. A new pro-growth economic platform that sets aside small-government monomania and focuses instead on protecting citizens\u2019 basic rights to commit \u201ccapitalist acts between consenting adults,\u201d as the libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick put it, has both practical and political advantages. It helps a lot to correctly diagnose what\u2019s hurting the economy. Removing the regulatory barriers that make it hard for people to get work, start businesses and find affordable housing would actually do what tax cuts are supposed to do \u2014 liberate stymied productivity and brighten the prospects of ordinary Americans.Fortunately, defending a more freewheeling economy implies no hostility to the welfare state. On the contrary, a generous and effective safety net can be embraced as a tool to promote and sustain a culture of freedom, innovation and risk taking. Politically, repairing and improving the slipshod infrastructure of the safety net would liberate Republicans from the bad faith of attacking the welfare state in one breath, halfheartedly promising not to cut entitlements in the next and then breaking that promise once in power.More important, grasping that government spending is compatible with high levels of freedom and economic vitality would give Republicans space actually to govern. The belief that it is necessary always and forever to reduce spending leads to the embarrassing spectacle of obstruction and paralysis unfolding on Capitol Hill.A Republican Party that aimed instead to free markets and improve the effectiveness and composition of spending could govern, govern well and win elections doing it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Gift and in Conversation, Vatican Presses Trump on Climate Change", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byThat could put Mr. Trump on the back foot after what had been an energetic swing through the Middle East.Mr. Trump told his Vatican hosts that he would not make a final decision until after he returned to the United States, despite some expectations that he could announce a decision at the Group of 7 summit meeting in Italy this weekend.\u201cThey were encouraging continued participation,\u201d Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters about the message from the Vatican. \u201cWe had a good exchange on the difficulty of balancing addressing climate change, and ensuring that you still have a thriving economy and you can still offer people jobs so they can feed their families.\u201dIn their first encounter, the pope and the president, two men with starkly different worldviews, sought to bridge the chasm between them with a handshake, a private audience and a mutual pledge to work for peace.They stuck mainly to protocol, avoiding a public reprise of the barbs they aimed at each other during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign or the pope\u2019s thinly veiled critiques of the new president as a symbol of a dangerously reinvigorated nationalism.But there was also a sense in the Vatican that Mr. Trump was easier to talk to than his tough language on the campaign trail or his sharp words toward Francis had led them to believe. That could be particularly true on the issue of American participation in the Paris accord, where there are sharply conflicting views inside the West Wing.Francis left no doubt about his message in the gifts he gave to his guest, notably the essay on the importance of the environment, which stands as a rebuke to the climate change skepticism espoused by Mr. Trump. Francis also presented him with a medallion engraved with the image of an olive tree \u2014 \u201ca symbol of peace,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe can use peace,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Francis replied, \u201cIt is with all hope that you may become an olive tree to make peace.\u201d As he bade the pope farewell, Mr. Trump told him, \u201cI won\u2019t forget what you said.\u201dFor Mr. Trump, who came here after stops in Saudi Arabia and Israel, the visit to the Vatican capped a tour of the ancestral homes of three of the world\u2019s great monotheistic religions. For Francis, who made his own landmark visit to Egypt last month, it was a chance to welcome a second American leader, after President Barack Obama paid his respects in 2014. Unlike that meeting, few expected a meeting of the minds. Pope Francis and Mr. Trump have diametrically opposed views on issues like immigration, climate change and arms sales. Although both appeared determined not to let politics spoil their encounter, their fraught personal history and divergent personal styles made for a loaded backdrop.In Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump came with a $110 billion arms deal and was embraced by a royal family eager to improve relations with Washington. In Israel, he expressed America\u2019s solidarity with a close ally and staked his claim as a peacemaker. At the Vatican and elsewhere in Europe, however, Mr. Trump has had to overcome suspicions.At 8:20 a.m., under an azure sky, the president\u2019s motorcade rolled into the courtyard of the Apostolic Palace. Swiss Guards stood at attention as Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, stepped out of a sport utility vehicle \u2014 he in a dark suit, she in a black dress with a veil on her hair. A few minutes earlier, the pope arrived in a lone blue Ford Focus.Archbishop Georg G\u00e4nswein, the prefect of the papal household, greeted Mr. Trump and escorted him to an antechamber outside the pope\u2019s office, where, after a few seconds, Francis came to greet him. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor.\u201dA bell signaling the end of the audience rang at 9 a.m., and Mrs. Trump joined her husband and the pope. Francis looked graver than Mr. Trump, but he lightened up when he shook Mrs. Trump\u2019s hand, asking her in Italian, \u201cDid you give him potica to eat?\u201d (Potica is a Slovenian dessert.)Missing was Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who left the trip before coming to Rome. Mr. Bannon, a Catholic, has criticized Pope Francis as a socialist, a global elitist and a promoter of Muslim migration to Europe. He also favors pulling out of the Paris accord. \u201cThat is why this visit is so important,\u201d said Jim Nicholson, a former United States ambassador to the Vatican. \u201cThere still is an educational element to it. It is an opportunity for President Trump to learn a lot more about this man, his life and his formation.\u201dIn addition to the environment essay, \u201cLaudato Si\u2019: On Care for Our Common Home,\u201d the pope gave the president two of his other writings \u2014 on the family and the joy of the Gospel \u2014 as well as his most recent World Day of Peace message (\u201cI signed it personally for you,\u201d Francis said). \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be reading them,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who gave Francis a set of books by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.The pope and the president were both elected as outsiders promising to carry the voices of the forgotten to the centers of power. But that is more or less where the similarities end. Mr. Trump is the scion of a real estate developer and a thrice-married lover of the gilded. Francis has made a calling card out of modesty. When, in 2013, he paid his own hotel bill after being elected pope, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing the Pope standing at the checkout counter (front desk) of a hotel in order to pay his bill. It\u2019s not Pope-like!\u201dBut Francis is also a shrewd political operator, and he had said that he was not seeking a confrontation. \u201cIn our talk, things will come out,\u201d he told reporters recently. \u201cI will say what I think, he will say what he thinks, but I never, ever, wanted to make a judgment without hearing the person.\u201dCoral Davenport contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Questionable Bonds", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byIt seems quite a lot to expect a country barely able to feed its people to pay billions of dollars to foreign lenders.But when that country is Venezuela, investors are willing to bet that the government will pay bondholders instead of importing food and medicine.One of those investors is Goldman Sachs, which bought $2.8 billion worth of bonds issued by the national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, causing a political uproar.Goldman Sachs says that other investors also own the bonds and that the securities were bought on the secondary market, without interacting with the Venezuelan government.Its purchase is the latest sign that investors are seeking out higher yields (which come with higher risks) in a world of low interest rates.A lawsuit pitting the ride-hailing service against Google hinges on what Mr. Levandowski did when he quit Google to start his own company, Otto, which was acquired by Uber last year.Both companies have a lot riding on the case: Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is seeking to protect its autonomous car technology, on which it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars over nearly a decade. Uber, for its part, sees its future as dependent on self-driving cars.Mr. Levandowski asserted his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination when he was ordered by a federal judge to hand over evidence and testimony.Uber had pressured him to cooperate, but after he missed an internal deadline to hand over information, the company fired him.It had little choice, legal analysts said: Uber risked being tarnished if it continued to stand by him.But Mr. Levandowski could now become a witness against Uber if he were to claim, for example, that executives looked the other way while he used proprietary information from a rival to advance Uber\u2019s self-driving efforts.If Lael Brainard is ready to raise rates, there is probably little opposition within the Federal Reserve.Her comments indicated that the Fed was willing to shrug off a little bad data, including data indicating that inflation is still below the level desired by the Fed.The sluggishness of inflation has been a mystery and a \u201csource of concern,\u201d she said, but added that the economy was strong enough to warrant a rate increase.The caveat: Ms. Brainard would reconsider the wisdom of additional rate increases if there were no evidence of stronger inflation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manuel Noriega, Dictator Ousted by U.S. in Panama, Dies at 83", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byManuel Antonio Noriega, the brash former dictator of Panama and sometime ally of the United States whose ties to drug trafficking led to his ouster in 1989 in what was then the largest American military action since the Vietnam War, died Monday night in Panama City. He was 83.President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama announced Mr. Noriega\u2019s death on Twitter early Tuesday morning.Muerte de Manuel A. Noriega cierra un cap\u00edtulo de nuestra historia; sus hijas y sus familiares merecen un sepelio en paz.Mr. Varela\u2019s post read, \u201cThe death of Manuel A. Noriega closes a chapter in our history; his daughters and his relatives deserve to bury him in peace.\u201dMr. Noriega died around 11 p.m. at Santo Tom\u00e1s Hospital, an employee there confirmed. No official cause was immediately given.Mr. Noriega had been in intensive care since March 7 after complications developed from surgery to remove what his lawyer described as a benign brain tumor. His daughters told reporters in March that he had had a brain hemorrhage after the procedure. He had been granted house arrest in January to prepare for the operation.His medical problems came on the heels of a legal odyssey that had begun with the invasion and led to prison terms in the United States, France and finally Panama. While imprisoned abroad he suffered strokes, hypertension and other ailments, his lawyers said.After returning to Panama on Dec. 11, 2011, he began serving long sentences for murder, embezzlement and corruption in connection with his rule during the 1980s.It was an inglorious homecoming for a man who had been known for brandishing a machete while making defiant nationalist speeches and living a lavish, libertine life off drug-trade riches, complete with luxurious mansions, cocaine-fueled parties and voluminous collections of antique guns. It was a quirky life as well: He liked to display his teddy bears dressed as paratroopers.Mr. Noriega, who became the de facto leader of the country by promoting himself to full general of the armed forces in 1983, had a decades-long, head-spinning relationship with the United States, shifting from cooperative ally and informant for American drug and intelligence agencies to shady adversary, selling secrets to political enemies of the United States in the Western Hemisphere and tipping off drug cartels. Whose side he was on was often hard to tell.In the 1990 book \u201cIn the Time of the Tyrants,\u201d a chronicle of the Noriega years, the journalists Richard M. Koster and Guillermo S\u00e1nchez Borb\u00f3n gave a startling example of Mr. Noriega\u2019s double-dealing. While providing secrets about Cuba to the United States, they wrote, Mr. Noriega sold Fidel Castro thousands of Panamanian passports, at $5,000 each, for use by Cuban secret agents and possibly agents of other Soviet bloc nations.The authors estimated that his illicit gains came to at least $772 million. (The White House put his personal fortune at $200 million to $300 million in the months before his ouster.)\u201cHe craved power and became a tyrant,\u201d Mr. Koster and Mr. S\u00e1nchez wrote in laying out Mr. Noriega\u2019s ultimate undoing. \u201cHe craved wealth and became a criminal. And the careers came in conflict.\u201dMr. Noriega\u2019s two-facedness was known to American officials. But they saw him as useful in helping them maintain influence in Panama at a time of leftist uprisings in Central America. He provided, for one thing, an important listening post in the region.Mr. Noriega turned more violent toward political opponents, setting his feared anti-riot units \u2014 his \u201cDobermans\u201d \u2014 on demonstrators.The United States Senate in 1986 overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling on Panama to remove Mr. Noriega from the Panamanian Defense Forces pending an investigation of charges of corruption, election fraud, murder and drug trafficking. The next year, after Congress cut off military and economic aid, Panama defaulted on its foreign debt payments, and its economy contracted by a startling 20 percent.In 1988, Mr. Noriega was indicted in Miami and Tampa, Fla., on federal narcotics-trafficking and money-laundering charges. He was accused of turning Panama into a shipping platform for South American cocaine destined for the United States, and allowing drug proceeds to be hidden in Panamanian banks.Mr. Noriega responded by organizing demonstrations in Panama against the United States. Gripping a machete as he spoke to a crowd, he declared, \u201cNot one step back!\u201d The slogan began appearing on billboards throughout Panama City.Then, on Dec. 16, 1989, Panamanian troops shot and killed an unarmed American soldier in Panama City, wounded another and arrested and beat a third soldier whose wife they threatened with sexual assault.\u201cThat was enough,\u201d President George Bush said in announcing the invasion, which included more than 27,000 troops.A White House statement as the invasion got underway said the United States had acted \u201cto protect American lives, restore the democratic process, preserve the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties and apprehend Manuel Noriega.\u201d Political commentators assigned other motives, including a way for Mr. Bush to shake off perceptions of weakness; his poll numbers rose significantly after the invasion.Panamanian forces were overwhelmed as Mr. Noriega escaped into hiding, surfacing days later, on Dec. 24, at the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. Twenty-three American service members were killed and more than 300 wounded in the invasion; casualties among Panamanians have been disputed, with the Panamanian government at the time estimating that several hundred soldiers and civilians had died, while some human rights groups insist the toll was much higher.American troops descended on the embassy, and a standoff followed. For a time, American forces blasted heavy metal music (including Van Halen\u2019s \u201cPanama\u201d) to torment Mr. Noriega and prevent reporters with directional microphones from hearing conversations between military and Vatican officials. He surrendered on Jan. 3, 1990, and was flown to jail in Florida, leaving behind a new president sworn in on an American military base and a new era for Panama.Manuel Antonio Noriega was born in a Panama City slum on Feb. 11, 1934 \u2014 or was he? The date has been in dispute. In a court hearing in France in June 2010, he gave his birth year as 1936, but then corrected himself, saying it was 1934, the generally accepted date. Legal documents have listed it as 1938, and Mr. Noriega had been said to lie about his age.His father was a public accountant and his mother a cook or laundress, depending on the account, but for murky reasons they were gone from his life in early childhood. He told interviewers that he had been raised by a godmother. He attended the Instituto Nacional, Panama\u2019s best public high school, and in a yearbook he named his life\u2019s ambitions: to be a psychiatrist and president of Panama.When his plans for medical school did not work out, a connection in government helped him get a scholarship to a military academy in Peru. On his return, he began rising in the National Guard.In the late 1960s, he came under the wing of Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, a dictator who would sign a 1977 treaty in which the United States would agree to cede control of the canal and the American property alongside it in December 1999. Mr. Noriega became a loyal aide to General Torrijos, orchestrating the abuse and imprisonment of opponents and tightening relationships with American law enforcement and intelligence.He took on the moniker \u201cEl Man,\u201d but the nickname that endured among his detractors was \u201cPineapple Face,\u201d owing to his pockmarked skin. (A judge in California in October 2014 dismissed a lawsuit filed by Mr. Noriega\u2019s representatives protesting the use of his likeness and the \u201cPineapple Face\u201d moniker in a \u201cCall of Duty\u201d video game.)Embracing his power, Mr. Noriega rigged elections to favor his handpicked candidates. He strengthened ties to drug traffickers. But he also sought bonds with the United States.Colonel North was a central player in a Reagan administration scheme to sabotage the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua by secretly selling arms to Iran and using the proceeds to finance rightist Nicaraguan rebels, known as the contras. Congress had banned funding them.Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate Sandinista leaders or sabotage them in exchange for Colonel North\u2019s help in repairing Mr. Noriega\u2019s deteriorating image in Washington. A congressional report said the sabotage plan had been approved, but there is no evidence that it was carried out. In any event, it was too late for image rehabilitation; the American invasion was around the corner.After he was stripped of his rank by Panama\u2019s new civilian government in 1990 and taken to Florida to face charges, Mr. Noriega\u2019s booking photo, disseminated around the world, became emblematic of his fall. It showed him glum in a brown T-shirt holding a placard with the words \u201cU.S. Marshal, Miami, FL,\u201d reduced to federal prisoner 41586.Mr. Noriega was convicted in April 1992 and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He insisted all along that the trial and charges were a farce. \u201cI accuse George Herbert Walker Bush of exercising his power and authority to influence and subvert the American judicial system in order to convict me,\u201d he said in a two-hour courtroom speech.His sentence was reduced by 10 years, and he was later declared a prisoner of war, allowing him access to a telephone, more visiting hours and even a small salary, among other perks.But while he was in prison in the United States, Panama tried him in absentia for the execution of soldiers in the failed 1989 coup attempt. And in July 1999, France tried him in absentia on money-laundering charges, accusing him and his wife, Felicidad Sieiro de Noriega, of channeling $3 million in drug profits to banks.His lawyers argued that the money was payment by the Central Intelligence Agency, but the couple were convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison.The United States had intended to release Mr. Noriega on parole in September 2007 after reducing his sentence by half for good behavior. But after a protracted extradition fight, he was sent to France in April 2010 for another trial on the money-laundering charges. Again he was convicted.Mr. Noriega is survived by his wife and three daughters, Lorena, Sandra and Thays Noriega.While incarcerated in the United States, Mr. Noriega wrote \u201cAmerica\u2019s Prisoner: The Memoirs of Manuel Noriega\u201d (1997, with Peter Eisner). In the book, he expressed frustration over his captors. \u201cNo one can avoid the judgment of history,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI only ask to be judged on the same scale of treachery and infamy of my enemies.\u201dYet in June 2015, in an interview in prison with Panamanian television, he was more conciliatory, leaving people, once again, to guess about the real Mr. Noriega.\u201cI want to close the cycle of the military era as the last commander of that group,\u201d he said, \u201casking for forgiveness.\u201dYolette Nicholson and Azam Ahmed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. Accused in Lawsuit of Deceit on Diesel Truck Emissions", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byA Seattle law firm that specializes in suing automakers has filed a class-action lawsuit against General Motors, accusing the company of programming some of its heavy-duty pickup trucks to cheat on diesel emissions tests.News of the lawsuit was enough to send the company\u2019s shares down almost 2 percent on Thursday. It is the latest sign of the intense scrutiny of the methods that automakers have devised to meet stringent diesel-emissions regulations, an issue that has led to major legal cases against Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler.General Motors denied the allegations. \u201cThese claims are baseless and we will vigorously defend ourselves,\u201d it said in a statement.It was unclear whether environmental regulators would open investigations into G.M. and the emissions-control technology used in its diesel trucks.The suit accuses the company of using software that helps the diesel versions of Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD and GMC Sierra 2500HD heavy-duty pickup trucks with Duramax engines meet emissions requirements.The software was used in about 705,000 trucks sold from 2011 to 2016, the suit says. It argues G.M. deceived customers by marketing the vehicles as \u201cclean\u201d diesel trucks and seeks to force the company to buy the vehicles back and compensate owners for economic losses.According to the suit, the trucks conform to emissions standards when they are being driven at steady speeds and when outdoor temperatures range from 68 to 86 degrees \u2014 the conditions used for some of the emissions testing such trucks undergo.Absent those conditions, the vehicles emit four to five times the pollutants than are allowed, the suit says. It alleges that G.M. intentionally programmed the vehicles\u2019 emissions controls to pass emissions tests and to then scale back those controls in real-world conditions to improve power and fuel-economy.In response to the suit, G.M. said heavy-duty trucks with its Duramax diesel engine complied with all emissions regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, which plays an influential role in vehicle emissions.The E.P.A. did not respond to requests for comment on the suit. The California agency is reviewing the lawsuit, a spokesman said. He declined further comment.The suit was filed by Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, a law firm that specializes in class actions and that previously filed a diesel-emissions suit against G.M. related to the Chevrolet Cruze compact and another against Fiat Chrysler; those suits are pending. A similar suit filed by the firm against Mercedes-Benz was dismissed. Hagens Berman has also filed liability claims unrelated to emissions against Ford Motor, Kia Motors, Tesla and others.John German, a senior fellow at the International Council on Clean Transportation in Ann Arbor, Mich., said he had reviewed some details of the lawsuit and was not sure if G.M.\u2019s emissions controls amounted to a so-called illegal defeat device. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough information to say right now,\u201d he said.Hagens Berman said the suit was based on tests it conducted on a 2013 Silverado 2500HD with about 51,000 miles on the odometer. Steve W. Berman, a partner, said the firm had hired its own engineers to test diesel vehicles after Volkswagen acknowledged in 2015 that it had cheated on emissions tests.\u201cWe came to the conclusion that all manufacturers in Europe had cheated, and we began to ask, \u2018How could it be that the vehicles manufacturers are selling in the U.S. are clean?\u2019\u201d Mr. Berman said.Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays Capital, said in a research note to clients that the suit could merely be a \u201cfishing\u201d attempt to extract a settlement from G.M. \u201cWe\u2019d only know that it\u2019s more serious if the E.P.A. steps in,\u201d he wrote.The diesel versions of the heavy-duty Silverado and Sierra make up a small portion of G.M.\u2019s total United States sales, but contribute significantly to its bottom line.A decade ago, BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen began offering a new generation of cars that they promoted as \u201cclean diesel.\u201d They were designed with new pollution-control technologies and intended to meet more stringent emissions limits being set by the European Union and California.Among the innovations was a system that sprays ammonia into a vehicle\u2019s exhaust system to remove nitric oxide, one of the most harmful pollutants in diesel exhaust. New filters that trapped and burned particles common in diesel fumes were also introduced.But then Volkswagen began selling cars that passed the tighter emissions tests without using the exhaust additive, which is known as urea. Researchers at West Virginia University and elsewhere eventually discovered that emissions from VW\u2019s diesel models were far higher on real roads than in tests, and the E.P.A. demanded that the company explain the discrepancy.In September 2015, Volkswagen admitted that its cars had used software to detect when they were being tested, and to turn on emissions controls. In real driving, the controls were dialed back to give cars better fuel economy and a peppier ride.In all, Volkswagen sold some 11 million cars and sport-utility vehicles \u2014 including about 600,000 in the United States \u2014 equipped with the offending software.\u201cVolkswagen, because the cheating was so clear with them, sort of because the poster child for misbehavior when it comes to diesel emissions,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s look at all the other diesels and see if they\u2019re doing the same thing.\u2019\u201dOn Tuesday, the federal government filed a lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler, accusing it of using illegal engine-control software on diesel versions of its Ram 1500 pickup truck and Jeep Grand Cherokee. That case involves about 104,000 vehicles from the 2014 to 2016 model years.In Europe, where diesel cars account for a much larger portion of the market, regulators and researchers have begun investigations of several automakers to determine whether they are using illegal means to comply with diesel-exhaust rules.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hollywood Writers Kept the Heat on Studios to Win Their Contract", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 \u201cVictory!!!\u201dWith that single aggressively punctuated tweet, Phillip Iscove, a creator of the Fox drama \u201cSleepy Hollow,\u201d summed up what Hollywood writers seemed to be feeling on Tuesday, after a middle-of-the night deal between studios and writers to avert a strike.Conspicuously not doing a victory lap was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios.A tentative agreement for a new three-year, master contract with the producers\u2019 alliance and unions representing more than 12,000 television and movie writers was reached at around 1 a.m. on the West Coast. The previous contract expired at midnight, and the Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, had vowed to go on strike as early as Tuesday morning. A walkout would have immediately sent late-night comedy shows into reruns and threatened important presentations planned by ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC to attract advertising.The unions declared in an email to members that they had won \u201cunprecedented gains.\u201d Leaders added: \u201cDid we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild\u2019s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept.\u201dOne thing writers wanted and did not get was uniform pay for writing done across platforms, whether that be a traditional broadcast network, cable channel or streaming service.Still, the celebratory whoops of union members were warranted, said Miranda J. Banks, a professor of film and media at Emerson College in Boston, who followed the talks closely. Ms. Banks is the author of the 2014 book, \u201cThe Writers: A History of American Screenwriters and Their Guild.\u201d\u201cThe union was extremely tactical in these negotiations, and it shows in the outcome,\u201d she said. \u201cThey came in with a plan and expertly executed it.\u201dThe guilds, with David Young serving as their chief negotiator, did seem to approach the talks in a strategic fashion. Bargaining started on March 13, with writers asking for a long list of contract enhancements. After breaking off on March 24 \u2014 each side blamed the other \u2014 Mr. Young and his cohorts immediately ratcheted up the pressure, sending letters to TV advertisers promising a strike if no deal was reached by Monday and asking members to authorize a walkout.On Sunday, studios made a new offer \u2014 one reflecting improvements in some areas (health care) and scant movement in others (raises for streaming series) \u2014 and the unions on Monday afternoon made counteroffers that held a hard line on multiple demands, according to three people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings.\u201cCalm, cool, honest and authentic every step of the way,\u201d Damon Lindelof, a member of the union\u2019s negotiating committee, wrote in an email on Tuesday of the guild\u2019s leadership. Mr. Lindelof, whose credits include \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d \u201cWorld War Z,\u201d and \u201cLost,\u201d also gave credit to studio negotiators for \u201cbeing true to their word in hearing our membership\u2019s concerns about the dramatic shifts in the way our business now functions.\u201dOne big sticking point involved what is known as \u201cspan,\u201d or how long television writers spend on each script. There are more shows than ever, but networks are ordering far fewer episodes per season \u2014 as few as six, compared with 22 or more in the past. At the same time, the episodes that are ordered are taking longer to produce \u2014 up to three weeks per episode, rather than the usual two.

{"Headline": "Vote to Kill Retirement Account Rule Draws Criticism From State-Level Republicans", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 An idea to make it easier for Americans to save for retirement that was introduced at the conservative Heritage Foundation is in the cross hairs of a conservative Republican Congress.The publicly stated reason for killing a rule that allowed states to automatically enroll employees of small businesses in savings accounts: federal jurisdiction. But critics contend it was a case of conservatives being cowed by the financial services industry.\u201cThis current Congress seems to want to put fingers in their ears and covers over their eyes,\u201d said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan and the chief economist at the Labor Department from 2010 to 2011. \u201cThere are some really hard problems with retirement, but this is an easy one.\u201dApproximately 55 million Americans lack workplace retirement accounts. Inertia and ignorance are among the reasons many do not enroll in employer-sponsored retirement plans. So the Obama administration constructed the Labor Department rule to encourage states to set up these savings plans on their own, without being subject to Erisa.\u201cI was talking to a bunch of states simultaneously, not with the thought that they would take the lead on this ultimately, but just that, if a state or two started down this road and actually tried to do it, then Congress might take notice and pass legislation to do this,\u201d Mr. Iwry said.But this week, Mr. Iwry said, \u201cthe financial services industry simply directed the congressional majority to throw shade on Labor\u2019s effort to encourage the states.\u201dDemocrats mounted a furious campaign to defeat the bill. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, said that President Trump would betray his supporters by signing it into law.A White House official said in March that, if the bill passed the Senate, President Trump would sign it into law.The commotion around the vote reveals a deep split between state-level Republicans and those in Congress. Congressional Republicans are comfortable with the ways Erisa defers to the private marketplace. Those in the states see the savings accounts as one of the few ways for low-wage workers to get ahead of living paycheck to paycheck.\u201cFor states, this wasn\u2019t partisan. This was principle,\u201d said Angela M. Antonelli, the executive director of the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. \u201cRed states were saying blue states should have the freedom to do what they want, and vice versa.\u201d\u201cThe states can\u2019t afford to do nothing,\u201d Ms. Antonelli said of the need for them to create a plan in place of Congress. The issue may ultimately be decided by the courts if states decide to sue.Few Republicans in Washington buy that argument. Senator Todd Young of Indiana, was one of only two Republicans to vote no on Wednesday. \u201cWhile state-based retirement plans are not my first choice, if implemented carefully, they could help close the retirement savings gap and ease the strain faced by our social safety net system,\u201d he said.Representative Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican, was a co-sponsor of the House resolution passed Wednesday by the Senate. He acknowledged the gap between state and national Republicans, but said state-level officials were too eager to meddle in an issue that had long been subject to federal supervision.\u201cThere are Republicans that have a different tolerance for big government intrusion,\u201d Mr. Rooney said. \u201cThey have a different tolerance for federalism.\u201d\u201cBureaucracies are like amoebas; They just grow and grow and grow,\u201d Mr. Rooney said. \u201cI had one senator ask me, \u2018Why would my state treasurer be for this?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Because she\u2019s a state elected official who wants to regulate more stuff.\u2019\u201dFor those defending the states\u2019 rights, the debate is not merely a question of oversight. Advocates of the state-based savings accounts see a pernicious influence from special interests.\u201cAll politicians get confused between pro-market and pro-business policies. They listen to their business constituents who are actually lobbying to protect their profits, not to make the market economy work better,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said.\u201cI think that state Republicans understand that there\u2019s a retirement crisis, and if they don\u2019t help try to solve the crisis by getting people to save more for their own retirement, there will be pressure for bigger government handouts down the road,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery penny counts when you\u2019re dealing with low-wage workers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He said that he had done so in all three Kaszek funds in an individual capacity apart from Accel, even as that firm had continued to be active in Brazil under his stewardship.Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, faces fresh corruption allegations and his survival is in doubt.That uncertainty has also jeopardized Brazil\u2019s economic recovery, which until recently was taking root in small ways but depends on the enactment of major economic changes.Kaszek though is bullish on internet entrepreneurs in Brazil, as are other firms.The firm expects use of the internet to increase in fields like banking and agriculture and greater mobile penetration. Some of its companies have grown between 50 and 100 percent in revenue in one of Brazil\u2019s worst recessions, its partners said.Kaszek\u2019s first two funds focused on marketplaces, financial technology and software as a service. Now it will add agriculture technology, education and health care.The other founding partner, Hern\u00e1n Kazah, said that the crisis in Brazil has resulted in \u201cmore committed entrepreneurs,\u201d or those starting companies because they really want to.Kaszek\u2019s backers similarly take the long view.Sequoia Heritage, whose funds include money from Sequoia Capital\u2019s partners and outside investors, largely Sequoia entrepreneurs, increased its investment in the new fund compared with the second fund, according to Keith Johnson, Sequoia Heritage\u2019s chief investment officer.\u201cI still think more people will be buying goods and services online in 10 years in Brazil than are today regardless,\u201d he said.The asset manager Hall Capital Partners, which backed Kaszek\u2019s Fund II, also increased its contribution in absolute dollars in the new fund, according to Laura Andron, a principal at the firm, which is based in San Francisco.For these limited partners, this is the right time to invest.Edward J. Grefenstette, president and chief executive of The Dietrich Foundation, said that although Brazil\u2019s macroeconomic and political environments are volatile, \u201cif you wait for the \u2018all clear\u2019 sign, then you\u2019ve probably missed an attractive entry point. \u201cKaszek is the first venture capital firm in Latin America backed by the foundation, a charitable trust made possible by William S. Dietrich II, which has roughly $800 million in assets under management, with 47 percent of that in venture capital funds. It also invested in the firm\u2019s second fund.Even as Brazil remains the focus, Kaszek\u2019s partners say they plan to increasingly look at Mexico and Colombia, too. Argentina will also continue to be important. they said.Mr. Szekasy said that \u201cthere\u2019s also been good progress in the technology ecosystems in Mexico and Colombia, and we\u2019re also quite bullish on the Argentine economy.\u201dWith the new fund, Kaszek ranks 43rd globally among venture capital fund managers that started in 2011 or later by aggregate capital raised, according to the data firm Preqin.

{"Headline": "Speak Up for Europe and Win", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWith the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump\u2019s election, one happening a few months after the other, it seemed that a trend had been born. Clearly, that is not the case. Every thesis breeds the antithesis, and in a world that lives at the pace of social media algorithms, the antithesis does not take years to develop. Brexit was followed by the Dutch general election in March, in which two strongly pro-European parties, Green Left and the progressive D66, together received more than a third more votes than the anti-European party of Geert Wilders.This might all seem good news for those of us in the pro-European camp, but we should be aware that the root causes of euroskepticism are far from resolved. As wrong as the nationalists are about their solutions, they are right in their criticism. The European Union we have right now is very skilled at over-regulating the internal market and especially tying up small businesses in red tape. At the same time, the union is very bad at taking political steps to reboot Europe\u2019s economy and solve its internal and external security troubles, like homegrown terrorism and the refugee problem caused by the Syrian civil war.I\u2019d go further. What we call the European Union is not, in fact, a union. It is still what it was a half-century ago: a loose confederation of nation-states whose coordinated actions are based on the principle of unanimity. As a result, its actions are always too little, too late.An even greater worry for us pro-Europeans is that if the antithesis of euroskepticism was born so fast, then time is fast ticking away for us, too. After the German elections in September of this year, we have to start reforming the union \u2014 not by papering over the cracks, but with deep reforms. That means fixing the eurozone, strengthening the union\u2019s foreign policy and border protection measures, creating a European defense force and establishing a continentwide security service. All of this needs to go hand in hand with deep changes to our institutions. The key challenges are to replace the bloated European Commission with a smaller government and to eradicate once and for all the unanimity rule.The last thing the political center in Europe should do is revert to business as usual. The ruling Socialist Party was wiped out in France\u2019s election; it had become the wobbly party, unsure of what to do. It wanted to bring in reforms, but also clung to an outdated and overgenerous welfare system. It wanted to be pro-European, but was also the first to criticize Europe\u2019s single market, unjustifiably, as \u201cneo-liberal.\u201d The French Socialists were unable to overcome these internal contradictions and synthesize them into something new. The result was political inertia and a total loss of credibility with the voters.The lesson from Mr. Macron\u2019s victory is that the ideals of the European Union are still very much alive. But this can be only the beginning of something new, not the conclusion. The hard work starts now. Europe\u2019s citizens are inspired to vote for politicians who stand up for Europe, but they will extend our mandate only if we deliver. And fast, please.Guy Verhofstadt is a former prime minister of Belgium, the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group, a member of the European Parliament from Belgium since 2009 and the author of \u201cEurope\u2019s Last Chance: Why the European States Must Form a More Perfect Union.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Buries Thatcherism in Play for U.K.\u2019s Working-Class Votes", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 It is a British campaign ritual that every party issues its political platform, or manifesto, telling voters what policies it intends to enact if elected. This time, however, with the Conservatives expected to have an easy victory, their manifesto matters more than most.While continually uttering the mantra of a \u201cstrong and stable government,\u201d she has been contrasting that with the prospect of \u201ca coalition of chaos\u201d should Mr. Corbyn form a minority government with the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats.She hailed \u201ca manifesto to see us through Brexit and beyond\u201d and a \u201cplan for a stronger, fairer and more prosperous Britain,\u201d one \u201crooted in the hopes and aspirations of working people.\u201d Her speech essentially tried to justify her decision to call a new election three years early to get her own mandate and ensure a larger majority in Parliament through March 2019, when two years of negotiations with the European Union are supposed to end.And while Mrs. May was a quiet supporter of the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign to stay in the European Union, she has worked to convince voters that she will keep the promises she has made since becoming prime minister and negotiate a British exit from the European Union that will reduce immigration and mitigate the economic costs of leaving.Against the quiet advice of many senior Conservatives, Mrs. May has recommitted to a target of keeping net immigration below 100,000 a year, which is considered unrealistic, especially if foreign students coming to Britain for their education are included.The last year that net immigration was below 100,000 was 1997; in 2016, the figure was 273,000.Still, if anger over uncontrolled immigration from the European Union was the main driver of the exit vote, as social scientists believe, Mrs. May\u2019s pledge, even if never achieved, will reinforce her attraction to Labour and U.K. Independence Party supporters who voted to leave.One of the reasons for the Conservatives\u2019 large lead in the opinion polls is that UKIP is falling apart and moving toward the Conservatives. It is being joined by working-class Labour voters, especially in the north of Britain, who favored a British exit and do not consider Mr. Corbyn a plausible prime minister, even if they like some of his traditional left-wing redistributive policies.The small centrist Liberal Democrats have called for a second referendum on Britain\u2019s exit after the government negotiates a deal with the European Union. But opinion polls indicate that the party is not gaining much traction with a voting public that has come to accept leaving the bloc as inevitable and seems to feel that Mrs. May will negotiate a better deal than Mr. Corbyn would.To pay for new funding for social benefits and the huge National Health Service, Mrs. May has abandoned two important Cameron pledges intended to appeal to older people. There is no longer a promise that a new Conservative government will not raise income tax or national insurance contributions (though value-added tax will not go up). And there is no longer a promise of a \u201ctriple lock\u201d on pensions that increased payments by at least 2.5 percent a year, which in recent years was much higher than the inflation rate.The Conservatives will also cut back on the promise of free school lunches for all children, regardless of family income, to provide another 1 billion pounds, about $1.3 billion, for school funding, and will only provide subsidies for heating during the winter to those who cannot afford it, rather than to everyone. But it also promises to cap energy bills for many.Under one such proposal, the state would shoulder the cost of long-term care when the family\u2019s assets were reduced to \u00a3100,000 rather than nothing, as it is now \u2014 assuring elderly relatives could stay in their homes and the next generation would receive some inheritance.But the proposal would also mean that those who can afford it will pay a larger share of the cost of their care, rather than the state, and some homes might be sold after death, rather than being passed on.Previous Conservative governments have promised various deadlines, none of them met, for a balanced budget; this manifesto promises one only by 2025, even as Britain\u2019s cumulative national debt continues to rise.The Conservatives also pledged to increase defense spending, and keep it above the NATO target of 2 percent of gross domestic product, and to keep foreign aid spending at 0.7 percent of G.D.P. Not surprisingly, they also reject the idea of a new referendum on Scottish independence until Britain\u2019s exit \u201chas played out\u201d and \u201cthere is public consent for it to happen.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Gwynne said that Mrs. May \u201coffers the majority of working people and pensioners insecurity with a huge question mark over their living standards.\u201d The Conservatives, he said, \u201cstand up only for the few.\u201d\u201cFor the many,\u201d he added, \u201cthey offer the prospect of five years of insecurity.\u201dEven if Mrs. May achieves the significantly larger majority she seeks, her problems will not be over, warned Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. \u201cIf she wins a majority of over 100, it sounds like the empress of all you survey,\u201d he said. \u201cBut her party has its own fractures, and the coalition she will create among them is inherently unstable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting Trump on Climate, California Becomes a Global Force", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The environmental ministers of Canada and Mexico went to San Francisco last month to sign a global pact \u2014 drafted largely by California \u2014 to lower planet-warming greenhouse pollution. Gov. Jerry Brown flies to China next month to meet with climate leaders there on a campaign to curb global warming. And a battery of state lawyers is preparing to battle any attempt by Washington to weaken California\u2019s automobile pollution emission standards.As President Trump moves to reverse the Obama administration\u2019s policies on climate change, California is emerging as the nation\u2019s de facto negotiator with the world on the environment. The state is pushing back on everything from White House efforts to roll back pollution rules on tailpipes and smokestacks, to plans to withdraw or weaken the United States\u2019 commitments under the Paris climate change accord.In the process, California is not only fighting to protect its legacy of sweeping environmental protection, but also holding itself out as a model to other states \u2014 and to nations \u2014 on how to fight climate change.\u201cI want to do everything we can to keep America on track, keep the world on track, and lead in all the ways California has,\u201d said Mr. Brown, who has embraced this fight as he enters what is likely to be the final stretch of a 40-year career in California government. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to do everything we can to advance our program, regardless of whatever happens in Washington.\u201dSince the election, California has stood as the leading edge of the Democratic resistance to the Trump administration, on a range of issues including immigration and health care. Mr. Trump lost to Hillary Clinton here by nearly four million votes. Every statewide elected official is a Democrat, and the party controls both houses of the Legislature by a two-thirds margin. Soon after Mr. Trump was elected, Democratic legislative leaders hired Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, to represent California in legal fights with the administration.But of all the battles it is waging with Washington, none have the global implications of the one over climate change.The aggressive posture on the environment has set the stage for a confrontation between the Trump administration and the largest state in the nation. California has 39 million people, making it more populous than Canada and many other countries. And with an annual economic output of $2.4 trillion, the state is an economic powerhouse and has the sixth-largest economy in the world.California\u2019s efforts cross party lines. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served as governor from 2003 to 2011, and led the state in developing the most aggressive pollution-control programs in the nation, has emerged as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest Republican critics.Mr. Trump and his advisers appear ready for the fight.Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency chief, whom Mr. Trump has charged with rolling back Obama-era environmental policies, speaks often of his belief in the importance of federalism and states\u2019 rights, describing Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals as a way to lift the oppressive yoke of federal regulations and return authority to the states. But of Mr. Brown\u2019s push to expand California\u2019s environmental policies to the country and the world, Mr. Pruitt said, \u201cThat\u2019s not federalism \u2014 that\u2019s a political agenda hiding behind federalism.\u201d\u201cIs it federalism to impose your policy on other states?\u201d Mr. Pruitt asked in a recent interview in his office. \u201cIt seems to me that Mr. Brown is being the aggressor here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we expect the law will show this.\u201dIn one of his earliest strikes, Mr. Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Clean Power Plan, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature climate policy change. Much of the plan, which Mr. Trump denounced as a \u201cjob killer,\u201d was drawn from environmental policies pioneered in California.Mr. Brown has long been an environmental advocate, including when he first served as governor in the 1970s. He has made this a central focus as he enters his final 18 months in office. In an interview, he said the president\u2019s action was \u201ca colossal mistake and defies science.\u201d\u201cErasing climate change may take place in Donald Trump\u2019s mind, but nowhere else,\u201d Mr. Brown said.The leadership role embraced by California goes to the heart of what has long been a central part of its identity. For more than three decades, California has been at the vanguard of environmental policy, passing ambitious, first-in-the-nation measures on pollution control and conservation that have often served as models for national and even international environmental law.\u201cWith Trump indicating that he will withdraw from climate change leadership, the rest of the global community is looking to California, as one of the world\u2019s largest economies, to take the lead,\u201d said Mario Molina, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist from Mexico who advises nations on climate change policy. \u201cCalifornia demonstrates to the world that you can have a strong climate policy without hurting your economy.\u201dThe Senate leader, Kevin de Leon, introduced legislation this month that would accelerate, rather than retrench, California\u2019s drive to reduce emissions, requiring that 100 percent of retail electricity in the state come from renewable sources by 2045. Mr. de Leon said it was \u201cimportant that we send a signal to the rest of the world\u201d at a time of what he described as \u201cblowback\u201d from Washington.Mr. Schwarzenegger, who tangled with Mr. Trump after the president mocked him for receiving low ratings as his replacement on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d described Mr. Trump\u2019s environmental policies as a threat to the planet.\u201cSaying you\u2019ll bring coal plants back is the past,\u201d Mr. Schwarzenegger said. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying you\u2019ll bring Blockbuster back, which is the past. Horses and buggies, which is the past. Pagers back, which is the past.\u201dHe said California had shown it could adopt aggressive environmental policies without hurting the economy. \u201cWe\u2019re outdoing the rest of the country on G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Schwarzenegger said.Even before Mr. Trump took office, California\u2019s tough regulatory rules had stirred concern among business leaders, who said it had increased their costs. They warned that the situation would become worse if California stood by its regulatory rules while Washington moved in the other direction.\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about that,\u201d said Robert C. Lapsley, the president of the California Business Roundtable. \u201cIf we are 1 percent of the problem, and we have the most far-reaching climate policies on the planet while all the other states are slowing down because Washington is slowing down, that is going to create an absolute imbalance.\u201d\u201cWashington will create a less competitive environment for California businesses here because businesses in other states will not have to meet the same mandates,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no question that businesses are going to move out.\u201dThe precise contours of this battle will become clear in the months ahead, as Mr. Trump\u2019s environmental policies take shape. For now, the critical questions are whether the United States will withdraw from the Paris agreement, an international compact to reduce greenhouse pollution, and whether the Environmental Protection Agency will revoke a waiver issued by President Richard M. Nixon that permits California to set fuel economy standards exceeding federal requirements.Revoking the waiver, which was central to a policy that has resulted in noticeably cleaner air in places like Los Angeles, would force the state to lower its tough fuel economy standards, which are also intended to promote the rapid spread of electric cars. As they stand, the rules would force automakers to build fleets of cars that would reach 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.California is preparing for a legal challenge. \u201cYou have to be concerned when anybody talks about going backward,\u201d said Xavier Becerra, the state attorney general. \u201cIn this case we think we have a strong case to be made based on the facts and the history.\u201dMr. Trump is already moving to weaken federal auto emission standards that were influenced by California\u2019s tougher standards. Automakers, who met with the president in the Oval Office days after he assumed the presidency, have long complained that the standards forced them to build expensive electric vehicles that consumers may not want.And the companies have lobbied for years to stop the federal government from allowing California to set cleaner tailpipe regulations than the rest of the nation, arguing that the double standard necessitates building two types of cars. In Detroit, those companies see President Trump as their best chance for finally ending onerous California car requirements. But in the meantime, over a dozen other states have adopted California\u2019s auto emissions standards \u2014 and Mr. Brown is betting that the sheer size of that market will be enough to make the Trump administration reconsider any effort to roll back the California waiver.\u201cBecause we\u2019re such a big part of the car market, and places like New York and Massachusetts are tied in with the U.S., our standard will prevail,\u201d he said.Beyond pushing to maintain its state climate laws, California has tried to forge international climate pacts. In particular, Mr. Brown\u2019s government helped draft and gather signatures for a memorandum of understanding whose signers, including heads of state and mayors from around the world, pledged to take actions to lower emissions enough to keep global temperatures from rising over two degrees Celsius. That is the point at which scientists say the planet will tip into a future of irreversible rising seas and melting ice sheets.That pact is voluntary, but California, Canada and Mexico are starting to carry out a joint policy with some teeth.California\u2019s signature climate change law is the cap-and-trade program. It places a statewide cap on planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, and then allows companies to buy and sell pollution credits. The California measure was the model for a national climate law that Mr. Obama tried unsuccessfully to have passed in 2010.Given the setbacks in Washington, California environmental officials are working with Mexico and Canada to create what is informally called the \u201cNafta\u201d of climate change \u2014 a carbon-cutting program that spans the region.\u201cCanada\u2019s all in when it comes to climate action, and we\u2019ll partner with anyone who wants to move forward,\u201d said Catherine McKenna, Canada\u2019s environment minister.Already, California\u2019s cap-and-trade market is connected to a similar one in Quebec, now valued at about $8 billion, and the Province of Ontario is linking with the joint California-Quebec market this year. Climate policy experts in Sacramento and Mexico City are in the early stages of drafting a plan to link Mexico with that joint market.In April, a delegation from California traveled to Beijing to meet with Chinese counterparts to help them craft a cap-and-trade plan. \u201cWe have people working in China, in their regulatory agencies, consulting with them, speaking fluent Mandarin, working with the Chinese government \u2014 giving them advice on cap and trade,\u201d Mr. Brown said.The Clean Power Plan was central to the United States\u2019 pledge under the 2015 Paris agreement, which commits the nation to cut its emissions about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Now that Mr. Trump has moved to roll back the plan, it will be almost impossible for the United States to meet its Paris commitments.That has resonated powerfully in China. The heart of the Paris agreement was a 2014 deal forged by Mr. Obama and President Xi Jinping of China in which the world\u2019s two largest economies and largest greenhouse polluters agreed to act jointly to reduce their emissions.\u201cChina is committed to establishing a cap-and-trade this year, and we are looking for expertise across the world as we design our program \u2014 and we are looking closely at the California experience,\u201d said Dongquan He, a vice president of Energy Foundation China, an organization that works with the Chinese government on climate change issues.Mr. Brown recently met with the prime minister of Fiji, who will serve as chairman of this fall\u2019s United Nations climate change meeting in Bonn, Germany, which aims to put the Paris agreement in force, with or without the United States. The governor said he planned to attend as a representative of his state.\u201cWe may not represent Washington, but we will represent the wide swath of American people who will keep the faith on this,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name the vice president of Energy Foundation China, who commented about California\u2019s role in climate discussions. He is Dongquan He, not Donquan. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Frightful Five: They\u2019ve Got Us", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtA few weeks ago, I bought a new television. When the whole process was over, I realized something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction \u2014 figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so \u2014 I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon.It wasn\u2019t just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 percent of my household\u2019s commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What\u2019s more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children.This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there\u2019s a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison.This is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large \u2014 to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche.So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column\u2019s companion quiz.The Big Five tech companies increasingly dominate our lives. Could you ditch them?When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy \u2014 but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialize online using Twitter, Apple\u2019s messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal.Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don\u2019t normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft\u2019s word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I\u2019d hate to lose it.It\u2019s when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It\u2019s here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we\u2019ve come to depend on them.In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can\u2019t fathom living without it. Without the world\u2019s best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes \u2014 email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I\u2019d need after ditching Apple \u2014 I\u2019d be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992).And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life.When the kids were born, it became my household\u2019s Costco \u2014 supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?Which brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks.One evening three days after I\u2019d ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner.If such a future makes you blanch, that\u2019s the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you\u2019re right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behavior \u2014 a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t patronize Amazon.But if it\u2019s not Amazon for you, it\u2019ll be another of the five. Or, more likely, it already is. It\u2019s too late to escape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exxon Mobil Shareholders Demand Accounting of Climate Change Policy Risks", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byA majority of Exxon Mobil\u2019s shareholders, in a reversal, have voted in favor of more open and detailed analyses of the risks posed to its business by policies aimed at stemming climate change.Those policies include the goal of the Paris climate agreement to restrict global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.Preliminary results announced at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday put the results at 62.3 percent in favor, up from the 38 percent a similar resolution garnered last year.The resolution, which the company\u2019s directors opposed, is nonbinding. But Darren W. Woods, the chief executive, said the board would consider the result because it reflected the view of a majority of shareholders.Investors and groups concerned about climate change submitted similar proposals in the last few years, but Exxon resisted.Increasingly, though, Wall Street and large investors, including fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, two of Exxon\u2019s largest investors, have signaled concerns about the risks to companies whose assets were based in fossil fuels that could lose significant value as climate policies and market forces reduce demand.Exxon would not say how specific funds voted their shares on Wednesday, and Vanguard would not disclose its own vote. A person briefed on BlackRock\u2019s decision said the fund voted with the majority on the proposal.BlackRock voted for a similar proposal earlier this year at Occidental Petroleum, the first time it had opposed company management on such a measure.Three years ago, a group of investors withdrew a similar resolution after Exxon agreed to report details of the risks that stricter limits on carbon emissions would place on its business, becoming the first oil and gas producer to do so. But that report lacked the detail that the resolution\u2019s proponents were seeking.This year, the resolution was led by the New York State Pension Fund and the Church of England investment fund and included dozens of backers like the New York City Retirement Systems.\u201cThe burden is now on Exxon Mobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously,\u201d said Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller and trustee of the state\u2019s Common Retirement Fund.Mr. Woods said before the vote that Exxon Mobil believed the risks of climate change were serious and warranted action. But he expressed confidence in the company\u2019s reporting on its long-term financial viability, which indicates that even assuming the 2-degree goal of the accord is met, demand for oil and gas would remain high.\u201cIt is a global challenge that requires global participation, and we think the advantage of the Paris framework is that it engages and involves communities and countries all around the world irrespective of their economic development,\u201d he said.Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Folks: Tell the Truth About Your Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byLast Wednesday, President Trump unveiled his huge tax cut, unmistakably geared to helping business and the wealthy.A few days later, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a business conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that there would be no net tax cut for the rich because it would be offset by closing loopholes and deductions.That was hardly the first time Mr. Mnuchin made that patently absurd assertion nor the only occasion on which he and other members of the Trump administration had similarly misled the public about the nature of the tax plan.In fact, when Mr. Mnuchin first offered his unequivocal pronouncement, at his confirmation hearing in January, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, quickly called the commitment the \u201cMnuchin rule.\u201dA few weeks later, in his first television interview as secretary, Mr. Mnuchin said, \u201cWe\u2019re primarily focused on a middle-income tax cut and simplification for business.\u201dWhen the first dribblings of specifics arrived, they included lowering the top rate on earned income, eliminating a 3.8 percent levy on investment income, and doing away with the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.Yes, some deductions are to be eliminated, most notably for state and local taxes, but I\u2019ll bet a lot of money that when the Trump administration provides enough details for the experts to \u201cscore\u201d the proposal, the rich will be the big winners.And that\u2019s not even counting the trickle-down effect of the business tax cuts, which appear to total about two-thirds of the package.I guess Mnuchin rules are made to be broken. But he is not alone.\u201cThis is a targeted tax deduction for the middle class,\u201d the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d in another huge misstatement of what the Trump bill would do. (He meant \u201creduction,\u201d not \u201cdeduction.\u201d)In an interview Monday on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who is now director of the National Economic Council, argued that the increase in the standard deduction qualified Mr. Trump\u2019s plan as a \u201cmiddle-class tax cut.\u201dThe problem, as David Kamin quickly pointed out in Democracy, is that a family of two or more pays less tax under current law than it would under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan because of the availability of both a standard deduction and personal exemptions, which Mr. Trump said in the campaign he would end.All told, the Trump tax initiative to date has been a tale of broken promises and obfuscation about its true impact.Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Misleading the public about the true nature of its policies has become a hallmark of this administration. In recent days, Mr. Trump has been routinely misstating the effect that the current draft of a new health care law would have on those with pre-existing conditions.What\u2019s particularly odd about Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to taxes is that the plan he announced as president is far less detailed than what he put forward as a candidate. Typically, when a president makes a proposal, it has more specifics than a campaign agenda item.Whether this unusual behavior has been driven by his arbitrary nature (the 100-day mark loomed) or by cleverly trying to be sufficiently vague to prevent the costs and impact from being assessed remains a mystery.When the plan was unveiled in the White House briefing room, not a word was said about the fate of the carried interest break enjoyed by hedge-fund and private equity managers, even though abolishing it had been a hallmark of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.After strong pushback, the administration began saying that it would be dealt with in details still to be revealed \u2014 but will it?Similar vagueness has enshrouded a campaign proposal for a child care credit, while a plan to eliminate corporations\u2019 ability to deduct interest payments has disappeared, at least for the moment, as has the campaign plan to limit the amount of interest payments that business can deduct.As for the cost of the plan, Mr. Mnuchin said Monday at the business gathering, the Milken Institute Global Conference, that \u201cwe expect to pay for this through economic growth.\u201d Another wild misstatement.By Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s own math, if the economy expands by 3 percent instead of the current rate of roughly 2 percent, about $2 trillion of revenue would be created.But there are two problems with that assertion. First, achieving that growth level is highly unlikely. And second, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Trump plan would cost about $5.5 trillion over the next 10 years.All told, some transparency and honesty about its tax plans would be a welcome change for the Trump administration.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video Review: BMW 5 Series Delivers New Generation of Pampering", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byDrivenIt\u2019s tough to grasp what a million of anything looks like. But wrap your brain around this: BMW has moved more than 1.2 million 5 Series vehicles in the United States. Worldwide, it has sold around 7.6 million.The new seventh-generation 5 Series is now available to pamper owners. I\u2019m driving a rear-wheel-drive 530i (all-wheel drive is available). Want more \u201cultimate\u201d from your driving machine? Go with the turbocharged 6-cylinder 540i or the all-wheel-drive M550i with a turbo V8. Gas sippers can opt for the 530e plug-in hybrid, which gets the fuel economy equivalent of 72 miles per gallon.The 5 Series is a BMW crown jewel so, no surprise, the designers didn\u2019t make many changes. The familiar look gets more aggression in the face with standard LED headlamps flowing into the twin kidney grille for a wider look. The jewelry that defines the side vents behind the front tires recalls its big brother 7 Series. BMWs have a familiar design language, but the company hasn\u2019t gone as far as Audi and Mercedes in taking a single design approach and offering it in small, medium and large.The 5\u2019s new suspension is largely made of light alloy. Unlike in the 7, the chassis structure does not use carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic. It sheds up to 137 pounds by using more high-strength steel, aluminum and magnesium, not by eliminating carbs.The 530i is powered by a 2-liter inline 4-cylinder engine with a twin-scroll turbo, making 248 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque when fueled with premium gasoline. A hint of snarl pops from the tailpipes, but it won\u2019t violate any neighborhood covenants.I often find the electronic transmission controllers fussy, and while this one is no exception, the 8-speed gearbox decisively chooses the right ratio every time. Steering wheel paddles allow manual selection. Drive modes change the steering weight, the throttle response and the gauges.Rich low-end torque sends the 530i off in a satisfying way. The rear-drive 530i does the zero-to-60-mile-an-hour dash in six seconds. The all-wheel-drive model is a tick quicker. The top speed is 130 miles an hour. Remember, though, there\u2019s no autobahn in the United States.The ride quality, and really everything about the 5 Series down to the switchgear, is creamy smooth. It\u2019s a refined, confident and hushed sedan. I highly recommend the optional dynamic shock absorbers, integral active steering and M Sport brakes that were on my test vehicle to achieve Ultimate Driving Machine levels of handling. Road feel is improved, and the new 5 feels more athletic than the outgoing car. Why have dinner delivered when it\u2019s more rewarding to drive for takeout?Enthusiasts may moan that the 530i isn\u2019t sharp or athletic enough. Remember, the M550i exists to fill that need. And while the hard-core-performance M5 version doesn\u2019t exist yet, we all know it\u2019s coming.I came close to the government\u2019s fuel economy rating of 24 miles per gallon in the city, 35 highway and an average of 27. Driving round-trip from Seattle to Portland, Ore., I got 34 miles per gallon in rainy conditions. I also arrived at my destination fresh as a spring day.That\u2019s a result in part of the optional vented seats with massage function. Another stress reliever is the available adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist working in a semiautonomous driving mode. BMW claims that drivers\u2019 hands can be kept off the steering wheel for up to 50 seconds. I found it was closer to 30, but it was raining. Of course, it\u2019s Seattle.More tech? Properly equipped, the 5 Series will change lanes to avoid impact with a hard-braking car ahead. It can even park itself with no one in the driver\u2019s seat.With loads of wood, leather and metal to gaze upon, the cockpit is a fine place to watch the world go by. The dramatic interior accent lighting is a reason to linger in the driveway. BMW\u2019s iDrive user interface is improved with a new tiled look. Control it with the classic center console knob or touch the screen. That\u2019s new. There\u2019s also gesture control \u2014 for example, rotating your hands clockwise near the LCD screen raises the radio volume \u2014 but it can be finicky. Knobs may be old-fashioned, but they work every time.The $875 midtier Harman Kardon audio system is a crowd pleaser. I\u2019m not sure the extra $3,325 for the Bowers & Wilkins upgrade is needed. BMW offers Apple CarPlay wirelessly, but, like seemingly everything in a Bimmer, there\u2019s a charge for that \u2014 in this case, an extra $300.Back seat room is generous, though if your passengers must stretch out, BMW would be happy to upsell you to a 7 Series. Seat backs split 40/20/40 to haul longer items, but there is no additional space under the trunk\u2019s load floor. There\u2019s no spare tire; BMW is big on run-flat tires, which can travel 100 miles or so if there\u2019s a small puncture but not if you gash a sidewall. The usable cargo room isn\u2019t much larger than what is found in a Chevy Cruze or a Honda Civic.The price spiral begins at $52,195. Considering this is a luxury car, I\u2019d be loath to part with any of the $19,940 in options on the car I drove.The competition is not trivial. The Audi A6, the Cadillac CTS, the Mercedes E-Class and, for significantly less money, the Genesis G80 all have their appeals. But there\u2019s a reason the 5 Series has been so popular for so long. The improvements made to this seventh generation should mean continued success.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arts Groups on Edge as New York City Re-evaluates Cultural Funding", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byThe elite, majestic museums of Manhattan never had to worry about competing for city money with the small-fry arts groups of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx. Those organizations, hardly world famous or well connected, had to accept scraps while the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lincoln Center and other giants enjoyed a relative feast of resources under the city\u2019s century-old formula for financing cultural institutions.But this two-tiered system of haves and have-nots is poised for its biggest transformation in decades. Mayor Bill de Blasio and his lieutenants are deep into a re-examination of New York City\u2019s $178 million arts budget and other cultural resources to try to give a higher profile \u2014 and perhaps more taxpayer money \u2014 to smaller institutions in disadvantaged neighborhoods.The prospect of a new approach, with an emphasis on greater equity, has some major arts organizations fearful they will end up with less of the municipal-funding pie, while more marginalized groups are hopeful about finally receiving more.The de Blasio administration\u2019s intentions and vision will become clearer with the release of the city\u2019s first \u201ccultural plan,\u201d which represents the mayor\u2019s big chance to put his stamp on the artistic landscape of the city and counteract his reputation for caring little about culture. City Hall declined to comment.But in pursuing these changes, city officials could be setting the stage for an art-world version of class warfare, with cultural giants and their well-heeled patrons pitted against smaller, less-glamorous institutions that focus chiefly on serving racially and economically diverse local audiences. Mayor de Blasio, a progressive with national political ambitions, has tried to make equity a theme of his tenure.The mayor\u2019s team is to submit the cultural plan to the City Council by July 1. Next week, in a prelude of sorts, city officials will release a summary of the views of some 20,000 residents who have commented about culture during public meetings on the plan during the past year throughout city\u2019s the five boroughs.Jimmy Van Bramer, majority leader of the City Council and chairman of its Cultural Affairs Committee, said he helped spearhead legislation to create the plan and identify inequities in order to establish \u201cmore funding opportunities for small, emerging, community-based nonprofit cultural organizations.\u201dBut in a recent interview, he acknowledged a potential unintended consequence.\u201cThere is great concern out there that somehow folks would have funding pulled as a result of this process,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to take from one to give to another, to rob Peter to pay Paul.\u201d\u201cThere will be something that says there are parts of New York City that are under-resourced, and that\u2019s going to be something we want to address,\u201d Mr. Finkelpearl said. \u201cIt\u2019s also going to say that there is great recognition on the part of this administration of the value of major cultural institutions. These are very important, not just for tourism \u2014 which we do care about \u2014 but also to the spirit of the city.\u201dThe city\u2019s re-evaluation is taking place as arts organizations nationwide struggle to cut costs and raise revenue amid President Trump\u2019s threatened elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts, dwindling philanthropic dollars and increasing competition for donors and audiences. In the face of potential cutbacks, major cultural institutions like New York City Center are trying to make clear how much the city\u2019s funding matters to them.\u201cThe support we receive from the city is essential for us,\u201d Arlene Shuler, City Center\u2019s president and chief executive, said, \u201cto carry out our responsibilities as caretakers of this exquisite landmark building that houses one of New York City\u2019s pre-eminent cultural institutions.\u201dCity Center is one of the 33 arts groups in city-owned buildings, on city-owned land, or both, that make up the Cultural Institutions Group. These institutions collectively receive about 63 percent of the $178.3 million municipal arts budget. The Metropolitan Museum receives the largest annual allocation, $26 million, while the Bronx County Historical Society receives the least, $184,072.The remaining 37 percent of the budget is distributed through a competitive application process among nearly 1,000 organizations that are not in or on city property.Less prominent arts organizations, some of them also part of the Cultural Institutions Group, say this might be an opportunity for them to catch up a little.\u201cWe are serving an underserved community in southeast Queens; we are what the cultural plan is all about,\u201d said Cathy Hung, executive director of the Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, which will depend on the city to cover about half of its $1.3 million costs next year.\u201cIn this neighborhood, we don\u2019t have the private resources \u2014 I don\u2019t have the corporations and foundations and individuals,\u201d Ms. Hung added. \u201cHowever you flip the coin, we are always on the wrong side.\u201dThe current funding formula lacks clear criteria or consistency, city and arts officials say. Funding has been determined on a case-by-case basis as organizations joined the Cultural Institutions Group, and city arts leaders have long questioned the formula. The amounts have remained largely stable, with the biggest and often wealthiest institutions receiving the most money.But that doesn\u2019t mean larger organizations are financially healthy, arts managers say. The Met\u2019s allocation, for example, represents just a small fraction of its $332 million annual operating budget.Some say the city should focus on trying to increase its arts budget over all, so that every organization is fortified.\u201cWhat is needed is more money \u2014 there is simply not enough,\u201d said Karen Brooks Hopkins, president emeritus of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, who is on the Citizens\u2019 Advisory Committee appointed by the mayor to consult on the cultural plan.\u201cYou see other cities like London making a big investment in culture,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not about fighting over crumbs; it\u2019s about expanding the pot.\u201dIn addition, some arts leaders say, these larger organizations make a significant contribution to the mayor\u2019s cultural priorities, namely educating children. \u201cIt\u2019s not one big cocktail party with rich people,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said. \u201cThey are getting the mission part, too, and that\u2019s got to be respected.\u201dIn an indication of the mayor\u2019s sympathies, the city used a $10 million increase in the culture budget last year to give smaller arts organizations a 12 percent increase and larger ones a 6 percent increase.Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, which financed the cultural plan\u2019s research, said this kind of redistribution makes sense. While organizations like New York City Ballet, a Cultural Institutions Group member on whose board Mr. Walker serves, are important for tourism and other parts of the city\u2019s economy, smaller arts groups outside Manhattan are also crucial, he said, and have a harder time.\u201cLarger organizations have more capacity to raise private funds\u201d compared with arts groups \u201cin low-income communities of color and in places like Staten Island,\u201d he said.\u201cIf culture in New York only means large, rich organizations, then we lose the lifeblood, which are the small, innovative, entrepreneurial, off-the-beaten track kind of organizations with small budgets that the city should also be funding,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not possible for those organizations to thrive anymore, New York will have all of the features of an unequal city.\u201dThe results of this re-examination period won\u2019t be felt right away; Mr. Finkelpearl noted that the cultural plan will come out after the city has finalized next year\u2019s budget. But because the city\u2019s cultural funds are finite, the process is expected to affect how much public support arts organizations will be able to count on in years to come.\u201cI understand that resources are limited,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said. \u201cBut budgets are statements of values, budgets are about priorities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s First Budget Works Only if Wishes Come True", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 In its inaugural budget, the Trump administration projected that booming economic growth would allow the president to keep a wide range of expensive campaign promises while eliminating federal deficits in 10 years.It is wishful thinking.The budget promises a deep tax cut for businesses and consumers that would not reduce federal revenue. An increase in military spending would be offset by trillions of dollars of unspecified or loosely sketched reductions in federal spending.And it all works because the budget assumes an acceleration of economic growth to an annual pace of 3 percent a year, much higher than the post-recession average of 2 percent.Strikingly, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget would increase the share of the nation\u2019s economic output the federal government collects each year. The Congressional Budget Office projected in January that under current law the government would collect 18.37 percent of gross domestic product in 2027. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget projects that the government would collect 18.43 percent \u2014 even after a proposed tax cut. Because the White House also projects faster economic growth, the combined effect would increase federal revenues over the 10-year period by an estimated $2.7 trillion.The White House expects the government to claim a smaller share of a much larger pie. By 2027, the Trump administration estimates, higher growth would yield an additional $344 billion in individual income taxes even after the proposed reductions in individual tax rates.Mr. Trump wants to combine that stream of revenue with sharp spending cuts to reduce annual federal deficits. The White House projects the budget would swing from a deficit of $440 billion in 2018 to a surplus of $16 billion in 2027, which would be the first since 2001.Some proposed reductions in federal spending are clearly specified. The budget assumes, for example, that the government can save $48.8 billion in disability payments by returning to work men and women who the government has previously concluded are unable to work.Other proposed reductions are unspecified, like a \u201ctwo-penny plan\u201d to reduce discretionary spending by 2 percent a year. That wide-ranging category of spending includes everything except the defense budget, interest payments and obligations like Social Security. But the administration provided no details about the particulars of the plan, just an estimate that the cuts would save $1.4 trillion, or about 40 percent of the total reduction in federal spending.A combination of fiscal restraint and faster growth could quickly render the federal debt much more manageable. The standard measure of government debt is in comparison to a nation\u2019s economic output. Under Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, the debt would decline from 76.7 percent of annual economic output in 2018 to 59.8 percent of annual economic output in 2027.\u201cThe C.B.O. assumes that we\u2019ll never grow at more than 1.9 percent again,\u201d said Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget. \u201cThat assumes a pessimism about America, about the economy, about its people, about its culture that we refuse to accept.\u201d\u201cWithout violating some of the most basic laws of economics and history, we are not going to get the kind of growth that will yield a balanced budget in 10 years,\u201d said Steve Bell, a former staff director at the Senate Budget Committee who is now at the Bipartisan Policy Center.That would leave two possible outcomes: deeper spending cuts or larger deficits.Mr. Trump has some big spending plans. His budget would provide an additional $469 billion for defense discretionary spending over 10 years. It also calls for $2.6 billion in 2018 to bolster border security and begin work on a wall along the border with Mexico. And he has called for a family-leave program that would allow new mothers and fathers to take six weeks off work while receiving their full salaries. The idea, the brainchild of Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, would cost $19 billion over a decade.Mr. Trump\u2019s budget sheds little new light on the main planks of his legislative agenda. The budget allocates $200 billion over 10 years to \u201csupport\u201d $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. This would entail using federal money to attract investment from the private sector to help rebuild roads and bridges. A summary of the budget proposal also describes the Keystone XL pipeline as an example of an infrastructure project that might not happen without the Trump administration\u2019s involvement, though it would not receive federal funding.Even less specificity was offered on the tax plan, which Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team has promised will become law by the end of this year. Mr. Mulvaney said Monday that the budget projected that the proposed tax cuts would not increase the federal debt because they would produce offsetting economic growth.The budget contained no new information on the plan. Materials released by the White House showed tax projections that appeared unrelated, and the White House did not respond to a request for comment. \u201cThe tax plan as you know is in its very early stages,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mayor\u2019s Fall in Seattle Shakes the Gay Community He Rose From", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Being young and gay in this city in the 1980s, said Seattle\u2019s mayor, Ed Murray, was all about being comfortable being out. There were shadows \u2014 AIDS was ripping through the community, and gay-bashing was common \u2014 but you didn\u2019t have to hide the way previous generations had, and that was a powerful, exhilarating thing.\u201cYou\u2019re accepting who you are, you\u2019re letting everyone else know who you are, you\u2019re going out dancing, you hang around with people who are like you \u2014 you never thought they existed,\u201d he said. Those years, he added, are a big part of what shaped him as a man and a politician.\u201cThe thought that I\u2019m going to step away from this is like my life coming to an end,\u201d Mr. Murray, 62, said during an interview in his top-floor office at City Hall.\u201cEver since I\u2019ve been a little kid, I\u2019ve been obsessed with politics,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s been my life. It\u2019s been my hobby. It\u2019s been my job.\u201dFour men have come forward, in court filings or interviews, and said that when they were teenagers in the 1980s, under the age of legal consent, Mr. Murray had paid them for sex. He has called the accusations \u201cuntrue,\u201d and said the law firm representing one of the men had a history of homophobia and political motivations to take him down.But he said the city was being hurt by the story and its distractions, and so he would leave office at the end of his four-year term after this fall\u2019s election.Mr. Murray\u2019s story parallels that of his city\u2019s transformation from a town of waterfront grit to liberal, high-tech sheen. He grew up in a working-class Irish Catholic family of seven children, came out at 25 while a student at the University of Portland in 1980, then on his return to Seattle found that the rungs of power could be climbed back home.That mix of experiences became crucial to his political brand. In the State Legislature, starting in the mid-1990s, he led the fight for a statewide anti-discrimination law, which bears his name. He is also widely credited with forging the coalition that made Washington one of the first states, in 2012, to pass a same-sex marriage law through a statewide ballot initiative.By the time he ran for mayor in 2013, beating an incumbent to become the first openly gay man in the job, he was a well-known quantity to Seattle voters, and his sexual orientation barely made a ripple.But now his exit is making a splash. Lincoln C. Beauregard, the lawyer who filed a lawsuit against Mr. Murray last month in King County Superior Court, called the mayor\u2019s accusations of a political motive and homophobia \u201cnot true\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a disgusting man and doesn\u2019t have the judgment or integrity to be in office at this point based on his actions since we filed the case,\u201d Mr. Beauregard said in an interview.In the gay, lesbian and transgender community that has largely worshiped Mr. Murray \u2014 and especially in its heart, Capitol Hill, where Mr. Murray and his husband, Michael Shiosaki, have lived for decades \u2014 a pall of uncertainty and sadness has descended.\u201cThere\u2019s a sadness for the loss of a leader who has put himself on the front line of many of these causes that have been so important to us,\u201d she said.Other people who live or work in Capitol Hill, where many of the crosswalks are painted in gay-pride rainbows, said they were struggling with what to think, because no matter what is decided in court, many young gay, lesbian and transgender people are victims of crime, exploitation and abuse.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to contribute to the vilification of a member of our community,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we also don\u2019t want to be supporting someone who maybe was an abuser. We don\u2019t want to alienate people who have been abused.\u201dThe man behind the lawsuit, Delvonn Heckard, who said he was 15 when Mr. Murray, then in his early 30s, began paying him for sex, could have potential credibility issues \u2014 he has dozens of criminal convictions on his record, including about 13 felonies, said his lawyer, Mr. Beauregard. The lawsuit seeks unspecified money damages.Mr. Murray said he could not comment in detail about the accusations, except to say that they were \u201cnot true\u201d and that more would come out as the lawsuit moved forward.The suit has drawn attention to a grungier Seattle, and Mr. Murray has admitted that the 1980s were a time of partying \u2014 at gay bars like Neighbours, at the gay gym and at the gay beach on Lake Washington.\u201cOn the one hand, you\u2019re having the time of your life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, the shadow of the plague of AIDS is haunting you.\u201dHe talked about the complex emotions of getting a test for H.I.V. with a friend. \u201cAfter we got our negative results, we went down and lit a candle at St. James, and then went out to the bars to find boyfriends,\u201d he said.But he also gained the reputation of working with the real estate industry on compromise agreements \u2014 anathema to some more liberal Democrats here \u2014 that allowed taller buildings and more density, in return for more affordable housing.Mr. Murray\u2019s impact on the city, and on gay rights, makes his fall all the harder to absorb, said Aidan Key, the executive director at Gender Diversity, a group that works with transgender children. But Mr. Key said new threats to those rights that he fears coming from the Trump administration, not looking back, must now be the priority.\u201cI absolutely don\u2019t have time to live in fear,\u201d he said.The dozen or so candidates for mayor already jostling for position, including a former United States attorney for Seattle, Jenny Durkan, and a former mayor, Mike McGinn, mostly talk about the future, too. And even some of Mr. Murray\u2019s past supporters, like Joe Fugere, are starting to say that maybe Seattle drifted too far to the liberal side in the last few years.\u201cI believe the City Council in Seattle has gone way left,\u201d said Mr. Fugere, a business owner and founder of a chain of pizzerias called Tutta Bella. Mr. Fugere (pronounced fu-JER) said he was looking for a candidate who understood the crisis that small businesses like his faced in costs and city mandates.The politics of sexual identity in Seattle, and how it is emphasized or not in the next mayor\u2019s race, could also be affected by Mr. Murray\u2019s fall. Ms. Durkan, for example, in announcing her candidacy last week, stressed her credentials as a trailblazer in becoming the first openly gay United States attorney, but barely mentioned Mr. Murray at all.Mr. McGinn, who lost his job to Mr. Murray, said his decision to start a comeback bid even before Mr. Murray had bowed out was based on the needs of the city, and was nothing personal. \u201cOf course, I looked at the lay of the land,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did Trump Snub Turnbull? Our White House Reporter Explains", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byWhen they finally did meet before a planned dinner they both attended Thursday evening, Mr. Trump and Mr. Turnbull both said they had moved beyond the contentious phone call that defined their relationship early on. \u201cWe\u2019re not babies,\u201d Mr. Trump said.What do you make of the fact that Trump canceled the scheduled meeting with Malcolm Turnbull, or shortened it and pushed it into the evening? What should we take away from that?Well, I think a few things. Part of it speaks to Trump\u2019s whimsical approach to all things. He shifted course so he could celebrate a needed (albeit short-term) victory on the repeal bill for the Affordable Care Act.And that ceremony was the happiest that Trump had seemed in some time. But I also think that it speaks to his lack of concern for protocol, and perhaps his lack of belief that he has some making up to do with the prime minister.People here were also interpreting it as a sign of his transactional nature and his short memory, or lack of focus, on longer-term strategic relationships. Does that sound accurate to you?I think that\u2019s precisely it. In other words, it\u2019s not an intended snub of the prime minister, but it is a reminder that Trump will handle everything at his own pace, and try to do so on his own terms \u2014 a tricky approach internationally.Speaking of international policy, Australians often tell me the most important relationship in the world of foreign policy is the U.S.-China relationship. And I think a lot of people are wondering who really drives that policy in the White House. Do you have any insight on how that works in this very divided White House? Is this a Jared Kushner thing, a Steve Bannon thing, or does someone else take the lead?It is an all-of-the-above thing. Jared has had an interest in China policy for some time, and Bannon is equally intrigued. But there has been a very definitive effort to nudge the president in the direction of a friendlier relationship with China to deal with North Korea.And is there consensus on that point?That has been generally agreed upon by a wide range of advisers. And remember there is an axis comprised of Henry McMaster, Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, and they are very strongly guiding the president at this point.Do they see a role for Australia to play in the standoff with North Korea?I have gotten conflicting signals on that. Right now they don\u2019t seem certain of what their goal is diplomatically with Australia. It\u2019s worth noting here that one of the most significant voices for the president here is Rupert Murdoch\u2019s.Interesting point. How does that play out? I think tonight might give us a clue! Murdoch is among the attendees on the Intrepid.We just got the pool report with a few quotes from President Trump and Mr. Turnbull and they seemed to be trying to sound pretty chummy. There wasn\u2019t much detail on policy but Trump said the argument at the center of their first phone call, about a deal to bring refugees from Manus Island and Nauru to the United States, was all worked out. \u201cIt\u2019s been worked out for a long time,\u201d Trump said. What do you make of what they said?The New York Times is rolling out expanded coverage of Australia and the region. Here\u2019s how to see our work and connect with our team.I am struck by the degree to which they are downplaying the fight. I don\u2019t take much more from it.What else are you looking at as you continue to report out the Trump-Turnbull meeting or the dinner? I think President Trump\u2019s body language will tell us a lot. When he is in an uncomfortable situation, or when he doesn\u2019t really know someone very well and doesn\u2019t want to, he\u2019ll be quite stiff. So how he behaves, especially after their introductory phone call months ago, will say a lot, and I am curious to see how the president describes Murdoch compared to how he describes Turnbull. A 30-minute meeting \u2014 if it even is that much \u2014 is not a long time for a relationship reset.That\u2019s what seems to be frustrating a lot of Australians. It looks like a second act of disrespect. By any objective measure, it is. The question to me is how much the president tries to mitigate that in person.Getting back to Murdoch for a second, can you describe the Murdoch-Trump relationship a bit? Are they friends, mates in the Australian sense, or is there another dynamic at play?The president speaks to Murdoch now almost every day. And Murdoch speaks with Jared Kushner as well. Murdoch is one of the people who urges the president to stay focused on the economy narrowly and foreign policy more broadly.Do we know if Murdoch advises him on China or Australia, or is it just more general?My sense \u2014 and again this is a sense \u2014 is that he speaks with some specificity on both, but the details are not clear.The New York Times is expanding its coverage of Australia, New Zealand and the region \u2013 and we want to hear from you.People here often wonder what it\u2019s like covering Trump. For you, what\u2019s the hardest part of covering Trump and his White House these days?The incessant nature of it all. And to a lesser degree in fact the president has so little grounding in history or how politicians are covered that he perceives all coverage as somehow specific to him, as opposed to the way presidents are covered.Can you give us an example of what you mean?Sure. As a for-instance, he is said to take great umbrage at coverage about his habits in the White House, or some of the focus on his looks. Some folks around him think it\u2019s some sign of disrespect from the media specific to him.In reality these types of issues are always the focus of coverage with presidents. Obama was marked for his ankle-length jeans. Bill Clinton parodied on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d for his love of McDonald\u2019s hamburgers. There is very little new under the sun but it feels new to this president because while he has been in the media spotlight for decades, he never so much as ran for City Council before he was elected president.For many, it\u2019s fascinating that he still talks to you and to us at The Times given all his criticism of the media. After a tough story that he doesn\u2019t like, what happens? Sometimes after a tough story that he doesn\u2019t like his aides will send angry emails. Sometimes they won\u2019t send anything at all \u2014 they will just go complain publicly. And other times he will stop talking for a while or his press aides will stop talking to you.What brings them back?There is no paper that captures Trump\u2019s imagination more than The New York Times, except possibly The New York Post. But The Times to him represents Manhattan elites whose approval he has wanted for decades.Anything else you think Australia should know about Trump that I haven\u2019t asked? I would strongly recommend people read Tom Wolfe\u2019s \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities\u201d to better understand this president.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Hemingway Tell-All Bares His Tall Tales", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Ernest Hemingway began his career blessed lavishly by the gods. As a rugged young journalist, with a radiant, adoring wife, he dazzled the expatriate and artistic community of Paris in 1922 with his exuberance, gregariousness and exceptional good looks, including \u201cthe most beautiful row of teeth\u201d the writer Max Eastman had ever seen. As Mary V. Dearborn notes in her authoritative biography, Hemingway \u201cvirtually commanded affection, admiration and attention.\u201d His first books of character sketches and stories showed that he had literary talent as well, with an understated style stripped of euphemism, piety and cant. \u201cIn the golden city at a golden time,\u201d Dearborn writes, \u201che would appear a golden young man.\u201dWith the publication of \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d in 1926, Hemingway put a stamp on his spectacular literary career. Rapidly hailed as an important American writer, he became first a celebrity and then a legend, with his voracious pursuit of the adventurous roles and violent rituals of masculine contest. As he aged, however, that myth of heroic virility seemed increasingly untenable. He extolled male camaraderie, but was driven to betray and demolish his friends. He deserted his Paris wife, Hadley Richardson, and in three more marriages became more demanding of women\u2019s adulation and service, more selfish and abusive. As his third wife, the writer and journalist Martha Gellhorn, observed, \u201cA man must be a very great genius to make up for being such a loathsome human being.\u201d And after World War II, Hemingway\u2019s claim to literary genius seemed suspect as well. \u201cHow can a man in his senses,\u201d John Dos Passos wondered when \u201cAcross the River and Into the Trees\u201d came out in 1950, leave such garbage \u201con the page?\u201d The international success of \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea\u201d (1952) redeemed his literary reputation for a while, and secured the Nobel Prize. But his suicide on July 2, 1961, was so shockingly at odds with the hypermasculine persona he had cultivated and protected that it undermined critical evaluations of his aesthetic standing as well. Harold Bloom saw him the same way he saw Updike, as \u201ca minor novelist with a major style.\u201d His golden legend became the tragic saga of a man destroyed by his demons and hiding despair. Yet Hemingway\u2019s outsize life and controversial achievement has continued to be a magnet to biographers, and Dearborn is the first woman to join their company. A perceptive and tough-minded biographer, who has written about other fabled icons of masculinity \u2014 Henry Miller, Norman Mailer \u2014 Dearborn has now tackled the big one. A feminist biography, then? Not exactly. Her chief asset as a female biographer, she insists, is her immunity to the hairy-chested, competitive Hemingway legend. Dearborn wants to opt out of the legend business and focus instead on \u201cwhat formed this remarkably complex man and brilliant writer.\u201dDearborn delved into the Hemingway family archives in Texas, and she gives rewarding attention to her subject\u2019s relationships with his father, his five siblings and especially his mother. Grace Hemingway is often seen as domineering and emasculating; Ernest claimed to hate her for her sanctimonious condemnation of his early fiction, and blamed her for his father\u2019s suicide. Dearborn contends, however, that she was artistically talented, creative and charismatic. It\u2019s well-known that she dressed little Ernest in frills with a long blond bob, as the twin of his older sister, Marcelline. But she also encouraged his skill with guns; at the age of 2, she boasted, \u201cErnest shoots well with his gun and loads it and cocks it himself.\u201d Guns would be part of his legend, from the Tommy gun he used to shoot sharks in Bimini to the doublebarreled shotgun with which he killed himself. The cover of Dearborn\u2019s biography pictures him aiming the Tommy gun straight at the reader, as if to demand we read the book.Dearborn traces Hemingway\u2019s \u201cpersistent confusion about gender identity\u201d to Grace\u2019s androgynous mothering style. His hair fetish, a sexual fascination with matching short haircuts and bleached blond hair for men and women, which became a theme in the gender-bending posthumous novel \u201cThe Garden of Eden,\u201d could be judged as a shameful secret, but also, she argues, as \u201copenness to fluidity in gender boundaries.\u201d Of course, that openness could be risky for a macho superhero in the 1950s. When he wanted to get his ears pierced in Africa, his fourth wife, Mary Welsh, sent a tactful note to dissuade him: \u201cYour wearing earrings will have a deleterious effect on your reputation.\u201d Dearborn is incisive about the ways each wife handled the difficult bargain she had made in marrying a legend.She also stresses his genetic predisposition to manic depression and suicide: \u201cMental illness coursed through the Hemingway family like one of the rivers Ernest wrote about with such beautiful economy.\u201d This dark legacy was exacerbated by his experiences in World War I, his alcoholism and the five traumatic brain injuries he suffered over his lifetime. Nevertheless, she holds Hemingway culpable for inflating his legend from the very beginning. Returning to Michigan as a wounded soldier, he played the \u201cprofessional veteran\u201d in interviews. En route to Paris with Hadley, he was \u201cconstructing myths about himself before he got off the boat.\u201d By the 1940s, he was regularly telling \u201ctall tales\u201d about his war heroism, \u201can exaggeration or lie in nearly every sentence.\u201d These falsities, she believes, began to infect his fiction as well. In \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d (1940), she charges, his \u201cconcerns about authenticity\u201d in writing, political commitment, love and experience were cheapened by the \u201crepeated use of the word \u2018truly.\u2019 Authenticity truly loses.\u201dDearborn skillfully covers an enormous range of rich material; she is an indefatigable researcher. But I\u2019m not an indefatigable reader, and her insistence on using every minute detail slows the momentum of Hemingway\u2019s story. Even his terrible last year of depression, drugs, hospitalization, shock treatment and memory loss is high drama. But after following his inexorable march toward suicide for hundreds of pages, I just wanted him to shoot that Chekhovian gun.Ultimately, the scale of Hemingway\u2019s life is so colossal and his motives so convoluted that no biographer, however gifted, can neatly sever the legend from the life, or have the last word on its meaning. This spring, two other books take up more tightly focused aspects of Hemingway\u2019s life; in \u201cThe Ambulance Drivers,\u201d James McGrath Morris looks closely at the difficult friendship of Hemingway and Dos Passos, and in \u201cWriter, Sailor, Soldier, Spy,\u201d Nicholas Reynolds uncovers Hemingway\u2019s \u201csecret adventures\u201d in espionage between 1935 and 1961. Dearborn includes elements of both studies in her capacious volume, but she ends with another portrait of the artist as a victim of both his self-destructive urges and a genetic fate he could not prevent. His final failing, she concludes, was his inability \u201cto tell the truth, even to himself.\u201d Yet his life is still potent and compelling to writers and readers, and his posthumous fiction, especially \u201cThe Garden of Eden,\u201d reveals that he was trying to tell new truths about himself. It\u2019s time to reconsider the paradigm of his tragic decline.

{"Headline": "Merkel, After Discordant G-7 Meeting, Is Looking Past Trump", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Europe\u2019s most influential leader, has concluded, after three days of trans-Atlantic meetings, that the United States of President Trump is not the reliable partner her country and the Continent have automatically depended on in the past.Clearly disappointed with Mr. Trump\u2019s positions on NATO, Russia, climate change and trade, Ms. Merkel said in Munich on Sunday that traditional alliances were no longer as steadfast as they once were and that Europe should pay more attention to its own interests \u201cand really take our fate into our own hands.\u201d\u201cThe times in which we could rely fully on others \u2014 they are somewhat over,\u201d Ms. Merkel added, speaking on the campaign trail after a contentious NATO summit meeting in Brussels and a Group of 7 meeting in Italy. \u201cThis is what I experienced in the last few days.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s strong comments were a potentially seismic shift in trans-Atlantic relations. With the United States less willing to intervene overseas, Germany is becoming an increasingly dominant power in a partnership with France.The new French president, Emmanuel Macron, has shown a willingness to work with Germany and to help lead the bloc out of its troubles. And Ms. Merkel sees Germany\u2019s future more and more with the European Union of 27 nations, without Britain after its vote to leave the bloc.\u201cThis seems to be the end of an era, one in which the United States led and Europe followed,\u201d said Ivo H. Daalder, a former United States envoy to NATO who is now the director of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. \u201cToday, the United States is heading into a direction on key issues that seems diametrically opposite of where Europe is heading. Merkel\u2019s comments are an acknowledgment of that new reality.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s emphasis on the need of Europe to stand up for its own interests comes after Mr. Trump declined to publicly endorse NATO\u2019s doctrine of collective defense or to agree to common European positions on global trade, dealing with Russian aggression or mitigating the effects of climate change.\u201cWe have to know that we must fight for our future on our own, for our destiny as Europeans,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.Ms. Merkel, who did not mention Mr. Trump by name, also spoke of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, which means the bloc will lose its second-largest economy and one of its two nuclear powers. Britain\u2019s departure will also weaken trans-Atlantic ties and leave the Continent more exposed than before.Given this new context for international relations, she said, \u201cI can only say that we Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands \u2014 of course in friendship with the United States of America, in friendship with Great Britain and as good neighbors wherever that is possible also with other countries, even with Russia.\u201dIn the document addressing the climate pact and other topics, six nations reaffirmed their commitment to cutting planet-warming emissions.With her statement, she seemed to be calling for German voters to get accustomed to a more active European role \u2014 and to more involvement by Berlin in crises on the Continent as well as global ones affecting Europe\u2019s future. Ms. Merkel is seeking a fourth term as chancellor ahead of parliamentary elections in September.Ms. Merkel was known to have been unsettled by her meetings with Mr. Trump in Washington in March, and she had been concerned that if Marine Le Pen won the French presidency this month, Germany would be isolated and the European Union badly damaged.But Mr. Macron, who was meeting Mr. Trump for the first time, appeared to have a less negative impression of the outcome of the talks than Ms. Merkel. In a news conference at the end of the Group of 7 conference, Mr. Macron took a glass-half-full approach, saying that he believed, over all, that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier hostile language toward NATO, multilateralism was intact and there was a shared vision in a number of areas.Mr. Trump campaigned on a platform of trade protectionism, nationalism and skepticism about multilateralism and climate change \u2014 all issues on which most European leaders disagree with him. Europeans also depend on NATO for their ultimate defense and are more concerned about an increasingly aggressive Russia than Mr. Trump seems to be, although his defense secretary and national security adviser, both senior military officers, insist that the president is fully behind NATO\u2019s Article 5, which requires all members to come to the defense of any country in the alliance that is attacked.Mr. Daalder said: \u201cThis is \u2018America first\u2019 \u2014 a policy focused on narrow self-interest \u2014 and abandons the idea that the best way to enhance our security and prosperity is by having strong allies and leading globally in pursuit of common values and interests.\u201dAs they traveled back to the United States over the weekend, White House officials said Mr. Trump had succeeded in delivering a blunt message about self-reliance to American allies in Europe.They said the president\u2019s decision to scold the NATO member countries about their contributions to the defense alliance would reduce the need for the United States to carry the financial burden for the Continent\u2019s defense. And they said the president\u2019s tough position on trade would help protect American companies from unfair practices.\u201cThis was a summit in which the goals and priorities of the United States and the president really were felt deeply,\u201d said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president\u2019s conversations with other leaders. Mr. Trump \u201chas changed the way many people around the world are thinking about these issues.\u201dWhite House officials expressed little concern about the personal interactions between the president and other heads of state. The administration official said Mr. Trump had built \u201can extraordinary rapport with the other leaders.\u201dThe climate accord was the most vivid sign of division between the United States and its allies. But Mr. Trump, in Brussels, also repeated comments that Germany was \u201cvery bad\u201d because of its trade surplus and the fact that some German car companies manufacture in Mexico for importing into the United States, even though many of them produce cars in American factories with American workers.On Saturday, Ms. Merkel was unusually direct in discussing what she called unsatisfying talks on climate change, which is an important issue for many German voters and a hallmark topic for the chancellor, who first made her mark in the 1990s shepherding an international accord on the environment.Ms. Merkel\u2019s disappointment on the issue was not entirely shared by Mr. Macron, who said Mr. Trump had at least listened to the arguments of the other Group of 7 leaders.Ms. Merkel, however, sounded a somewhat bleaker note. \u201cThe whole discussion about climate was very difficult, not to say unsatisfactory,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a situation where it\u2019s six, if you count the European Union, seven, against one.\u201d\u201cThis is not just any old agreement, but it is a central agreement for shaping globalization,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no signs of whether the U.S. will stay in the Paris accords or not.\u201d\u201cMy handshake with him \u2014 it wasn\u2019t innocent,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cOne must show that you won\u2019t make small concessions, even symbolic ones, but also not over-publicize things, either.\u201dThe budding Merkel-Macron relationship is important, and Ms. Merkel has moved quickly to embrace him, conscious that he must still try to win a legislative majority in elections next month to be an effective partner. The European Union has traditionally been at its strongest when its two biggest continental powers work closely in tandem.Accordingly, Ms. Merkel and her top aides held a bilateral meeting on Friday night in Sicily with Mr. Macron and his top officials, German officials said. Most strikingly, the spouses of the two leaders also attended. It is rare for Ms. Merkel\u2019s husband, Joachim Sauer, to accompany her on trips abroad \u2014 something she said recently that he decides. Brigitte Macron is new to the role of France\u2019s first lady, but Mr. Macron has credited her with giving him valuable political advice.In general, Mr. Macron \u2014 who will meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday at Versailles, outside Paris \u2014 has stressed friendship with Germany, appointing German speakers to critical positions, including prime minister, chief foreign policy adviser and defense minister. The newly elected president also kept the tradition of paying his first official visit to Berlin, doing so on his first full day in office.Mr. Daalder disagreed. \u201cThe president\u2019s failure to endorse Article 5 in a speech at NATO headquarters, his continued lambasting of Germany and other allies on trade, his apparent decision to walk away from the Paris climate agreement \u2014 all suggest that the United States is less interested in leading globally than has been the case for the last 70 years,\u201d he said.Alison Smale reported from Berlin and Cologne, and Steven Erlanger from London.

{"Headline": "Why \u2018Mayism\u2019 Really Is a Thing", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byIt is hard to exaggerate the force of this repudiation, a series of sentiments that would not look out of place in a socialist text. The party that smashed the trade unions in the 1980s now promises to protect employee entitlements, such as the right to take time off work to look after a sick relative. It proposes caps on energy prices, a significant (and risky) intervention in the competitive marketplace that provides gas and electricity to consumers.Why is Mrs. May doing this? First, because she can. Though the opinion polls are fluctuating a little, they point uniformly to a heavy defeat for the Labour Party and a result that will give the Tories comfortable room for maneuver in the lawmaking House of Commons. So if the prime minister wants to make her mark, and lay out a new direction for her party and country, now is the time to do so.Second, she sees Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, which she quietly opposed before last year\u2019s referendum, as an opportunity as well as a monumental challenge. Even before the vote in favor of Brexit, Mrs. May had come to believe that globalization, the digital revolution and unprecedented population mobility presented the 21st-century nation-state with a series of fundamental challenges and that the rules-based capitalist system and liberal democracy were in deep trouble if they did not address the grievances of those who felt left out, disenfranchised and unconsulted.All of which chimes with her determination that the Conservative Party should speak to, and for, working-class communities as vigorously as it does with its traditional base of rural and affluent suburban voters. This has translated into a direct appeal to those who are \u201cjust about managing\u201d (\u201cJams,\u201d as this slice of the struggling middle class has become known by policy makers in the Civil Service), to ethnic minorities and to the vulnerable.Mrs. May\u2019s critics object that the rhetoric is not matched by reality. But she has already overturned one Tory shibboleth in pursuit of her broader project. It has long been an article of faith for Conservatives that as far as possible, wealth should be taxed lightly \u2014 a principle that has naturally recommended the party to the rich and made the poor suspicious of its motives.But the Tory manifesto proposed a dramatic shift in this doctrine: a new system in which home care of the elderly is paid for out of capital released from what they own. This may sound technical, but its significance is simple. The Conservatives now regard wealth as a legitimate target for the state to raid.Most striking is her relentless focus upon society, its dreams and its pathologies. In recent decades, the Tories have been the party of the economy, rescuing a nation on the brink of industrial collapse and hyperinflation in the \u201980s, and reducing the deficit during Mr. Cameron\u2019s six-year tenure as prime minister.Mrs. May insists that sustained economic growth remains her most important objective, especially as she embarks upon tortuous exit negotiations with the European Union, which she hopes will yield a strong trade deal. But the governing principle of Mayism is a conviction that politics is not simply a branch of economics; that the voters\u2019 experience is not exclusively defined by disposable income; and that the nation\u2019s prosperity is, in any case, distributed much too unevenly.Caricatured by her political opponents as a stony-faced neo-Thatcherite, Mrs. May is nothing of the sort. There are plenty of her own members of Parliament who are troubled by the direction in which she is heading \u2014 another reason she is seeking a solid House of Commons majority that will enable her to govern as she pleases. Though her campaign slogan is \u201cstrong and stable leadership,\u201d what she promises is nothing less than a root-and-branch transformation of Conservative ideology. Buckle up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Sounds Cautious Note but Doesn\u2019t Deter Forecast of Rate Increase", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve Board officials said at a meeting early this month that they wanted to see evidence of stronger economic growth before continuing to increase the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate, according to minutes of the meeting published on Wednesday.\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of stuff they were looking for, that they were expecting, and they just wanted to see come to fruition,\u201d Mr. Faucher said, \u201cand I think it did, and so now they can go ahead\u201d with a rate hike at the June meeting.Investors also learned for the first time on Wednesday how the central bank is likely to reduce its holdings of more than $4 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. A reduction of those holdings would be the last step in the Fed\u2019s retreat from its economic stimulus campaign. The account of the May meeting reiterated that the Fed would probably begin taking that step later this year.The Fed raised its benchmark rate in March to a range between 0.75 percent and 1 percent, the third increase since the 2008 financial crisis. Rates remain at a low level that supports economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. The Fed is gradually reducing those incentives by raising rates because it believes the economy is expanding at roughly the maximum sustainable pace.The account of the May meeting, published by the Fed after a standard three-week delay, generally reflects that optimism, describing most officials as ready to raise rates \u201csoon,\u201d provided the economy shows signs of the expected rebound. But the minutes also offered an unexpected note of caution.\u201cMembers generally judged that it would be prudent to await additional evidence indicating that the recent slowdown in the pace of economic activity had been transitory before taking another step in removing accommodation,\u201d the account said, referring to the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which determines monetary policy.The continuing decline in the unemployment rate is likely to weigh in favor of raising rates more quickly. The May minutes also noted that financial conditions had loosened since the last rate hike. Borrowing costs have declined since March, and the dollar has weakened, the opposite of what the Fed had intended.The account of the meeting also noted that the government had regularly reported slow winter growth in recent years, and there was some evidence to suggest that the problem was not the economy but the methodology.But inflation has increased more slowly than the Fed had hoped it would at the beginning of the year, remaining below the 2 percent annual pace that policy makers regard as healthy. The share of Americans who are working also remains significantly lower than before the recession. Some Fed officials see the combination as evidence that the economy is still benefiting from low interest rates.Robert S. Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said Monday that he still expected the Fed to raise rates twice more this year.The plan to reduce the Fed\u2019s asset holdings, which help to hold down borrowing costs, was presented by Fed staff members, and the minutes said it was viewed favorably by \u201cnearly all\u201d of the board\u2019s policy makers.The Fed plans to reduce its holdings without selling securities. Instead, as securities mature, the Fed will keep the proceeds rather than following its current policy of investing in new securities.Under the proposed plan, the Fed would begin by keeping a fixed amount of the monthly proceeds and then increase the cap every three months until proceeds were no longer being reinvested. The schedule, including the caps, would be detailed in advance.Advertisement"}

Says Trump Budget Cuts Would \u2018Make It Impossible\u2019 to Do Its Job", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byThe United Nations said on Wednesday that the Trump administration\u2019s proposed budget cuts would \u201csimply make it impossible\u201d for the global organization to maintain essential operations.The statement, by a United Nations spokesman, added to the growing criticism of a budget submission for the 2018 fiscal year that would reduce funding of the State Department by roughly a third and cut foreign assistance by about 29 percent.The spending proposal, which was released on Tuesday, would reduce American financial support for the United Nations, including for its peacekeeping operations and international aid programs. The United States is the organization\u2019s biggest single donor.\u201cThe figures presented would simply make it impossible for the U.N. to continue all of its essential work advancing peace, development, human rights and humanitarian assistance,\u201d St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in response to queries about the budget proposal.Republicans and Democrats have criticized the proposed budget\u2019s cuts to foreign assistance, saying that such reductions would undercut national security and send the wrong message about American generosity as humanitarian crises are escalating in the Middle East and Africa.The United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, has said the United States wants the United Nations to use American taxpayer money more efficiently.But she has also expressed opposition to what she has called a slash-and-burn approach to budget reductions and has suggested that final allocations will not be as austere as what has been proposed.Mr. Dujarric acknowledged that the \u201cbudgetary process in the U.S. is complex and lengthy, and it needs to be completed.\u201dHe also said, \u201cWe are indeed very grateful for the support the United States has given to the United Nations over the years as the organization\u2019s largest financial contributor.\u201dThe United States contributes 22 percent of the United Nations\u2019 core operating budget of $5.4 billion. That share is set by an international agreement and is based on the size of the American economy. The United States has also been a leading provider of aid to United Nations organizations that rely on voluntary contributions.Twenty-eight percent of the United Nations\u2019 peacekeeping budget of nearly $8 billion has been paid by the United States.

{"Headline": "Why Do We Appease North Korea?", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSince the early 1990s, American presidents have treated the growing threat of the North Korean nuclear program as a priority \u2014 but one to be dealt with later. North Korea\u2019s deep poverty and the apparent clownish nature of its leaders have sustained the illusion that its nuclear program could be bought out, the regime itself could be waited out, and that its largely concealed crimes against humanity could be tuned out.While the United States has vacillated between expedient deals, halfhearted sanctions, pleas to China for greater intervention and doing nothing, the North has methodically advanced its nuclear arsenal and missile capacity.The Bush administration showed even less backbone. After Pyongyang\u2019s first nuclear test, in 2006, Washington, distracted by the war in Iraq, lifted targeted financial sanctions on Pyongyang, returned to nuclear talks, turned a blind eye to the North\u2019s construction of a nuclear reactor in Syria, resumed food aid, and removed North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism.While the Obama administration was less prone to making concessions, Pyongyang took a great leap forward in its weapons programs by conducting four nuclear tests and four long-range missile tests.Although most North Koreans are cut off from the global economy, the regime elite remains beholden to international finance for moving proceeds from weapons trafficking. Pyongyang\u2019s international currency of choice is the United States dollar.North Korea is the only state known to counterfeit dollars as a matter of state policy. And the United States has largely declined to go after the Kim regime\u2019s money trail because of concerns that doing so would push Pyongyang to escalate its provocations. The United States has also mostly shied away from imposing sanctions on the regime\u2019s Chinese partners.Pyongyang\u2019s volatility, however, has deterred full enforcement. Sanctions enforcement, like domestic law enforcement, takes much work and time. Even a full-throttled effort is unlikely to yield results in the first couple of years. But until the United States inflicts a hard financial blow on the Kim regime by freezing its funds in offshore accounts, Washington will lack sufficient leverage for negotiations to be effective.With equal determination, the United States should overhaul its efforts to reach the North Korean people. Pyongyang does its best to block information, censor speech and monopolize knowledge. The state\u2019s invasive practices range from lifelong ideological indoctrination to life-ending punishment for thought crimes like watching video recordings of South Korean dramas or using illegal Chinese cellular phones.The United States must sustain these efforts until the Kim regime\u2019s denuclearization and dismantling of gulags are verified. The regime will step away from its nuclear program only when sustained financial pressure creates the specter of revolt or regime collapse, at which point Washington must negotiate a way out for the Kims.Sung-Yoon Lee is an assistant professor of Korean studies at the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rouhani Wins Re-election in Iran by a Wide Margin", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byPerhaps as important, analysts say, the resounding victory should enable him to strengthen the position of the moderate and reformist faction as the country prepares for the end of the rule of the 78-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Turnout was heavy, with more than 70 percent of Iran\u2019s 56 million voters casting ballots.Despite the healthy margin of victory, Mr. Rouhani, 68, will face considerable headwinds, both at home and abroad, as he embarks on his second term. He badly needs to demonstrate progress on overhauling the moribund economy.While he accomplished his goal of reaching a nuclear agreement with the United States and Western powers in his first term, that has not translated into the economic revival he predicted because of lingering American sanctions.Mr. Rouhani, who has managed to mend ties with the European Union, is undaunted, saying only last week that, \u201cWe will break all the sanctions against Iran.\u201dAfter his victory on Saturday, he said after invoking the name of God: \u201cWith more than 41 million of your votes, you have pulled out the history of our country away from inertia and doubt.\u201d He made a point of mentioning the name of Iran\u2019s former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, whose name and portrait have been banned by state television and all domestic print media. \u201cI will keep my promises,\u201d Mr. Rouhani added.As Iran elects a new president, I drove 550 miles from its holiest city to the capital to see how people are divided.Analysts said Mr. Raisi fared well enough in the elections to maintain his status as a potential successor to Ayatollah Khamenei.In defeating Mr. Raisi, Mr. Rouhani proved once again that Iran\u2019s electorate prefers the moderate reformist path over the rigid ideology and harsh social restrictions favored by the conservative clergy and security establishment.Nevertheless, as supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei remains the ultimate arbiter in Iran\u2019s opaque political system, and he must approve any further changes sought by Mr. Rouhani.Yet, the supreme leader has demonstrated a surprising flexibility in recent years. He has permitted Mr. Rouhani to break some decades-old ideological canons when public pressures grow too intense.Thus, most Tehran residents have satellite dishes that enable them to watch foreign news broadcasts and entertainment, and couples often walk hand-in-hand through the city\u2019s parks without fear of arrest or harassment.This time, prominent intellectuals, actresses, Instagram stars and sports figures waged social media campaigns to urge people to vote for Mr. Rouhani.She was sentenced to 91 lashes and jail time, though the rulings were later suspended. \u201cAt the time, Mr. Rouhani tweeted saying the country needed happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a great help.\u201dThis year, she decided she wanted to help Mr. Rouhani win re-election.\u201cI looked at what he has achieved for us in the past four years and decided I had to do something,\u201d she said in an interview over the messenger app Telegram.The nuclear deal has been hugely important in bringing Iran with all its talented young people out of its isolation, she said. \u201cBut what he has done for the internet has been revolutionary.

All candidates have pledged to overhaul the chaebol, the family-controlled conglomerates that have dominated the economy for decades, to make them more transparent.Jitters are also running high over slowing economic growth, rising household debt and soaring unemployment rates among the youth. But whoever wins the election will find it hard to enact change through the deeply fractured National Assembly, where no party controls a majority.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the political party of the South Korean presidential candidate Moon Jae-in.

Medicaid savings are estimated at $610 billion over 10 years. The administration would shift some costs to the states, by setting annual limits on federal payments to each state, starting in 2020.Claimed savings from reductions in war funding: $593 billionPhasing down the Defense Department\u2019s Overseas Contingency Operations fund, an off-budget spending account that is used to fund wars, saves some more money. The fund has been used to override spending caps passed by Congress and could be changed during any given year.Other: $339 billionThe budget includes new limits on medical malpractice lawsuits, expected to reduce the practice of \u201cdefensive medicine,\u201d saving Medicare $31 billion over 10 years. It also proposes raising about $36 billion in new federal revenue by selling off major American energy resources and infrastructure, opening up vast new areas of public land for oil and gas drilling, and redirecting state revenues that flow from oil and gas royalties back to Washington. The Postal Service would see $46 billion in cuts.Savings on interest payments on the debt: $311 billionInterest payments on the federal debt are one of the federal government\u2019s biggest expenses. Under current law, the interest payments are expected to grow as deficits mount and interest rates increase. The Trump administration predicts that its cost-cutting will slow this rise.Welfare programs: $272 billionThe budget seeks to cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps, by $190 billion and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grants by $15.6 billion. It also proposes $40 billion in savings by barring undocumented immigrants from collecting the child care tax credit or the earned-income tax credit.Repeal and replace Obamacare: $250 billionUndoing the Affordable Care Act would save $250 billion over 10 years, according to the Trump administration, which promises \u201ca smooth transition away from Obamacare.\u201d (These savings are in addition to those proposed for Medicaid.)Student loans: $143 billionThe Trump administration is proposing large cuts to the federal student loan program for low-income college students. The proposal eliminates federally subsidized loans, which pay students\u2019 loan interest while they are in school, saving $39 billion. The budget would also eliminate the public service loan forgiveness program for nurses, police officers and teachers. The largest savings, about $76 billion, would come from creating a single student loan repayment plan based on income.Government payments: $142 billionThe budget promises savings from reducing unspecified government payments through \u201cactions to improve payment accuracy and tighten administrative controls.\u201dDisability programs: $72 billionThe budget would tighten access to Social Security\u2019s disability program, counting $48 billion in savings from testing \u201cnew approaches to increase labor force participation.\u201d The budget does not make changes to Social Security benefits for retirees, which along with Medicare is one of the primary drivers of the nation\u2019s debt.Retirement bene\ufb01ts for federal employees: $63 billionCutting retirement benefits to federal workers would save $63 billion over 10 years. It would be done by reducing the cost-of-living adjustment for retirees and by gradually increasing government employees\u2019 contributions to their own retirement fund.Farm bill programs: $38 billionPresident Trump is proposing a cap on crop insurance premium subsidies and eliminating commodity payments and crop insurance for farmers with adjusted gross income above $500,000 a year.Financial regulation: $35 billionUnspecified changes to the Dodd-Frank Act passed after the financial crisis of 2008 would produce more savings.Discretionary defense spending: $469 billionMr. Trump is proposing a roughly 10 percent increase to the Pentagon\u2019s base budget, with some of the money going toward new jets for the Air Force and ships for the Navy. The increase goes hand in hand with Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to cut foreign aid, including programs that military officials say contribute to global stability and are seen as important in avoiding future conflicts.Infrastructure investment: $200 billionThe $1 trillion infrastructure program is now called a private/public infrastructure investment, priced at $200 billion over 10 years.Veterans Choice Program: $29 billionThe budget would extend a voucherlike program that allows veterans to seek medical care in private hospitals outside the Veterans Affairs system.New paid parental leave program: $19 billionA new program would provide six weeks of paid leave to new parents.The bulk of the savings in Mr. Trump\u2019s budget come from \u201ceconomic feedback\u201d effects. The administration is projecting that its tax cuts and changes to welfare programs will spur significant economic growth and expand the work force, resulting in $2 trillion more in revenue than would have been generated under current law.

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s President Assails His Accuser as Corruption Scandal Intensifies", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byIn a brief but combative television address to the nation, Mr. Temer leveled explosive charges against the billionaire, Joesley Batista, accusing him of insider trading and the manipulation of audiotapes.Mr. Temer contended that Mr. Batista, 44, an heir to the JBS global beef empire, profited immensely from currency and stock trades in the days before the recording was made public. The president insisted he would not quit despite facing an uproar over their taped discussion about obstructing graft inquiries.\u201cHe committed the perfect crime,\u201d Mr. Temer, 76, said of Mr. Batista, accusing him of lucrative trades in futures markets after negotiating a plea deal with investigators. The president also called Mr. Batista a \u201ccriminal,\u201d claiming he had fled to New York.Reports about Mr. Batista\u2019s negotiations with investigators, and the resulting fears about renewed political turmoil, sent shock waves through Brazil\u2019s financial markets in recent days, and the uncertainty gripping the country created a potential windfall for some investors.The aggressive positioning by Mr. Temer, who called Mr. Batista a \u201cnotorious exaggerating windbag,\u201d raised the stakes in the political impasse engulfing Brazil.Calls for the president to resign have intensified since Brazil\u2019s prosecutor general said Mr. Temer was facing an investigation into claims he received millions of dollars in illicit payments and sought to obstruct an anticorruption drive.Regarding the accusations of Mr. Batista\u2019s trades, Brazil\u2019s securities regulator said Friday night that it was investigating alleged irregularities by JBS, including the possible crime of insider trading.Mr. Temer also claimed on Saturday that Mr. Batista\u2019s recording of their meeting one evening in March at the president\u2019s residence in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, had been \u201cmanipulated and adulterated.\u201d Mr. Temer said he was issuing a request to the Supreme Court to suspend the investigation into him.JBS said that the recording was not adulterated, adding that Mr. Batista and other executives from the company had provided an array of documents to support their testimony in plea negotiations.Analysts did not think the televised speech would do much to help the president\u2019s position.\u201cThis does not reduce the political crisis and does not improve Temer\u2019s situation,\u201d said Paulo Ba\u00eda, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, describing the president\u2019s strategy as trying to disqualify his accuser and the evidence that Mr. Batista provided about Mr. Temer.\u201cTemer is in intensive care, in a very serious state, trying to survive,\u201d Mr. Ba\u00eda said.Indeed, the investigation of Mr. Temer is the deepest crisis of his brief presidency. Allies of Mr. Temer have been forced to resign over claims that they tried to stymie corruption inquiries, but Mr. Temer has had some success in persuading lawmakers to approve austerity measures aimed at shoring up confidence in the economy.Mr. Temer was already governing under the cloud of scandal, facing testimony that he negotiated a $40 million bribe for his scandal-ridden Brazilian Democratic Movement Party in 2010. Mr. Temer, who has struggled with dismal approval ratings, has denied the claims.But while Brazil\u2019s Constitution prevents sitting presidents from being investigated for acts committed outside their terms in office, Mr. Temer is coming under intense scrutiny over the latest claims. In Mr. Batista\u2019s recording, Mr. Temer seems to be heard endorsing bribes of a jailed politician who helped orchestrate Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster, as Mr. Batista brags about buying off a prosecutor and a judge.According to testimony released by the Supreme Court, executives at JBS said that Mr. Temer received about $4.6 million in illegal campaign contributions in 2014, when he ran for vice president on Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ticket, and pocketed some of the money for himself.Mr. Temer insisted on Saturday that he was innocent of wrongdoing. He accused Mr. Batista, who traveled recently to the United States, of not spending a day in jail despite admitting to an array of crimes.\u201cHe\u2019s freely walking the streets of New York,\u201d the president said.Mr. Temer also accused JBS of a $1 billion trade before the latest scandal. He suggested that \u201cpeople connected to the economic group\u201d had leaked information about the recording because the revelations \u201cwould provoke chaos in the foreign exchange market,\u201d allowing Mr. Batista to profit from the episode.Dom Phillips and Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buy? Sell? Politics May Move the Market, but Rarely for Long", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseIn a period of otherwise extended market calm, geopolitics have been driving periodic bouts of volatility. Even small investors have been making bets on the impact politics can have on stocks and other asset classes. After last week\u2019s sell-off, I got a wave of questions from people asking whether Mr. Trump might be impeached and if they should sell stocks.I obviously can\u2019t answer the first question. As for selling stocks, my answer, as it has been consistently since the election, is \u201cno,\u201d at least not because of the troubles swirling around the president.Consider what has happened in the days since the headline-making news. By the middle of this week, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index had recovered virtually everything it lost after the Trump-Russia news broke, and on Thursday it closed at a new high.Brazil\u2019s Bovespa index regained much of the ground it lost last week and was in positive territory for the year to date.Within a month of Brexit, European stocks had recovered nearly all their losses. This year European stock markets have been notching new highs.Even some of Wall Street\u2019s most famous and successful investors have been struggling this year to turn political upheaval into market gains. Paulson & Company and Soros Fund Management, two of the best-known global macro hedge funds, which make bets on geopolitical events, lost billions last year according to an annual hedge fund ranking compiled by LCH Investments. Paul Tudor Jones\u2019s Tudor Investment, another macro fund, was flat, and Mr. Jones recently told investors he\u2019s taking on more risk and shifting to more quantitative strategies in an effort to enhance performance.A macro hedge fund index compiled by Hedge Fund Research is down nearly 1 percent since Jan. 1 and over 4 percent for the last 12 months, one of the worst performing hedge fund indexes. Meanwhile, the S.&P. 500 gained almost 10 percent in 2016 and is up more than 7 percent this year.By and large, \u201cinvestors should tune out political events,\u201d said James B. Stack, president of InvesTech Research and Stack Financial Management, who has done a study of what he calls \u201ccrisis events\u201d and their effect on markets. \u201cHistorically speaking, and as a seasoned investor, I\u2019d say investors should just ignore geopolitical events like Brexit or whatever is happening in Brazil.\u201dThe problem, Mr. Stack\u2019s research has found, is that \u201cgeopolitical events may be widely feared, and there will often be a knee-jerk market reaction when they\u2019re unexpected, but seldom do they have a lasting impact. Underlying economic trends and monetary policy are far more important.\u201dMarkus Schomer, chief economist at the asset manager PineBridge Investments, made a similar point. As fundamental investors with longer time horizons, \u201cwe try not to be distracted by the political noise,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling even our traders with shorter time horizons that what we\u2019re seeing doesn\u2019t really affect the economy or monetary policy, which is more important for markets than anything else.\u201dMr. Stack noted that stocks declined sharply after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But the bear market and recession that followed the technology bubble that exploded in 2000 were already well underway by then. September 2001 turned out to be an unusually bad time to sell stocks: By New Year\u2019s Day 2002, little more than three months after the post-9/11 low reached on Sept. 21, the S.&P. 500 had gained close to 20 percent.A more recent example was the showdown over the federal debt ceiling in 2011, when Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded United States government securities for the first time amid fears the government might default on its debt. \u201cStocks dropped 15 percent in less than two months and we were on the brink of a bear market,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cOnce the crisis was resolved, stocks came roaring back,\u201d and had regained all their losses by year-end.Of 11 major geopolitical events examined by Mr. Stack\u2019s firm, only two \u2014 the Nazi invasion of France in May 1940, and Japan\u2019s bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 \u2014 led to market losses over one-week, three-month and one-year periods (and in the case of Pearl Harbor, the one-year decline was less than 1 percent).President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination had no discernible impact: Stocks were up more than 20 percent a year later.As geopolitical crises go, those were pretty big shocks to markets and investor psychology. So far, nothing in the Trump administration has come close. Still, expectations that Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress would succeed in enacting business- and shareholder-friendly tax and regulatory changes are part of what has driven recent market gains.Mr. Stack noted that measures of confidence among small businesses, chief executives and consumers are at or near record levels. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that expectations have accelerated since the election,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the question is whether political turmoil will turn those expectations upside down,\u201d leading to a loss of confidence and lower consumer spending. That could happen, but so far, \u201cwe\u2019re not seeing any evidence of that,\u201d he said.He said comparisons to the Watergate-era bear market of 1973-74 were off base, because then the country was in recession, the Arab oil crisis sent gasoline prices surging, inflation was raging and interest rates hit record highs. Arguably, President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s abandonment of the gold standard and the transition to market-determined currency exchange rates had more to do with plunging stock prices than his crumbling presidency.Mr. Schomer said a failure to act upon many of Mr. Trump\u2019s spending and tax proposals might not be such a bad thing for markets, given that the United States economy is already at or close to full employment and doesn\u2019t need additional stimulus. \u201cAt the end of the day, the only reason we\u2019ll have a recession is if the Fed is forced to raise interest rates too quickly, unless we have a massive crisis, which I don\u2019t see happening,\u201d he said.If anything, history suggests that long-term investors should buy stocks after markets fall on bad geopolitical news, not sell. But that\u2019s not to say this time won\u2019t prove to be an exception, or that markets won\u2019t correct for other reasons.Whatever happens with President Trump, the United States is in the ninth year of the second-longest bull market since World War II; none have made it past 10 years. Valuations are getting stretched. Sooner or later, there will be another correction, and eventually a bear market.Nonetheless, Mr. Schomer says he sees no imminent end to the bull market. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to see a 25 percent surge this year, but this economic cycle is so slow and steady with so few imbalances, we could end up with 8 to 10 percent gains the next few years and a much greater degree of overvaluation.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Stack said: \u201cWe still believe this market will hit new highs in 2017, but the low volatility and the high valuations suggest this is not a low-risk market. It\u2019s not a market in which you should be investing large sums of new capital.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Class of 2017", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported byEditorialIt has taken 10 years, but the job market for young college graduates has largely recovered to where it was in 2007, before the Great Recession. The recent unemployment rate for college graduates ages 21 to 24 was 5.6 percent, basically the same as in 2007. The wages of young college graduates have also recovered, to $19.18 an hour.For the college Class of 2017, those improvements offer a better starting point than was true for those who graduated in earlier post-recession classes. What they don\u2019t guarantee, however, is prosperity. While the labor market for young college graduates has improved from its recession-era lows, it is still not showing robust signs of full employment, in which everyone who wants a job has one, prices are stable and wages are rising.Elevated underemployment indicates the absence of professional job opportunities, which in turn acts as a brake on wage growth. Worse, job challenges among college-educated workers generally mean even tougher times for black and Hispanic graduates, as well as for young people who do not go to college.College graduates who are members of racial and ethnic minorities have far higher unemployment rates and underemployment rates than white college graduates. Racial discrimination is an unavoidable explanation for the discrepancy.Young people with only high school degrees fare even worse. The recent unemployment rate of high school graduates ages 17 to 20 was 16.9 percent, compared with 15.9 percent in 2007; their average wage recently came to $10.89 an hour, which is less than in 2007 when adjusted for inflation. This dire situation results in part because college-educated workers are competing for some of the same lower-paying jobs.The Class of 2017 \u2014 both college and high school graduates \u2014 is coming of age in an economy that is still enfeebled by the serial busts of this century and the failure of government to pick up the slack with more robust policies. These young people deserve better. They deserve a legal and regulatory system that safeguards against boom-and-bust cycles. They deserve federal investment in infrastructure, clean energy and scientific research that creates jobs and lays the foundation for prosperity. They deserve increased resources for public-sector jobs that require college degrees, notably teaching. They deserve a tax system that collects enough revenue to ensure health care, child care and secure retirement.Will they get it?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Panel Approves Stiff Iran Sanctions and Says Russia Is Next", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved on Thursday the most sweeping sanctions against Iran since the United States and five other nations reached an agreement with Tehran in 2015 to sharply limit that nation\u2019s nuclear capability, and the committee warned Russia that it was almost certain to be the next target.Because Iran has complied with the nuclear accord, the Senate committee had to find other reasons to impose the sanctions, and linked the penalties to Iran\u2019s continued support for terrorism and its human rights violations, among other concerns. But the timing of the long-planned punishment was awkward, coming right after Iranians overwhelmingly re-elected President Hassan Rouhani, who has moved to expand personal freedoms in the country and integrate its economy with the West.The Trump administration has supported new sanctions against Iran, which were approved 18 to 3 by the committee and could receive a full Senate vote as early as next month.But Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had pleaded for more time before new sanctions were imposed on Russia, hoping to use the first few months of the Trump administration to fundamentally change a relationship he recently said had hit its lowest point in years.Lawmakers on Thursday strongly hinted that they were no longer interested in giving Mr. Tillerson much additional rope, and the drive in both parties to impose sanctions is a clear outgrowth of the investigations into whether President Trump\u2019s associates had improper connections to Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee \u2014 the committee\u2019s Republican chairman and often a defender of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s approach, to the chagrin of lawmakers in both parties who had hoped to pursue sanctions sooner \u2014 said he had seen \u201cno difference whatsoever\u201d in Russia\u2019s conduct, citing its \u201cwork against our interest\u201d in Syria.\u201cUnless he can come in and demonstrably show us \u2014 and I don\u2019t think he will be able to, based on the intelligence I\u2019ve read \u2014 we are going to move ahead with a Russia sanctions bill during this next work period,\u201d Mr. Corker said of Mr. Tillerson.Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, offered an addendum. \u201cWe have seen a change in Russia behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all been bad.\u201dDuring the presidential campaign Mr. Trump called the Iran nuclear deal a \u201cdisaster\u201d that would eventually allow Iran to produce its own nuclear weapons. But as president he has been loath to make good on his promise to scrap the accord. Should he do so, Iran would be free to resume the production of uranium and plutonium, which are sharply limited under the existing agreement for the next 13 years.Still, the vote on Thursday underscored the degree to which the broader promise of the Iran nuclear deal has gone awry. President Barack Obama and John Kerry, the former secretary of state, had hoped the deal, while limited to nuclear fuel production, would open a pathway to cooperation between the two countries.Instead, both countries have retreated to their corners, with the Iranians working in other ways to influence activities in the Middle East, especially by propping up President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The United States has done nothing to build on the accord, and Mr. Trump just visited Saudi Arabia, heaping praise on a country that has never held an open election and has a human rights record that rivals Iran\u2019s.Mr. Corker noted that the committee had waited to take up the sanctions bill until after the Iranian election, at the request of some members.Among those who urged senators to reject the sanctions was Mr. Kerry, who negotiated the nuclear deal. \u201cAfter Rouhani\u2019s re-election, there is much up in the air/room for misinterpretation,\u201d he said in a series of Twitter messages earlier this week. \u201cThis is not the moment for a new Iran bill.\u201dHe lost that argument, with many of the Democrats on the committee voting for the sanctions. Mr. Cardin called Mr. Rouhani\u2019s victory \u201can encouraging vote,\u201d but argued that the new legislation remained essential.\u201cThis bill is surgical,\u201d he said, noting it had been designed to avoid undermining the 2015 agreement. \u201cJust because they entered into a nuclear agreement, we\u2019re not going to permit them to continue to support terrorism.\u201dRepublicans have continued to express concerns about the Obama administration\u2019s efforts. Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, said the issues addressed in the current bill should have been part of the nuclear agreement.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Mr. Risch said, before supporting the measure, adding that \u201cthese people are not people who want to get on the international stage and take a place with the rest of the countries that want to see peace and harmony.\u201dSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, interjected: \u201cThese people \u2014 that\u2019s a tough, tough phrase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got no beef with Iranian people.\u201dMr. Risch clarified that he was referring only to hostile Iranian leaders, not its citizens. \u201cI should have made that clear,\u201d he said.Mr. Corker suggested that the bill was in fact \u201cvery congruent with the will of the Iranian people themselves,\u201d an assertion that a fellow Republican, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, disputed.Later in the meeting, the committee approved a separate measure to boost efforts to counter Russian propaganda and election interference in the United States and around the world.Some senators made clear that they had expected to take up true sanctions by now.\u201cThis is not a sanctions bill, though many of us wish it were,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said pointedly. \u201cThis is a defensive measure.\u201dTwo committee members \u2014 Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, and Mr. Kaine \u2014 also introduced on Thursday a bill to authorize military force against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups, a move intended to curb executive authority and reassert congressional power over authorization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Columbia\u2019s Business Temptation: An Opaque Array of Tax Breaks", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 British Columbia is well known for its spectacular landscape and outdoorsy living, its swanky urban real estate and bouillabaisse of cultures.A fact not so well known? It has a sweet deal for businesses, offering them tax breaks in an unusually opaque arrangement.Like many places, British Columbia set up a system of tax incentives to lure businesses to the far western Canadian province in the hopes of creating jobs and transforming Vancouver into a global financial center.But if the program has been good for business, it\u2019s been less beneficial for British Columbia.Participating companies have created few jobs, according to government figures, while more than 140 million Canadian dollars ($106 million) have been doled out in tax refunds since 2008, when the initiative was expanded.The incentives operate under a cloak of secrecy that is unusual for similar efforts in Canada and the United States, critics say. The province will not name the companies that get the breaks. The only information available about them is on the website of a nonprofit that promotes the program.\u201cThis is essentially a temporary foreign-worker program for the rich, with secret government subsidies for multinational corporations,\u201d said Dermod Travis, the executive director of IntegrityBC, a nonpartisan political watchdog group based in Victoria, the provincial capital. \u201cThe government is selling B.C. as a tax haven for the global elite to park investment here, but not have to contribute.\u201dThe provincial Ministry of Finance, which runs the effort, says it is a success, with 82 companies participating. Jamie Edwardson, a spokesman for the ministry, declined in an email to identify those companies or discuss the amount of refunds each has received, citing a ban on publicly disclosing taxpayer information in the law that created the incentives. He said the law protects taxpayer privacy.Experts say that with few public details, it is hard to tell whether the plan is worth the lost tax revenue. They also say the lack of disclosure prevents the public from knowing if companies are using the province as a pit stop on a global quest to avoid taxation. \u201cThere\u2019s a real concern corporations are just stripping money out of places,\u201d said Michael Knoll, a law professor and a director at the University of Pennsylvania Law School Center for Tax Law and Policy. \u201cThis lack of transparency is aiding that process.\u201dThe International Business Activity Act, initially passed in 1988, allows companies to claim a refund of up to 100 percent of their provincial corporate income taxes on a number of business activities, including lending, foreign exchange trading and investment management, which could bring a company\u2019s tax rate down to 15 percent.Over the years, the plan was expanded several times. In 2010, an expansion allowed high-paid nonresidents of Canada who work in British Columbia for participating companies to receive new generous tax breaks unavailable to Canadian residents.The tax breaks favor foreigners in other ways, too. Companies can receive refunds on real estate activities with foreigners, including mortgage loans on property in Canada for international buyers. Conducting the same domestic activities for Canadians would not qualify for the refunds. This has raised concerns that the tax refunds may encourage banks and other companies to prioritize foreigners over Canadians in Canada\u2019s overheated housing markets.\u201cThere is no reason for this organization to be outside of government,\u201d said Duff Conacher, a founder of Democracy Watch, a Canadian civic organization, \u201cexcept to escape the ethics, transparency and accountability requirements government institutions have to face.\u201dIn a recent interview, though, he said that its goal was really to enlarge the local financial services sector. \u201cThe program was not actually set up to be a job creator,\u201d he said.It is unclear which businesses listed on AdvantageBC\u2019s website are in the program and receiving tax breaks. But a company must be a core member to get the refunds.In 2014, the province expanded the program for foreign banks, which it said would raise the potential for investment from Asia, especially China. \u201cThese amendments to the International Business Activity Act send a strong message to foreign companies that B.C. welcomes their business, setting the stage for increased investment,\u201d said Michael de Jong, the finance minister, according to a government news release.Mr. de Jong declined to answer questions about the program, including whether the public should be able to know which companies are receiving the tax breaks.Scott Neufeld contributed research.Advertisement"}

In Ohio, Talking Taxes", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe have a tax system that penalizes job creation, economic growth, saving,\u201d Mr. Ryan, tieless with his white shirt sleeves rolled up, said during a round-table discussion with local business leaders and lawmakers outside Columbus. \u201cWe want to fix that so we have more of the things we need in this country.\u201dMr. Ryan\u2019s optimism that the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code in 30 years would be accomplished this year stood in stark contrast to the chaos he left behind in the capital. That turmoil intensifies the challenge he faces in trying to sell ambitious pieces of legislation in a country that is increasingly polarized and distracted by White House intrigue.Some analysts warned on Wednesday that the way Mr. Comey was fired was a sign that a tax overhaul could be too big of a lift for lawmakers in this political environment.\u201cThe Comey firing does not kill tax reform,\u201d analysts at the financial services firm Keefe, Bruyette and Woods wrote to clients. \u201cBut it does reinforce our view that the Trump administration is not operating as effectively and efficiently as it could be, and that it has been slow to learn important political lessons in the past four months.\u201dThe analysts noted, \u201cSome of its actions continue to appear impulsive and create distractions from achieving important policy victories.\u201dSurrounded by local business leaders in one of the country\u2019s most critical swing states, Mr. Ryan offered only broad brush strokes about the tax plan. He spoke of lowering tax rates for American companies so that they can be more competitive globally, simplifying the tax code for regular workers and getting an intrusive Internal Revenue Service off people\u2019s backs.While factory workers in red shirts stood and listened with their arms crossed, the full opposition to Mr. Ryan\u2019s plans was on display outside.Dozens of protesters from liberal groups marched along the road in front of the building where Mr. Ryan was speaking. They accused Republicans of promoting tax cuts that would benefit the rich and loudly criticized Mr. Ryan for pushing through a health care bill that they said would take away insurance from the sick. \u201cBecause of Ryan, people are dyin\u2019!\u201d the protesters chanted.Prominent Ohio Democrats also gave Mr. Ryan a frosty welcome, organizing an event before his arrival to warn that Republican tax policies would not lift the state\u2019s sluggish economy. David Pepper, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the Buckeye State was a case study of why Mr. Ryan\u2019s plans should be abandoned. \u201cHe\u2019s coming to a state that has lived through seven years of trickle-down tax policy,\u201d Mr. Pepper said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t worked in Ohio.\u201dOne of the main points of contention between the plans is the border adjustment tax on imports that Mr. Ryan and House Republicans want. The tax would be a big boon to American exporters, but companies like retailers that rely heavily on imported parts and products have warned that it would be a major burden for them and their customers.Mr. Ryan told the assembled group in Ohio that he was working on ways to ensure that the new tax did not harm American industries. But opponents of the idea remain deeply wary.\u201cWe\u2019re gravely concerned with the impact it will have on consumer prices and on retail sales in Ohio,\u201d Gordon M. Gough, the president of the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants, said in a conference call before Mr. Ryan\u2019s visit.Domenic Federico, the president of BriskHeat Corporation in Ohio, warned that his global business, which produces heating components, would face substantial headwinds if a border tax were imposed on imports. He said it would probably force him to cut up to 30 percent of the 300 workers he employs at the company\u2019s Columbus offices.\u201cImports and exports are not a zero-sum game,\u201d said Mr. Federico, whose company sources parts from around the world.However, she said she was hopeful that Republicans in Washington would focus their energy on making changes to the tax code that would help small businesses, and would not be consumed by political squabbling.\u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d Ms. Abraham said. \u201cBut I\u2019m always worried about the distractions.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Betsy DeVos Refuses to Rule Out Giving Funds to Schools That Discriminate", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, on Wednesday fiercely defended budget plans to spend $1.4 billion on the Trump administration\u2019s expanded school choice agenda, but refused to say whether her office would withhold funds from private schools that discriminate against students.In her first testimony to Congress since a bruising confirmation hearing in January, Ms. DeVos appeared unflappable as she told members of a House Appropriations subcommittee that the budget sought to empower states and parents to make decisions about students\u2019 educations.\u201cWe cannot allow any parent to feel their child is trapped in a school that isn\u2019t meeting his or her unique needs,\u201d Ms. DeVos told lawmakers.But Democrats derided the education spending blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year as tone deaf to low-income and working-class Americans. Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the panel, called it \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cinhumane.\u201dThe budget plan would eliminate more than 20 education programs and redirect funding to expanding school choice initiatives. Those include a $250 million program to give students publicly funded scholarships to attend private schools.But Ms. DeVos said states, not the Education Department, would decide whether to withhold federal money from private schools that are neither required to serve a diverse pool of students nor held publicly accountable for doing so.Earlier this week, in a speech to school choice advocates, Ms. DeVos said that state participation in the voucher program and other federally funded school choice initiatives would be optional. But, she said, states that chose not to participate would be making a \u201cterrible mistake.\u201dRepresentative Katherine M. Clark, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked how Ms. DeVos would respond to a state that gave federal funding to a school that denied admission to students from lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender families.\u201cFor states that have programs that allow for parents to make choices, they set up the rules around that,\u201d Ms. DeVos replied.Though she said the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights would vigorously investigate any discrimination claims, Ms. DeVos declined to say how, specifically, she might protect students\u2019 rights by intervening in state funding decisions.\u201cI\u2019m shocked that you were unable to find one example\u201d of discrimination against students that the secretary of education should oppose, Ms. Clark said.Ms. DeVos maintained that parents should have the final say in what kind of schools their children attend. \u201cToo many children today are trapped in schools that don\u2019t work for them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to do something different.\u201dShe offered similar reasoning when asked whether schools that received voucher money would be required to uphold special education students\u2019 due process rights.\u201cIf a parent chooses to go to a school that is not a public school, then that is a decision made and a contract made with that provider,\u201d she said.The education budget calls for cutting about $9 billion, or 13 percent of the department\u2019s funding, from about 20 programs, including the Special Olympics for students with disabilities, after-school programs for low-income students and programs for gifted students.Since the budget\u2019s release Tuesday, opponents have expressed alarm at how much it targets student-centered programs. The department\u2019s cuts to programs that help students pay for college, such as work-study and subsidized loans, have drawn the most ire.John B. King Jr., who served as education secretary under President Barack Obama and now leads the Education Trust, a think tank, said it was an \u201cassault on the American dream.\u201d\u201cNo one in good conscience could stand up and say this budget makes sense for the interests of students and the long-term interest of the country,\u201d Mr. King said.However, supporters called the cuts long overdue. The conservative Heritage Foundation said the spending blueprint \u201csignals a serious commitment to reducing federal intervention in education \u2014 a necessary condition to make space for a restoration of state and local control.\u201dMs. DeVos told committee members that while the cuts might be alarming, they reflected \u201ctough choices\u201d on programs that had been deemed ineffective or duplicative. More money has not translated into success for the nation\u2019s public schools, she said, citing a $7 billion program targeting low-performing schools that did not improve student outcomes.Republican members of the committee agreed, and praised Ms. DeVos for her emphasis on school choice and better outcomes for students.\u201cI think there is no question that we don\u2019t get a bang for our buck in the American education system,\u201d said Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland. \u201cWe are failing in a global education economy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article inaccurately attributed context to a comment by Katherine M. Clark as part of her quote. It should more accurately be rendered: \u201cI\u2019m shocked that you were unable to find one example\u201d of discrimination against students that the secretary of education should oppose, Ms. Clark said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "You\u2019re Not Going to Change Your Mind", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byGray MatterA troubling feature of political disagreement in the United States today is that many issues on which liberals and conservatives hold divergent views are questions not of value but of fact. Is human activity responsible for global warming? Do guns make society safer? Is immigration harmful to the economy? Though undoubtedly complicated, these questions turn on empirical evidence. As new information emerges, we ought to move, however fitfully, toward consensus.But we don\u2019t. Unfortunately, people do not always revise their beliefs in light of new information. On the contrary, they often stubbornly maintain their views. Certain disagreements stay entrenched and polarized.Why? A common explanation is confirmation bias. This is the psychological tendency to favor information that confirms our beliefs and to disfavor information that counters them \u2014 a tendency manifested in the echo chambers and \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d of the online world.If this explanation is right, then there is a relatively straightforward solution to political polarization: We need to consciously expose ourselves to evidence that challenges our beliefs to compensate for our inclination to discount it.But what if confirmation bias isn\u2019t the only culprit? It recently struck us that confirmation bias is often conflated with \u201ctelling people what they want to hear,\u201d which is actually a distinct phenomenon known as desirability bias, or the tendency to credit information you want to believe. Though there is a clear difference between what you believe and what you want to believe \u2014 a pessimist may expect the worst but hope for the best \u2014 when it comes to political beliefs, they are frequently aligned.For example, gun-control advocates who believe stricter firearms laws will reduce gun-related homicides usually also want to believe that such laws will reduce gun-related homicides. If those advocates decline to revise their beliefs in the face of evidence to the contrary, it can be hard to tell which bias is at work.So we decided to conduct an experiment that would isolate these biases. This way, we could see whether a reluctance to revise political beliefs was a result of confirmation bias or desirability bias (or both). Our experiment capitalized on the fact that one month before the 2016 presidential election there was a profusion of close polling results concerning Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.We asked 900 United States residents which candidate they wanted to win the election, and which candidate they believed was most likely to win. Respondents fell into two groups. In one group were those who believed the candidate they wanted to win was also most likely to win (for example, the Clinton supporter who believed Mrs. Clinton would win). In the other group were those who believed the candidate they wanted to win was not the candidate most likely to win (for example, the Trump supporter who believed Mrs. Clinton would win). Each person in the study then read about recent polling results emphasizing either that Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump was more likely to win.Roughly half of our participants believed their preferred candidate was the one less likely to win the election. For those people, the desirability of the polling evidence was decoupled from its value in confirming their beliefs.Importantly, this bias in favor of the desirable evidence emerged irrespective of whether the polls confirmed or disconfirmed peoples\u2019 prior belief about which candidate would win. In other words, we observed a general bias toward the desirable evidence.What about confirmation bias? To our surprise, those people who received confirming evidence \u2014 polls supporting their prior belief about which candidate was most likely to win \u2014 showed no bias in favor of this information. They tended to incorporate this evidence into their subsequent belief to the same extent as those people who had their prior belief disconfirmed. In other words, we observed little to no bias toward the confirming evidence.We also explored which supporters showed the greatest bias in favor of the desirable evidence. The results were bipartisan: Supporters of Mr. Trump and supporters of Mrs. Clinton showed a similar-size bias in favor of the desirable evidence.Our study suggests that political belief polarization may emerge because of peoples\u2019 conflicting desires, not their conflicting beliefs per se. This is rather troubling, as it implies that even if we were to escape from our political echo chambers, it wouldn\u2019t help much. Short of changing what people want to believe, we must find other ways to unify our perceptions of reality.Ben Tappin is a graduate student, and Ryan McKay is a reader in psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London.

{"Headline": "The European Crisis", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byThose problems bear a certain resemblance to those of our own politics. In Europe as in the United States, recent trends in culture and economics have elevated an educated upper class while separating it, geographically and ideologically and in every other way, from a declining and fragmenting working class. In Europe as in the United States, a growing immigrant population serves this upper class while seeming to compete with downscale natives for jobs, housing and social benefits. In Europe as in the United States, the center-left coalition has become a kind of patronage arrangement between the multicultural meritocracy and minority groups both new and old, while the white working class drifts rightward and votes for Brexit, Trump and now Le Pen.In Guilluy\u2019s account, the tensions between Trumpland and liberal America find their mirror in the tensions between the French republic\u2019s thriving regions and the stagnation and disappointment of \u201cla France p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique\u201d \u2014 a mix of rural areas and cities whose industries have suffered under globalization, and whose inhabitants feel disdained and ignored by the metropoles. And the ethnic tensions that Trump has exploited are mirrored as well, albeit with distinctively French twists \u2014 like the role of the vast suburban housing projects, built in the postwar era for a largely native working class and now contested between natives and immigrants. (Caldwell writes: \u201cGuilluy speaks of a \u2018battle of the eyes\u2019 fought in the lobbies of apartment buildings across France every day, in which one person or the other \u2014 the ethnic Frenchman or the immigrant\u2019s son \u2014 will drop his gaze to the floor first.\u201d)So far, so similar. But as counterintuitive as it may seem \u2014 after all, we elected Trump and they have not \u2014 in many ways these problems are worse in Europe, part of a systemic crisis that\u2019s more serious than our own.They\u2019re worse because Europe is stuck with a horribly flawed experiment in political economy, a common currency without a common fiscal policy or a central political authority capable of claiming real legitimacy. The damage that this combination has done to the economies of Southern Europe, in particular, is striking and severe \u2014 years of elevated unemployment and stagnation, all of it imposed without democratic accountability by a mostly Northern European caste of bankers and politicians.This strategy partially succeeded in Greece, but it failed with Brexit. It should succeed in defeating Le Pen, but it has failed to prevent Poland and Hungary from turning to parties of the populist right.But even \u2014 maybe especially \u2014 if it were comprehensively successful, it would still deserve to be discarded, because it represents a dereliction of duty, a refusal to stare actual failure in its face.Ideally, it would be discarded first by existing parties of the center-right, which would adapt the populist critique and implement an agenda purged of crankishness and bigotry: This seems to be what Theresa May is trying to do in Britain, and I wish her well.But elsewhere right-of-center parties are either breaking down or simply sticking to the same old playbook, leaving populists as the most viable alternative to the status quo. And the policy alternative that the right-wing populists often offer \u2014 hard limits on immigration, new financial support for families, a re-emphasis on national sovereignty, the unwinding of the euro \u2014 is in some ways less extreme than the open-borders and onward-to-federalism fantasies still nursed by the elite, and more directly responsive to the elite program\u2019s widespread failure. (It is also considerably more coherent than the right-wing populism of Donald Trump.)But I still think it\u2019s generally made in a way that doesn\u2019t quite reckon with the scale of Europe\u2019s problems, and the wider political environment in which parties like the National Front exist.I also agree with Mounk that their authoritarian inclinations and ugly historical roots are good reasons to fear what far-right parties might do with real power.But from my perspective \u2014 as, yes, a religious conservative, and therefore someone already far outside the official European mainstream \u2014 the evils of right-populism are not some wild outlier in an otherwise harmonious and liberal Europe. They are instead dangers to be weighed against the myriad evils of the status quo.Above all, perhaps \u2014 it is not right-wing authoritarians but the great and good of Brussels and Berlin who have shown consistent contempt for the popular will, for democratic self-government and for the interests of weaker countries in their union.The logic of that column is the same basic logic that leads me to at least entertain the case for Le Pen. The European Union has systemic problems that its existing leadership cannot or will not solve. Rebellion in such a context may not be wise; it will always risk worse evils. But it is understandable, and at some point it might become desirable as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Sees an Opening in Rift Between Trump and Germany", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Exit President Trump, offending almost everyone. Enter China, eager to talk.But as Ms. Merkel\u2019s busy diplomatic schedule this week seemed to indicate, she might have other options.On Monday and Tuesday, Ms. Merkel hosted a big Indian government delegation, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom her spokesman made a point of calling a \u201creliable partner.\u201d Then, on Wednesday, the chancellor welcomed Li Keqiang, the prime minister of China.The timing of the visits has intensified speculation that in the current febrile state of global politics, China in particular may prove a steadier ally on climate change and free trade than Mr. Trump, even if it comes with its own tensions and complexities.\u201cTrump\u2019s turn away from America\u2019s classic leading role is having a destabilizing effect,\u201d wrote Henrik M\u00fcller, a professor at Technical University of Dortmund, in his weekly column on the global economy for Der Spiegel. \u201cOne consequence: Global economic policy is sorting out in a new way. The other two big economies \u2014 the E.U. and China \u2014 are seeking new partners to work on the international problems.\u201dChina\u2019s prime minister underscored Germany\u2019s importance by stopping in its capital for two days of talks before going on to the European Union headquarters in Brussels, where Mr. Trump made such a poor impression last week.He clearly frustrated Ms. Merkel by proving impervious to her requests, and those of other Europeans, to commit to staying in the Paris climate accord. Yet Ms. Merkel, campaigning for a fourth term from voters who cherish the environment but rarely coddle American presidents, insisted there was no rift.But the Chinese view Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh behavior in Europe as a gift to be capitalized on. It helps Beijing carry through on a long-term vision of China and the European Union joining together as a geostrategic balance against the United States, some Chinese analysts said.\u201cPossibly we will see an important shift in the China-U.S.-E.U. triangular relations, with China and the E.U. moving closer while the U.S. and E.U. drift apart,\u201d said Wang Dong, assistant professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University. \u201cPremier Li and Chancellor Merkel will likely reaffirm their commitments to upholding the Paris agreements.\u201dBaohui Zhang, professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, sensed major changes afoot, too. \u201cLi should be seen from a different perspective now by his hosts,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Europe in general and Germany specifically are collectively experiencing a paradigm shift in their perceptions of U.S.-Europe relations.\u201dIn Berlin, that view is shared by some analysts. Before the United States election, sharp tensions were visible between Europe and China, particularly over Chinese investment in strategic or military companies, said Bj\u00f6rn Conrad, a leading researcher at the Mercator Institute, a Berlin think tank on China. Now, \u201cthere is a shift going on.\u201d\u201cObviously, if you feel you are losing a very important partner, you have to be on the lookout for alternatives,\u201d Mr. Conrad said.But that view is not universal, and others see a more calibrated calculation.\u201cFor Berlin, the relationship with China is not a tool to achieve more influence globally,\u201d said Volker Stanzel, a former German ambassador to both China and Japan. \u201cImprovement of that relationship seems sensible in order to pursue Germany\u2019s economic interests in China better,\u201d he said, particularly at a time when China is wavering in its commitment to allow more leeway to foreign companies operating in China.Ms. Merkel, who has visited 10 Chinese provinces in 11 years in power, insisted in Beijing last summer on reciprocity for foreign companies.In February, Germany, France and Italy presented the European Commission with a request to set up screening of incoming foreign investment.The balance between security and the need for capital in a globalized world is a central concern for both Europe and Japan as they move forward with China.The Chinese government has presented itself this year as the chief proponent of globalization as a source of prosperity \u2014 a stark divergence from Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist instincts and rejection of multinational trade deals in favor of more old-fashioned bilateral accords.President Xi Jinping of China delivered the keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he positioned China as the guarantor of free trade. Despite widespread criticism from Western companies and analysts of China\u2019s failure to open up its economy, European business leaders applauded.Mr. Xi is expected to push that initiative at the next global gathering of note, the G-20 summit meeting hosted by Germany in Hamburg in early July.That China is sending its two most senior leaders here twice in just over a month underscores how seriously Beijing takes Germany \u2014 and Ms. Merkel, who, according to current opinion polls, is expected to win national elections in September.Mr. Stanzel, the former ambassador, cautioned, however, that the frequency of meetings at many levels did not necessarily signify accord.\u201cWe see a long process of increasing frustration with how China implements its reform plans,\u201d he wrote in an email. That requires frequent and intense contacts, \u201cwhich may give the impression that they become warmer.\u201dMarcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, concurred that replacing America with China \u201cis not a good swap.\u201d\u201cGermany has a lot more to fear from the Chinese than from the United States,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a conference on American-German relations, taking place right by the Brandenburg Gate where former President Barack Obama appeared with Ms. Merkel last week before the Trump meetings in Brussels and Italy.Mr. Fratzscher, for one, argued for more German interest in India, whose delegation had just arrived to attend an investment conference with Ms. Merkel in a nearby hotel. India ranks about 24th on the list of trading partners for export-oriented Germany, between Ireland and Finland.This week, Ms. Merkel pledged support to get stalled talks between India and the European Union moving. India\u2019s high customs tariffs and bureaucracy \u2014 protections it argues a developing country needs \u2014 have delayed progress for a decade.Similarly, it remains to be seen if she can prod the Chinese to level the playing field for foreign companies and overcome the tensions standing in the way of a deeper partnership with Beijing as relations with Mr. Trump\u2019s America sour.Alison Smale reported from Berlin, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Preparations for Trump\u2019s Visit Expose Political Rifts in Israel", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byMr. Netanyahu also had to wrestle much of Sunday in a closed cabinet meeting with right-wing ministers of his coalition to win approval of even modest gestures meant to encourage the Palestinian economy and ease conditions in the West Bank and elsewhere.On the Israeli side, Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of his cabinet meeting on Sunday that he would discuss with Mr. Trump ways to strengthen the Israeli-American alliance, and added in English: \u201cMr. President, we look forward to your visit. The citizens of Israel will receive you with open arms.\u201dSome in the Israeli news media have already described the visit as \u201chysterical,\u201d rather than \u201chistorical.\u201d And squabbling within Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition has marred much of the festivity surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s visit: Right-wing politicians are disappointed that the Trump administration appears to be adhering to longstanding American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and they are agitating for Mr. Netanyahu to take a tougher stance.The Israeli government is in any case likely to be more focused on American help in containing Iran\u2019s influence in the region, former Israeli officials said.The cities Mr. Trump will visit and what events are planned.\u201cFor a long time, Israel\u2019s priority has been the Iranian threat,\u201d said Dore Gold, a former director general of Israel\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a longtime adviser to Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cThe shift that the Trump administration has made in wanting to block Iranian hegemonialism is significant for Israel.\u201dThe measures the Israeli government approved for the Palestinians include the expansion of a West Bank industrial zone; the phased extension of operating hours at the Allenby Bridge between the West Bank and Jordan; and the authorization of Palestinian construction in the 60 percent of the West Bank that Israel fully controls, known as \u201cArea C.\u201d The authorization mostly pertains to buildings already constructed and slated for demolition on the edges of existing Palestinian towns.Israeli officials played down the gestures to the Palestinians after approving them. In deference to hard-liners in the cabinet, the government also announced the establishment of a committee to retroactively push for the legalization of settler outposts and homes in the West Bank built without government authorization.Some of the incentives appeared to be recycled. At a meeting last September at the United Nations, Israeli officials presented incentives including an upgrade to the Allenby Bridge and master plans for authorizing building in Area C.Mr. Trump is scheduled to visit the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem, making him the first sitting American president to visit the holiest site where Jews can pray. But even that has caused a political disagreement. Mr. Netanyahu wanted to accompany Mr. Trump and his family to the wall, according to Israeli news reports, to emphasize Israeli ownership of the contested area, but American officials nixed that idea, saying it is a private visit.The wall is in East Jerusalem, an area that Israel conquered from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and then annexed in a move that has never been internationally recognized. The Palestinians also claim the Old City, with its Jewish, Muslim and Christian sacred sites, as part of the future capital of a Palestinian state. On Sunday, Israel kicked off its celebrations marking 50 years since the reunification of the contested city.Bezalel Smotrich, a legislator from the Jewish Home party, suggested that members of the Knesset, or Israeli Parliament, use their parliamentary immunity to pass through the police lines at the wall during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit as a way of asserting Israeli sovereignty.Mr. Trump told Israel Hayom that he had not ruled out the possibility of Mr. Netanyahu accompanying him. \u201cGoing with the rabbi is more traditional,\u201d he said, presumably referring to the rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinowitz. \u201cBut that could change.\u201dIn another twist, the Americans requested Sunday that a dinner to be hosted by Israel\u2019s defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, on Monday for senior members of the American delegation be canceled. The guests were to include Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson; Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump; and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. No reason was given for the cancellation.Israelis have also been upset by Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for a 15-minute visit to Yad Vashem, the official Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem.\u201cHe is taking the opportunity to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust and to identify with the memory, which is meaningful,\u201d said Simmy Allen, a spokesman for Yad Vashem. But Mr. Allen said he could not imagine the program there taking less than half an hour.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Russian Businessman\u2019s Road From Siberia to Success", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 He was rejected by the K.G.B. He couldn\u2019t sell vodka to Russians. He went broke.Then Andrei V. Trubnikov bet on a dish-soap factory and started making shampoo. He is one of Russia\u2019s most successful businessmen, at the helm of a global cosmetics brand.A strapping man who adorns himself in ethnic jewelry and indigenous talismans and decorates his office with wooden masks and fish tanks, Mr. Trubnikov serves herbal tea to guests, speaks in a gravely, reverent voice about traditional Siberian shamanism and eschews any hint of business attire.In short, he stands out, a distinctive look he has sought to extend to his company, Natura Siberica. The brand\u2019s colorfully named products, like Wild Thistle and Siberian Juniper shampoo and Strength of the Bear shaving cream, are sold in dozens of countries, from Argentina to Australia, at supermarkets like the Monoprix chain in France, as well as upmarket department stores like Harrods in London.The company is a rare bright spot for a Russian economy that has been languishing in recent years.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard,\u201d Mr. Trubnikov, 58, said of succeeding in business in Russia.As a college student, Mr. Trubnikov aspired to join the K.G.B., studying Spanish and Serbo-Croatian to help his chances. He was abruptly turned away and, like other spurned applicants, was never told why.Dejected and in search of work, he opened a vodka distillery in the late 1990s, but his timing was terrible. Russia was hit by a financial crisis in 1998, and the country defaulted on its debt, sending the economy into a tailspin. The price of vodka nose-dived. Mr. Trubnikov couldn\u2019t cover his debts and the distillery soon went under.The next year, in desperation, he sold his car, a Soviet-era Volga sedan, for about $5,000, and used the proceeds to buy a defunct dish-soap factory outside Moscow, setting out to make shampoo.\u201cI wanted to make something that shows the value of Russia,\u201d Mr. Trubnikov said.He initially sold products under the brand the Recipes of Grandmother Agafia, named after a Siberian healer, Agafia Lykova. Sales of the products \u2014 based on herbs found in Siberia \u2014 remain brisk inside Russia. But abroad, Mr. Trubnikov said, they were hampered by a lack of recognition by consumers who also found the name a mouthful.Still, he wanted to infuse the company with the good characteristics of Siberia. Despite being from Moscow, he was convinced consumers would associate the remote region with snow, isolation and cleanliness, and not the dark clouds hanging over political leaders in the Russian capital.He eventually settled on the brand name, Natura Siberica, in 2008.The company has now moved from its original dish-soap factory to a larger facility outside Moscow and runs six organically certified herb farms as well as a herd of yak in Siberia. It also has a factory in Estonia and presses to extract herbal essences in Scotland and Romania.Mr. Trubnikov\u2019s sprawling executive suite on the third floor of the building is a veritable temple to cosmetics and beauty products. Sunlight filters through and around thousands of bottles of shampoo, soap, gel, lotion and conditioner made by companies around the world, all stacked on floor-to-ceiling shelves.He largely ignores the contents of the products, and instead studies the bottles and labels for marketing ideas, all with the eventual goal of entering the American market. If Natura Siberica were successful, it would become one of the first major Russian consumer brands to do so.\u201cI like this idea because it is difficult,\u201d Mr. Trubnikov said, \u201cand I like difficult projects.\u201dIn its early years, the company concentrated on its domestic market.The logic was simple. Women in Russia spend about 30 percent of their income on beauty products, according to the Perfumery and Cosmetics Association of Russia, far more than in higher-income countries.\u201cIn Europe, if you overdo it, you could get a condescending look,\u201d said Anna Dycheva-Smirnova, the association\u2019s deputy chairwoman, referring to the amount of makeup used. \u201cIn Russia, if you are not made up, you could get a condescending look.\u201d\u201cNo matter how snowy it is and how slippery,\u201d she added \u201cwomen will wear heels and a fur coat.\u201dThough overshadowed by Russia\u2019s wars, sanctions and political intrigue, fast-footed consumer companies have popped up to cater to the country\u2019s middle class.This year, investors oversubscribed Russia\u2019s first public offering since the onset of the Ukraine conflict in 2014, raising $355 million for Detsky Mir, which operates a collection of toy stores.Over all, about 260 domestic companies have sprung up to make and market soaps, lotions and shampoos in Russia, according to the cosmetics association. The sector now accounts for about 40 percent of the country\u2019s $16 billion in annual cosmetics sales.For Russia\u2019s creaking economy, aggravated by a prolonged slump in oil prices from their highs, there is hope that such nonpetroleum enterprises could help kick-start a broader revival. The country relies on oil and gas sales for 60 percent of all exports, and revenue from crude sales in particular was down 17 percent in 2016.The future, economists say, lies in unleashing Russia\u2019s entrepreneurs.Natura Siberica has largely stood out by putting a different spin on cosmetics, helping the company distinguish itself from the pack both at home and abroad. Its focus on Siberia and Siberian shamanic practices, as well as peculiar ingredients like pine nuts, cloudberries and yak butter, are aimed at evoking visions of stark and unspoiled natural terrain.\u201cAt first, I was skeptical, because we think Italian or French cosmetics are best,\u201d said Viktoria Y. Vedenskaya, a real estate agent picking up a bottle of Sakhalin Island Thistle body lotion in a Moscow store. \u201cBut these berries and flowers are unique.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s virgin nature out there,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can travel for a week, and see nobody.\u201dNatura Siberica\u2019s big break internationally came at a 2008 cosmetics exhibition in Japan, when a Japanese retailer signed a deal to carry the brand.Since then, the company has been expanding, both within Russia and overseas. It now operates 70 of its own brand stores in Russia and six other countries, while its products sell in more than 40 nations.In Europe, it is going for a high-end consumer, with shampoo selling for about 8 euros, or about $8.70. Some branded stores offer luxurious touches, like presses that make fresh pine nut oil for customers while they wait. Over all, sales in 2016 were about 14 billion rubles, or $248 million.\u201cA Russian woman can have a lot of problems. She might have to work in a factory,\u201d Mr. Trubnikov said. \u201cBut in our stores, she should feel like a queen, feel desired, and feel like a woman.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Rules Patent Laws Can\u2019t Be Used to Prevent Reselling", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byThe case concerned Lexmark International, which makes toner cartridges for use in its printers. The court ruled that the company could not use patent law to stop companies from refilling and selling the cartridges.Mark Lemley, director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science and Technology, said that anyone who refurbished, repaired or resold used products would now be protected from patent infringement claims. The ruling will also prevent manufacturers from forcing consumers to buy supplies only from the original source.\u201cIt\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d Mr. Lemley said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to reduce consumer prices.\u201dLexmark sold the cartridges on the condition that they not be reused after the ink ran out. Impression Products, a small company in Charleston, W.Va., nonetheless bought Lexmark cartridges in the United States and abroad, refurbished and refilled them, and sold them more cheaply than Lexmark does.The appeals court acknowledged that the general rule was that buyers of patented products could do with them what they wished. But it said the conditions Lexmark placed on the sale of its cartridges could be enforced as a matter of patent law for sales in the United States.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for a unanimous Supreme Court on this point, disagreed. He said Lexmark could not use the patent laws to enforce the contractual conditions it placed on the sale of its cartridges. Under the doctrine of \u201cpatent exhaustion,\u201d he wrote, once a patent holder sells an item, it can no longer control the item through the patent laws.\u201cThe purchaser and all subsequent owners are free to use or resell the product just like any other item of personal property, without fear of an infringement lawsuit,\u201d the chief justice wrote.He used an illustration to make the point.\u201cTake a shop that restores and sells used cars,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote. \u201cThe business works because the shop can rest assured that, so long as those bringing in the cars own them, the shop is free to repair and resell those vehicles. That smooth flow of commerce would sputter if companies that make the thousands of parts that go into a vehicle could keep their patent rights after the first sale.\u201dWhile Lexmark turned to the courts to stop the refill companies, HP resorted to technology, such as changing the internal software in the printers to recognize and block the use of unauthorized cartridges.But the court\u2019s decision will have ramifications far beyond ink, particularly for the import and resale of products like smartphones and name-brand drugs.The justices essentially ruled that once products are sold, buyers can do what they want with them unless other laws intervene. In theory, the decision will allow a retailer like Costco Wholesale, which filed a brief for the defendant in the case, to buy high-tech goods at the cheapest price it can find worldwide, bring them to the United States and resell them to customers.The appeals court had also ruled in favor of Lexmark on foreign sales, saying that patent holders could control what was done with their products after they were sold abroad and re-imported by buyers.Chief Justice Roberts again disagreed, writing for the majority that the same basic principles applied. \u201cAn authorized sale outside the United States, just as one within the United States, exhausts all rights under the Patent Act,\u201d he wrote.The ruling on international sales is significant, legal experts said, because companies often sell their products abroad at lower prices on the condition that they will not be imported into the United States.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented from that part of the decision. \u201cPatent law is territorial,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA foreign sale, I would hold, does not exhaust a U.S. inventor\u2019s U.S. patent rights.\u201dJustice Neil M. Gorsuch did not participate in the case, Impression Products v. Lexmark International, No. 15-1189.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fertile Ground of French Communism", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byRed CenturyPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s presidential election this year was exceptional: because of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory, because of the presence of a representative of the far right in the second round, because of the first-round elimination of the two main parties on the right and the left. And also because of the strong showing of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the head of the political movement \u201cFrance Unsubjugated.\u201dMr. M\u00e9lenchon, who also had the support of the French Communist Party, or P.C.F., obtained 19.5 percent of the first-round vote, though he came in fourth and couldn\u2019t participate in the runoff. By refusing to give Mr. Macron (in Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s eyes a contemptible neoliberal) an unequivocal endorsement, though at the same time declaring that Marine Le Pen must be opposed, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon aroused multiple controversies and raised questions about what exactly he stood for. Neither Mr. Macron nor Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the center-right candidate, hesitated: They called him a Communist. The specter of Communism, therefore, has made a sudden return to France in the 21st century.For a large part of the 20th century, the P.C.F. was one of the most powerful forces in French politics. Born in 1920, the P.C.F. was rapidly Bolshevized after the Russian Revolution and submitted to the strict control of the Soviets, whose goal was to make it into a \u201creal\u201d revolutionary party. It achieved its first electoral successes in the 1930s. After its darkest period, from 1939 to 1941, when it was dissolved and suppressed for supporting the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, the party joined the Resistance to the Nazis \u2014 and played a heroic role.Consequently, from 1945 to 1958, the P.C.F. became the No. 1 political party in France, a period when it could count on more than one voter out of every four. Destabilized in 1958 by General de Gaulle\u2019s return to power and the foundation of the Fifth Republic, the Communists nevertheless remained the principal left-wing party in France until the end of the 1970s, when they were overtaken by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s Socialist Party. The P.C.F.\u2019s irresistible decline began in 1981. Today it has been drastically reduced, but the political culture the party formed in the postwar decades has by no means disappeared.In fact, the P.C.F. constituted a powerful counter-society, one that stood apart from the rest of French political and social life without ever being completely cut off from it. The party\u2019s base was principally composed of workers, but also of small farmers, teachers and prestigious intellectuals, like Paul \u00c9luard, Pablo Picasso and Louis Althusser, to name just a few. Having elevated Marxist doctrine to infallible dogma, the P.C.F. derived strength from its ability to arouse passions \u2014 that is, to generate feelings of a quasi-religious nature that in turn led to mass mobilizations.Starting in the mid-1930s and then during and after the Resistance, the P.C.F. endeavored to be at once the herald of internationalism, organized around the absolute primacy of Soviet interests, and the champion of national independence, defined in the party\u2019s terms. It was therefore at pains to reconcile a double allegiance to the Soviet Union and to France, though the former always won out over the latter. The Communists wanted to incarnate France, and beginning in the 1940s they tried in vain to deny De Gaulle a monopoly on the representation of the nation. For the P.C.F., France was a revolutionary nation, built on the tradition of 1789. In the 1970s, the P.C.F. claimed to have created \u201csocialism in French colors.\u201dThis glorification of the nation lies at the origin of the party\u2019s opposition to European integration. Moreover, the P.C.F. saw itself not only as the protector of the working class, but also as the voice of all the ordinary people who opposed capitalism. The party oscillated permanently between a kind of \u201cworkerism\u201d that exalted the worker as the repository of all virtues and a propensity for populism when it tried to address other demographic groups. Ever since the 1970s, the workers\u2019 world has been disappearing under the effects of economic modernization, and the P.C.F. has lost the greater part of its base without being capable of appealing to others.Finally, the P.C.F. has maintained a complex relationship with representative liberal democracy. For a large part of its existence, it was determined to strike down \u201cbourgeois\u201d democracy and install the dictatorship of the proletariat. This objective, along with the party\u2019s ties to the Soviet Union, and its organizational structures, made it a totalitarian and revolutionary movement that hated socialist reforms. Gradually, however, the P.C.F. accepted the rules of democracy, assimilated them \u2014 and has often even contributed to defending them. Nevertheless, it has always maintained a certain inclination toward direct democracy.These days, France\u2019s Communist Party is on its deathbed. After lively internal debates, it supported Mr. M\u00e9lenchon in the presidential election, though it remained wary of him, because of the way he built his movement around his personality and the concern that he wouldn\u2019t subject himself to Party control. But without blinking an eye, the P.C.F. called on its supporters to vote for Mr. Macron, even as it criticized him, in order to oppose Ms. Le Pen, in the tradition of the anti-fascist \u201crepublican front.\u201dBut the legacy the P.C.F. leaves behind is the remains of a certainly deteriorated but nonetheless highly significant left-wing culture based on anticapitalism, anti-fascism, anti-Americanism, anti-colonialism, hostility to reformism and gradualism, the call for revolutionary change, the aspiration to state administration of the economy, the praise of republican sovereignty. It is partly upon this rich soil that Mr. M\u00e9lenchon is thriving today. He denounces the free-market economy, economic liberalism and the United States, and he advocates economic intervention by the state, wants France to leave the European Union, talks about a \u201ccitizens\u2019 revolution,\u201d lays claim to France\u2019s revolutionary and republican heritage. (And he\u2019s even pro-Russia.) He has settled into the space on the radical left that the P.C.F. occupied for nearly 40 years.All in all, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon perpetuates a certain communist tradition, while simultaneously transforming it. This allows him to attract voters who previously voted Communist (few remain), people disappointed by the Socialist Party and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande (much more numerous), as well as young people engaged in their first political experiences \u2014 and often unacquainted with the history of the P.C.F., which was once so powerful in France.Advertisement"}

In these moments, we may stumble upon what the dancer, writer and performance theorist Barbara Browning, in her blithely metafictional third novel, \u201cThe Gift (Or, Techniques of the Body),\u201d refers to as \u201cinappropriate intimacy\u201d \u2014 an accidental partnership or exchange, perhaps uncomfortable, yet full of possibilities. Browning, for her part, relishes the creation of such unusual, erotically charged encounters throughout daily life: email spam, performance art, YouTube videos and academic panels each provide opportunities in \u201cThe Gift\u201d that she seizes with zest. The result is a smart, funny, heartbreaking and often sexy delight of a novel that presses hard against the boundaries of where literary and artistic performances begin and end. Perhaps no surprise from an artist who likes to \u201crecuperate what might appear to be wasted time by thinking of it as conceptual art.\u201d\u201cThe Gift\u201d is narrated by one Barbara Andersen, an artist and professor of performance studies in early 2010s New York and an obvious stand-in for Browning herself. She is, among other things, engaged in a continuing art project that involves recording ukulele covers as unsolicited gifts for strangers and friends. In typical artless fashion, she reasons that her uke covers \u201ccould possibly help jump-start a creative gift economy that would spill over into the larger world of exchange.\u201d In fact, what the project does do is lead her into a longdistance collaboration with Sami, an autistic music virtuoso in Cologne, Germany. This relationship intensifies, via an online exchange of dances and other gifts, into an intimacy mediated by layers of fiction, vulnerability and lies. Before long, Barbara is forced to wonder whether Sami really is who he claims to be, and the novel tumbles toward an emotional climax no less devastating for turning on an arbitrary linguistic quirk. Meanwhile, Barbara lectures on Pussy Riot, tends her ailing mother, leads workshops through the Occupy movement\u2019s Free University and deepens her friendship with a talented trans performance artist whose work concerns \u201ceconomic transactions that make art possible or impossible.\u201dAs author/narrator, Browning/Barbara is delightfully shrewd, if a little daft \u2014 an intellectual with scrupulous ethics and a love of organic wool. One tragicomic set piece has her fretting, at length, over something to do with a perfume called \u201cRealism,\u201d not a quality, as it turns out, that concerns her overmuch. The novel\u2019s events bear an uncertain relationship to life, and all of her characters are apparently versions \u2014 with varying degrees of authenticity \u2014 of actual collaborators, family members, lovers and friends. Some, she writes, gave her input on earlier drafts; some are completely fictional. Such metatextual confessions are, like the rest of the novel, conveyed in a charmingly procedural tone that surprises, at times, with how vulnerable it can be.\u201cMy body is an extension of my body,\u201d Browning writes. The statement has something to do with erogenous zones, something to do with technique, something to do with the way art changes the meaning of things and the ways a person might love. Sometimes, there is no one there to meet the extended hand. Still, as \u201cThe Gift\u201d shows, it\u2019s possible for the reaching itself to act as a down payment on a new economy of pleasure.Jenny Hendrix has written for Slate, The Believer and The Los Angeles Review of Books, among other publications.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Be Great Again, America Needs Immigrants", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byWhat makes America great?The standard answers point to qualities that the United States is said to have in greater abundance than its peers in Europe and Japan. There are the innovations that pour out of Silicon Valley companies and elite universities, the flexibility of a work force relatively unconstrained by union rules, the dynamism of entrepreneurs less hamstrung by an oversize welfare state and of a more mobile population willing to move to where the cutting-edge jobs are mushrooming.In short, the standard innovation theory of American exceptionalism is all about qualities that make each worker more productive. Today, nearly all the economic discussion about how to make America great again focuses on ways \u2014 like cutting red tape and taxes \u2014 to revive flagging productivity growth.Though this discussion remains critically important, it plays down a big shift in the story. The underlying growth potential of any economy is shaped not only by productivity, or output per worker, but also by the number of workers entering the labor force. The growth of the labor force is in turn determined mainly by the number of native-born and immigrant working-age people. Over the last two decades, the United States\u2019 advantage in productivity growth has narrowed sharply, while its population advantages, compared with both Europe and Japan, have essentially held steady.What makes America great is, therefore, less about productivity than about population, less about Google and Stanford than about babies and immigrants.The growing importance of the population race will be very hard for any political leader to fully digest. Every nation prefers to think of itself as productive in the sense of hard-working and smart, not just fertile. But population is where the real action is.Comparing six of the leading developed countries \u2014 the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Britain \u2014 I found that not only has productivity growth been slowing across the board in recent decades, but also that the gaps in productivity growth among these rich nations are narrowing sharply. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, productivity was growing much faster in the United States than in Germany or Japan, but that advantage has largely disappeared in this decade.The reasons for this convergence are complex, possibly having to do with the way production technology now spreads quickly across borders. But this trend spans the developed world, and it basically holds regardless of which two countries you compare, which should raise doubts about how any one country, including the United States, can regain a distinct economic advantage by focusing only on reviving productivity.Which brings us back to babies and immigrants. Like productivity, population growth has been slowing worldwide in recent decades, the big difference being that the gaps among the rich nations are increasingly significant. In the 1960s the United States population growth rate averaged 1.2 percent, or 50 percent higher than Europe\u2019s and about the same as Japan\u2019s. By the late 1960s, population growth peaked worldwide because of the spread of birth control and other cultural shifts, but it has slowed much more gradually in the United States than in its rivals.In the past decade, American population growth has averaged 0.8 percent a year, eight times faster than Europe\u2019s, and Japan\u2019s population has not grown at all. Increasingly, then, the underlying difference between the fast- and slow-growing economies is explained more by the differences in population growth than by productivity. And the United States now relies more than ever on demographics to defend its economic power. In the past decade, population growth, including immigration, has accounted for roughly half of the potential economic growth rate in the United States, compared with just one-sixth in Europe, and none in Japan.Since 2005, per capita gross domestic product has grown on average by 0.6 percent a year in the United States, exactly the same rate as in Japan and virtually the same rate as in the 19 nations of the eurozone. In other words, if it weren\u2019t for the boost from babies and immigrants, the United States economy would look much like those supposed laggards, Europe and Japan.Indeed, if the United States population had been growing as slowly as Japan\u2019s over the last two decades, its share of the global economy would be just 15 percent, not the 25 percent it holds today.Moreover, immigrants make a surprisingly big contribution to population growth. In the United States, immigrants have accounted for a third to nearly a half of population growth for decades. In other countries with Anglo-Saxon roots \u2014 Canada, Australia and Britain \u2014 immigrants have accounted for more than half of population growth over the past decade. Those economies have also been growing faster than their counterparts in the rest of Europe or Japan. But much of that advantage would have disappeared without their population advantage.Politically, the irony of this moment is stark. Population growth is increasingly important as an economic force and is increasingly driven by immigration. Yet now along comes a new breed of nationalists, rising on the strength of their promises to limit immigration. And they have been especially successful in countries where anti-immigrant sentiment has run strong, including the United States and Britain.Immigration has been expanding the United States population at a rate of about one million people a year over the last decade. It\u2019s not clear exactly how much President Trump\u2019s policies will reduce the net flow of immigrants, given that he has yet to articulate a broad-based immigration program. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has been more explicit, promising to cut the net inflow to the \u201csustainable level\u201d of under 100,000 immigrants a year, down from an average of 250,000 in the last decade. For these leaders, delivering on these anti-immigrant messages may now be politically imperative, but it will seriously handicap their economies in the global growth sweepstakes.History is littered with examples of emerging nations that have failed to generate enough jobs for a booming young population. But virtually no nation has ever sustained rapid economic growth without strong population growth. And at a time when every major country including the United States faces continued decline in population growth, workers are an increasingly precious source of national economic strength.In the long run, governments have limited avenues to increase the growth rate of the labor force, which is unaffected by short-term fluctuations in unemployment. Even enticing the \u201cforgotten men\u201d \u2014 those no longer looking for work \u2014 back into the labor force can have only limited impact. The main reason fewer Americans participate in the labor force is not because they are discouraged, but because they are getting older.In recent decades nations from Australia to France to Singapore have foreseen the looming economic impact of slower population growth, offering families \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d to have more kids \u2014 but typically with little impact on the birthrate or the economy. The impulse to procreate may be one of the few areas of human endeavor that remains beyond the reach of government mandarins. In contrast, regulating immigration remains a relatively simple task, and if immigrants are properly assimilated, they can have an immediate impact on the size of the work force.It would be unrealistic to imagine that hard economic logic will turn the anti-global, anti-foreign tide any time soon. So the likely result is that the United States and Britain will go ahead and limit immigration. To the extent they do \u2014 and their rivals do not \u2014 they will undermine their key economic edge, and cede much of the growth advantage they have enjoyed over Europe and Japan.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Health and Welfare, Moral Arguments Can Outweigh Economics", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBut the judgment of who is deserving \u2014 as opposed to what is most effective \u2014 is at heart a moral one.In pushing for repeal of the Affordable Care Act last week, Mr. Brooks, an Alabama Republican, suggested that people with pre-existing conditions deserved to pay higher premiums, because they had not \u201cdone things the right way.\u201d That could include a cigarette smoker\u2019s lung cancer \u2014 or a newborn\u2019s congenital heart disease.The same theme of who is deserving surfaces in tax debates. Conservatives often argue that the wealthy deserve the biggest cuts because they contribute the most in taxes \u2014 and, besides, they create jobs. Liberals argue the opposite, noting that the top 10 percent reaped nearly all of the gains in income since the recession ended.House Republicans initially proposed that only people who work should be eligible for publicly funded health insurance. And now a handful of states, like Arkansas, Maine and Wisconsin, are pushing to institute such requirements on their own.Suspicions about freeloaders have reliably shoved the question to the center of health and welfare policy, engaging both Democrats and Republicans.Yet as earnings for many working-class families have stagnated or stumbled despite nearly eight years of recovery, resentment about the size and cost of the social safety net has grown. That fed the wave of anger that helped propel President Trump into the White House. The greatest disdain is directed toward adults who seem capable of working.The mentally ill, older adults and disabled people can do little to take care of themselves, Mr. Carson said, but \u201cthere is another group of people who are able-bodied individuals, and I think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them.\u201d\u201cRyan revived the idea that these programs hurt people rather than help them, that dependency is bad,\u201d said Robert A. Moffitt, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University.Yet defining public assistance as inherently counterproductive denies the possibility that there may be a trade-off between values and effectiveness.Both liberal and conservative researchers agree that tax credits, food stamps, child care support and Medicaid reduce hunger, illness and poverty among the poorest Americans.\u201cThat\u2019s tripe,\u201d said Mr. Haskins, who was also a senior adviser on welfare policy to President George W. Bush.Mr. Haskins is a longtime advocate of work requirements, but he argues that ethics and effectiveness mean the government should not \u201cnot take anybody\u2019s benefits completely away without actually offering them a job.\u201dThat piece is crucial, but he sees little support in Congress for funding such initiatives. \u201cWe\u2019re just not trying hard to do it,\u201d he said.America\u2019s secular and spiritual traditions both embody the notion. The American dream is based on the idea that hard work will result in success. Failure is in the hands of individuals, leaving citizens to feel less responsibility to offer help.The notion of just deserts has deep roots in the Bible, based on the assumption that God rewards the good and punishes the wicked. Though modern medicine and the germ theory of disease have largely severed the link between goodness and health, the nexus with material wealth remains.\u201cWinning to him also equates to good,\u201d Ms. White said of Mr. Trump, \u201cand good equates to God.\u201dEvangelical adherents to the prosperity gospel turned out to be reliable Trump voters on Election Day. A close analysis of poverty statistics over the past half-century, though, shows that two-thirds of all Americans received some kind of income-based benefits over their lifetime, like food stamps, disability payments or Medicaid, Mr. Rank said.\u201cAre we going to make the argument that all these folks are undeserving?\u201d he said.\u201cRather than an individual problem, this is a systemic problem,\u201d he said. In the case of the economy, that means shifting attention from who lost to why the system produces so many losers in the first place. (Perhaps because of a shortage of well-paying jobs or insufficient wage growth.)\u201cThat shifts from this idea of the deserving and the undeserving,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different framework.\u201dA news analysis article on Monday about policy debates on social issues like health care and hunger misidentified the administration in which Ron Haskins, who commented on the war on poverty, was an adviser.

{"Headline": "In Venezuela, Goldman Sachs Found a Hot Deal and a Moral Mess", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIf a deal looks too good to be true, it may just be. Money managers at Goldman Sachs bought $2.8 billion face value of Petroleos de Venezuela bonds at a deep discount last week, attracting the ire of critics of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Investments aren\u2019t necessarily moral choices, but they can hit reputations.Venezuela could, on paper, be one of the soundest emerging-market credits, given that it has the world\u2019s largest oil and gas reserves. But the economy has been in precipitous decline since Mr. Maduro succeeded Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013. Output has fallen by nearly a third over the past three years, and inflation is projected to exceed 1,000 percent by the end of this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Bare shelves and angry protests met with violence have become the norm.The country\u2019s opposition is angry that Goldman has, in effect, made life easier for the central bank \u2014 the previous owner of the state-controlled Petroleos de Venezuela bonds \u2014 thereby propping up Mr. Maduro\u2019s regime. The Wall Street firm, however, says it bought the block of bonds, priced at about 31 cents on the dollar, through a broker and did not interact directly with the government.It would, however, be surprising if Goldman\u2019s asset managers did not understand where the securities were coming from. While Venezuelan debt is a component of the most widely tracked emerging-market bond benchmark, JPMorgan\u2019s EMBI Global Diversified index, and many investors hold it, these particular Petroleos de Venezuela bonds are different. Maturing in 2022, they are not in the index because they are not publicly held, according to JPMorgan. The face amount bought represents more than 90 percent of the $3 billion issue, according to Thomson Reuters data.Goldman may earn a hefty profit if the Venezuelan economy bounces back. As with other controversial transactions, though, such gains may come at a cost. The bank earned extraordinary fees underwriting bond deals for 1Malaysia Development, known as 1MDB, earlier this decade. The Justice Department and Swiss authorities are currently investigating allegations of fraud and money laundering at Malaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The bank also took heat from European authorities for arranging currency swaps that helped Greece mask borrowing ahead of its debt crisis.With that track record, Goldman can\u2019t be accused of na\u00efvet\u00e9. By now, the firm ought to have a better nose for a problematic deal.Advertisement"}

An Islamic bookstore faces a Jamaican supermarket. The air carries the sweet scent of shisha, emanating from cafes named after Damascus and Dubai. The food is from Tunisia, Vietnam and all points in between. These few blocks contain a whole world.And part of that world are the 10,000 or so Libyans in Manchester, the largest community outside Libya. Many arrived here to escape Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s brutal regime and have been here for decades, a quiet presence in the city, well woven into Manchester\u2019s fabric.He attacked not just a concert venue. He attacked a city and its sense of self as the proudly cosmopolitan, multicultural capital of northern England.The Manchester still reeling from Monday night\u2019s terrorist attack is not the decaying postindustrial wasteland of the 1970s. Nor is it the Ecstasy-fueled party city that emerged a decade later, or the gang-ridden gun crime capital of Britain that lodged itself in the popular imagination at the turn of the century.It is none of those things and all of those things. It is the gleaming glass towers of Spinningfields and the hipster bars of the Northern Quarter, the leafy suburbs of Chorlton and Didsbury, the high-rises of Hulme and the uneasy, red brick streets of Moss Side.It is a city of 530,000 people \u2014 in a metropolitan area of 2.5 million \u2014 many of them now wondering whether the city really is the exotic, polyglot, polychrome place they believe it to be. It is smaller than London, of course, and perhaps not as rich or as sophisticated, or as famous, but no less confident or international.As graffiti on a disused rail depot not far from Piccadilly train station has it, Manchester sees itself as \u201ca haven for heathens, hoodies and hipsters, hijabis and Hebrews, highbrow intellectuals and however-you-sexuals \u2026 it\u2019s home to all.\u201dIt is that open-mindedness that first brought Libyans here, in search of their own haven. \u201cPeople often call it Libya\u2019s second capital,\u201d said Hashem Ben Ghalbon, a Libyan who has lived here since 1976 and who was, for decades, one of the leading figures in the dissident movement based in Manchester after escaping Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s rule.When he first came, he said, he found \u201cno more than a hundred\u201d of his countrymen.\u201cIf you go to the hospital up the road, there will be Libyan doctors,\u201d said Saif Eddin, who moved to England from Libya 12 years ago and has spent the last decade in Manchester. \u201cIf you get a coffee at Costa Coffee or Caffe Nero, the guy serving you will be Libyan. There are lots of Libyans who work at Manchester Airport. If you go to the immigration office, the woman who works there, she\u2019s Libyan.\u201dHe works in a Lebanese restaurant called Beirut on the Curry Mile. There are no Libyan restaurants or bars nearby, nor are there shops or community centers dotted around the city \u2014 no physical sign at all, in fact, of a thriving expatriate culture.\u201cThere are a lot of us here, but we don\u2019t live in the same place, like the Jewish community,\u201d said Tariq Olilish, 18, a native Libyan raised in Manchester.Mr. Ben Ghalbon suggested that could be explained by the circumstances of their arrival. Like him, many who came to Manchester were dissidents fleeing Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s repression.They came, he said, because it was \u201ccheaper than London, life was not so fast, but it was still cosmopolitan and welcoming,\u201d and it became a hive of anti-Qaddafi activity. Mr. Ben Ghalbon and his brother, Mohamed, founded the Libyan Constitutional Union, an activist group dedicated to Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s removal and the restoration of Libya\u2019s Constitution.Among the exiles, though, there were countless schisms. Mr. Ben Ghalbon said some were \u201cmore religious\u201d than others, and some had differing tribal loyalties. \u201cWe were not well integrated among ourselves,\u201d he said.Even like-minded dissidents were afraid to congregate, unsure who was a fellow traveler and who was a secret agent for Colonel Qaddafi. For \u201csecurity,\u201d Mr. Ben Ghalbon said, it was better to stay apart, to blend in and to disappear.Until Monday night, most believed it had worked. \u201cWe have been here since the 1960s,\u201d Mr. Eddin said. \u201cWhen did you ever hear about anything like this?\u201dMr. Olilish, sitting outside his home in Longsight, east of Rusholme, says he believes his generation is \u201cwell integrated.\u201d \u201cIt is not like London,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody asks you where you\u2019re from. It doesn\u2019t matter when or how you arrived. If you live here, people treat you like a local.\u201dThe people of Manchester, Mancunians \u2014 derived from Mancunium, the Latin name for the Roman settlement here \u2014 are \u201ca family,\u201d he said.There is embarrassment among the Libyans here that \u201cone of our own,\u201d as Mr. Olilish put it, carried out the atrocity. Mr. Eddin said he could understand why the city, and the country, might feel as though they had \u201cdone someone a favor and been kicked in the face.\u201dMr. Olilish described the people of Manchester as kind and tolerant, saying he always felt part of the community and never felt discriminated against.In the aftermath of the attack, even he fears the dynamics of the city could change. He decided against attending the vigil on Tuesday for the victims because \u201cpeople are rightly angry and upset, and I did not want to see that.\u201dThat is not the Manchester that either the city or its appalled, grieving Libyan population recognizes. \u201cThe people who have come here have always found Manchester welcoming and accepting of foreigners,\u201d Mr. Ben Ghalbon said. \u201cThat is the Mancunian way.\u201dThat open-mindedness has remained unchanged, even as the city\u2019s outward appearance, and its public perception, have shifted over the decades the Libyans have been here.When Mr. Ben Ghalbon came, in the 1970s, Manchester was in the grip of seemingly endemic urban decay, polluted and hopeless, described by the music journalist Paul Morley as a \u201cvery boring place to be.\u201dBy the time Mr. Olilish came, in 2002, it was Britain\u2019s party town, known as Madchester, home of the Hacienda nightclub and the gay bars of Canal Street, the Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays.It remodeled itself after 1996, when a devastating truck bombing by the Irish Republican Army obliterated parts of the city center and shook the area to its core. In the early years of the 21st century, it recovered from a spate of spiraling gun crime \u2014 Madchester becoming Gunchester \u2014 to become a byword for urban regeneration.When the British government announced its plan, in 2010, to build a \u201cNorthern Powerhouse\u201d to rebalance the country\u2019s economy away from London, Manchester sat at its center.This time, the damage to the city is emotional more than structural.\u201cI don\u2019t think things are ever going to be the same, not after this,\u201d said Hamza Aberid, 15, a Libyan student at the Abraham Moss Community School. \u201cEveryone at school is down; no one is going out. People are scared it\u2019s going to happen somewhere else.\u201dYet, in the days after the attack, the first shoots of a new civic identity have emerged to match the glimmering cityscape Manchester seems to be developing, one proud not just of what the city once was but what it has become: a multicultural melting pot, open to all, a Rusholme on a grand scale.At a vigil held on Tuesday, the local poet Tony Walsh, known as Longfella, read his poem \u201cThis Is the Place.\u201d\u201cAnd there\u2019s hard times again on these streets of our city,\u201d Mr. Walsh read. \u201cBut we don\u2019t take defeat and we don\u2019t want your pity, because this is a place where we stand strong together, with a smile on our face, Mancunians forever.\u201dAn article on Friday about the Libyan community in Manchester misstated part of the surname of a leader of the former Libyan dissident movement there. He is Hashem Ben Ghalbon, not Ben Ghosal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Chinese Tourism Down, Taiwan Looks to Lure Visitors From Southeast Asia", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported by\u201cBeijing has used Chinese tour groups as both carrots and sticks,\u201d said Ian Rowen, an assistant professor of geography at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, who is writing a book on Chinese tourism.Ms. Tsai has held her ground, however, and demonstrated that a declining number of Chinese tourists can be offset, to some extent, with visitors from other Asian markets.Figures from the first three months of this year show, however, that while Southeast Asian arrivals exceeded 478,000, up 36 percent from the same period in 2016, the number of Chinese visitors continued to drop, by 42 percent, to just under 660,000. This pulled down total arrivals by 10 percent in the first quarter, putting pressure on Taiwan to attract more visitors from other Asian countries.The tourism component of the policy has focused on making it easier for Southeast Asians to come to Taiwan; visa requirements have been relaxed, new air routes have opened, and announcements at some train stations are made in Indonesian, Thai and Vietnamese. The number of Southeast Asian visitors is expected to rise further when Taiwan extends visa-free entry to the Philippines, most likely this year, as happened with Thailand in August.\u201cThe economies of Southeast Asian countries are growing very quickly, and their middle classes are expanding rapidly,\u201d Mr. Tsai said.That is reason enough to pursue new markets, he said, but avoiding an overreliance on China is also important, he said, citing the experiences of South Korea and Hong Kong.Until last year, the agency\u2019s Southeast Asian customers mostly lived and worked in major Chinese cities. But now, clients are coming directly from Vietnam and Thailand, he said, spending as much as $400 per person a day, excluding accommodations.\u201cThey\u2019re really, really high end,\u201d he said.Providing a high level of service can be a challenge, primarily because of linguistic considerations, he said. Most clients based in mainland China speak Mandarin and English, his company\u2019s core languages. As a result, the company needs local partners in Indonesia, Thailand or Vietnam, whereas the high level of English proficiency in the Philippines makes that market more accessible.Government overtures under the New Southbound Policy are complementing efforts by companies in Taiwan to draw Southeast Asian visitors. Cheng Ying-huei, deputy director of the Tourism Bureau\u2019s International Affairs Division, said the government had been promoting Taiwan through on-the-ground and digital marketing, and had offered subsidies to tour group agents. The bureau also plans to open an office in Bangkok this year, she said.One possible benefit of shifting toward more Southeast Asian tourists and putting less of a focus on Chinese tour groups is that more money could stay in Taiwan, Mr. Rowen, the tourism researcher, suggested.Mr. Rowen, who traveled to Taiwan from China in an organized group as part of his research, said that such tours are highly structured, with \u201cmandatory prearranged shopping stops and rushed site visits.\u201d\u201cTourists have little choice but to comply with their local tour operator\u2019s selection of hotels and restaurants,\u201d he added.How much of the spending by Chinese groups remains with Chinese companies remains unclear, but suspicions run deep in Taiwan that local businesses may not be the main beneficiaries.\u201cThe vast majority of industry insiders I\u2019ve interviewed \u2014 even those who have championed tourism from China \u2014 are certain that hotels, transport companies and shopping destinations have been penetrated, if not dominated outright, by Chinese capital,\u201d Mr. Rowen said. \u201cBut given opaque ownership structures and local partners, it\u2019s difficult to demonstrate the veracity of such claims.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Tens of millions of Trump opponents cannot communicate with tens of millions of his supporters. There is no viable vocabulary. There is no shared reality.This is the chasm to which Fox News, Republican debunking of reason and science, herd-reinforcing social media algorithms, liberal arrogance, rightist bigotry, and an economy of growing inequality have ushered us.In New York you never need encounter a Trump supporter. But in Colorado, neither red nor blue but purple, it\u2019s impossible to evade difficult conversations that cut across political lines.

The liberal complacency that holds that these people simply need to be \u201ceducated\u201d is self-defeating. If that\u2019s what the Democratic Party exudes \u2014 coastal complacency \u2014 it will lose, just like Ms. Clinton did last year.As Abe Streep, a journalist and writer based in Montana, put it to me: \u201cNobody\u2019s ever been convinced by being made to feel stupid.\u201d\u201cYou have to be more receptive and see where people who don\u2019t think like you come from,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people are concerned about climate change.

Instead of talking about sustainability and climate change \u2014 words that set them off \u2014 talk pragmatically about drought conservation plans. Persuade them that increasing irrigation efficiency at a time of the longest drought in recorded history on the Colorado River System benefits everyone from farms to downstream city users. It\u2019s doable. But you have to curb the liberal arrogance that\u2019s out there.\u201dAmerica needs the conversations it\u2019s not having. They start, for both sides, with listening.

He spoke hours before the expiration of a deadline for online registration for the meeting, which will be held from May 22 to 31.Mr. Hsu and his colleagues are fighting an uphill battle against Beijing.Since President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan took office a year ago, China has worked to suppress Taiwan\u2019s participation in global aviation and policing organizations, and has lured away another of its diplomatic allies.Beijing, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has vowed to annex it by force if necessary, seeks to pressure Ms. Tsai into accepting the so-called 1992 Consensus, which holds that there is only one \u201cChina,\u201d encompassing the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, although each side has its own interpretation of what that means. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council \u2014 a seat once held by Taiwan \u2014 China has considerable sway over the World Health Organization, the United Nations agency that convenes the World Health Assembly.\u201cIt is clear to everyone on which side the blame lies,\u201d Mr. Zhang told reporters in Jiangsu Province. Ms. Tsai has not shown any inclination to yield to China\u2019s demands.In recent days, she has campaigned on Twitter, making a case for observer status for Taiwan at this year\u2019s meeting by sharing stories about Taiwanese doctors helping with health programs in countries including Vietnam and Burkina Faso. Taiwan had been a World Health Assembly observer since 2009.Taiwan is the size of Kentucky, but its population is larger than Australia\u2019s and it has the world\u2019s 22nd-largest economy. Its extensive transport and trade links to the rest of the world make it particularly relevant in the case of global epidemics.China has worked persistently to block opportunities for Taiwan to participate in any events that could offer it international visibility or influence. Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, lost its membership in the United Nations in 1971, when the mainland People\u2019s Republic of China took over the seat.In November, the global police organization Interpol rejected Taiwanese participation in its general assembly. In December, the tiny nation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe announced that it would cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan and recognize China, leaving Taipei with only 21 diplomatic allies.An article on Tuesday about Taiwan\u2019s efforts to gain inclusion in the World Health Assembly\u2019s annual meeting misstated the year the United Nations ejected Taiwan, known formally as the Republic of China, and turned its former seat over to the People\u2019s Republic of China instead.

It spends the most on campaign contributions, has the largest army of lobbyists and has the biggest pile of chits among lawmakers to try to protect its own interests.Nearly every week that Congress is in session, the industry holds fund-raisers at private clubs and restaurants to help bankroll the re-election campaigns of its allies. One former lobbyist for PhRMA recently boasted that he had once organized six fund-raising events in a two-day period. (He asked that he not be named because the fund-raising efforts are supposed to be confidential.)In late April, for example, a PhRMA Industry Breakfast was hosted for Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, at the National Republican Club of Capitol Hill, a members-only hot spot across the street from the Capitol.A spokesman for Mr. Shimkus said his actions were intended to protect cancer patients \u2014 pointing to a clinic in his district he said might close if the Medicare program had gone into effect \u2014 not the pharmaceutical industry.But other participants said industry influence \u2014 as drug companies attempted to preserve their bottom line \u2014 had played a decisive role.\u201cWhen we first proposed this, people were warning me, \u2018Be careful, everybody on K Street is going to be gunning for you now,\u2019 and I did not really know what they meant,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, a top Obama administration official who pushed the prescription drug price experiment. \u201cNow I know. When you take on pharma, you take on this whole town.\u201dStephen J. Ubl, the chief executive of PhRMA, acknowledged that his group had been \u201cvery engaged\u201d in defending his member companies\u2019 interests, and blamed a few bad actors \u2014 not his own members \u2014 for the public\u2019s disapproval.The pharmacy benefit managers are giants themselves. Two of the biggest, Express Scripts and CVS Health, which are among the nation\u2019s 50 largest companies, have initiated their own counteroffensive.The memo bragged about the group\u2019s courting of senior Trump administration officials. It also said it had met with Capitol Hill staff members and lawmakers, formed a partnership with conservative advocacy groups and created an advertising campaign called \u201cDrug Benefit Solutions.\u201dLast month, the group hosted several hundred government officials and other industry players at a fancy \u201cpolicy forum\u201d a few blocks from the Capitol, where it detailed just why its members were \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to save consumers money.A smaller war is playing out between pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacists, confrontations that have included covert operations.When the independent pharmacists descended on Capitol Hill in late April, they came with a brochure depicting benefit managers as sharp-toothed dogs, grabbing bags of money.Yet even as they walked the halls, a group calling itself Ask Your Independent Pharmacist sent a blast email to some of the same lawmakers the pharmacists had just met with. \u201cWhose interests are they on the Hill to champion \u2014 the pharmacist\u2019s pocketbook or the patients they claim to serve?\u201d an email asked.When The New York Times called a public relations firm, Kivvit, which operates out of an address listed on the email, staff members repeatedly hung up when asked who had paid for the message. After a reporter called the firm\u2019s Chicago headquarters, Tracy Schmaler, a Justice Department aide in the Obama administration who now works at Kivvit, responded: Express Scripts had paid for the message.Jonah Houts, the head of government affairs at Express Scripts, said the company\u2019s role as a middleman drew fire from all sides.\u201cWe were designed to create tension,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re successful at what we do, and that\u2019s why we want to make sure the lawmakers who are considering legislation that affects us understand that.\u201dThe generics industry has also come under attack. Though its drugs are generally cheap, some have also risen sharply in price, and prosecutors have been investigating claims of price-fixing by some of the largest players, including Mylan.Mr. Doggett, the Texas Democrat, said the industry war was in some ways a positive sign.\u201cWe have moved from \u2018There is no problem\u2019 to \u2018It\u2019s not my fault,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt begins to focus attention on what so many of my constituents already know the problem is, which is price gouging.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The director, Hugh Ross, adds a soup\u00e7on of farce to the percolating proceedings, keeping his busy cast on point.Throughout, Priestley gently reminds us of the ephemerality of affluence in a teetering economy.

In part, he owes his 17 years leading Russia as either president or prime minister to the fact that he defeated a domestic insurgency in Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus by branding it as part of the global war on terrorism and flattening the place. Although Al Qaeda was almost certainly active in Chechnya, no one outside Russia paid much attention to Mr. Putin\u2019s warnings about extremism there \u2014 until after the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.His antiterrorism campaign is central to his grand overall strategy of restoring Russia to the superpower status it enjoyed in Soviet times.Yet given the whims of Mr. Trump, Mr. Trudolyubov and others said, it is unclear that such cooperation will endure. The unexpected manner in which the information was shared makes it difficult to assess whether it reflects a permanent shift in course.\u201cIt is not something that Russia can rely on, because Trump changes like the weather,\u201d Mr. Trudolyubov said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of victory that you do not really want if you want orderly policy cooperation.\u201dThroughout his campaign, Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would work more closely with Russia, and this latest episode could indicate that he is following through.Although Moscow asserted that chasing Islamist militants from the ancient ruins of Palmyra \u2014 twice \u2014 proved that it was defending civilized Western values, Russian firepower has largely been focused against the uprising confronting Mr. Assad.Outside of the Islamic State, a shared definition of who constitutes a terrorist in Syria does not exist, and the Pentagon has been leery about cooperation.\u201cThe problem is that both Russia and the U.S. mean different things when they talk about the fight against terrorism in Syria,\u201d said Ivan Kurilla, an expert on Russian-American relations at the European University at St. Petersburg. \u201cThe question is whether they will try to bridge the gap in their understanding.\u201dIn addition, it is taken as a given in Russia that whatever Mr. Trump wants, the real establishment in Washington will put a stop to it if it clashes with its interests. \u201cIt is not a question of whether Trump wants to or not, it is a question of whether Trump can or not,\u201d said Sergei A. Markov, a political analyst close to the Kremlin.Still, disparaging asides about Mr. Trump that had been creeping into official newscasts will most likely vanish.\u201cI would expect the Russians will now stop criticizing Mr. Trump as they have done during the last month or so,\u201d Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, the director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email.Even if the Kremlin has reason to be pleased with the latest episode, Mr. Putin and the Russian government prefer that policy changes happen in an orderly, choreographed manner.If the United States and Russia are to forge genuine new cooperation on terrorism, analysts said, Russia would prefer that it emerge from a meeting between the two presidents, scheduled for July, not via Twitter and confusing, contradictory denials in Washington.In any case, the Oval Office episode was not big news in Russia, where the main headline of the day was Ukraine\u2019s shutting down key Russian social media and information sites, including Vkontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and Yandex, Russia\u2019s version of Google.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, dismissed the reports from the White House. \u201cFor us, this is not a subject,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis is the latest nonsense.\u201dFew here accept the idea, at least publicly, that Russia helped Mr. Trump by stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee, even if Russia has clearly stated that conducting hybrid information warfare is important to achieving its strategic goals.One of those goals is undermining the Western institutions that oppose it. Whether anyone accepts that idea or not, there is glee in some quarters in Moscow at the confusion in the American capital.\u201cOf course, from Moscow, we look at this chaos with a bit of a smile,\u201d Mr. Markov said. \u201cSo many Americans used to look at the chaos in Russia that way. It is a kind of psychological revenge.\u201dAmerican officials preoccupied with domestic problems will also have less time to meddle in Russian affairs, he added.Most Russians expect that the United States will endure given the strength of its institutions, its economy and its overall resources. Some wonder, however, if the dysfunction at the White House will descend to the level that paralyzed the Kremlin in the worst, last days of the Soviet Union, or even to that of pre-Putin Russia.There were sarcastic remarks regarding the White House in a commentary on Channel One, a state-run television station, during a news program on Sunday.\u201cThe new action-packed series, tentatively titled \u2018Secrets of Trump\u2019s Oval Office,\u2019 becomes more fascinating every day,\u201d said a commentator named Evgeny Baranov. \u201cRussia\u2019s footprint, that is in one way or another present in each new episode, only enhances the intrigues of this bold plotline.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ricky Gunawan, the basketball coach at Harapan Bangsa Institute of Technology, said LIMA had already improved competitions by ensuring that students actually attended the universities they represent.\u201cOver time, universities are investing more in their sports programs because they see the names of their universities promoted at the national stage\u201d when they succeed in a national LIMA tournament, he said.\u201cWe have 250 million people, and a genius is one in a million,\u201d Gozali said. Yet Indonesia\u2019s men\u2019s soccer team is ranked just 177th \u2014 out of 211 \u2014 in the world.\u201cI\u2019m a statistics guy,\u201d he lamented. \u201cI just don\u2019t accept that fact.\u201dIn its first year, 2012, around 2,000 student-athletes participated in LIMA competitions. Last year, Gozali said that number was about 5,000.But Indonesia\u2019s challenges to fielding competitive national teams, and producing top athletes, go deeper than a lack of training and development opportunities. Cities in this fast-urbanizing nation are crowded, hot and lacking in park space, meaning that residents have few places to play, or even to exercise. Limited sidewalk space and public transit options mean Indonesians travel mainly by car and motorbike, compounding the lack of national fitness.LIMA developed from the efforts of private investors to develop university sports leagues. When LIMA was created, Gozali, its chief executive, combined the separate sports leagues into a single one, with the backing of initial investors. As a result, Gozali is expanding his sports programs into more corners of this ethnically and religiously diverse nation of 13,000 islands. This year, the LIMA badminton competition is limited to athletes from Indonesia\u2019s central islands of Java and Bali, but next year teams from Sumatra and Sulawesi will participate, too.Gozali, a paunchy Chinese-Indonesian with a penchant for American hamburgers, is perhaps an unlikely apostle for sports and fitness. Raised in Jakarta, he and his family fled the city in the dark of night two decades ago, during the 1998 Asian financial crisis, after rioters blaming Chinese businessmen for the downturn burned Jakarta\u2019s ethnic Chinese areas.Gozali finished high school in Singapore before heading to California for college. After graduating from the University of California, Irvine, he worked in banking and biotech. But after falling hard for American sports culture, he left that work to indulge his passion for athletics.In San Francisco, Gozali began working 16-hour days, commuting from a business development job that included work with clients like the N.B.A. and the World Tennis Association to shifts as a manager of a local sports club. \u201cAnything I could get my hands on,\u201d he said.In 2011, he decided to return to Jakarta, where opportunity beckoned.\u201cIn America, it\u2019s a mature sport market \u2014 I can do a good job but I won\u2019t make much of a dent,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Indonesia, it\u2019s like the wild, wild West, looking for the gold rush.\u201dHis sports league has expanded quickly. This year, Gozali negotiated a television rights contract with Metro TV, one of Indonesia\u2019s largest broadcasters, and he said LIMA\u2019s revenue is already about $1 million a year. The league is already profitable, he added, but he is hoping the television deal \u2014 along with ticket sales and added corporate sponsorships \u2014 will guarantee its long-term survival.Gozali said there were still people in the country who want Chinese-Indonesians like him to be \u201csecond-class citizens.\u201d But he also argued that sports were one way to heal racial tensions.The challenge, he said, provides him with a sense of purpose. \u201cJohn F. Kennedy is like, \u2018I\u2019m going to put a man on the moon,\u2019\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cMy life goal is to see Indonesia qualify for the World Cup.\u201dOn a recent Sunday, that quest placed Gozali in the stands at a South Jakarta sports complex, watching dueling college badminton teams. The match in front of him was a game with three players to a side \u2014 an innovative arrangement that he introduced, and that he hopes will speed up play and make badminton more exciting for TV audiences.Jakarta\u2019s badminton stadiums are often sweltering, as all windows in the building must be closed to prevent the wind from interfering with play. Though it was just a qualifying match for the national tournament, college-age fans lined the bleachers, wiping their brows and calling out in triumph after every point won.With extra players on each team and amateur talent everywhere, it was a long way from a world-class exhibition. But that did not matter to Gozali. For him, this remains merely the start of a long journey.\u201cWe\u2019re on the fifth year and the N.C.A.A. has been around 111 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can cut us some slack.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Candidate\u2019s Call to Save \u2018Canadian Values\u2019? Un-Canadian, Critics Say", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byTo Kellie Leitch, one of more than a dozen candidates vying to lead Canada\u2019s Conservative Party, the most pressing issue today is something that some of her critics consider un-Canadian: the need to preserve what she calls \u201cCanadian values\u201d through a more restrictive immigration policy.Whether she wins the race or not \u2014 the position is to be announced on Saturday \u2014 she has set off a debate that is not likely to go away.Ms. Leitch has proposed screening would-be immigrants to weed out those who lack the values she says characterize Canadian society \u2014 in her words, \u201cequality of men and women, freedom of religion, and equality of all under the law.\u201d\u201cPeople who do not agree with these values will not be allowed into the country,\u201d Ms. Leitch said in a recent interview. \u201cSome people will be turned away.\u201d\u201cWe need to build a modern and inclusive Conservative Party that focuses squarely on pocketbook issues that matter to Canadians, and not on issues that pit one Canadian against another,\u201d said Michael Chong, one of her rivals in the Conservative race, in a statement last year criticizing Ms. Leitch\u2019s Canadian values campaign.For decades, Canada has embraced immigration as a way to help its economy grow and to expand the country\u2019s place in the world. In 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party won on strong support for multicultural immigration policies.Immigration levels for 2016 were raised to 300,000 from 250,000 and kept there for 2017 without any significant national debate. New arrivals now add more than 1 percent to the country\u2019s population each year, one of the highest rates in the industrialized world.The immigration policy has been broadly embraced by a majority of Canadians. But social scientists say the views expressed by Ms. Leitch could gain traction as the county\u2019s demographic shift accelerates. Some polls show support for a values test like the one Ms. Leitch proposes.\u201cThe media establishment is very quick to say that what she is doing is un-Canadian, even though they know that on the ground there are many, many Canadians \u2014 in the case of some polls, the majority of Canadians \u2014 who agree with her,\u201d said Ricardo Duchesne, a sociology professor at the University of New Brunswick.Ms. Leitch, 46, is a pediatric orthopedic surgeon who grew up in Manitoba and now represents an Ontario district in Parliament. She has been active in Conservative Party politics since her teenage years and served in two ministerial posts in the government of the Conservative prime minister who preceded Mr. Trudeau, Stephen Harper.Her national profile crystallized during the 2015 federal election campaign, when she became her party\u2019s loudest voice opposing the Liberal Party\u2019s stance on immigration. She promised that if her party won, the government would establish an anonymous hotline for reporting forced and underage marriages and practices that had been made illegal by an act of Parliament. Her argument was that members of conservative immigrant communities are otherwise reluctant to go to the police.The country was already in a heated national debate about the Conservative Party\u2019s effort to prevent a Muslim woman from wearing a face-covering veil while swearing the oath of citizenship, and the hotline idea was quickly attacked as a clumsy election-year stunt meant to appeal to anti-immigration voters. Many people believe those two issues cost the Conservatives the election, and Ms. Leitch later said she regretted making the hotline promise.\u201cIn Canadian society, men and women are equal, little girls are not forced into marriages,\u201d Ms. Leitch said.Her solution is for immigration officers to include a discussion of Canadian values in interviews with prospective immigrants. People who do not embrace those values, she says, would be turned away. \u201cPeople coming here should become part of our value set, not try to change it,\u201d she said.Critics also argue that values are a private matter and that, in any case, new immigrants and longtime citizens alike must obey the country\u2019s laws.\u201cSome of the concern is that people with the wrong values will not obey the law,\u201d said Jeffrey G. Reitz, a University of Toronto sociology professor. \u201cBut the evidence shows that far from being resistant to change, the attitudes and behaviors of these immigrant groups do move toward the mainstream.\u201dProfessor Reitz said that while Ms. Leitch\u2019s proposals might resonate with some people, there are practical difficulties in defining values in concrete terms and actually deciding whether a particular person sufficiently conforms with those values.He agreed there should be a debate. But he also said Ms. Leitch and her supporters should produce evidence that a significant number of immigrants harbor un-Canadian values, and give specific examples of those that should be screened out in a test.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberals Wanted a Fight in Montana. Democratic Leaders Saw a Lost Cause.", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byThe margin in this race was relatively small in a state that Mr. Trump carried by more than 20 percentage points last year. But Mr. Quist\u2019s defeat disappointed grass-roots Democrats who financed nearly his entire campaign while the national party declined to spend heavily on what it considered, from the outset, an all-but-lost cause in daunting political territory.This tension \u2014 between party leaders who will not compete for seats they think they cannot win and an energized base loath to concede any contests to Republicans \u2014 risks demoralizing activists who keep getting their hopes up. It also points to a painful reality for Democrats: Despite the boiling fury on the left, the resistance toward Mr. Trump has yet to translate into a major electoral victory.In part, this is because the few special elections for Congress so far have taken place in red-leaning districts, where the near-daily barrage of new controversies involving Mr. Trump has not damaged him irreparably and where he remains fairly popular.The Montana contest was the second special House election this year in a conservative district where rank-and-file progressives rallied behind their candidate only to see Washington-based Democrats shrink from the fight as Republicans launched ferocious attacks to ensure victory.\u201cIf the national Democratic Party would start getting more involved in these races earlier, then maybe we could flip them,\u201d Mr. Thompson said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating.\u201dFor Republicans, the outcome in Montana, where Mr. Gianforte apologized in his victory speech late Thursday night to the reporter he had attacked, is likely to calm nerves at least for a while, staving off what the party feared would be a full-blown panic if Mr. Gianforte lost on such favorable turf. Washington-based Republican strategists had grown increasingly pessimistic about the race in recent weeks, bemoaning their candidate\u2019s political deficiencies and predicting a narrow victory.For Democrats, though, the contest pointed to an increasingly heated disagreement over where the party has a realistic chance to win. Party officials in Montana and progressive activists beyond the state\u2019s borders grew frustrated last month watching outside Republican groups savage Mr. Quist as Democratic groups remained on the sidelines.But House Democratic officials make no apology for their prudence, believing they are more likely to claim the 24 seats needed to capture the House majority in suburban districts with highly educated voters, where anger at Mr. Trump runs high. That includes districts like the one in suburban Atlanta, previously represented by Health Secretary Tom Price, where both parties have poured tens of millions of dollars into a contest that looms all the more consequential after the Democratic defeats in Kansas and Montana.Even this week, just two days before the Montana vote, Mr. Luj\u00e1n announced new spending in the Georgia race. And in private, Mr. Luj\u00e1n was telling other House Democrats that Mr. Quist stood little chance, based on private polls showing Mr. Gianforte with a healthy, consistent lead of about 10 percentage points, according to one of those present at a closed-door meeting of the caucus. After the election was called, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee circulated a memo declaring that it had \u201crefused to waste money on hype.\u201dOn Friday, Democratic leaders emphasized that Mr. Quist had performed better than the party\u2019s past congressional candidates in Montana, apparently benefiting from the enthusiasm of rank-and-file Democrats even as he fell well short of victory. The party\u2019s nominees, they noted, are outpacing their predecessors on fairly forbidding terrain, and Democratic voters are participating at higher rates than Republicans, despite being outnumbered in these districts.But other Democrats acknowledged that they must work harder to make inroads with voters who live far beyond major cities and their suburbs, if they want to pick up seats like the one Mr. Gianforte just captured.While both Mr. Trump and key Republican policy proposals, like the American Health Care Act, are broadly unpopular in public polling, the president and his party retain a strong hold over rural America, potentially limiting the map on which Democrats can compete next year.Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the Democratic caucus, said that the outcome in Montana had come as little surprise, and that he took heart that it was \u201cnot an easy struggle\u201d for Republicans to retain a normally safe seat.But Mr. Crowley said that his party\u2019s approach to competing in rural areas was a work in progress, and that Democrats were still honing a positive message on the economy and jobs ahead of the 2018 campaign.\u201cWhat it says is we can be competitive in rural districts in states like Montana,\u201d Mr. Crowley said of the special election, adding: \u201cWith the right candidate, with the right resources.\u201dThe first element of that formula was on the minds of many Democrats on Friday, looking back at the avalanche of opposition research Republicans used against Mr. Quist as a sign that party leaders need to intervene more in primaries to ensure better candidates.\u201cI\u2019m for grass-roots politics, but if you\u2019re going to actually win seats, you need to focus on helping candidates who will be the most potent for the general election,\u201d said David Axelrod, the veteran Democratic strategist, holding up Mr. Ossoff as an example of someone party officials had coalesced around early. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons there\u2019s a competitive race there now.\u201dNational Democratic strategists were deeply skeptical of Mr. Quist from the outset: The party\u2019s campaign committee and House Majority PAC, a Democratic \u201csuper PAC,\u201d dedicated only modest sums to the contest. Both groups faced harsh criticism from the left for holding back while Republican groups pounded Mr. Quist early in the race, driving up his personal unpopularity and effectively disqualifying him in the eyes of many voters.But by not finishing more closely, Mr. Quist mitigated the postelection grumbling on the left. Two groups that had stoked enthusiasm for him \u2014 Our Revolution, a committee backed by Senator Bernie Sanders, and Democracy for America, a grass-roots liberal organization \u2014 applauded Mr. Quist for his effort but declined to fan grievances against the Democratic Party establishment.The party will face a more telling test of its favored strategy on June 20 in the Georgia runoff. Democrats are more optimistic about that contest, and the Montana defeat increases pressure on the party to deliver a special election victory at last.\u201cThat race becomes more of an actual test of what might happen in 2018,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said.The good news for Democrats is that Republicans will be unable to replicate across the map next year the kind of multimillion-dollar spending blitzes they have mounted in this year\u2019s special elections.Yet while it may be possible for Democrats to win control of the House without staking their fortunes on states and districts like Montana\u2019s at-large congressional seat, the implications of being less competitive in rural precincts could have graver consequences in the Senate, where Democrats are defending a cluster of seats in conservative, sparsely populated states \u2014 including Montana.\u201cDemocrats have to compete in Western states and rural areas,\u201d said Tom Lopach, a Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to Mr. Tester. \u201cFor Democrats to have a governing majority, they have to listen to folks in rural America.\u201dMr. Lopach, who led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2016, said that writing off rural voters would be a betrayal of \u201cour governing philosophy of standing up for working folks and all Americans.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from Bozeman, Mont., and Alexander Burns from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Road Trip Through Rusting and Rising America", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byOAK RIDGE, Tenn. \u2014 In his dystopian Inaugural Address, President Trump painted a picture of America as a nation gripped by vast \u201ccarnage\u201d \u2014 a landscape of \u201crusted-out factories scattered like tombstones\u201d that cried out for a strongman to put \u201cAmerica first\u201d and stop the world from stealing our jobs. It was a shocking speech in many ways and reportedly prompted former President George W. Bush to say to those around him on the dais, \u201cThat was some really weird [stuff].\u201dIt was weird, but was it all wrong?I just took a four-day car trip through the heart of that landscape \u2014 driving from Austin, Ind., down through Louisville, Ky., winding through Appalachia and ending up at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee to try to answer that question.Trump is half right in his diagnosis, but his prescription is 100 percent wrong. We do have an epidemic of failing communities. But we also have a bounty of thriving ones \u2014 not because of a strongman in Washington but because of strong leaders at the local level.Indeed, this notion that America is a nation divided between two coasts that are supposedly thriving, pluralizing and globalizing and a vast flyover interior, where jobs have disappeared, drug addiction is rife and everyone is hoping Trump can bring back the 1950s, is highly inaccurate.The big divide in America is not between the coasts and the interior. It\u2019s between strong communities and weak communities. You can find weak ones along the coast and thriving ones in Appalachia, and vice versa. It\u2019s community, stupid \u2014 not geography.The communities that are making it share a key attribute: They\u2019ve created diverse adaptive coalitions, where local businesses get deeply involved in the school system, translating in real time the skills being demanded by the global economy.They also tap local colleges for talent and innovations that can diversify their economies and nurture unique local assets that won\u2019t go away. Local foundations and civic groups step in to fund supplemental learning opportunities and internships, and local governments help to catalyze it all.The success stories are all bottom-up; the failures are all where the bottom has fallen out.The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that Austin \u201ccontains the largest drug-fueled H.I.V. outbreak to hit rural America in recent history.\u201d Its 5 percent infection rate \u201cis comparable to some African nations.\u201d Austin, the newspaper noted, doesn\u2019t just sit at the intersection between Indianapolis and Louisville but at the \u201cintersection of hopelessness and economic ruin.\u201dI chose to go there to meet the town\u2019s only doctor, Will Cooke, whose heroic work I learned of from the Courier-Journal series. Cooke\u2019s clinic, Foundations Family Medicine, sits at 25 West Main Street \u2014 opposite Marko\u2019s Pizza & Sub, a liquor store and a drugstore. Down the street was a business combination I\u2019d never seen before: Eagle\u2019s Nest Tanning and Storage. It\u2019s the Kissed by the Sun Tanning Salon and a warehouse \u2014 both of which seemed to be shuttered, with the space available for rent.For generations Austin\u2019s economy was anchored by the Morgan Foods canning plant, but, as The Courier-Journal noted, \u201cthen came a series of economic blows familiar to many manufacturing-based communities. The American Can plant next to Morgan Foods shut its doors in 1986 after more than 50 years in business. A local supermarket closed. Workers left along with the jobs and poverty crept up among those who stayed.\u201dAustin, Cooke explained to me, got caught in the vortex of declining blue-collar jobs, leading to a loss of dignity for breadwinners, depression and family breakdown, coinciding with doctors\u2019 and drug companies\u2019 pushing painkillers, and with too many people in the community failing to realize that to be in the middle class now required lifelong learning \u2014 not just to get a job but to hold one.\u201cThirty percent of students were not even graduating from high school,\u201d said Cooke. \u201cThen you take high unemployment, generational poverty, homelessness, childhood abuse and neglect, and cloak that within a closed-off culture inherited from Appalachia, and you begin to have the ingredients that contributed to the H.I.V. outbreak.\u201dAustin\u2019s insularity proved deadly for both jobs and families. \u201cThe close-knit, insular nature of the community worked against it, with the C.D.C. later finding up to six people shared needles at one sitting, and two or three generations \u2014 young adults, parents and grandparents \u2014 sometimes shot up together,\u201d The Courier-Journal reported.Lately, though, Cooke told me, the town\u2019s prospects have started to improve, precisely because the community has come together, not to shoot up but to start up and learn up and give a hand up. \u201cThe local high school has introduced college-credit classes and trade programs so people are graduating with a head start,\u201d said Cooke. Faith-based and civic groups have mobilized, celebrating social and economic recovery, providing community dinners called \u201cFood 4R Soul\u201d and even installing community showers for people without running water.Addiction is often a byproduct of social breakdown leading to a sense of isolation. Cooke feels hopeful because he sees the tide slowly shifting as \u201csocial isolation gives way to community.\u201d\u201cOnly a healthy individual can contribute to a healthy family, and only a healthy family can contribute to a healthy community \u2014 and all of that requires a foundation of trust,\u201d said Cooke. \u201cThat kind of change can\u2019t come from the outside, it has to be homegrown.\u201dI shared with him the business philosopher Dov Seidman\u2019s admonition that \u201ctrust is the only legal performance-enhancing drug.\u201d Dr. Cooke liked that a lot and only wished he could prescribe it as easily as others had prescribed opioids.But just 40 minutes down the highway from Austin, I interviewed Greg Fischer, the mayor of Louisville, a city bustling with energy and new buildings. \u201cThat \u2018Intifada\u2019 you wrote about in the Middle East is happening in parts of rural and urban America \u2014 people saying, \u2018I feel disconnected and hopeless about participating in a rapidly changing global economy.\u2019 Drug-related violence and addiction is one result \u2014 including in a few neighborhoods of Louisville.\u201dBut Louisville also has another story to tell: \u201cWe have 30,000 job openings,\u201d said Fischer, and for the best of reasons: Louisville has \u201ca vision for how a city can be a platform for human potential to flourish.\u201d It combines \u201cstrategies of the heart,\u201d like asking everyone to regularly give a day of service to the city; strategies of science, like \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d bearing GPS-enabled inhalers that the city uses to track air pollution, mitigate it and warn asthma suffers; and strategies for job creation that leverage Louisville\u2019s unique assets.One job-creation strategy led to a slew of new businesses that make \u201cend of runway\u201d products for rapid delivery by leveraging the fact that Louisville is UPS\u2019s worldwide air hub; \u201cbourbon tourism\u201d that leverages the fact that Kentucky is the Napa Valley of bourbon; a partnership with Lexington, home of the University of Kentucky, has created an advanced manufacturing corridor; and by leveraging Humana\u2019s headquarters in Louisville, the city has unleashed a lifelong wellness and aging-care industry.Show me a community that understands today\u2019s world and is working together to thrive within it, and I\u2019ll show you a community on the rise \u2014 coastal or interior, urban or rural.I found more such communities as I moved south on Interstate 75 through Tennessee to Oak Ridge, home of the Manhattan Project facilities where the enriched uranium for the \u201cLittle Boy\u201d atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was produced.Today, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which sprawls across two counties, is still involved with nuclear weaponry, but its supercomputer, one of the world\u2019s most powerful, and its hundreds of scientists help drive a broad array of research in energy, materials science, 3-D manufacturing, robotics, physics, cybersecurity and nuclear medicine \u2014 research it now actively shares with the surrounding Appalachian communities to spawn new industries and jobs.Sitting on the spot where the K-25 Manhattan Project facility once stood, I interviewed Ron Woody, county executive for Roane County, where Oak Ridge is partly located, and Steve Jones, an industrial recruiter hired by the city of Oak Ridge to seek out companies interested in investing in the region or leveraging spinouts from Oak Ridge\u2019s labs. That kind of active entrepreneurship is a new thing for Roane County, where generations of people have known only a government job.\u201cBack in the 1980s you had the T.V.A. [Tennessee Valley Authority], and it had over 50,000 employees. Now it has 10,000 employees,\u201d explained Woody, so \u201cwe were not diversified in our employment. We had to convince the public that we can\u2019t rely on the Oak Ridge lab and T.V.A. The Cold War is over. So our communities had to make a big transition from a lot of government programs to very few.\u201dIt\u2019s starting to work, said Woody, \u201cbut progress is slow.\u201d One of those success stories was luring a former three-time Tour de France winner, Greg LeMond, to open a 65,000-square-foot factory for his new company, LeMond Composites, for making lightweight carbon-fiber bikes, based on new materials pioneered at Oak Ridge.\u201cThe research Oak Ridge has done is going to change the way we make things,\u201d LeMond explained to me, as we sat in his new factory. \u201cIt is a really exciting future. My goal is that you will be able to go on my website and design your own bike out of carbon fiber.\u201dBut just because there are workers looking for employment and there are new jobs opening, it isn\u2019t automatic that local people work in those jobs, explained Jones, the recruiter. Because of the opioid crisis, many people cannot pass the mandatory drug test \u2014 and years of working for the government has left them unprepared for the pace of today\u2019s private sector.\u201cThe two biggest issues we are dealing with are the soft skills and passing the drug test,\u201d explained Woody. \u201cI thought the problem was that people needed more STEM skills.\u201d But that\u2019s not the case.It turns out that it\u2019s not that hard to train someone, even with just a high school or community college degree, to operate an advanced machine tool or basic computer. \u201cFactory managers would say, \u2018I will train them and put them to work tomorrow in good jobs\u201d requiring hard skills, said Woody. \u201cThe problem they have is finding people with the right soft skills.\u201dWhat are those soft skills? I asked. \u201cEmployers just want someone who will get up, dress up, show up, shut up and never give up,\u201d Woody responded without hesitation. And there are fewer workers with those soft skills than you might think, he added.When new companies come into the area today, noted Jones, who grew up on a farm, they ask specifically for young people who were either in a 4-H club or Future Farmers of America (now called FFA) because kids with a farming background are much more likely to get up, dress up, show up on time and never give up in a new job.Soft skills also include the willingness to be a lifelong learner, because jobs are changing so quickly. For instance, the Oak Ridge lab is partnering to embed top-level local technical talent as entrepreneurial research fellows in advanced manufacturing who want to start companies in this realm. Every summer Oak Ridge\u2019s M.D.F. \u2014 Manufacturing Demonstration Facility \u2014 hosts 100 young interns to learn the latest in 3-D printing, and its experts coach teams from local high schools for national robotics competitions.The beauty of 3-D printers is that any community can now go into the manufacturing business, explained Lonnie Love, a corporate fellow at Oak Ridge, as he showed me around the M.D.F., where whole car bodies and car parts are being \u201cprinted\u201d on giant 3-D printers.\u201cTraditionally to make a car part you first had to build a die, and those dies cost anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million to make,\u201d Love said. Every die consists of a female and a male die, and the way you made a car part was to stamp them together. There are hundreds of dies needed to make a car, and that was why an assembly line for a new car model in Detroit could cost upward of $200 million \u2014 and take two years to build. Sadly, that die-making industry actually moved out of America to Asia over the last 15 years, leaving only a dozen such companies in the U.S.No more. \u201cLarge-scale 3-D printing is enabling us to re-shore that industry,\u201d explained Love, who then offered this example: \u201cThe naval air station at Cherry Point, N.C., repairs all the aircraft for the Navy on the East Coast. About a year ago their head of engineering called me on a Monday and asked if we could print a die mold for them and I said, \u2018Sure, just send me the digital model of what you want printed.\u2019\u201cWe got it by email that afternoon, and by Friday he had the mold to make the new part. And it only weighed about 40 pounds because with 3-D printing we could make it stronger but lighter weight by hollowing out the inside. The following Monday he calls and asks me how much did it cost and how long did it take me to make? I told him it took me longer \u2014 and was more expensive \u2014 to ship it to him than it was make it.\u201dThink about car dealers in the future who, instead of needing a huge lot with hundreds of cars in inventory, will just custom print the car you want. \u201cOur only inventory is carbon fiber pellets that cost $2 a pound, and we can make any product out of them,\u201d said Love. \u201cYou won\u2019t need inventory anymore.\u201dOver the last 100 years, Love concluded, we went from decentralized artisan-based manufacturing to centralized mass manufacturing on assembly lines. Today, with these emerging technologies, we can go back to artisans, which will be great for local communities that spawn a leadership and workers able to take advantage of these emerging technologies. We are going to see a world of micro-factories, and you can see them sprouting around Oak Ridge already.\u201cThere\u2019s a new wave of kids coming up who love this stuff,\u201d said Love. \u201cWe can create mini-moonshots all over the place.\u201dThe same applies to the design of the parts. Thom Mason, the director of the Oak Ridge lab, explained to me that high-performance computing \u201callows you to design and test out all the parts on the computer and only make those that you know will work. It is totally speeding up the iteration loop of physical manufacturing. You move all the trial and failure into the digital world \u2014 so you don\u2019t need to do all that costly tooling of prototypes \u2014 and then go straight to manufacturing.\u201dI ended my little tour in Knoxville, Tenn., where I met with the mayor at a restaurant in the newly rejuvenated downtown square, a beehive of restaurants, public art exhibitions, theaters, shopping and museums.\u201cUntil the mid-1980s, the old economic development model here was low wages and no unions. That model wasn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d said Mayor Madeline Rogero, the first woman mayor of Knoxville and a former organizer for Cesar Chavez\u2019s United Farm Workers union. \u201cWe wanted better schools, and you cannot build a great school system on the back of low-wage workers. So we started thinking about what are our unique assets and stopped selling ourselves as a low-wage town.\u201dThe whole region came together around that project and wove an adaptive coalition that could draw in investors based on the region\u2019s strengths. It\u2019s call Innovation Valley, the mayor explained, and it markets the assets of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pellissippi State and Roane State Community Colleges, the work force skills in the metro area and available infrastructure that can be utilized by technology companies. It also stimulated a dialogue between employers and higher-learning institutions to ensure they\u2019re meeting the labor force needs of the future.But there are real constraints that need to be overcome. The region has a shortage of both manufacturing and back-office workers. \u201cWe face the same work force development issues that all metro areas in the U.S. are facing,\u201d explained Bryan Daniels, president of the Blount Partnership, one of Knoxville\u2019s regional development boards. \u201cOur local law enforcement has described the prison populations as having approximately 65 percent opioid-related inmates.\u201dIt is vital, therefore, for the community to develop programs to get this population back to being employable. At the same time, said Daniels, the Knoxville region is exploring new ways to get workers from outlying rural areas into the metro area labor force and help them acquire the \u201ceducational attainment they need to get their skill level up\u201d for a modern economy. They are even studying \u201cpublic-private partnerships to provide transportation for [rural] workers up to a two-hour commute radius,\u201d he said.This is the real picture of America today.It\u2019s cities and regions rising together to leverage their unique assets from the bottom up \u2014 living side by side with distressed and lost communities where the bottom has fallen out. It\u2019s not your grandparents\u2019 America, but it is also not Trump\u2019s America \u2014 that land of vast carnage and an industrial wasteland. The picture is much more complex.It\u2019s actually Bill Clinton\u2019s America.Clinton once famously observed, \u201cThere is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured with what is right in America.\u201d That has never been more accurate \u2014 and necessary \u2014 than it is today.What is wrong with America is that too many communities, rural and urban, have broken down. What is right with America is the many communities and regions that are coming together to help their citizens acquire the skills and opportunities to own their own futures. We need to share and scale these success stories.Only strong communities, not a strong man, will make America great again.Advertisement"}

Instead, we\u2019ll work so that the battle is for them in Iran.\u201dThe two countries, which stand on opposite sides of the conflicts in Syria and Yemen, are competing for religious and political influence across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, ruled by a Sunni royal family, is a close ally of the United States and accuses Iran of spreading its revolutionary ideology to destabilize the Arab world. Saudi leaders have taken heart from the Trump administration\u2019s criticism of Iran.For its part, Shiite-led Iran says Saudi Arabia\u2019s ultraconservative religious creed, known abroad as Wahhabism, endangers minorities and feeds terrorism. Iranian officials did not immediately respond to Prince Mohammed\u2019s statements.The prince said that dialogue with Iran was impossible because of its belief in the Imam Mahdi, the so-called hidden imam, who many Shiites believe is a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad who will return to save the world from destruction.\u201cTheir stance is that the awaited Mahdi will come, and they need to create a fertile environment for the arrival of the awaited Mahdi, and they need to take over the Islamic world,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are the common points that we might be able to reach an understanding on with this regime?\u201dPrince Mohammed gave a positive view of the war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab countries have been bombing for more than two years to try to push Shiite rebels aligned with Iran out of the capital.He said that Saudi forces could uproot the rebels \u201cin a few days,\u201d but that doing so would kill thousands of Saudi troops and many civilians. So, he said, the coalition is waiting for the rebels to tire out.Aid organizations have been sounding the alarm about an escalating humanitarian crisis and the threat of famine in Yemen, the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, exacerbated by a Saudi-led blockade of rebel-held territory and airstrikes on a key seaport.Prince Mohammed said Saudi Arabia was in no hurry.\u201cTime is in our favor,\u201d he said.The king has vested enormous power in his son, who runs the Defense Ministry, oversees the state oil company, and is spearheading a program known as Vision 2030 to reduce the kingdom\u2019s dependence on oil and improve the quality of life for Saudi citizens.Much of the interview was aimed at a domestic audience, with Prince Mohammed assuring Saudis that the government was working hard to fight corruption and improve the economy, which has been hurt by low oil prices.The prince\u2019s high public profile has caused many in the kingdom to speculate that he wants to succeed his father on the throne, displacing Mohammed bin Nayef, the current crown prince.During the nearly hourlong interview, he did not mention the crown prince once.Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why \u2018Brexit\u2019 Will Make Britain\u2019s Mediocre Economy Worse", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 An observer of Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d debate would be forgiven for thinking that the country\u2019s economy is one of the European Union\u2019s star performers. Brexit\u2019s advocates rarely pass up an opportunity to claim that the European Union economy is the world\u2019s weak link, and that Britain\u2019s reformed, dynamic and flexible economy has little to risk, and much to gain, from leaving it. The reality is rather different. And Brexit threatens to make matters worse.Britain\u2019s economic performance relative to the other big economies in Western Europe \u2014 including France, Germany, Italy and Spain \u2014 does not stand out as impressive, at least once the different prices of goods and services across these countries are factored in. As the chart below shows, British economic growth between 2000 and 2015 lagged behind Spain and Germany.And in 2015 Britain ranks only slightly ahead of France, a country that has become synonymous in Britain with economic weakness.Sustainable increases in living standards require economies to combine land, labor, capital and technology in more efficient ways; Britain has made a poor job of this, helping to explain why Britons\u2019 wages have risen by much less than their French and German counterparts over the last 15 years.It also explains why Brits have to work longer hours than the French or the Germans to earn a comparable income, as the chart below shows.If the country\u2019s overall performance looks mediocre, note that it is also highly skewed by London and the southeast of England. In one of the most politically centralized democracies in the world, regions as economically diverse as the northeast of England and London are essentially run as if they face the same challenges, and, Scotland aside, those regions have scant scope to tailor policies to their particular needs. This is part of the reason why, since 2000, poorer regions of Britain have not been catching up with the richer regions of the European Union. Instead, they\u2019ve been falling further behind.So, why has the country\u2019s performance been so poor? The British government overdid austerity between 2010-12, but not by as much as the Germans, Italians or Spanish and by about the same as the French. And there is no evidence that government borrowing is \u201ccrowding out\u201d private sector investment by taking up too much of the available financing: interest rates are extremely low, pointing to a surfeit of savings over profitable investment opportunities.That leaves supply-side failures. Britain is generally perceived as a liberalized economy, and by some measures of labor market performance this is no doubt true: Non-wage labor costs, such as employer contributions, are low and it is easy to lay off workers, which reduces the costs of taking them on in the first place. But a successful labor market requires more than easy hiring and firing; it needs skilled workers, access to housing and good quality infrastructure. By these measures Britain has some real weaknesses.A significantly higher proportion of British 18- to 24-year-olds suffer from weak literacy and numeracy than those in France, Germany, Italy or Spain.And, despite strong population growth and rapid price increases, Britain is building around half as many houses as in the 1970s, and the supply of subsidised (or social) housing has pretty much dried up, making it difficult for many British workers to move to where the jobs are.Good infrastructure increases productivity by raising the return on investment and boosting foreign trade and can play a major role in addressing regional disparities. But, as the chart below shows, the country has invested less in roads, railways and air travel than other large European Union economies over the last 20 years.A Britain outside of the European Union will inevitably be less open to trade with member states, which will curb competition and productivity growth. Tax revenues will fall, further squeezing infrastructure investment and education spending. That\u2019s why, far from liberating Britain to conquer world markets as a buccaneering trading nation, Brexit threatens to make its mediocre economic performance even worse.Advertisement"}

It also comes as Austria appears to be settling down after the arrival of tens of thousands of migrants in Europe in 2015.The economy has been on the rise in recent months, with the European Commission predicting growth of 1.7 percent into next year with unemployment projected to dip below 6 percent.Mr. Kurz insisted he was seeking a \u201cbrief, intense\u201d election campaign that would take place over the summer, with elections in the fall, possibly October.Since the end of World War II, most of Austria\u2019s governments have been a coalition of the two main left and right parties, an arrangement credited by many for creating harmony in the republic. Others have criticized it for paving the way for cronyism and an ossified system of politics.But they also show Mr. Kurz enjoying the support of roughly 50 percent of all Austrians, more than double that for the Freedom Party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache.Early elections have to be approved by all members of Parliament and the opposition. Mr. Strache told reporters on Monday that his party would support balloting in mid- or late October. \u201cWe want to ensure the chaos is eased,\u201d he said. \u201cSwift elections will lead to orderly circumstances.\u201dMr. Strache\u2019s party is currently the third-strongest in the national Parliament. A new round of voting could leave it poised to enter into government for the first time since 1999.The current political crisis started last Wednesday, when the vice chancellor and previous leader of People\u2019s Party, offered his resignation.That opened the door to Mr. Kurz, the 30-year-old foreign minister, to swiftly move to translate his growing popularity into power by offering to take over leadership of the flagging center-right party in exchange for a series of demands.Among them were the consolidation of hiring and decision-making powers for the new leader and the right to refashion itself into a movement bearing his name.\u201cWe are starting a new movement that is based on the proven powers of the People\u2019s Party and at the same time attracts new people,\u201d Mr. Kurz said in a statement after his election on Sunday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Compete but Won\u2019t Let Their Workers Do the Same", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAmericans, we are told, believe in competition. But a shockingly large number of workers \u2014 30 million, according to a report from the Treasury Department \u2014 are shackled by what are called \u201cnoncompetes,\u201d which are agreements forbidding employees to leave their job to work for a competitor or to start their own competing business. And the number is growing fast.Once reserved for a corporation\u2019s most treasured rainmakers, noncompetes are now routinely applied to low-wage workers like warehouse employees, fast-food workers and even dog sitters. One out of every six workers without a college degree have signed one. By including them in employee contracts, employers can use the threat of litigation to constrict wages and employee mobility.At a minimum every state should ban noncompetes for all low-wage workers, for all workers in occupations that promote public safety and health, such as physicians and nurses, and for all workers who are laid off or terminated without cause. Looking forward, the research suggests that noncompetes should be banned for all employees, regardless of skill, industry or wage; they simply do more harm than good.Workers bound by noncompetes cannot rely on outside offers and free-market competition to fairly value their talents. Without incentives to increase wages in-house, companies can allow salaries to plateau. And while noncompete restrictions impose hardships on every worker, for women these restrictions tend to be compounded with other mobility constraints, including the need to coordinate dual careers, family geographical ties and job market re-entry after family leave.California and Massachusetts offer a case study within the high-tech industry. California strictly voids all noncompete agreements. Massachusetts, like most other states, enforces noncompetes. Both California and Massachusetts enjoyed an early boom of economic growth within the high-tech market, but California\u2019s Silicon Valley has continued growing, while Massachusetts has sputtered.Some states, including Colorado, Oregon, Illinois and New York, have recently introduced reforms. Hawaii passed a law in 2015 prohibiting noncompetes in the tech industry.Federally, Congress introduced two bills last year \u2014 the Limiting the Ability to Demand Detrimental Employment Restrictions Act (Ladder Act) and the Mobility and Opportunity for Vulnerable Employees Act (MOVE Act).The best companies already realize the damaging effect of post-employment restrictions. Companies with little turnover risk becoming stagnant and myopic. In fact, relying on noncompetes rather than active recruitment and retention creates a market for lemons \u2014 a business will end up with employees who stay despite their unhappiness.Smart leaders treat departing employees as alums, rather than sour exes in a divorce. But too many other employers have become increasingly litigious against their former employees, relying on noncompetes rather than positive incentives to retain the best talent and curtail the competition.The liberty to move in the job market not only supports workers\u2019 choice, equality and wage growth but also creates the competition that catalyzes entrepreneurship, innovation and overall economic growth. If we want a healthy and free market, we should not shackle workers to the first business that offers them a job. Let them compete.Advertisement"}

Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have been protesting in Caracas and other cities, calling him a dictator and demanding that he schedule elections that his government postponed.To many, Mr. Maduro\u2019s call to rewrite the Constitution seemed like an effort to divert attention from the political crisis he has been facing in the streets and to avoid elections that his governing United Socialist Party is likely to lose, according to polls.\u201cFrom my point of view, they are in a dire situation that they don\u2019t know how to continue using the normal mechanisms, such as having elections,\u201d said Enrique S\u00e1nchez Falc\u00f3n, a legal expert and professor at the Central University of Venezuela.Venezuela\u2019s opposition quickly rejected the president\u2019s proposal. Henrique Capriles, a state governor who narrowly lost to Mr. Maduro in an election in 2013, dismissed the plan as a \u201cfraud\u201d that had been \u201cannounced by a dictator.\u201d\u201cPeople to the street to disobey this madness,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Monday.Mr. Maduro\u2019s supporters urged the opposition to accept the constitutional process as a means of settling their disagreements.\u201cThere are violent groups that don\u2019t understand that violence won\u2019t get us anywhere, and that we must have a dialogue despite our differences,\u201d said Hermann Escarr\u00e1, a legal adviser to Mr. Maduro.It was unclear precisely how Mr. Maduro wanted the Constitution changed. Some legal experts said the constitutional assembly could be used to sideline Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly, which has been attacked by the country\u2019s courts.Venezuela has been rocked for the last month by huge street protests against Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, which have been met with repression by the security forces. At least 29 people have been killed.A dismal economy has led to shortages of food and medicine, and a Supreme Court decision in March to strip power from the National Assembly led to the protests.The court, on Mr. Maduro\u2019s urging, later reversed much of its ruling. But his opponents say he is continuing to govern in an authoritarian manner, and they are demanding new elections.Rewriting the Constitution would forestall any elections, legal experts said.The last president to initiate a rewriting of the Constitution was Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 1999, shortly after he took power and declared his plans for socialist reforms to benefit poor and working-class Venezuelans.An article on Tuesday about calls by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela to rewrite his country\u2019s Constitution misstated the timing of a Supreme Court decision to strip power from the National Assembly.

{"Headline": "Profits From Store-Branded Credit Cards Hide Depth of Retailers\u2019 Troubles", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byDepartment stores and big name retailers are increasingly making the hard sell to sign up customers for credit cards at the register. The store cards promise deep discounts on clothing, furniture and electronics, and are tough for shoppers to resist.For some retailers, those credit cards are not just a sales tool, but also an essential way to bolster their struggling businesses \u2014 a trend that has worrisome implications for the industry and its customers.Weak consumer spending, digital competition and changing shopping habits have already roiled retailers. In recent months, the industry has shed tens of thousands of workers, making it one of the job market\u2019s weakest links. Macy\u2019s reported a sharp drop in earnings on Thursday, sending its stock spiraling and dragging down the rest of the industry.But the businesses may be in worse shape than they appear, since store cards are a shaky foundation. If more consumers fall behind on their payments, the profits could dry up, intensifying retailers\u2019 troubles.At Macy\u2019s, the money from branded credit cards accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s total profit of $1.9 billion last year, up from 26 percent in 2013, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley. Bloomingdale\u2019s, which is owned by Macy\u2019s, has pushed to increase the number of credit card customers that workers are expected to sign up each month, according to the store workers\u2019 union.At Kohl\u2019s, the profit from plastic totaled 35 percent, up from 23 percent, over that same period. At Target, it made up 13 percent of total earnings, up from 11 percent in 2013.Amazon, by comparison, derives only about 3 percent of its total operating profit from its credit cards.The cracks are starting to show. As signs of customer distress rise, one major lender, Synchrony Financial, which handles the credit cards for stores like Sam\u2019s Club, Gap and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, is now setting aside more money for bad loans.\u201cInvestors may not appreciate the magnitude of the retailers\u2019 stress because of the store card income stream,\u201d said Kimberly Greenberger, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley.J. Crew offers card holders 15 percent off their first purchase, while Home Depot offers one year of \u201chassle-free\u201d returns for card holders. A Macy\u2019s card offers savings of up to $100 for a two-day shopping spree.At first the cards can seem appealing to customers with limited budgets, allowing them to finance purchases they might not otherwise be able to afford. But the retailers make much of their money on interest charges, so they are counting on many customers going into debt.\u201cThese stores are propping up their failing businesses on the backs of lower-middle-class people,\u201d said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in New York, whose clients often have rung up thousands of dollars in debt on retail cards.Lillian Esposito, of Queens, accumulated at least 10 different credit cards, including ones from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Walmart. The mother of two young boys, she used them to buy school supplies and Christmas gifts, taking advantage of store discounts on the cards.But any savings quickly evaporate when borrowers cannot pay off their bills right away.As Ms. Esposito watched her balances grow every month, she calculated paying $25 on interest for every $100 she spent. And she fell behind on some payments.She has since sworn off big retailers. \u201cNever again,\u201d said Ms. Esposito.Synchrony Financial, which issued some of Ms. Esposito\u2019s cards, declined to comment on her experience. But Samuel Wang, a spokesman for Synchrony, said the company underwrote \u201cin a way that takes into account a customer\u2019s ability to pay\u201d and encouraged customers in distress to contact the lender \u201cso we can help address their situation.\u201d Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said in a statement the terms of its cards were similar to others.In some cases, customers end up owing more in interest than the original bill. Many store cards carry rates around 30 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s like fool\u2019s gold,\u201d said Bryan Hall, who lives in the Bronx.Mr. Hall, 48, charged thousands of dollars on cards from P. C. Richard, Best Buy and Kay Jewelers, for an iPad, a 46-inch television and a ring for a friend who was getting married. He then sold off items he bought to pay his rent and keep his car on the road. He stopped making payments on several cards.Kay Jewelers and Best Buy declined to comment on Mr. Hall. P. C. Richard did not respond to requests for comment.The payoff for employees is low. Workers at some stores earn as little as $1 for each new account they open, and the discounts that their customers get for signing up for a card also cut into the employees\u2019 sales commissions.A company spokeswoman, Cheryl Heinonen, said credit card enrollments are only one aspect of how employees are evaluated, but declined to discuss the confidential negotiations.Ms. Heinonen added that the company was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with its store cards, noting that card holders were among Macy\u2019s \u201cmost loyal and happiest customers.\u201d Citigroup, which issues the Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s cards, declined to comment.Credit card profits could prove a fleeting lifeline for retailers. When customers fall behind or default, the banks are likely to clamp down on extending new cards, meaning that source of income for retailers can quickly evaporate.Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse, said credit card profits were a \u201ctemporary subsidy\u201d that the industry could not count on over the long term.The problems are already starting to appear.Among the company\u2019s struggling borrowers was Jose Luis Garcia, a 75-year-old whose only income is from Social Security.Last August, Mr. Garcia went into a furniture dealer on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn planning to buy a box spring for $100 in cash. But after the aggressive sales pitch, he came out with a full bed set, totaling $2,041, including delivery. The purchase was charged to a Synchrony card, which he says he never wanted.Unable to keep up with interest payments of 29.99 percent, Mr. Garcia sought legal assistance from New Economy Project, a nonprofit group that helps low-income New Yorkers. After an inquiry from The New York Times, Synchrony said it looked into the matter and forgave his debt.\u201cThey took me for an idiot,\u201d Mr. Garcia said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Has Failed in France", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byAmericans live to work, while the French work to live. That\u2019s the clich\u00e9, and it\u2019s time to retire it. If Emmanuel Macron defeats Marine Le Pen in Sunday\u2019s election \u2014 let\u2019s pray the polls are right this time \u2014 the message from voters will be: The vacation in Martinique will have to wait. First, we\u2019d like to work.That\u2019s the real story of this election, the most stunning aspect of which isn\u2019t that the French might possibly install a crypto-fascist in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. It\u2019s that they seem strongly inclined to elect a former Rothschild investment banker who evinces no sense of guilt about his elite pedigree, capitalist profession and market-friendly economic inclinations that include tax cuts for corporations and an easing of the 35-hour workweek.What ails France? The facile answer is to cite forces beyond French control: bureaucracy in Brussels; the currency straitjacket of the euro; the European Central Bank; the dark winds of globalization. Le Pen specializes in just this sort of blame shifting, which is another way in which she and Donald Trump are kindred spirits.This isn\u2019t just a tax-and-spend model of government. More like: tax-spend-cosset-strangle. At least until the outgoing government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande managed to ram through some modest labor-market reforms last year, the French labor code ran to over 3,000 pages.(Recent polls have been cruel to the president, but like Germany\u2019s Gerhard Schroder, he will be remembered as one of the more courageous economic reformer in recent history, if perhaps only because he had so little politically to lose.)Assuming Macron wins, his challenge won\u2019t simply be political. It will also be pedagogical. Le Pen has offered him a relatively easy ideological foil, given how thoroughly tainted her party is by xenophobia and anti-Semitism.Yet it\u2019s one thing to make the abstract case for openness, competitiveness and globalization in the face of a bigot. The harder climb will be to press for changes that inevitably take things away from people.The paradox of France is that it is desperate for reform \u2014 and desperate not to be reformed. It wants the benefits of a job-producing competitive economy but fears relinquishing a job-protecting uncompetitive one. A Macron presidency will have to devote its intellectual and rhetorical energies to explaining that it can be one or the other, but not both.I don\u2019t want to close this column without allowing for the awful chance that Le Pen might win. That would be a moral tragedy for France and a probable disaster for Europe. But it would also be a reminder that chronic economic stagnation inevitably begets nationalist furies.In the United States, a complacent left acquits itself too easily of its role in paving the way to the Trump presidency. Many of Le Pen\u2019s supporters might be bigots, but their case against the self-satisfaction, self-dealing, moral preening and economic incompetence of the French ruling classes is nearly impeccable.What has failed in France is an idea \u2014 an idea about the role of the state. Macron\u2019s challenge, should he win, is to show the French there\u2019s a better one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2017 College Access Index Methodology", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byWe examined colleges with a five-year graduation rate of at least 75 percent. Roughly 170 colleges nationwide met this standard. For these colleges, we collected three main kinds of data to produce the ranking.The first is the share of entering freshman who receive Pell Grants, the large federal financial-aid program. It typically helps students coming from the bottom 50 percent of the income distribution (and most Pell recipients are in the bottom 40 percent).We then multiplied the share of Pell students by the graduation rate for Pell recipients. The resulting number captures the share of a college\u2019s entering class that is low-income and can be expected to graduate. The number led to one half of a college\u2019s index number.The other half came from the average price \u2014 tuition, fees, room and board, net of financial aid \u2014 that the college charged students from families with annual income between $30,000 and $75,000.Together, the index measures how many lower-income students graduate from a college and how much they must pay to attend it.These statistics remain the only apples-to-apples statistics that most colleges have been willing to release (because the federal government mandates it). If colleges released more detailed statistics \u2014 such as an annual breakdown of their student body into comparable income buckets, rather than based only on the Pell cutoff \u2014 we would use them in our analysis. (More detailed statistics do exist, but they are at least five years old.)One other point: Officials at some public colleges with declining Pell shares argued that the main reason was the improvement in the economy over the past few years, which they say had made fewer students eligible. But after talking with economists and looking at the data, I\u2019m skeptical of that explanation.For one thing, incomes haven\u2019t risen that much in the past few years. For another, the Pell shares at private colleges have held steady on average. The economic improvement may well have played a small role in the declining Pell shares at some public colleges, but other factors, such as declining state support, have played a bigger role, as my column explains.Below, we offer more details on the calculations.The Department of Education publishes data for each college on the share of first-year, full-time students receiving Pell Grants, with the most recent year available typically being 2014-15. We requested 2015-16 data from each college in the index, and most provided it.For those that did, the 2014-15 share accounted for 40 percent of their raw Pell score; 2013-14 accounted for 30 percent; 2012-13 accounted for 20 percent; and 2011-12 accounted for 10 percent. For those colleges that did not provide the 2014-15 number, we used the previous three years, with the same 3-2-1 weighting.The goal is to make the most recent year count most heavily but to avoid allowing any single data point to dominate.We asked each college in our index to provide us with graduation rates for the first-time full-time cohort that entered in the fall of 2009 \u2014 the six-year graduation rate for both Pell students and all students. Most but not all colleges provided the data. The Pell and overall graduation were strikingly similar on the whole, which is good news. Lower-income students who enroll at most top colleges graduate at almost the same rate as upper-income students.For colleges that provided the Pell graduation rate, we multiplied the six-year rate times its Pell share to arrive at an adjusted Pell score. For example, a college with 15 percent of freshmen receiving Pell grants and a Pell graduation rate of 80 percent would receive a Pell score of 12 percent \u2014 signifying that 12 percent of first-year students were both Pell recipients and likely to graduate.For colleges that did not provide a Pell graduation rate, we used overall graduation rate, deflated to adjust for the difference between overall and Pell graduation rates. We used the 25th percentile of the Pell/overall ratio, in an effort to ensure that colleges would not benefit by declining to provide their Pell graduation rate.Yet the net price nonetheless captures the differences between colleges that offer nearly full scholarships to lower-income students and those that charge such students tens of thousands of dollars a year.We used the same weighting for the past four years of data as we did for Pell Grants, with the most recent year counting most.We then took an average of the net price for students from two groups: families with annual income between $30,000 and $48,000, and those with income between $48,001 and $75,000. (Federal rules set the cutoffs for these groups.)An index value of 1 is average. A value higher than 1 suggests a greater commitment to economic diversity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pipelines and Donald Trump: British Columbia Goes to the Polls", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byThese are the issues voters are talking about as British Columbia holds its election for the provincial legislative assembly on Tuesday.Bordered by the United States on two sides, British Columbia is home to Canada\u2019s fastest-growing economy and has its lowest unemployment rate. But much of that is potentially threatened by Mr. Trump\u2019s recently announced tariffs on lumber, which affect the province\u2019s booming forestry industry. And the campaigning demonstrates how Canada\u2019s trade dispute with the United States is seeping into domestic politics.Here is a look at the contenders, and some of the issues they are fighting over.The election pits the governing BC Liberal Party, which despite its name is conservative, against the New Democratic Party and, to a lesser extent, the more progressive Green Party.The New Democratic Party, which draws more strongly in urban and liberal areas, has promised to ban corporate and union donations, build more housing that is affordable for the middle class and raise taxes to pay for social programs in a province marked by rising economic inequality.It may all come down to the performance of a potential kingmaker, the Green Party, which is promising to double the province\u2019s tax on foreign buyers of Canadian property to 30 percent, cancel an oil pipeline to the coast that China desperately wants, and broaden environmental regulations.Much as in the United States, oil pipelines are a source of political conflict in British Columbia.Ms. Clark\u2019s government supported the pipeline after initially opposing it last year. The party received over $546,000 in political donations from Kinder Morgan, an oil company based in Houston; the province places no limits on political contributions.Housing prices in Vancouver have soared over the past decade to an average of $1.3 million for a single-family home (or about 1.8 million Canadian dollars at current exchange rates). Residents say offshore buyers are bidding prices up, prompting British Columbia\u2019s Liberal government last year to impose a 15 percent tax on those buyers, even though the party received nearly $13 million in political donations from property developers, its top source of contributions.While prices have come down a bit since then, homes still remain unaffordable for most middle-class residents, a problem worsened by a rental vacancy rate below 1 percent. The Liberals have no plans to build more affordable housing or to impose further taxes on overseas purchasers, while their opponents have promised to raise taxes on offshore and wealthy homeowners.Conflicts of interest are also an issue in BC politics. The province has some of the most lax political finance rules in all of Canada, allowing unlimited donations from corporations, unions and foreigners, a practice banned pretty much everywhere else in the country.\u201cI am not going to be a sucker for Donald Trump and accept the bad deals the Americans have offered us so far,\u201d she told wood pellet factory workers at a campaign stop late last month, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I\u2019m Not Reviewing Noma Mexico", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookAnd I\u2019m going to miss it.As these you-are-not-there dispatches clattered in over the Teletype, I had two thoughts: The first, of course, was, \u201cHoly banana peels, can I pull some strings and get in?\u201d This was quickly followed by, \u201cWhat is the point?\u201dOf course, there are other reasons to write reviews. We restaurant critics do more than fill our mouths and then flash our greasy thumbs up or down. We try to assess the way a place fits into its context, including its environment. Part of this is simply sorting out whether, say, a new Sichuan restaurant in Queens is as good as, better than or different from all the other Sichuan restaurants nearby. We ask whether it\u2019s providing something the location doesn\u2019t already have, and whether it makes sense there. These are separate questions: Queens might not have an overpriced, incompetent Sichuan restaurant, but that doesn\u2019t mean opening one is a good idea.You don\u2019t need to eat at Noma Mexico to know Tulum doesn\u2019t have anything like it. But does it make sense there?Start with the advertised cost \u2014 $600 a person, or $750 after tax and service charges. This is considerably more than Noma charged for its pop-ups in Sydney (around $350 without drinks) and Tokyo (about $380), two cities where it\u2019s not unheard-of to spend that much on a meal.Tulum is not a city; it\u2019s a resort town, formerly a sleepy getaway of tilted palapas and sunrise yoga classes that has been climbing upscale. Largely thanks to the tourist economy, the state of Quintana Roo has the highest employment rate in the country, but the average income is in the bottom third. About half the state\u2019s residents live in moderate to extreme poverty.Before dinner reservations were available, Mr. Redzepi announced that he would also be serving free lunches to Mexican culinary students for the last two weeks of the pop-up. But, clearly, most of the people coming for dinner have paid for not just the meal but for flights to the Yucat\u00e1n, a car rental or taxi to Tulum, and at least one night in a hotel.It is no surprise that a paying audience exists for this tropical getaway. At this point in his career, Mr. Redzepi could sell out a weenie roast in Death Valley. What I find hard to run through my critical algorithms, though, is the idea of a meal devoted to local traditions and ingredients that is being prepared and consumed mostly by people from somewhere else.The Noma philosophy, from the start, was rigorously local. Mr. Redzepi drew a circle around the Nordic region and gathered almost all his ingredients from inside it, with rare exceptions. Noma founded a next-level locavorism that is widely if not always intelligently imitated, and one of its legacies is the notion that restaurants with global ambitions must demonstrate a strong attachment to their location.By all reports, Noma Mexico has sense of place in spades. The path to the jungle dining area is lined with baskets of jackfruit and mangos. The tables slipped in between the palms were made from a local hardwood. Directly in front of the kitchen, four women from a nearby Mayan village make tortillas.But can a restaurant really be of its place if it doesn\u2019t bend and sway to the breezes of local tastes and local demands? I doubt it, and I doubt that my own ecstatic reveries (for the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume that I would have enjoyed Noma Mexico as much as everybody else) would help on that front. I\u2019d be another tourist, hoping to be knocked out with sensations that would carry over to the flight back to New York.Back home at the keyboard, I\u2019d calculate how many words to spend on sensory pleasures and how many on the $2,000 or so that my employers were on the hook for, whether it was \u201cworth it\u201d and whether the local standard of living was likely to be helped by the attention Noma had brought to Mexican ingredients.Fretting about the ethics of eating a meal costing hundreds of dollars is a particularly awkward form of talking with your mouth full. I know, because I\u2019ve done it before and will do it again, always with a small pit of shame in my gut. The two things can never really be reconciled, without some shady bookkeeping.I don\u2019t blame Mr. Redzepi and the Noma crew for coming up with an event that makes my critical lens fog over. They\u2019ve acknowledged that they owe something to Mexico and tried to pay it back. In Tulum, they\u2019re chasing their curiosity and raising new bars to vault over, which is what creative people should do.That\u2019s the artistic side of Noma Mexico. On the business front, they\u2019ve chosen to pour their creativity into something that, because of its planned scarcity and relative expense, has to be seen as a luxury product. Luxury goods tend to float free of the everyday world and create their own cultural context, one of wealth and exclusivity. There are many ways to respond to that, but in this case, I don\u2019t think a review written by me is one of them. I\u2019d rather review a restaurant that has its roots in the ground.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steel Industry, Seeing a New Dawn, Is Cheering for Trump", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Stocks are up, and employees at a South Carolina plant are confident in the prospect of infrastructure spending and a tough stand on trade.Supported byHUGER, S.C. \u2014 Safely stationed in the control pulpit, Chris St. Amand is watching the pot boil.He tracks every step of this galvanization process \u2014 from the caldron\u2019s 865-degree temperature to the line speed \u2014 on a bank of flashing screens. Except, that is, for the screen at the bottom right. \u201cI watch our stock and the Dow Jones on that one,\u201d he said.Mr. St. Amand, whose pay package includes profit-sharing, likes what he sees. Since Election Day, Nucor is up 13 percent.Across the steel industry, stock prices \u2014 and spirits \u2014 have been on the rise, lifted by President Trump\u2019s vow to protect American manufacturers against cheaper imports and invest as much as $1 trillion in infrastructure over the next decade.Mr. Ferriola, one of the business leaders who met with Mr. Trump at the White House in February to discuss American manufacturing, is looking for further improvements. \u201cWe believe our full year 2017 could significantly exceed the level achieved for 2016,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cimports and inventories are down.\u201dJeffrey Goude, 29, nicknamed Strawberry for the curly red beard and hair that peeks out of his green hard hat, agreed. \u201cAll of them get criticism,\u201d he said of politicians. \u201cTrump is No. 1 for this industry. He\u2019s trying to make America great again.\u201dWith more than 200 facilities and $16 billion in sales last year, Nucor is well positioned to take advantage of an upswing in domestic demand. The company uses advanced technology to turn scrap metal into skyscraper-worthy support beams, paper-thin water heater linings and delicate sheets that can be molded into Christmas ornaments and fishing lures.\u201cWe\u2019re very flexible,\u201d said Giff Daughtridge, the Huger plant\u2019s general manager and vice president. \u201cWe can take cold scrap and turn it into product very quickly.\u201dThe fiery showers of orange sparks, mammoth tipping buckets and pounding rollers are roaring round the clock here, staffed by four rotating teams that work 12-hour shifts.\u201cIt\u2019s hot; it\u2019s dirty. It\u2019s hard work,\u201d said Leigh Kemp, 48, who switched from an office job to the plant floor tending a ladle metallurgy furnace two decades ago. \u201cBut you make good money.\u201dThe plant employs 940 workers, yet most of the acreage is occupied by highly automated machinery rather than people.If trade policies have eaten away at steel industry jobs, so have technological advances like Nucor\u2019s electric arc furnaces, which recycle existing iron and steel instead of making it from scratch. The old-style blast-furnace steel plants that resembled volcanic Mordor from \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d and employed legions of boilermakers, electricians, steamfitters and more are on the decline in the United States.In the 1980s, for example, making a finished ton of steel required about 10 human-hours of work. Now the Huger plant can make that same ton from recycled material in 0.4 human-hours, said Mr. Daughtridge, who has worked for Nucor for 33 years.The jobs that do exist are coveted. Workers stay one, two and three decades with the company while encouraging family and friends to join them.There is no union at Nucor, not in this anti-union state or any other where the Charlotte-based manufacturer has a plant. But good benefits and pay-for-performance bonuses that have raised the average salary to $80,000 in a good year inspire loyalty. (Nucor did not release specific information about the wage scale.)In lean times, pay can fall by a third, but the job remains. A no-layoff tradition, even during the Great Recession, means Nucor can keep trained workers who are ready to stoke up when demand picks up.When the recession hit in 2008, \u201cthe board of directors thought we had lost our minds\u201d for not cutting staff, Mr. Daughtridge said. \u201cBut we spend a lot of time, money and effort hiring and training,\u201d he explained, detailing a process that takes 12 to 18 months, includes strict alcohol and drug testing, and involves as many as seven interviews and vetting by a psychologist. Keeping those workers saves money in the long run, he said: \u201cWe have the highest wages and the lowest cost per ton.\u201dBusiness cycles are familiar to longtime employees. \u201cThe steel industry always had its ups and downs,\u201d said Nina Jones, 62, a 19-year veteran at the plant who inspects the shiny zinc-coated steel after it hardens. Ms. Jones, who wears gray-and-blue Kevlar gloves and steel-toed boots that had to be specially ordered in a small size for her, said that her father worked in the industry and her brother works the same shift schedule at Nucor that she does. The ceaseless and conflicting reports coming out of Washington, more than 500 miles away, have left her weary of politics, but cautiously optimistic about the industry\u2019s prospects.\u201cI want to stay positive and hope manufacturing will come back,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m waiting and seeing.\u201dCertainly, the type of divisions over budget deficits and program cuts that have shadowed the Republicans\u2019 health care bill could also interfere with policies the steel industry is counting on \u2014 corporate tax cuts, tougher enforcement of trade rules and an expensive infrastructure bill. At the same time, uncertainty about the future may slow overall growth.Still, for all the contention that has dogged Mr. Trump since the election, Mr. Daughtridge said that none of the suppliers and workers that he regularly spoke with were having second thoughts about voting for him. \u201cI don\u2019t hear any buyer\u2019s remorse from them,\u201d he said.Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Auto Boom Seems to Be History, Just as Trump Counted on Jobs", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byFor seven years, the steadily expanding auto industry has helped drive the American economy forward, racking up billions in profit and paying workers hefty bonuses, all while consumers flocked to dealerships and drove sales to record heights.It is a boom that President Trump has been counting on to add more jobs. But the industry\u2019s ability to do so is now in question.On Tuesday, automakers reported the fourth straight monthly retreat in sales of new cars and light trucks, the longest stretch of declines since 2009, when the industry was embroiled in crisis and bankruptcies. The slump underscores the view of many that auto sales have peaked and are set to trend downward.\u201cThe market is tapped out,\u201d said Adam Silverleib, vice president of Silko Honda, a dealership in Raynham, Mass. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer expanding at the rate the manufacturers thought it would.\u201dHe added that the more optimistic consumer sentiment recorded since Mr. Trump\u2019s election \u201chasn\u2019t translated into what\u2019s happening in dealerships where we\u2019re trying to sell cars.\u201dMoreover, the top six automakers in the American market all reported declines from their April sales a year ago, and in every case the falloff exceeded analysts\u2019 forecasts. Wall Street took notice: Shares of Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles were down more than 4 percent, and General Motors shares fell almost 3 percent.In April, automakers sold 1.43 million cars and trucks, down from 1.5 million a year ago. But even before those totals were reported, automakers had started preparing to trim the number of vehicles they are making, which almost always means jobs are eliminated.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.Some 1,100 workers at a General Motors plant in Lansing, Mich., are being laid off this month and will be out of work for at least the next five months, although about 700 of them are expected to be rehired by the end of the year. Three other G.M. plants are eliminating shifts, moves that will idle more than 3,000 other workers.\u201cWe are very cognizant that we operate in a cyclical industry, and we are in the eighth year of expansion,\u201d the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, said in a conference call last week after the company reported first-quarter earnings. \u201cWe are very focused on acting like we are in a downturn.\u201dThe automakers\u2019 comeback since the 2009 crisis had been driven in large part by low gasoline prices that have fed Americans\u2019 tastes for sport utility vehicles and trucks \u2014 particularly profitable categories, and the models more likely to be assembled in the United States rather than Mexico. Sales also benefited from pent-up demand as recession turned to recovery.Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler both saw their sales fall 7 percent or more in April, while Honda\u2019s fell 6.3 percent and General Motors\u2019 5.8 percent. Toyota declined 3.5 percent, and Nissan dipped 2 percent. (Those figures exclude the Japanese makers\u2019 luxury brands.)Like G.M., Fiat Chrysler has idled several thousand workers this year while it retools factories in Toledo, Ohio, and Belvidere, Ill.Further production cuts may be coming. Many analysts have forecast that auto sales will suffer a small decline this year \u2014 to about 17.2 million vehicles from the record of 17.5 million sold in 2016. But some expect the industry to see larger declines after that. AlixPartners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice, is predicting that auto sales will decline to 16.6 million vehicles in 2018, and 15.2 million in 2019.Mark Wakefield, a managing partner at Alix, said such declines would force manufacturers to lower production further. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it already,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the manufacturers take capacity out, that means less overtime, or actual layoffs.\u201dThe trend toward lower production runs counter to the wishes of Mr. Trump, who has been pushing carmakers to make more cars in the United States and import fewer from other countries, including Mexico and Canada.Slowing sales is not the only trouble the industry is facing. Inventories on dealer lots are rising. As of the end of April, G.M. had enough cars to last 100 days at the current rate of sales. The industry considers 60 days ideal.Interest rates, if they rise later this year as the Federal Reserve intends, could crimp sales further.Automakers are also resorting to ever sweeter incentives to sell models like small and midsize cars, which have been eclipsed by larger vehicles. In April, Hyundai Motor, the South Korean automaker, offered discounts of $5,000 or more on its Sonata sedan. \u201cMidsized cars are really struggling,\u201d said Andrew DiFeo, owner of a Hyundai franchise in St. Augustine, Fla.Another challenge comes from the increasing supply and falling prices of late-model used cars. Some 3.6 million leased vehicles are due to be turned in this year, according to Manheim, an auto auction company. Another 4.1 million are due back in the market next year. Most of those will end up on dealer lots, where they make enticing and less expensive alternative to new cars.Mr. Silverleib, the Honda dealer in Massachusetts, is seeing the impact already. In April, his dealership sold 104 used cars, compared with 65 a year ago. It sold 99 new vehicles, four fewer than a year ago.\u201cWhat that tells me is new sales are stagnant,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the Massachusetts city in which Silko Honda is located.

The candidate of the far-right National Front had not improved her already difficult position against the centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron.With her sneering mockery of Mr. Macron, her tone and her use of epithets, she had revealed something essential about herself despite years of effort to soften her party\u2019s image, in the view of commentators.\u201cI was myself surprised, as she revealed herself as what is worst about the far right in France,\u201d G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a veteran political scientist at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques, known as Sciences-Po, said in an interview.Even her own father, the National Front patriarch and founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, declared that she \u201cwasn\u2019t up to it\u201d during the two-and-half-hour debate, though he still supports her.

Significantly, however, many observers saw in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s principal debate tactic an unwelcome guest: the big lie.Mr. Macron repeatedly called her a liar during the debate, and newspaper commentaries on Thursday backed him up. \u201cMarine Le Pen: The Strategy of the Lie,\u201d was the banner headline on Le Monde\u2019s front page, which went on to say that the \u201cdeliberate tactic was largely inspired by what Donald Trump practiced in the American campaign.\u201dThe newspaper detailed \u201cThe 19 lies of Marine Le Pen\u201d during the debate about topics including \u201cBrexit,\u201d the euro, the European Union and terrorism. On all these subjects, the newspaper demonstrated that Ms. Le Pen had put forward half-truths and outright falsehoods.She was revealed as \u201cthe heir of a practice of politics that has always been based on denigration and threat,\u201d Le Monde said in its front-page editorial. \u201cThe imitator, besides, of Donald Trump, piling on, just like the American president, lying insinuation.\u201dThe Macron camp was quick to pick up on the negative parallel between President Trump and Ms. Le Pen, posting a video on Twitter in which Americans and Britons express regret about voting for Mr. Trump and for Brexit, and warning that \u201cthis Sunday, France will have to make a choice; the worst is not impossible.\u201dMs. Le Pen has significantly backed away from her early enthusiastic declarations in favor of Mr. Trump since his chaotic beginnings. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama announced on Thursday he was supporting Mr. Macron, in a video posted on Mr. Macron\u2019s Twitter feed.One \u201cinsinuation\u201d from Ms. Le Pen in the Wednesday debate may wind up costing her. At the end, she suggested that Mr. Macron might have \u201can offshore account,\u201d later acknowledging she had no proof.Such an accusation is extremely serious for public figures in France, especially in the court of public opinion. The Paris prosecutor has opened an investigation into whether fake news is being used to influence the election, and Mr. Macron has announced a lawsuit against right-wing websites over the suggestion.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s tactics on Wednesday, eschewing any kind of detailed exposition of policies and instead relying on epithet-slinging \u2014 Mr. Macron was \u201cthe privileged child of the system and the elites,\u201d and the \u201crepresentative of subjugated France\u201d \u2014 would have been familiar to anyone attending her rallies across France this election season. Her supporters roar at these verbal sallies.But such language is not normally part of mainstream political discourse in France. And that fact set up the collision of Wednesday night, and the tone of dismay and shock in the commentaries.The second-round presidential debate has become almost a sacred ritual in French politics. Fifteen years ago, Jacques Chirac, the former president, refused to dignify Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father in a debate when he unexpectedly made the second round. That Ms. Le Pen was not given that treatment in 2017, commentators suggested, meant that she had been accepted as a legitimate partner in the democratic process.But on Thursday, French news media and academic commentators suggested she had violated that trust by her \u201cviolence,\u201d as many put it. \u201cMaybe she wanted to reassure her electorate,\u201d Marc Lazar, a historian, said in an interview, \u201cor maybe she was just showing her true nature.\u201d\u201cShe has wanted to show that she has \u2018undemonized\u2019 the party,\u201d Mr. Lazar continued, referring to the effort Ms. Le Pen has undertaken to distance the National Front from the hate-filled declarations of her father. \u201cBut in the end, she just proved that she is her father\u2019s daughter. I think there were a lot of people who were surprised, because they thought she had really changed.\u201dEven veteran Front-watchers were taken aback by Ms. Le Pen\u2019s actions on Wednesday night. \u201cIt was transformed into a fight, not a debate,\u201d said Val\u00e9rie Igounet, the leading historian of the National Front.On Thursday, one of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s more prominent supporters, the filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin, wrote in an op-ed in Le Monde addressed to Mr. Macron in the wake of the debate: \u201cYou are detested already, before even having set foot in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e,\u201d referring to the presidential residence.More typical of Thursday\u2019s reactions, though, was that of an editorial in the southern La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi, in Toulouse: \u201cThe \u2018decisive\u2019 debate was above all a revelatory debate. Through lies and incessant interruptions, striking proof was given last night that it is difficult, if not impossible, to debate with the far right, in conditions of minimal democratic respect.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A First Step to Peace: Calm Angers, Then Talk", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLet\u2019s face it: Current political realities have made a final status agreement between Israelis and Palestinians unachievable now. So Israelis need to focus instead on creating conditions, on both sides, in which an accord might be possible in the future.To be sure, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\u2019s visit to Israel last month and President Trump\u2019s scheduled meeting on Wednesday with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, could lead to new talks.But even if they do, resumed negotiations now would almost certainly fail \u2014 or boomerang. Every other attempt at direct, bilateral negotiations has failed, and violence has often followed. Each disappointment, in turn, only deepens the profound mistrust and misunderstandings between the leaders on both sides, which further erodes confidence among Israelis and Palestinians that peace can ever be attained.In short, the peace process is broken.Yet it remains true that only a two-state solution can safeguard the Zionist dream \u2014 a state that is Jewish, democratic and secure. A unitary state would no longer be Jewish if a majority Arab population controlled it, nor a democracy if a Jewish minority ruled an Arab majority. It would instead be a breeding ground for prolonged civil war.Therefore, the goal of securing a comprehensive peace agreement needs to be set aside for now, and preserving hope for a two-state solution be made the objective. The immediate goal should be a realistic interim arrangement that could calm antagonisms and improve prospects for a political and psychological climate on both sides that would allow a two-state peace deal sometime in the future.The Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security, a network of 270 retired Israeli generals who have served at the highest echelons of the Israeli military, police and intelligence forces, has developed a program for such an arrangement. Its pragmatic proposals would immediately improve Israelis\u2019 security, halt and reverse the erosion of conditions for a negotiated two-state solution and enhance Israel\u2019s regional and international standing. At the same time, it would improve living and economic conditions for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. And it can be put into practice now.The program would allow Jewish settlers now in the West Bank to remain where they are, pending a final agreement, with the Israel Defense Force the only military force west of the Jordan River. But construction beyond built-up areas in the major settlement blocs, where 80 percent of settlers reside, would be prohibited, and Israel would acknowledge that the 92 percent of West Bank land east of Israel\u2019s security barrier would be included in a future Palestinian state.Israel would close gaps in that security barrier, but also reroute segments of it to minimize the disruption of Palestinian lives.Building on the successes to date of Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, the Palestinian police force would gradually expand its coverage to include some 700,000 Palestinians who now have no police protection. This would be accomplished by redesignating segments of the West Bank now under full Israeli civilian and security control (about 10 percent of the land) to bring them under Palestinian civil and administrative control. The expansion would produce greater Palestinian territorial contiguity.Perceiving a current alignment of regional interests among Israel and moderate Sunni Arab states, Israel would accept the Arab Peace Initiative offered in 2002, with reservations, as a basis for future negotiations.These and other steps can be taken independently by Israel today. They do not entail dismantling any settlements or evacuating any Israeli soldiers before an agreement is negotiated. Nevertheless, they would halt the descent into a one-state nightmare, even as they improved Israel\u2019s daily security.While the commanders\u2019 proposal \u2014 which is endorsed by our organization \u2014 would not bring a final settlement now, it would increase public confidence among Israelis and Palestinians that a lasting peace is, indeed, possible by tangibly improving their daily lives. For Israelis, it would reduce border infiltration that enables terrorism. For Palestinians, it would improve their economy and daily life, not just by making their land more contiguous, but also by expanding the role of their own police in guarding their security.And for both sides, freezing the expansion of Israeli settlements would enhance hope for the possibility of reaching a two-state solution.Ultimately, the improved atmosphere for talks could facilitate negotiations on two tracks \u2014 between Israelis and Palestinians to separate into two states, and between Israel and Arab countries to achieve normal relations and a regional security structure.The commanders\u2019 group realizes, as do we, that this will not be easy; provocateurs on both sides would seek to prevent a two-state solution. However, an extended period of calm and a reduction of points of friction would reduce the ability of these spoilers to influence policy and public opinion. Over time, a new atmosphere would enable leaders to resist provocation and move toward a negotiated final status agreement, buoyed by their publics\u2019 desire to live in two separate states, and their confidence that it is possible.The United States would do well to support this plan, encourage Israel to carry it out, and call on the Palestinians and moderate Arab states to reciprocate toward Israel with equally constructive steps.The generals\u2019 program is a pragmatic way forward to preserve an Israel that is Jewish, democratic and secure. The vast majority of American Jews \u2014 indeed, all Americans \u2014 should support it, as should all Israelis.Charles R. Bronfman is the advisory council chairman and Susie Gelman is the board chairwoman of Israel Policy Forum.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump\u2019s indictment of an entire religion had disfigured his campaign and his presidency, undermined America\u2019s long commitment to freedom of religion and gave fresh ammunition to the extremists Mr. Trump cannot defeat without the support of Muslim leaders.Much of the rest of his message was more problematic. He said nothing about the need to advance the cause of human rights in Muslim societies that discriminate against women and minorities. He sketched an unsettling path forward in which the United States and the Sunni Muslims would join in common cause against not only the extremists but against Iran, a position that could come back to haunt him.The man who once complained that \u201cIslam hates us\u201d described it as \u201cone of the world\u2019s great faiths.\u201d He said the fight against terrorism was not a \u201cbattle between different faiths,\u201d as some of his advisers had argued, but a struggle \u201cbetween barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life and decent people, all in the name of religion.\u201d He urged Muslim leaders to drive extremists \u201cout of your places of worship,\u201d \u201cout of your communities,\u201d \u201cout of your holy land\u201d and \u201cout of this earth.\u201dBut he provided no guidance as to how the war against extremism could be won, and showed no appreciation for the fact that Wahhabism, the fundamentalist Sunni orthodoxy that gives legitimacy to Saudi Arabia\u2019s royal family, has inspired ISIS and most other regional terrorist groups. Nor did he suggest, as President Barack Obama often did, that Muslim countries are unlikely to wipe out extremism until they reform their economies and political systems so their people have ways to address their grievances, to participate in governing, to obtain an education and jobs.Mr. Trump chose instead to single out Iran, the leading Shiite-majority state and Saudi Arabia\u2019s main enemy, as a threat because of its support for militias in Lebanon and Yemen and for its backing of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Many of Iran\u2019s activities are indeed destabilizing; but Mr. Trump\u2019s friend Vladimir Putin has been no less responsible for keeping Mr. Assad in power.Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to forge an anti-Iran alliance with the Sunni Arab states and isolate Iran could drift into military confrontation. The nuclear agreement negotiated between Iran and the United States could unravel, causing a split with America\u2019s European allies.

{"Headline": "The Battle Over Water on the Upper Delaware", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorHANCOCK, N.Y. \u2014 Four years ago, I traded a job in a big, noisy office in Washington, D.C., for one in a little storefront on the main drag of a town on the banks of the Upper Delaware River in the Catskills. My new job included protecting one of the finest wild trout fisheries on the East Coast, but I didn\u2019t start by meeting lawmakers and writing letters and rallying support. That came later. First, I fished.For two full months in the spring of 2013, I waded and floated the river, fishing for wild browns and rainbows in the company of a band of guides and anglers who dedicate no small portions of their lives to the pursuit.It did not take me two months to learn why this place is so special to so many. It\u2019s not just a pretty river meandering through beautiful countryside. It\u2019s a river with big, hard-pulling wild trout, native born and discerning enough to challenge even the most experienced angler. You start catching fish like these, and you\u2019ll never want to leave.When I returned to reality, I got to work. We\u2019ve had some successes in protecting the river. But the Upper Delaware is a fragile ecosystem, and now it is threatened by a bitter dispute between New Jersey and New York City over water availability, and how much should be released into the river for the fishery and downstream states from reservoirs that provide water to the city.It\u2019s crunchtime. If public officials cannot reach an agreement before midnight on May 31, reservoir releases to the river will be cut, resulting in extremely low water levels and potentially high water temperatures in the river \u2014 exactly the opposite of what is needed for a thriving trout fishery.It\u2019s not just anglers who will suffer. The Upper Delaware watershed is less than a three-hour drive away for millions of people. Many who travel here cherish the high-quality outdoor recreational experiences. Tourism is the leading revenue generator in a region desperate for economic revival. A 2014 report valued the impact of the river\u2019s fishing, boating and second-home market on the regional economy at $414 million.So local businesses \u2014 boosted by the millions of dollars visitors spend every year on things like food, lodging, fuel, tackle, boats and second homes \u2014 will foot the bill for the political stalemate.The irony is that this fishery and this tourism economy owe their existence to the very New York City water supply reservoirs that are at the center of the dispute. When cold, clean water is released from the bottom of the dams in sufficient quantities, the Upper Delaware ecosystem comes to life.A 1954 Supreme Court decree compelled New York City and the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware to work cooperatively to divvy up reservoir water in a way that satisfies the city\u2019s water demands and also meets a broad array of needs throughout the entire Delaware basin.After decades of complex negotiations, the parties settled on a temporary agreement in 2007, and although it is not perfect, the plan does allow for enough cold-water releases to support reasonably healthy ecological conditions in the river most of the time.This will wreak havoc on the Upper Delaware River. Reservoir releases will be dramatically slashed. The 51 miles that now qualify for \u201cexcellent\u201d cold-water protections will shrink to 13 miles. Large stretches of the riverbed could be left dry for days or weeks. Highly erratic \u201cyo-yo\u201d releases from the reservoirs will cause widespread ecological instability. The river-based tourism economy will suffer.Remarkably, most experts agree that there is sufficient water to satisfy everyone\u2019s needs. But this fact seems to be lost on the bureaucrats battling over water allocations.As next week\u2019s deadline approaches, it\u2019s time for the four governors and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York to step in and agree on a path forward. Where to start? Maybe they could do what I did four years ago \u2014 spend some time on the river and refocus on what really matters: the health of this special ecosystem, and the welfare of the people and local communities that rely on it so heavily.Jeff Skelding is executive director of Friends of the Upper Delaware.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airbnb Settles Lawsuit With Its Hometown, San Francisco", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Airbnb agreed on Monday to settle a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco, putting to rest litigation that could have hampered the company\u2019s efforts to expand and go public.The latest settlement removes a regulatory cloud over the company as it readies itself for a public offering, even though Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco and has a valuation of about $30 billion, still faces legal disputes in a handful of markets. The company\u2019s chief executive, Brian Chesky, said this year that the company could be ready to go public in a year.Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business who studies the so-called sharing economy, said, \u201cAs Airbnb gears up to go public over the next couple of years, creating a stable environment with less regulatory uncertainty is good for them.\u201d He added, \u201cWhile it is well past the point where regulations pose an existential threat to the company, regulatory issues are still the biggest source of uncertainty about its future revenue streams.\u201dAirbnb and another short-term rental company, HomeAway, brought the lawsuit against San Francisco in June over a decision by the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors to fine the companies $1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service.The board imposed the fines after it realized that hosts had not been complying with a cumbersome process passed in 2014 that asked them to register in person at a city office overseeing short-term rentals. Airbnb was so influential in the creation of the original rule that it was often referred to as the Airbnb law. Airbnb responded to the fines by suing the city.David Campos, a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said at a news conference announcing the settlement, \u201cThree years ago, we said the law being passed, which was written by Airbnb, won\u2019t work because there was no skin in the game in terms of enforcement.\u201dUnder the settlement between the city and the companies, Airbnb and other services like HomeAway will collect data from people who rent their homes out for less than a month on their sites. San Francisco will use that information to vet and register hosts.Companies like Airbnb will have to regularly provide the city with the data it needs to enforce local laws. The companies will also cancel reservations and deactivate listings if the city notifies them of an invalid registration.The city also preserved its ability to hold companies like Airbnb accountable by fining them $1,000 per violation if they do not take down illegal listings.\u201cThere are 2,100 registered hosts and about 8,000 listed. We don\u2019t have exact numbers, but it\u2019s not a secret that there are a lot of folks gaming the system and violating the law,\u201d Dennis J. Herrera, the San Francisco city attorney, said.\u201cWe want to work with cities as partners,\u201d said Chris Lehane, the head of public policy at Airbnb. \u201cWe are appreciative of the work with the San Francisco city attorney\u2019s office.\u201d Mr. Lehane said the new system would likely be put into effect by 2018.Mr. Lehane declined to say how settling outstanding legislation would affect the company\u2019s ability to go public. He said complying with laws and working with local governments would allow Airbnb to \u201cbuild the foundation\u201d and make sure it was \u201cgetting the basics right.\u201dThe settlement is contingent on the approval of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, some of whom spoke favorably of the deal at a news conference hosted by Mr. Herrera.\u201cThis is all part of a broader shift towards Airbnb taking on more regulatory responsibility,\u201d Mr. Sundararajan said. \u201cIt\u2019s also first steps, over time, toward governments trusting Airbnb to assume more responsibility for regulating their hosts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macron Decisively Defeats Le Pen in French Presidential Race", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Emmanuel Macron, a youthful former investment banker, handily won France\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, defeating the staunch nationalist Marine Le Pen after voters firmly rejected her far-right message and backed his call for centrist change.The election was watched around the world for magnifying many of the broader tensions rippling through Western democracies, including the United States: populist anger at the political mainstream, economic insecurity among middle-class voters and rising resentment toward immigrants.Mr. Macron\u2019s victory offered significant relief to the European Union, which Ms. Le Pen had threatened to leave. His platform to loosen labor rules, make France more competitive globally and deepen ties with the European Union is also likely to reassure a global financial market that was jittery at the prospect of a Le Pen victory.Her loss provided further signs that the populist wave that swept Britain out of the European Union and Donald J. Trump into the White House may have crested in Europe, for now.\u201cI understand the divisions of our country that have led some to vote for extremists,\u201d Mr. Macron said after the vote. \u201cI understand the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that a great part among us have also expressed.\u201dMr. Macron pledged to do all he could in his five-year term to bring France together. \u201cI will do everything I can in the coming five years to make sure you never have a reason to vote for extremism again,\u201d he said later Sunday evening, standing before the glass pyramid in front of the Louvre, once the main residence of France\u2019s kings, as thousands of flag-waving supporters gathered in the courtyard to celebrate.But the election results showed that many people chose not to vote for either candidate, signaling skepticism about his project. And Mr. Macron quickly made clear that he understood the magnitude of the task before him after an often angry campaign.Detailed maps of the French presidential election show how Emmanuel Macron decisively beat right-wing nationalist Marine Le Pen.\u201cIt is my responsibility to hear and protect the most fragile,\u201d he said.With nearly 100 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Macron had 66 percent, compared with 34 percent for Ms. Le Pen, according to the official count from the Interior Ministry.As significant for France and for Mr. Macron\u2019s future, nearly 34 percent of eligible voters did not cast a ballot or cast a blank or null one, suggesting that a large number of people could not bring themselves to vote for him. The abstention rate was the highest since 1969.That lack of support presaged a difficult road ahead as Mr. Macron tries to build a legislative majority to push through his program. French parliamentary elections are next month. Currently, he has no party in Parliament.Among the odds stacked against Mr. Macron, a former economy minister in the departing Socialist government, are deep doubts about the merits of a market economy.\u201cWe saw the emergence of very strong anticapitalist forces,\u201d said Gaspard Koenig, the director of the French think tank Generation Libre.\u201cYou have 50 percent of the electorate that reject the market economy in a very radical way,\u201d Mr. Koenig added. \u201cThus, he must during the next five years convince people that there are alternatives to the destruction of capitalism that can help them.\u201dMs. Le Pen, 48, conceded the election not long after polls closed in France, saying voters had chosen \u201ccontinuity,\u201d denying Mr. Macron his outsider status and linking him to the departing Socialists.The vote was a record for the National Front and, she said, a mandate for it to become a new \u201cpatriotic and republican alliance\u201d that would be \u201cthe primary opposition force against the new president.\u201dMs. Le Pen earned 10.6 million votes, close to twice the number her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, received when he ran a losing presidential campaign against Jacques Chirac in 2002. The 34 percent of the vote Ms. Le Pen won was the highest share the French had ever given to her party.The election was also the first in which the National Front candidate \u2014 rather than being a pariah who was shut out of debates and kept off the front pages of major newspapers, as happened in 2002 \u2014 was treated more like a normal candidate despite the party\u2019s anti-Semitic and racist roots.After taking over the party leadership in 2011, Ms. Le Pen worked to distance the National Front from her father, its founder. St\u00e9phane Ravier, a National Front senator and a close adviser to Ms. Le Pen, said the party needed to go further in remaking its identity.\u201cWe will need to make some changes, do things differently,\u201d he said in an interview as the returns came in. \u201cWe will have to talk about our positions on the euro with more pedagogy. We may also have to change the name of the party.\u201dIn her concession speech, Ms. Le Pen acknowledged that the party had to \u201cprofoundly\u201d renew itself to become a \u201cnew political force.\u201dMr. Macron formed his political movement, En Marche! (Onward!), a little more than a year ago. He was initially given a slim chance of winning in a country that has never elected a president from outside the traditional left-wing or right-wing parties, with the exception of Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, a centrist who led from 1974 to 1981.Since then, French politics has been dominated by the Socialists on the left and the Republicans (or their precursors) on the right.Mr. Macron\u2019s message \u2014 that his new movement was neither right nor left, but represented a third way, with elements of both \u2014 seemed to appeal to numerous urban voters, as well as to many young voters.As the results appeared on a screen set up at the Louvre, Macron supporters shouted with joy. Some started singing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem.\u201cThis is a historic moment,\u201d said Jacques Pupponi, 60, who came with his children: No\u00e9, 11; Dora, 12; and Eden, 13.\u201cI\u2019ve lived moments like this before, in 1981,\u201d he added, referring to the election of the Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. \u201cI\u2019m very happy about the score \u2014 it\u2019s very, very important,\u201d Mr. Pupponi said of Mr. Macron\u2019s decisive victory.For Mourad Djebali, 30, a Tunisian engineer who obtained French citizenship a few months ago, the result felt like a personal affirmation. \u201cI\u2019m moved,\u201d Mr. Djebali said. \u201cI recognize the France that has received me.\u201cIt\u2019s a great symbol of France,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of hope. Everyone doesn\u2019t agree with each other, but that one thing we agree on is that we should not open the door to the extremes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Budget Cuts? More Like Radical Surgery", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byAs the chart below shows, defense receives an increase, Medicare and Social Security retirement are left almost entirely unchanged and pretty much everything else is massively trimmed. (All projected changes are in relation to current law, and these figures are not adjusted for inflation, making the effective cuts from today\u2019s spending levels that much greater.)That means that President Trump, who vowed during the campaign not to touch Medicaid, now wants to cut it in half by 2027. He must really, really not like the poor.More than 74 million Americans, many of them impoverished single mothers, receive Medicaid. Are we actually going to impose far harsher treatment on this group than even the much reviled Republican health care legislation? Never in our history have we rolled back so dramatically a social program of such import.But let\u2019s not give short shrift to the equally large reductions in a vast array of domestic discretionary programs, ranging from education to environment to research and development and so many more.The new budget would take these areas down to roughly 1.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2027, well less than half of its 50-year average share of the economy of 3.8 percent.Many of these programs are investments in our future; we should be allocating more, not less, to them.Much has been made of $2 trillion that O.M.B. double counted. The reality is that the artificial math involved much bigger sums. Most importantly, the budget office completely ignored the president\u2019s massive planned tax cut, whose cost has been estimated at $6.3 trillion over the next five years, (including $1 trillion of tax reductions included in the health care legislation).At the same time, the proposal assumes that economic growth, which O.M.B. had been projecting at 2.2 percent, will accelerate to 3 percent.But no reputable economic forecaster believes that is possible, with or without the tax cut. Our labor force is aging and productivity growth has been waning, leading most economists to expect growth to remain roughly in the current range of 2 percent.Lastly, the $4.5 trillion of spending cuts that the administration seeks (including $1.25 trillion in the House health care bill) are by no means assured. Some would require 60 votes \u2014 and therefore a measure of Democratic support \u2014 to go into effect. Others that can be passed with 50 votes, such as the Medicaid evisceration, already face opposition from more moderate Republican senators.So to the extent that these plans are blocked, the deficit would be that much larger.All told, a budget that the Trump administration said would reduce red ink over the coming decade by $3.6 trillion would, in reality, add at least $1.7 trillion and possibly a good bit more.That\u2019s hardly the fiscal responsibility that the White House has been claiming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little Red Book for Children", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byRed CenturyThere\u2019s only one small problem: None of it is true.To do so, Ms. Adamczak tells a tale of peasants surviving the transition from feudalism to capitalism, a story about workers adapting to the market demands of capitalist productivity and a parable about different, failed attempts by proletarians and unemployed people to improve their social and economic conditions through collective organizing. Scary stuff, I know. Although the narrative is full of suffering, defeat and failure, the real scandal of the book lies in its optimism, its hope that another world is still possible in the womb of the old. More outrageous, such hope cannot be decreed from above by politicians, leaders or businesspeople, but only created from below by people struggling together for a fair, dignified and free way of life.Long before the Soviet Union crushed all political tendencies that favored a more libertarian form of socialism, the name for that way of life free from the misery of wage labor was called communism. In the philosophical epilogue to her book, Ms. Adamczak explicitly confronts the problem of how to speak about communism after a century of disasters committed in its name. As she makes abundantly clear, it\u2019s not easy.And yet, that doesn\u2019t let us off the hook. The only way to truly understand the failures of communism is to take seriously the motivations, desires and ideals of those who advocated it. But to do that, one must first understand capitalism.Alas, the history of communism is littered with failed attempts by communists to be better at capitalism than the capitalists themselves. As Ms. Adamczak argues, this is because most communist criticisms of capitalism take one idealized aspect of capitalist society and pit it against the others, unwittingly perpetuating the framework communism sets out to abolish. This recipe for disaster recurs throughout history, and the only way to stop it is for everyone to learn about the unsuccessful attempts at revolution, so as not to repeat those mistakes in their current struggles. Hence, \u201cCommunism for Kids.\u201dNaming the problem may be the first step toward curing the illness, but it doesn\u2019t yet tell us how to proceed. For that, we need ideas, experiments and dreams. Is it wise to dream about utopia while living in the dystopia of the present?There\u2019s another reading of Adorno\u2019s remark. We may not be able to live a wrong life rightly, but we can stop living wrongly altogether. To do that requires a depth of social imagination, the courage of collective struggle and a wellspring of political desire that seems all but evaporated in the present moment. \u201cCommunism for Kids\u201d is not a message in a bottle to some imagined future audience; it is rather a collection of broken shards from lost futures still jammed in the present. It is a cry from behind the curtain of history to rectify the injustices of the past by attending to the suffering of the present. I suggest we pay attention.Jacob Blumenfeld, a writer and translator, is a researcher in philosophy at the New School for Social Research.This is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}

By far the largest contingent of foreign students, they can be an economic lifeline for colleges, since they usually pay full tuition, and they can provide a healthy dose of international diversity.But those students often bring to campus something else from home: the watchful eyes and occasionally heavy hand of the Chinese government, manifested through its ties to many of the 150-odd chapters of the Chinese Students and Scholars Associations.In rare instances, members of the student group have been accused of spying.\u201cI basically don\u2019t think that any student organizations that are controlled by their government \u2014 which clearly the C.S.S.A. is \u2014 should have a presence on foreign university campuses,\u201d said Jeffrey Henderson, a professor of international development at the University of Bristol in England.Two days before the workshop, Dr. Henderson said, he received an email on behalf of the president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association stating that the Chinese Embassy in London was \u201cvery concerned that nothing should go on in the workshop that disturbs the harmonious relationship between Hong Kong and China.\u201dDr. Henderson arrived with plans to ignore the embassy guidance. Yet he found the seminar\u2019s Q. and A. session tightly controlled, permitting only written questions that had been vetted.For the most part, the clubs function as run-of-the-mill campus groups, providing transportation for new arrivals, sponsoring Lunar New Year celebrations and organizing bilingual job fairs. Joining the Chinese Students and Scholars Association on some campuses is competitive. Students are required to apply for spots on club committees, and being accepted confers a certain measure of prestige; members often trumpet it on their LinkedIn pages.Neither the Chinese embassies in Washington and London nor the consulate in Los Angeles responded to questions about their ties to the student organizations.\u201cSo it\u2019s true that we have connections with the consulate, but it\u2019s not the kind of relations that many people say we have,\u201d said Mr. Yao, a probability and statistics major from Zhuhai, China. \u201cThey think we represent the Chinese government, that we do things the Chinese government tells us to do, things like that, but that\u2019s not true.\u201dChinese Students and Scholars Association groups started to spread in the 1980s as the number of Chinese students studying abroad began to grow. \u201cI came to the U.S. and thought, \u2018Wow, great, I\u2019m in a free country, now I hope that everything is cool and happy,\u2019\u201d said Frank Tian Xie, who arrived in the late 1980s to study chemistry at Purdue University. \u201cBut I found out that the government extended their control to even Chinese students in America.\u201dDr. Xie, now a professor at the University of South Carolina, Aiken, said the Chinese Consulate in Chicago tried to handpick officers of the organization and periodically sent a representative to meet with students in a motel room.Li Fengzhi, a longtime employee of the Chinese Ministry of State Security who came to the United States in 2003 as a graduate student at the University of Denver, said that the Chinese government did not see the group so much as a spying operation, but rather as a propaganda and \u201cinformation collection organization.\u201d Mr. Li eventually defected and was debriefed by F.B.I. counterintelligence agents about the group\u2019s activities.The ties between the Chinese government and the student groups are not exactly secret. At some colleges, like the University of Connecticut and the University of North Texas, the groups\u2019 websites mention that they are supported by or affiliated with Chinese consulates.Michigan Technological University\u2019s group acknowledges a relationship with the Chinese Embassy, then adds, \u201cHowever, C.S.S.A. will not participate in any political revolutions, unless in special conditions.\u201dIn 2005, authorities in Belgium said they had identified another Chinese spy \u2014 a member of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at Leuven University \u2014 coordinating industrial espionage agents throughout Europe, according to an unclassified 2011 F.B.I. report.At Columbia in 2007, a Canadian human rights lawyer, David Matas, arrived to find heavy security and a protest by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association against his presentation on China\u2019s mistreatment of adherents of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that combines portions of Buddhism, meditation and exercise and is banned by the government.Later, a threatening email \u2014 apparently directed at Mr. Matas \u2014 was sent to the Columbia group\u2019s website, stating, \u201cAnyone who offends China will be executed no matter how far away they are,\u201d Mr. Matas said recently.Last month the Columbia chapter held its annual China Prospects Conference at the Low Memorial Library at Columbia, focusing on economic policy and sustainable development. Several dozen government, academic and business leaders spoke to an audience of mostly Chinese students, and the agenda avoided third-rail topics such as human rights, Taiwan and the Dalai Lama.Several colleges where the Chinese Students and Scholars Association openly acknowledges ties to the Chinese government, including Columbia, said such ties did not violate any college rules. But colleges have found themselves caught up in Chinese politics just the same.At U.C. San Diego, about 3,500 undergraduates hail from China, or more than 10 percent of the student body. They pay more than twice what California students pay, providing critical revenue at a time when the University of California system is financially pressured.Other than Mr. Yao, the exiting club president, members of the group declined requests for interviews. But some other Chinese students said they also were offended by the Dalai Lama\u2019s invitation. At the Price Center, a campus student center and food court, several who were eating lunch one recent afternoon predicted protests on June 17, commencement day. One said his parents were going to miss his graduation because they refused to be present for the Dalai Lama\u2019s speech.Shiwei Terry Zhou, a junior from Wuhan, China, said the students felt targeted by the university\u2019s decision. \u201cWe make good grades. We don\u2019t make trouble. We pay a lot,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cWhat is the motivation?\u201dDespite the pressure, the university has not backed down. At a meeting with Mr. Khosla, members of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association asked that the university at least refrain from referring to the Dalai Lama as a \u201cspiritual leader\u201d and that he be prevented from discussing politics.\u201cRebranding is very important so we won\u2019t take this personally, maybe,\u201d Mr. Yao said.The university has not said if it will comply with those demands. In a statement, it said it has always \u201cserved as a forum for discussion and interaction on important public policy issues and respects the rights of individuals to agree or disagree as we consider issues of our complex world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He had published a book of poetry, \u201cThe Man Among the Seals,\u201d at 19 and earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Iowa. But addictions to alcohol and drugs, including heroin, derailed him. He was in a psychiatric ward at 21, he said, and hospitalized again during the first of his three marriages.Mr. Johnson initially believed that sobriety would damage his creativity, but later realized that his addictions were not fueling much writing.\u201cI finally figured it only meant I\u2019d be writing three paragraphs less a year,\u201d he told New York magazine in 2002, \u201cbecause I\u2019d only written two stories and 37 poems in almost a decade.\u201dThat output would accelerate. By the early 1980s he was sober and had begun a prolific few decades, turning out novels, plays, poetry and journalism.

He was in the middle of taking the last breath of his life before he realized he was taking it.\u201dIn 1992 he published \u201cJesus\u2019 Son,\u201d a collection of 11 short stories about petty crimes and murder across a desperate American landscape. Each is linked by the same drug-using narrator.Mr. Johnson told The New York Times that his narrator \u2014 the sort of wild American who shoots people \u2014 is someone who would appeal to people in 12-step programs. \u201cJung once said that inside of every alcoholic,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a seeker who got on the wrong track.\u201dSome critics have called \u201cJesus\u2019 Son\u201d Mr. Johnson\u2019s masterpiece.In The New Yorker, John Updike compared Mr. Johnson\u2019s style to the \u201cgleaming economy\u201d of the young Ernest Hemingway. And in The Times, James McManus wrote that Mr. Johnson\u2019s universe \u201cis a place where attempts at salvation remain radically provisional and where a teetering narrative architecture uncannily expresses both Christlike and pathological traits of mind.\u201dThe book was made into a film in 1999 directed by Alison Maclean and starring Billy Crudup as the narrator, described by the critic A. O. Scott in The Times as \u201clike Candide strung out on every drug he can find.\u201d Mr. Johnson had a small role in it.Denis Hale Johnson was born on July 1, 1949, in Munich. His father, Alfred, worked for the United States Information Agency and was variously posted to Manila, Tokyo and Washington. His mother, the former Vera Louise Childress, was a homemaker.Mr. Johnson, who studied under the minimalist writer Raymond Carver at the University of Iowa, counted Dr. Seuss, Dylan Thomas, Walt Whitman, T. S. Eliot and the guitar solos of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix among his influences, primarily for poetry.He was sensitive to the \u201clanguage of people jammed together, like in the military and prisons,\u201d he told the Santa Monica radio station KCRW\u2019s \u201cBookworm\u201d podcast.\u201cThose are pressure cookers of language,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re on the cutting edge.\u201dHe wrote deliberately, taking many years to finish a story or a novel.\u201cMy projects tend to develop over years, beginning with scattered notes; then I start puttering and tinkering with ideas, voices, descriptions, and then I progress to some serious fooling around,\u201d he told Yale Literary Magazine in 2013. Then, he said, \u201cin the latter stages I settle down and try to produce a couple of pages every day, with an occasional day off.\u201dHis National Book Award came in 2007 for \u201cTree of Smoke,\u201d a novel about Vietnam, espionage and military intelligence. The impetus for the book was, in part, his familiarity with diplomats, the military and C.I.A. employees through his father\u2019s work.While \u201cTree of Smoke\u201d confirmed for some critics Mr. Johnson\u2019s prodigious literary talent, others were not persuaded.

His two previous marriages ended in divorce.Mr. Johnson thought of himself as a Christian writer who wonders about the existence of God in a troubled world.\u201cI have a feeling God finds us pretty funny,\u201d he told New York magazine. \u201cBut that\u2019s all the speaking I should do for God \u2014 he doesn\u2019t go around talking about me.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about the novelist Denis Johnson misstated one of the call letters of a Santa Monica radio station whose podcast \u201cBookworm\u201d interviewed him.

{"Headline": "Tourists Return to Tunisia, but Slowly", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byUpdateSimon Marsov, a 25-year-old management consultant from Moscow, flew to the resort town of Sousse, Tunisia, by the Mediterranean last summer because he wanted to experience a foreign place on the cheap.Lalioui Faouzi, a 26-year-old dentist from Algiers, said he made the 11-hour drive in late summer to Hammamet, another resort on Tunisia\u2019s east coast, because the hotels were cheaper than those in Algeria, the beaches were livelier and he didn\u2019t need a visa.Visitors from Algeria and Russia arrived in record numbers in 2016 and helped save Tunisia\u2019s seaside hotels from a second abysmal summer.Western Europeans continued to largely shun the small North African country in the wake of two massacres of tourists in 2015. But now there are signs that Tunisia\u2019s Continental visitors are returning, giving rise to hopes that the hobbled tourism industry might get back on its feet this year.Still, the overall number of foreign visitors to this crossroads of Arab, African and European cultures, and home to a stunning collection of Roman ruins, remains well below that of the peak years before the revolution: 4.5 million last year, compared with 6.9 million in 2010.Britain imposed a countrywide travel ban, which is still in effect, and a number of nations including the United States warned against travel to certain parts of Tunisia, like the southeast region bordering Libya.The scent of sunblock on sunburned Western tourists vanished from the pool decks and seaside promenades that summer.While other operators folded, Mr. Mbarek switched to local and corporate clients and started new companies in business coaching and video. He said his travel business had been in a slump until the end of last summer, when the Chinese started coming.In his office in Tunis in September, he joked about popping champagne when a Hong Kong travel agent committed to sending seven culture-tour groups in the coming months. Since then, he has had groups of 20 to 30 Chinese tourists arriving each week, trooping to cities like Douz, on the edge of the Sahara in the southwest, and Kairouan, home to one of Islam\u2019s holiest mosques, in the north-central region.Now his tourism trade is about half of what it was before the revolution. But like many others in the industry, he knows that the country will be dogged not only by its own political and economic troubles and the continuing Mideast turmoil, but also by the chaos and violence in neighboring Libya, where the Islamic State is fighting to secure strongholds.\u201cTourism will not recover very soon in Tunisia until Libya returns to calm,\u201d Mr. Mbarek said.In the meantime, the industry has been trying to fix what hotel owners, tour operators and former and current tourism officials admit was a broken model: marketing Tunisia for decades almost exclusively as a cheap, sea-and-sun, package-tour destination. They neglected the country\u2019s cultural sites, missed out on the book-it-yourself digital revolution and largely ignored other sources like Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East. After a decade, they are still debating whether to open Tunis to low-cost carriers like Ryanair.The first priority was security. Now black-uniformed police officers with assault rifles are stationed under big umbrellas at resort roundabouts and in armored trucks on the French-colonial boulevards of the capital.Before 2015, hotels in Tunisia had hardly any security. Now they check the trunks and undercarriages of vehicles pulling up to the gates, and the higher-end hotels have metal detectors.The police also monitor the routes of tourists traveling to historic sites like the Roman ruins of the ancient mountaintop city of Dougga. There, on an early afternoon, the only sounds amid the second- and third-century temples and stone streets rutted by chariot wheels were bleating sheep and the wind blowing through olive trees \u2014 and my tour guide\u2019s ringing cellphone as the police called to check on us.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible for me when it\u2019s quiet,\u201d another guide, Mona Begaoui, said amid remnants from the golden age of Roman Africa, including a largely intact but empty amphitheater. \u201cIf it\u2019s one group I\u2019m happy; sometimes it\u2019s nothing.\u201dTourism officials have put more emphasis on promoting sites like Dougga and the well-preserved amphitheater of El Jem, one of largest in the Roman Empire and modeled on the Coliseum in Rome. They are seeking to draw more international visitors to events like an annual music festival in Carthage and a new, electronic music rave in the Sahara near Tozeur, where a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie was filmed.The officials created new websites and platforms on Twitter and Instagram and marketed to specific countries like Algeria and Russia, as well as Belgium, which relaxed its travel ban on Tunisia this spring.The efforts to lure Russians were especially fruitful, with more than a tenfold increase in tourists last year, to 623,000.Last spring, Abdellatif Hamam, then the head of Tunisia\u2019s National Tourism Office, flew 440 Russian travel agents to Tunisia to pamper them at Djerba island hotels, show them the new armed patrols and persuade them to start organizing tours.The lifting of that ban late last summer is likely to mean fewer Russians for Tunisia and more for Turkey, which is even cheaper, said Mr. Marsov, the Russian tourist. He vacationed in Turkey a few years ago, but was so impressed with Tunisia last summer, he said, that he might come back.Mr. Marsov added that he knew the rap on his countrymen: that they book cheap, all-inclusive tours and stay glued to the hotel \u201clike a jellyfish on the beach.\u201dHe, too, was on a package trip \u2014 nine days for $500 \u2014 at a hotel in Sousse with stained carpets in the hallways and a large, airy atrium with clusters of Russians keeping the bar waiters busy. But he said he also wanted to discover \u201ca very different country, a bit wild but attractive,\u201d so he added a desert safari and a day trip to the ruins of ancient Carthage.He had no qualms about safety. He once considered taking job in Burkina Faso in West Africa, which has its own troubles with terror groups. In comparison, he said, \u201cTunisia is like Switzerland.\u201dNot quite. The trains I rode were late and had broken seats. Streets in the capital and even the resorts were often strewed with trash. And while Tunisia\u2019s revolution was seen as a success that put the country on a path to democracy, the economy is weak, unemployment is high and militant threats persist around the country, including at its borders with Algeria and Libya.The troubles, for some, have brought opportunities.At the Golden Tulip Carthage, bookings started picking up last summer, in part because the general manager, Ghassan Jana, pursued more new markets, hosting travel agents from Iraq and his native Jordan, for example. But mostly, he said, it was because \u201cwe are selling security and not rooms.\u201dThe hotel, popular with international businesspeople, European diplomats and Mideast dignitaries, commands a mountainside overlooking a bay, and the added security cameras and private guards, as well as the armed police on the roads leading there, make guests feel safe, Mr. Jana said.Reservations kept improving through last fall and now are back to pre-revolution levels, with 85 percent to 90 percent of the hotel full during the week, he said.Alexandra Azarova said she wasn\u2019t so confident. She gives private tours to small groups of Russians who tend to be well off and well educated and keen to visit desert and archaeological sites. In late April and early May, she had excursions booked for two weeks straight. But it\u2019s still early in the season, and she said she wasn\u2019t seeing many tour groups or buses at the museums and ruins.

They both possess boundless self-confidence. Each seeks advice from a select inner circle, ignoring the big bureaucracies of his government.Mr. Trump, not known for his effusive praise of world leaders, has talked up their relationship, saying in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last weekend that his relationship with China was \u201calready acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d He called Mr. Xi \u201ca man that I\u2019ve gotten to like and respect.\u201dBut beneath the bonhomie, Chinese analysts say, fundamental differences of strategic interest are likely to undermine any personal ties Mr. Trump says he has forged with the Chinese leader. The romance, they say, may be more a short marriage of convenience.Mr. Trump\u2019s public effusiveness is barely reciprocated in China. The state-run media accords Mr. Trump polite coverage, much more so than it did President Barack Obama \u2014 a signal that the government, for the time being, would like the Chinese people to view the American president in a positive light.Among foreign policy experts, however, there is skepticism that Mr. Trump\u2019s flattery of Mr. Xi, and his reliance on the Chinese leader to bear down on North Korea over its nuclear program, will bring the results he wants.In essence, the Trump administration is asking China to apply maximum economic pressure on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, so that he will relinquish his nuclear arsenal, or at least agree to negotiate on Washington\u2019s terms.Analysts say Mr. Xi is likely to take steps to curb the activities of some Chinese companies that help North Korea with the foreign exchange it badly needs, but not all of them. They say he may even, at some point, shut down the oil supply from China that keeps the economy afloat \u2014 but if so, only for a short period.On Wednesday, a commentary in North Korea\u2019s state-run news agency warned that the country would continue its nuclear weapons development program even if it risked losing a friendly relationship with China.North Korea \u201cwill never beg for the maintenance of friendship with China, risking its nuclear program which is as precious as its own life, no matter how valuable the friendship is,\u201d a writer named Kim Chol wrote in the commentary, which was carried by the North\u2019s Korean Central News AgencySome analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s own predictability should not be taken for granted.\u201cHe needs China to help implement what he wants on North Korea,\u201d said Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute for International Relations at Tsinghua University. \u201cIt won\u2019t work. Trump will change his attitude to China very soon. I don\u2019t think he will be so nice to our president for very long. His policy toward China is not durable.\u201dOthers noted that it would be against China\u2019s national security interests to side with the United States against North Korea. \u201cI think this ends unhappily,\u201d said Douglas H. Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cIn the end, China is not going to deliver North Korea on our doorstep. China will say: \u2018We\u2019ve done these things. What are you so upset about?\u2019 \u201dMr. Trump, who likes to do business by phone, is acquiring a reputation for pestering Mr. Xi. He called the Chinese president four days after their summit meeting in Florida last month, saying afterward on Twitter that he had had \u201ca very good call\u201d with Mr. Xi about the \u201cmenace of North Korea.\u201dHe called again on April 23. Mr. Paal said he was told by Chinese officials that after that call, Mr. Xi did not appreciate being treated like a midlevel official. Mr. Trump should realize that the Chinese president sets the framework for policies but cannot be expected to keep a checklist of tasks, the officials told him.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s impulse to reach out to Mr. Xi is in the tradition of some of the smoothest moments of relations between the two countries, and it plays to China\u2019s long-held preference to conduct policy through personal relationships.\u201cChinese leaders have demonstrated over and over again that they like to operate through personal relationships \u2014 like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with Henry Kissinger,\u201d said James Mann, a fellow in residence at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and the author of \u201cAbout Face: A History of America\u2019s Curious Relationship With China, From Nixon to Clinton.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of Chinese culture,\u201d Mr. Mann said, \u201cbut it also serves their interests, because personalized diplomacy helps them overcome the idea that China should be treated by the same impersonal rules and policies that apply everywhere else.\u201dIt is not unusual for a new American president to reach out to a foreign leader, even an adversarial one, in an attempt to break a pattern of the past.Early in his tenure, President George W. Bush praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, saying he had \u201clooked the man in the eye. I found him very straightforward and trustworthy \u2014 I was able to get a sense of his soul.\u201dThough they come from vastly different worlds, Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump were both born into privilege. Mr. Xi\u2019s father, Xi Zhongxun, was a senior general under Mao during the civil war and helped the Communists come to power. Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump, was a major New York City builder who left a fortune to his son.Both men rely on a small group of people to help craft their decisions. For Mr. Xi, Li Zhanshu and Wang Huning, two secretive officials who travel with him everywhere, are said to be the most influential.For Mr. Trump, his daughter Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, outstrip everyone else. It is Mr. Kushner who has served as the go-between for Mr. Trump in his dealings with the Chinese.But Mr. Xi\u2019s remoteness from Mr. Kim should not be taken to mean that he will do what Mr. Trump wants and force North Korea to change its behavior, Chinese analysts said.\u201cThere is no possibility for China to fix the situation,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cThat\u2019s because China does not want a nuclear-armed enemy in North Korea.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Leaders Increase Pressure on Trump to Stay in the Paris Accord", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byTAORMINA, Sicily \u2014 World leaders on Friday intensified their pressure on President Trump to keep the United States in the Paris climate agreement, as negotiators for seven Western powers labored to bridge differences between Mr. Trump and his counterparts before they depart on Saturday.Mr. Trump\u2019s message on the environment to the leaders on Friday made clear which option would win if the United States must choose between its economic well-being or staying in the Paris climate agreement.\u201cIf those things collide, growing our economy is going to win,\u201d said Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s economics adviser, who was at the Italy summit meeting.The exit of the world\u2019s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas polluter from the Paris accord would profoundly weaken the landmark effort to curb climate change. It could pave the way for other countries to withdraw, or to simply weaken their own commitments to cutting planet-warming pollution.But even as the leaders themselves mounted a concerted campaign to persuade a skeptical American president to stay, negotiators for the seven nations who gathered at the Hotel San Domenico here sought to reach agreement on a joint statement that might pave the way for a decision by Mr. Trump in the days to come.American officials were pushing for an acknowledgment that if the United States stayed in the Paris agreement, it would be allowed to lower the emission-reduction targets that the Obama administration had signed on to, according to people briefed on the negotiations. United States officials argued that those targets would harm the American economy.Aides to Mr. Trump were also pressing for language in the statement that would reassure coal producers in the United States that remaining in the Paris accord would not get in the way of the president\u2019s efforts to help their struggling industry. The United States was pressing for the agreement to specifically welcome the use of so-called clean coal.Many environmentalists are worried that such provisions would significantly undermine the effectiveness of the global effort to reduce global warming. Others believe that keeping the United States as a party to the agreement is worth making some compromises.It remained unclear on Friday night whether a joint statement, if one is issued, would result in a clear commitment by the United States to stay in the accord, or a vague message leaving open the possibility that Mr. Trump could still decide to end American participation in the global agreement.Andrew Light, who was a senior climate change adviser at the State Department under President Barack Obama, said the other leaders at the summit meeting \u2014 representing the G7 members Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, along with the European Union \u2014 would go home frustrated \u201cif Trump blows this thing up and continues to sit on the fence.\u201dThe other leaders confronted Mr. Trump on climate change as soon as he arrived in Europe. White House officials said Emmanuel Macron, the French president, brought the subject up during NATO meetings in Brussels, as did Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister. In Sicily, White House officials braced for what they knew would be \u201ca robust discussion\u201d of the issue.The lobbying continued throughout the day on Friday, as the leaders gathered behind closed doors for a series of meetings, luncheons and a dinner, taking a break for an evening concert in the Teatro Antico di Taormina, an ancient amphitheater overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.During one extended discussion on Friday, Mr. Trump listened to the pleas of the other leaders, White House officials said, but reiterated that the environment and jobs were both important to him. He talked about environmental awards he had received and declined to say when he would make a decision on the Paris agreement.\u201cI want to get to the right decision,\u201d Mr. Trump told the group, according to Mr. Cohn.The other leaders were said to be wary of how they spoke to the American president, concerned that they could anger him easily, which could result in his deciding to pull the United States out of the Paris agreement after he returns home.\u201cThey are all trying to figure out how do you offer convincing arguments to Trump without him feeling that you are ganging up on him,\u201d said Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group.Mr. Cohn insisted that the president was willing to listen to his counterparts, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s heard arguments that are persuasive on both sides.\u201dBut the president has long been on the record lashing out against the Paris climate agreement, insisting that it is bad for American businesses and will cost jobs in the United States. Speaking to a group of oil rig workers last May, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the accord.As president, Mr. Trump has moved swiftly to dismantle former Mr. Obama\u2019s climate policies, making it all but impossible for the United States to meet its current commitments under the Paris deal. The question still on the table is whether to remain part of the Paris agreement while scaling back Mr. Obama\u2019s commitments to cutting emissions of planet-warming pollution.Pushing for the United States to leave the accord are Mr. Trump\u2019s senior strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; his Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt; and several other advisers who see a withdrawal from the Paris deal as the fulfillment of Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to the nation\u2019s fossil fuel workers.But Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, joined by Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have urged the president to remain in the deal. Mr. Tillerson, who as chief executive of Exxon Mobil emerged as a major corporate backer of the Paris deal when it was completed in 2015, has said that the United States needs to keep \u201ca seat at the table\u201d in the global efforts to address human-caused climate change.Even some Republican foreign policy experts have made the case that withdrawing from the deal could have negative effects on Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to push other elements of his foreign policy agenda.\u201cHe wants to understand how we can bring back manufacturing, bring back jobs, but still be environmentally friendly, but not have a restriction enforced upon us that makes absolutely no sense,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.Other countries have vowed to continue to implement the terms of the Paris Agreement, with or without the United States.President Xi Jinping of China, the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas polluter, has vowed repeatedly to move ahead with steps in his country to curb climate-altering pollution regardless of what happens in the United States. In a phone call with Mr. Macron in early May, Mr. Xi told the French president that China and France \u201cshould protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement,\u201d according to the Chinese foreign ministry.But the United States has played a central role in pushing for provisions requiring robust and transparent oversight of how economies monitor, verify and report their emissions. There have been major questions about the accuracy of China\u2019s emissions reporting, in particular.\u201cThe U.S. has played a really important role in trying to develop this in other countries,\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the lead climate envoy in the Obama administration. \u201cIf the U.S. is not part of that negotiation, that\u2019s a loss for the world.\u201dMichael D. Shear reported from Taormina, and Coral Davenport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Agrees to Tighten Belt Again in Return for Further Bailout Funds", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 Greece and its international creditors said on Tuesday that they had reached a preliminary deal allowing the country to receive crucial bailout payments in exchange for promises to raise taxes and to further cut pensions and social spending.Under the terms of the agreement, which is subject to the approval of eurozone finance ministers and the Greek Parliament, Athens will make changes to its labor and energy markets, cut pension payouts, and increase taxes.The deal was a prerequisite for talks on easing Greece\u2019s enormous debt burden, which is about \u20ac300 billion. The issue is a point of contention between the International Monetary Fund, which advocates debt relief for the country, and European Union members, notably Germany, which have taken a harder line against Athens.\u201cThere was white smoke,\u201d Euclid Tsakalotos, the country\u2019s finance minister, told reporters after 12 hours of talks in the Greek capital, alluding to the method the Vatican uses to signal when a new pope has been selected. \u201cThe negotiation has finished.\u201dThe talks focused on economic overhauls including further pensions cuts, tax increases and changes to the labor market. But they stalled at times as a result of disagreements between European officials and the International Monetary Fund over Greece\u2019s economic prospects and its ability to meet budget targets.As part of the deal announced on Tuesday, Athens agreed to raise the equivalent of 2 percent of gross domestic product by cutting pensions further in 2019, and increasing tax receipts by reducing the income threshold at which taxes must be paid.Yielding to creditors\u2019 demands to make the labor market more competitive, the deal also makes it easier for businesses to fire employees.\u201cIt is time to turn the page on this long and difficult austerity chapter for the Greek people,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this agreement, we need now to write a new story of stability, jobs and growth for Greece and for the euro area as a whole.\u201dThe government must now draft legislation bundling together all the measures and push it through Parliament before eurozone finance ministers meet on May 22. As with similar bills in the past, they are expected to become law, but the government of Alexis Tsipras, the leftist prime minister, retains a fragile three-seat majority in the 300-seat chamber, and opinion polls show its popularity falling.If the measures are enacted, eurozone finance ministers \u2014 collectively known as the Eurogroup \u2014 are expected to approve the disbursement of bailout funds for Athens to make a debt payment that is due in July.The ministers are also expected to discuss debt relief and targets for Greece\u2019s primary surplus, or budget surplus not counting debt financing.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Superfood Gold Rush", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byThe Money IssueOn an April Monday in Sherman Oaks, Calif., the Harvest Bar was packed with adults in athleisure, eating pur\u00e9ed a\u00e7a\u00ed from bowls the size of flowerpots. The restaurant is a fast-casual \u201csuperfood cafe,\u201d one in a growing class of health-food restaurants doing brisk trade in the a\u00e7a\u00ed-bowl business, selling heaps of the pur\u00e9ed berries topped with diced fruit and other sweets. \u201cThe blend is like an ice cream,\u201d the owner, Aric Haut, explained. \u201cBut healthy.\u201d More than 5,000 miles to the south, harvesters in the Amazon basin of Brazil climb palm trees to pick the wild-growing fruit. What lies between these two distant parties is the latest unspooling of the food-fad plot \u2014 a supply chain driven by remarkable health claims, with money exchanged at every step along the way.If the superfood plot were a bit more predetermined, you might expect a\u00e7a\u00ed to go the way of quinoa. When the protein-rich grain spread to supermarket aisles and started to appear in fast-casual restaurants, it moved out of reach for the Bolivian farmers whose dependence on the grain made it famous in the first place. The story with a\u00e7a\u00ed is not so simple. Here, surprising parties become heroes and scoundrels as the coveted berry changes hands in different ways.Global consumption has further increased demand, but because of the high value of good vibes, some superfood exporters have an incentive to hew to best practices. Sambazon, the leading exporter of the berry, has emerged as an unlikely steward of the crop. The company\u2019s chairman, Ryan Black, first tasted the fruit in the late \u201990s, back when it was mostly unknown in America. Black, a jock with a stoner\u2019s lilt, was a former football captain at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has since cornered the a\u00e7a\u00ed export market, in part by paying a guaranteed minimum price to harvesters, protecting wages from dipping too low. According to a sustainability study, workers along Sambazon\u2019s vertical supply chain can earn up to three times what the average Brazilian takes home. Beyond taking pains to demonstrate that its harvest is sustainable, the company has begun funding local schools for agro-forestry education and even devoting some of its fair-trade funds to health and child-care services in the region.The domestic Brazilian a\u00e7a\u00ed market, by contrast, is structured as a game of pass the baton. The berry\u2019s rise to fame in tandem with internal migration yielded a fluid and decentralized network: The guy who picks the fruit sells to the guy with the boat, who sells to the guy with the bigger boat, who sells to the guy with a stall in the market, who sells to the guy with the processing shop, who turns the fruit into frozen pur\u00e9e and ships it to distributors in Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo. According to studies of the a\u00e7a\u00ed economy, these stages of the chain are often disconnected, their workers unaware and uninvested in the steps that come before. This poses a risk to long-term sustainability. Should some ambitious operator upstream decide it\u2019s easier and cheaper to simply cut a\u00e7a\u00ed trees down, the ecosystem could collapse. But for now, this nascent economy offers low barriers to entry in a region much in need of opportunity.As a\u00e7a\u00ed mania has progressed, even multinationals have latched on to the trend, with both Coca-Cola and Pepsi now peddling a\u00e7a\u00ed-tinged drinks. The berry, for now, remains harvested in the wild, but some who study sustainability in the region worry that increased demand for the crop might ultimately strain wild harvesting operations and result in large-scale a\u00e7a\u00ed plantations. The same vibes that drive growth in the region might also destroy the same wholesome ethic that made a\u00e7a\u00ed appealing to Americans in the first place. For us, it might not matter; we\u2019ll probably have found a new superfood by then.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citigroup Agrees to $97.4 Million Settlement in Money Laundering Inquiry", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byFor years, Citigroup employees feared that millions of dollars the bank was moving to Mexico might be suspicious. Yet in many cases, the bank did not alert regulators or step up its monitoring for money laundering, federal prosecutors said Monday.Even as the Citigroup unit Banamex USA was growing to dominate remittances from the United States to Mexico, the bank did not properly safeguard its systems from being infiltrated by drug money and other illicit funds, prosecutors said.As part of the agreement, Banamex USA \u201cadmitted to criminal violations by willfully failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering\u201d compliance program, the Justice Department said.The deal represents the first such agreement between a major bank and the Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions.It also resolves some of Citigroup\u2019s most serious regulatory issues related to its profitable, but risky, business in Mexico.From 2007 to 2012, Banamex USA generated about 18,000 internal alerts of suspicious transactions among the 30 million Mexico remittances it processed, prosecutors said.Yet the bank conducted fewer than 10 investigations and filed only six suspicious activity reports with regulators.Among the red flags that Banamex USA did not heed was $1.3 billion in remittances that each totaled more than $1,500 \u2014 five times the amount that families typically send.Most families receive remittances from one or two predictable sources. But one account holder in Mexico received 1,400 remittances from 950 senders in 40 states. Despite several automatic alerts about these transactions, Banamex USA did not file a suspicious activity report with regulators.One of the biggest problems was staffing. The bank had only two people assigned to review the thousands of suspicious transactions manually. Even as the bank grew and employees raised questions about the problematic transactions, Banamex USA did not invest in more oversight, the prosecutors said.\u201cAmong our most serious obligations as a bank is to achieve the strongest possible system for anti-money-laundering and sanctions compliance to protect the integrity of the financial system,\u201d Citigroup said in a statement on Monday.Shares of Citigroup were little changed on Monday, closing down 0.07 percent, at $61.06.Banamex helped fuel Citigroup\u2019s profit as the bank rode the wave of Mexico\u2019s growing economy and financial modernization. Banamex USA was supposed to build on Citigroup\u2019s access to Mexico\u2019s market by connecting the millions of Mexican immigrants in the United States who needed to send money to their families at home.The settlement announced Monday may be examined for clues about how the Trump administration will respond to misdeeds by big banks.After years of billion-dollar settlements in anti-money-laundering and mortgage-related cases brought by prosecutors working for the Obama administration, white-collar defense lawyers and investors have been watching to see whether the new administration will ease up on the banks.But it is difficult to draw many definitive conclusions from Monday\u2019s agreement.But that case also involved accusations that HSBC, which is based in London, had transferred billions of dollars for Iran, violating United States sanctions.Banamex USA was not accused of violating sanctions.Citigroup was permitted to settle the Mexico case without pleading guilty \u2014 a step the Justice Department under President Barack Obama had increasingly begun to require of banks that wanted to settle cases.Citigroup was granted a nonprosecution agreement as part of its settlement. Such agreements became rare under Mr. Obama, who faced criticism that the federal government had not done enough to punish big banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Citigroup has been closing Banamex USA. On Monday, Citigroup said it expected the troubled unit would cease operations by June 30.Jessica Silver-Greenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tales of \u2018Flippers\u2019 Led to a Housing Bubble", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThere is still no consensus on why the last housing boom and bust happened. That is troubling, because that violent housing cycle helped to produce the Great Recession and financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. We need to understand it all if we are going to be able to avoid ordeals like that in the future.But the explanations for what happened in housing are not, I think, to be found in the conventional data favored by economists but rather in sociologically important narratives \u2014 like tales of getting rich through \u201cflipping\u201d houses and shares of initial public offerings \u2014 that constitute the shifting mentality of the era.Consider the data for a moment. It shows us that extreme changes took place but doesn\u2019t tell us why.Instead, during the 1997 to 2005 boom there were multitudes of narratives about smart investors who were bold enough to take a position in the market. To single out one strand, recall the stories of flippers who would buy a house, fix it up, and resell it within months at a huge profit. These stories appear to have been broadly exciting to people who didn\u2019t flip houses themselves but who appear to have begun to think that stretching a little and buying a house with a large mortgage would make them wise investors.It can take a long time for narratives like this to grip the popular imagination. Flipping was \u201ca thing\u201d in the condominium conversion boom of the 1970s and \u201980s. The idea then was this: Big-time converters with deep pockets would buy apartment buildings and convert the rental apartments to owner-occupied condos, selling units to diverse individuals, some of them flippers. For public relations purposes, converters would offer to sell at reduced prices to renters already living in a building, and typically to some outsiders, too.This generated buzz. When renters and speculators flipped their purchase contracts at a big profit, sometimes using borrowed money for down payments to flip multiple units without actually even closing on the condos, it was thrilling. It seemed that anyone with energy and initiative could get rich doing this.Some people eager to make quick profits bought Donald J. Trump\u2019s well-timed 2004 book, \u201cTrump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life,\u201d written with Meredith McIver. Some enrolled in the less well-timed Trump University, which emphasized real estate investment in 2005, at the very end of the housing boom; it shut down, amid lawsuits and recrimination, in 2010.The promoters of condo conversions and I.P.O.s were onto something. By giving discounts to buyers who would make a high return, they captivated the nation with tales of people who had no advanced degrees or hefty r\u00e9sum\u00e9s but made fortunes anyway.The public fascination with speculating in housing has been held in check by regulators empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, but that restraint is tenuous with the election as president of a real estate promoter intent on reducing regulators\u2019 power. These narratives are still potent and could easily spur further spirals in the housing market.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Agenda for South Korea\u2019s New Leader", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSouth Korean equanimity toward the North\u2019s threats surprises Westerners, but the South Koreans have lived for decades with Pyongyang\u2019s provocations and, more recently, the nuclear program. Young South Koreans increasingly consider the North Korean menace a fact of life. South Korea\u2019s vulnerability to a devastating attack from the North \u2014 Seoul\u2019s northernmost suburbs begin just 20 miles from the demilitarized zone \u2014 adds to the sense here that the South should do everything it can to avoid war.An overture from the incoming Moon administration to start talks with Pyongyang should be made with caution. Engagement with North Korea has a mixed, if not poor, record, and new talks would be more effective if started from a position of strength. It is vital that Mr. Moon pursue policies to decrease his country\u2019s vulnerability to attack, while dangling the possibility of talks. Beijing and Washington are key to any deal with North Korea, but Seoul can do a lot on its own.Seoul and Tokyo should agree to avoid separate deals with the North and reject Pyongyang\u2019s efforts to play them against each other. Mr. Moon and his left-wing base are hostile to a recently signed South Korea-Japan intelligence-sharing pact, but he should consider that South Korea benefits from it more than Japan. Military cooperation in adjoining air and sea spaces would be ideal.To further improve South Korea\u2019s position, Seoul and Washington need to persuade Beijing to reduce trade with North Korea. Pyongyang is dependent on China for resources and access to the world economy. Cutting off North Korea would slow the nuclear and missile programs, and a reduction in luxury imports would put pressure on the regime elite.Beijing is already obligated to enforce the existing sanctions against Pyongyang but does so haphazardly because it fears a North Korean implosion. Mr. Moon should work with Beijing to reassure its anxieties over a post-North Korean order, including the possibility of United States forces on the Chinese border, which prompted Chinese intervention in the original Korean conflict in 1950.Given Seoul\u2019s vulnerability to attack, Mr. Moon should also do much more to encourage the decentralization of the country away from the Seoul area.

{"Headline": "Readers Speak Out on South Korea\u2019s New Leader", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byHundreds of readers responded to the election results, telling us that they hoped to see the country mend the political and social divisions that widened during the impeachment of Ms. Park. They also expressed concerns about what they see as entrenched economic corruption and an intractable threat from North Korea. Here is a small sampling of their thoughts.\u201cAfter a year of soul searching, candlelight vigils, real drama (you did not have to watch any soap operas on television), and impeachment of a sitting president, it is about time for the nation to move forward.\u201cTo be sure, the conservatives will continue to raise objections, but Moon Jae-in now has the mandate of the people and he must deliver on his promises. I expect him to engage in peaceful dialogue with the North, clean up the graft among family-owned mega corporations (chaebol), and find ways to strengthen the role of civil society in promoting gender equality, addressing social inequalities, and combating poverty/social exclusion.\u201d\u2014 Theodore Jun Yoo, 45, Seoul\u201cLet\u2019s hope that he will help South Korea move on from his predecessor\u2019s corruption, steer the nation through economic difficulties, and offer solid leadership in the face of North Korea\u2019s threats.\u201d\u2014 NM, New York\u201cEven though I am a rather conservative and voted for one of the conservative candidates, I am not dissatisfied with the result .... The most critical issue facing South Korea is North Korea\u2019s attempt to carry out its nuclear and missile tests. I assume that Mr. Moon will create a peaceful atmosphere on the Korean Peninsula through talks with the North and the close cooperation with the U.S., resulting in a more stability on the peninsular and economic growth.\u201d\u2014 Yoon-jeong Lee, 49, Seoul\u201cThe result from Tuesday\u2019s election is an extension of the impeachment process. It\u2019s something that I dearly wanted to avoid, but also something that I could see happening.\u201cAt the same time, I am still shocked. I thought the debates would prove to be a bigger influence especially since we had such a short time leading up to the elections. Moon didn\u2019t seem reliable in any field, whether it be security or economy. ...\u201cI don\u2019t believe we can solve North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat through dialogue. We tried \u2014 and for 10 years, too. It didn\u2019t work. Did taking a harder stance against North Korea work? I believe so. ... Kim is not going to give up on what he believes to be sustaining his regime, especially when he is very close to reaching his ultimate goal. Dictators are not normal political leaders, and we cannot treat them so.\u201d\u2014 Rebecca Moon, Berkeley, Calif.\u201cAs an overseas South Korean citizen, I voted for Mr. Moon a few days ago during the overseas ballot period. So happy to see him becoming my next president. I want Americans to acknowledge that Mr. Moon is not pro-North Korea. In previous statements, he made clear that the reopening [of the] Kaesong Industrial Complex and further economic cooperation can take place only when there is a significant progress in the nuclear negotiation. To be honest, I don\u2019t really consider Mr. Moon as a liberal. He is more like a center-right candidate. But it\u2019s the unique South Korean political environment that makes him look like a liberal politician.\u201d\u2014 SW, Boston\u201cSouth Korea tried rapprochement. It failed, giving North Korea eight years to develop its nuclear program. South Korea then tried to punitive incrementalism. That, too, failed, giving North Korea eight more years.\u201cThe key is China. As long as China continues to support the North, the North will continue to develop its nuclear program. If the South wants a diplomatic solution, China must participate. But China has thus far refused.\u201cThe only thing that appears to have rattled China is the sudden ratcheting up of U.S. military presence. But the U.S. military presence has alienated South Koreans, and the U.S. can\u2019t lose South Korea as an ally.\u201cHowever, North Korea is more capable than ever before. In addition to South Korea, it now poses a military threat to Japan. Soon it will pose a military threat to the U.S.\u201cIt\u2019s a conundrum....I don\u2019t know what the solution is, but I do know that South Koreans are deluding themselves if they think it\u2019s a return to rapprochement.\u201d\u2014 August Ludgate, Chicago\u201cComing from a very conservative household, my family and I were appalled by the outcome of the recent Korean election. One of the many reasons why I voted against Moon was due to his stance on the issue of North Korea. He seems to believe in the Sunshine Policy of his liberal predecessor, which essentially played a major role in financing the current nuclear capability of the North that threatens us today.\u201cSouth Korea has historically been a shrimp caught among whales. In recent years, we seemed to have finally avoided this fate by growing our partnerships with the United States on our joint commitment to pressuring North Korea. Now that Moon is in charge of the country, I fear we will yet again repeat our fate as a fragile nation with our two ears presented to both super powers to be yelled at. Who will pay the price? It is us, the younger generation.\u201d\u2014 Matthew (SJ) Oh, Richmond, Va.\u201cAs a Korean-American, I know the fact, the Sunshine Policy would work the best with NK. There is no perfect approach when you deal with NK. The fact is that the past two right-wing regimes of SK totally destroyed the relationship with NK and led them to focus on the development of nuclear weapon. Yes, the sunshine policy will not solve the issue entirely but it would work as a leverage to bring piece to the Korean Peninsula. I\u2019m so happy to see Mr. Moon was elected! The impeached former president Park Geun-hye brought down the country to the total disaster.\u201d\u2014 Ted Song, Portland, Ore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Household Debt Makes a Comeback in the U.S.", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byIt took nearly a decade, but debt has made a comeback.Americans have now borrowed more money than they had at the height of the credit bubble in 2008, just as the global financial system began to collapse.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Wednesday that total household debt in the United States had reached a new peak \u2014 $12.7 trillion \u2014 in the first three months of the year, another milestone in the long, slow recovery of the nation\u2019s economy.The growing debt level shows that many of the millions of Americans who struggled during the recession have sufficiently repaired their credit to qualify for loans. It also suggests a rising optimism about economic growth among banks and other lenders.Debt can fuel consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of all economic activity in the United States. It also allows Americans to make large investments in education and housing, which can help build personal wealth and financial stability.Yet the borrowing peak also signals the potential for new risks to the economy.One of the major factors behind the latest debt binge has been student loans, a mounting burden that can stifle economic growth by preventing Americans from buying homes or spending on big-ticket consumer items.The fear is that ballooning debt from student loans \u2014 and from auto loans and credit cards \u2014 could put many Americans back into a hole, prompting a new wave of defaults, much like the one that accompanied the mortgage meltdown a decade ago.\u201cThis is not a marker we should be superexcited to get back to,\u201d said Heather Boushey, the executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. \u201cIn the abstract, more debt signals optimism. But in reality, families are using debt as a mechanism to pay for things their incomes don\u2019t support.\u201dSince World War II, total household debt had been increasing, with only a few interruptions. The financial crisis changed that steady upward march.In late 2008, household debt began a decline that would last for 19 consecutive quarters, an unprecedented period of deleveraging during which many Americans shied away from new borrowing. Total debt began to rise again in 2013, finally hitting a new high in this year\u2019s first quarter.There is reason to believe that borrowers should be able to better manage their debt now than they did during the financial crisis. The nation\u2019s debt load is reaching new heights at a moment when the economy is expanding, a dynamic that makes the latest peak in borrowing less worrisome to economists.By comparison, mortgage debt is 68 percent of total debt, down from 73 percent during the same period. The household debt figures are not adjusted for inflation.Student borrowers today owe $1.3 trillion, more than double the $611 billion owed nearly nine years ago. About one in 10 student borrowers is behind on repaying the loans, the highest delinquency rate of any type of loan tracked by the New York Fed\u2019s quarterly household debt report.The student loan market is nowhere near the size of the $8.6 trillion mortgage market, making student borrowing less of a threat to the global financial system than the bad housing loans that touched off the financial crisis in 2008.But there are similarities in how student loan debt \u2014 like mortgage debt a decade ago \u2014 has managed to pile up.One idea underpinning the mortgage boom was that homeownership was a clear-cut route to building wealth. That notion was shaken by the housing collapse, which left millions of Americans in foreclosure and their finances in ruins.Students have gone deep into debt in the belief that a college degree will eventually lead to a higher income. But many students have graduated into a job market where wages have been rising slowly, leaving them with more debt than they can pay off.Economists are now unsure about how this mountain of student debt will affect the broader economy. Unlike mortgages, student loans cannot typically be shed or restructured, which means that more Americans are shouldering a type of debt that could weigh them down for the rest of their lives, preventing them from buying homes or starting businesses.\u201cStudent debt is a different animal with different rules,\u201d said Diane Swonk, founder of DS Economics in Chicago. \u201cIt has some good effects, but not always.\u201dAlyssa Pascarosa, 26, owes $100,000 related to the bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology she received from the University of Pittsburgh in 2013. The debt shapes nearly all of her financial choices. Ms. Pascarosa initially planned to attend law school but changed her mind after realizing that pursuing that career path would double or triple her debt load.Instead, Ms. Pascarosa moved back in with her mother in Easton, Pa., where she works as a graphic designer.\u201cI would like to move out at some point soon,\u201d she said, \u201cbut with my loans, I can\u2019t justify spending money on rent.\u201dThere are many benefits, of course, to the boom in student lending. More Americans now have college degrees, which will probably increase job opportunities and wages over time.Student loans are not the only area in which debt has grown rapidly.The New York Fed report also shows how growth in auto lending over the past decade has made up for slower mortgage lending. Auto loans totaled about $1.1 trillion, or 9 percent of all household debt, in the first quarter of 2017, up from 6 percent in the third quarter of 2008.Defaults have crept up in auto loans, one of the few sectors in which lenders were willing to extend credit to subprime borrowers after the 2008 crisis.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said defaults on student and auto loans were a \u201cfinancial blemish\u201d on otherwise healthy household balance sheets.\u201cIt is not an existential threat to households and the economy,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt is an area where there is some stress.\u201dMore broadly, the economic picture looks far less precarious than it did in late 2008. The amount of monthly income that Americans must spend paying off their debt is smaller, and employment is flush.\u201cWe had been renting and moving all through our 20s,\u201d Ms. Farrell said, \u201cand now seemed like the right time to get in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There are so many millionaires among the children of its leaders that they have a moniker: the Princelings.This uniquely Chinese brand of influence peddling is now being lavished on President Trump\u2019s Princelings and Princesslings. Suddenly, all kinds of business opportunities have opened up for Trump family members in the notoriously closed Chinese market.As a real estate mogul himself, Mr. Trump was frustrated in his many efforts to break into China. In March, 38 trademarks for various Trump projects were granted preliminary approval after a decade of denials. The Trump Organization is being run by his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, in their father\u2019s absence.On the very day Ivanka Trump and Mr. Kushner, her husband, flanked President Xi Jinping of China at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago last month, there was a surprise as tasty as the dry-aged steak on the menu: China approved her company\u2019s request to sell handbags, jewelry and spa services in China.But the oligarchy emerging on Pennsylvania Avenue today is something not seen before. The president, Ivanka Trump and her husband are the three most powerful figures in the White House, and they still profit from companies with billions at stake in global real estate deals.Their family enterprises are seeking private favors from China, the second most powerful economy in the world. This is the country that is our biggest rival in the Pacific, one that the president himself says has hurt American workers. Then he mimics its infamous Princeling culture.This isn\u2019t the petty Washington corruption of lobbying favors or excess campaign donations. It is far more unseemly and dangerous to democracy.Kathleen Clark, a professor of ethics at Washington University in St. Louis, told NPR, \u201cwhen Donald Trump is dealing with the Chinese government on behalf of the United States, he may also be thinking about what the Chinese government can do not just for the U.S. but for Donald Trump and his businesses and his own financial well-being.\u201dPresident Trump, his daughter and Mr. Kushner have all said that they have stepped away from their businesses. Ms. Trump has transferred her brand\u2019s assets into a trust overseen by her brother-in-law, Josh Kushner, and sister-in-law, Ms. Meyer. These businesses carry on without them and bear their very powerful names. Meanwhile, the legal arrangements to keep them at arm\u2019s length from those businesses remain opaque.Various ethics lawyers charge that the Trumps are violating the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which forbids any \u201cperson holding any Office of Profit or Trust under the United States\u201d from accepting \u201cany present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State\u201d \u2014 unless Congress explicitly consents. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a progressive government watchdog organization, has filed a lawsuit asserting that the president is receiving illegal payments from foreign governments through his companies.In an interview with The Washington Post, Eric Trump said, \u201cThere are lines that we would never cross, and that\u2019s mixing business with anything government.\u201d The president himself, after pledging to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d during the campaign, has done little on the ethics front other than cancel ethics training for White House personnel and threaten to defang the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.China\u2019s response to disclosures about the Princelings was to block the Chinese websites of The Times and Bloomberg.Part of why Donald Trump won is that voters had extreme fatigue about the Clinton family\u2019s ethical problems. His promise to end big-money corruption in Washington was taken seriously by his base.

{"Headline": "Hemispheric Pressure: As Asian Powers Rise, How Should the West Respond?", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cHigh-quality global journalism requires investment.\u201d With this phrase, The Financial Times encourages online readers to subscribe and discourages them from forwarding articles. This intelligent and provocative new book by the paper\u2019s leading chief foreign affairs commentator, Gideon Rachman, reminds us of different requirements for journalistic excellence: historical education, engagement in scholarly debates and tireless travel to interview global decision-makers.\u201cEasternization\u201d navigates the recent migration of economic, military and political power from the Western Hemisphere to the Eastern. Rachman repeatedly returns to that migration\u2019s main engine \u2014 the rise of China \u2014 but his thesis is broader. He considers the rise of Asia as a whole, including the growing clout of India and the continuing importance of Japan, a nation that is not currently rising but remains wealthy, technologically sophisticated and economically linked to all continents. Rachman also explores the decreasing ability of Americans and Europeans to shape to their liking outcomes around the world. Relentlessly fair, he resists blaming Asia\u2019s successes for Western problems and recognizes the West\u2019s self-inflicted wounds.Rachman\u2019s wisdom about global history precludes cartoonish characterizations of \u201cEast\u201d versus \u201cWest.\u201d Western nations spent more blood and treasure fighting one another, especially in two massive world wars, than they did colluding to dominate others. Similarly, mistrust among Asian states today outstrips mistrust among them and the United States or Europe. Nor do political ideas provide a clear border between East and West. Europe has had more than its share of authoritarian regimes, so it is a stretch to consider the recent rise of illiberal nationalism in Europe as somehow a move \u201ceastward.\u201d Mainland Chinese propagandists rail against the \u201cWestern values\u201d of multiparty democracy, a free press and independent courts, but some of the nation\u2019s largest and most successful Asian neighbors \u2014 South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and India \u2014 are no less Eastern for enjoying all of those institutions. No one, including Rachman, really knows how to categorize Russia. Moscow has tried with limited success to cobble together a Eurasian union with former Soviet republics in Central Asia, but it sees itself as the European part of such a union. Russia\u2019s recent diplomatic lean toward China has more to do with energy markets and the two authoritarian regimes\u2019 shared aversion to American support for color revolutions and regime change than it does with either realpolitik alliance formation or Sino-Russian cultural affinity.Changes within the East itself are as important to Rachman\u2019s analysis of war and peace as the global shift of power eastward. The prospect of a Sino-American war provides the most likely scenario for a direct conflict between Rachman\u2019s rising East and declining West, but it is harder to imagine such a conflict occurring without a prior clash between China and one of its neighbors. The good news ends there. China\u2019s growing offshore military and civilian presence in the maritime sphere has exacerbated tensions over longstanding sovereignty disputes with its Asian neighbors, including American allies and security partners. The Obama administration\u2019s self-styled \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d ensured that American forces and diplomats remained actively involved in addressing these regional tensions.Rachman gets the big picture in Asia right, but he sometimes gets important details wrong. For example, China\u2019s recent military modernization means forward-deployed American forces and bases in the region are vulnerable to attack in ways they were not during the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1995\u201396. It is incorrect and somewhat dangerous, however, for him to argue that Beijing \u201cbacked off\u201d after the Clinton administration sent two aircraft carrier battle groups toward Taiwan in early 1996. Beijing apparently had no plan to escalate anyway. Nationalism is indeed an important part of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s domestic legitimacy that influences Beijing\u2019s foreign policies, but that phenomenon long predates the brutal crackdown on protesters on June 4, 1989. Beijing and Washington have worked out peaceful methods to handle their difference over Taiwan since 1972, but the United States never formally accepted Beijing\u2019s One China policy, as Rachman states. Instead Washington adheres to its own version, with intentional ambiguity in regard to Taiwan\u2019s legal status in relation to mainland China.Like many, Rachman sometimes seems hamstrung by historical knowledge. In 1914 an archduke\u2019s murder in Sarajevo caused economically interdependent states in Europe to fight a giant war of survival, so why can\u2019t disputes over Asian rocks, reefs and artificial islands create a massive conflagration today? This is a good question, but many differences exist between these two worlds. There are no tightly knit alliance blocks in contemporary East Asia. Today all great powers have either nuclear weapons or nuclear-armed allies, a deterrent to massive conventional escalation. Perhaps most important, globalization in the past few decades has produced fundamentally different and deeper economic interdependence than in the past. The massive investment flows between the industrial economies, the rise of intra-industry trade and the creation of complex transnational production chains are all forces for peace today that were missing in 1914 Europe.Rachman\u2019s \u201cEasternization\u201d process matters, but so far mainly as a subset of the larger process of globalization that enabled it in the first place. The growing pains of the East pose threats of instability to a highly integrated global system, not directly to the West itself. No Asian actor can currently project military power other than ballistic missiles and cyber volleys very far from home. Serious East-West military clashes, then, would have to occur in the East. Unfortunately, Rachman is correct that Western comfort stops there. Asia is now a vital organ in the globalized system on which we all depend; challenges to Asian stability are real, and Western actors have less wherewithal than in the past to contribute actively to maintaining stability there.\u201cEasternization\u201d has implications not only for war and peace but also for global governance. Institutions created after World War II have not adjusted smoothly to eastward shifts in power, nor have they kept up with the global demand for cooperation to counter climate change, financial instability, underdevelopment and nuclear proliferation. China has recently taken the lead to fill some of those institutional holes with cooperative ventures like the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative. Beyond the region, Asian states\u2019 growing trade and financial relations with Africa and Latin America are generally positive developments. They come, however, with few strings attached and can thereby undercut recent American and European efforts to condition development aid on improvements in governance.Rachman\u2019s book concludes with some optimism about the West\u2019s continuing influence. The integrated global economy gives enormous power advantages to institutionally sound governments in the United States and the European Union. China\u2019s insecure single-party state is politically unwilling and structurally unable to replace the American dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency or Western Europe as a global banking center. Moreover, as long as leaders in the East need growth to stay in power, they should be reluctant to weaken ties to a highly integrated global marketplace. We should then expect considerably less great power conflict during 21st-century easternization than there was in the very bloody 20th century of Western dominance.Thomas J.

{"Headline": "As Le Pen and Macron Fight for Presidency in France, Unions Are Split", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byMore than 140,000 people participated in rallies in Paris, Lille, Marseille and other cities \u2014 events organized by French labor unions, some of which have found themselves in a bind ahead of the vote in the second and final round of the presidential election on Sunday.Although they have historically opposed Ms. Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front and have urged members to vote against her, several major labor unions also fought the job market overhauls that Mr. Macron defended as economy minister and that he wants to expand if elected.That has left unions split between those who have explicitly endorsed Mr. Macron, and those who have only called for votes against Ms. Le Pen.At a rally of his supporters in Paris on Monday, Mr. Macron reiterated his economic agenda and renewed calls for a \u201cstrong Europe.\u201d But he said he would never \u201cjudge\u201d a National Front voter, \u201cbecause behind that vote there is always an anger, an outrage, a disappointment.\u201dMr. Macron said that he was \u201cpro-European,\u201d but that if elected he would \u201creform in-depth the European Union and our European project,\u201d lest he \u201cbetray\u201d the French people.\u201cI don\u2019t want to do so, because the day after, we will have a \u2018Frexit,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to a French exit from the European Union, \u201cor we will have the Front National again.\u201dMany on the French left, including union advocates who oppose the National Front, say the economic policies defended by Mr. Macron \u2014 free trade and a desire to loosen labor regulations \u2014 have fueled the National Front\u2019s success.Some hooded protesters clashed with the police on the sidelines of the demonstrations, throwing rocks and firebombs at the officers, who responded with tear gas. Five riot police officers were wounded in the clashes, the Paris police prefecture said.Demonstrators at a smaller rally organized earlier on Monday in Paris by more moderate labor unions, who have endorsed Mr. Macron, said voters had to choose.\u201cAlthough we don\u2019t support the politics of Macron, we advise our followers to vote for him, because we don\u2019t want Le Pen,\u201d said Olivier Belem, 56, a computer technician and union member. \u201cThe fact that the other unions don\u2019t give voters clear advice will leave open the possibility of a blank vote and will help Le Pen in her chances of victory.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Macron also paid tribute to Brahim Bouarram, a 29-year-old man who was killed during a far-right demonstration in Paris on May 1, 1995, by skinheads who pushed him off a bridge and into the Seine. Mr. Bouarram\u2019s son, who was 9 at the time of his father\u2019s death, joined Mr. Macron as they laid flowers at a memorial plaque.The National Front\u2019s unsavory past is embodied by Ms. Le Pen\u2019s 88-year-old father and founder of the party, who on Monday addressed a couple of hundred supporters in Paris at a rally celebrating Joan of Arc.\u201cHe talks about the future, but he has no children; he talks about workers, but he\u2019s a former banker at Rothschild; he wants to revitalize the economy, but he\u2019s one of those who dynamited it,\u201d Mr. Le Pen said.\u201cI will be a president who protects,\u201d Ms. Le Pen told her cheering supporters.Manon Bouquin, 24, a Le Pen supporter at the rally, said she believed Ms. Le Pen could win on Sunday.\u201cWhatever the outcome, everything will have changed, and it was interesting to see people in the establishment of 40 years finally getting worried,\u201d Ms. Bouquin said.Even some Macron supporters at his rally said that, though they believed in his ability to win, they worried about his ability to unite disenchanted voters beyond their rejection of the far right.\u201cThere are a lot of people who think that it is mostly important to vote against Marine Le Pen,\u201d said Elfayed Sagaf, 18, a student who was holding a banner supporting En Marche!, Mr. Macron\u2019s movement. \u201cI would have preferred more votes of support.\u201dReporting was contributed by Beno\u00eet Morenne, Milan Schreuer and Pam\u00e9la Rougerie from Paris, and Lilia Blaise from Villepinte.Advertisement"}

Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, accusing the Wall Street firm of looking to make a \u201cquick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people.\u201dGoldman Sachs has defended the deal, saying that many other investors, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, own the bonds and that its asset management division bought the securities on the secondary market, without interacting with the Venezuelan government.Nevertheless, the transaction highlights the extent to which investors are willing to take on increasing levels of political and economic risk as they seek high-yielding investments when interest rates still hover near zero.\u201cThere is a lot of interest in this trade,\u201d said Carlos de Sousa, an economist at Oxford Economics, a research company based in London. \u201cWe are in a low-rate environment, and these are dollar bonds with really high yields.\u201dAmong the large holders of Pdvsa bonds are BlackRock, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase and Ashmore, an emerging market specialist based in London.But none of those firms carry Goldman\u2019s reputation for being politically influential and financially opportunistic \u2014 a combination that has made it an easy global punching bag.At the root of what makes the bonds so attractive to investors, beyond their more than 20 percent returns, is the crucial role played by the Venezuelan oil company in providing foreign exchange to the embattled Maduro government.While Venezuela has been in economic crisis for more than two years, the surge of people to the streets began after its Supreme Court, which is loyal to Mr. Maduro, tried to dissolve the country\u2019s National Assembly in late March. The group of lawmakers, controlled by opposition parties, is considered the only government institution independent of the president.Mr. Maduro\u2019s growing authoritarianism is only the beginning of mounting grievances against Venezuela\u2019s ruling leftists, who have governed since President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez took control of the country in 1999.Falling petroleum prices and years of economic mismanagement when oil revenues were high, have led to triple-digit inflation and left a majority of Venezuelans hardly able to buy sufficient food and other necessities. Even those who can afford meals most days have trouble finding basics like bread, eggs and sugar because of rampant shortages.Pdvsa brings in about 95 percent of the economy\u2019s dollars, so foreign investors believe that the government, even in a worst case, will do all it can to keep the company functioning.Mr. de Sousa also points out that unlike pure sovereign bonds issued by the government, Pdvsa securities lack legal mechanisms, like collective action clauses, which can help a government negotiate favorable terms with foreign bond holders if it defaults on its debt.Moreover, investors have noted that in the last year, as Venezuela\u2019s economic situation has deteriorated sharply, the government has paid out billions of dollars to foreign investors holding the oil company bonds.The Pdvsa trade is the latest sign that foreign investors are becoming bolder in investing in the bonds of governments in far-flung locales.In recent months, higher risk countries such as Turkey, Russia and Brazil have been at the forefront of this trend.Driving the bet, analysts say, is a view that emerging market economies, regardless of their political and economic challenges, are no longer willing to face the wrath of bond investors by defaulting on their debts.That is because global investment giants like BlackRock and Goldman have become ready sources of financing, quick to lend billions in dollars or even local currencies, to governments in Africa, Latin America and Asia that in the past relied on banks.Perhaps no country is as reliant on the kindness of risk-happy foreign bond investors as Venezuela. According to the research firm Exotix, Venezuela has a financing requirement of $17 billion in 2017, yet its central bank reserves are a paltry $10 billion.As investors see it, if you can buy a Pdvsa bond at 30 cents on the dollar, which also provides a double-digit yield, even if this government \u2014 or another for than matter \u2014 has to default, the gains made on the investment would be enough to overcome any loss.While Goldman Sachs defended its trade by saying that it bought the bonds on the open market from a broker, bankers and traders say the money ultimately ended up in Venezuela\u2019s treasury because the seller was an institution with ties to the government.Nonetheless, the threat by Mr. Borges, the opposition leader, that a new government would not make good on these bonds seems unlikely.That is because these bonds carry covenants aimed at preventing an issuer from favoring one bond holder over another. So paying BlackRock or JP Morgan and not Goldman would open Venezuela to lawsuits.All of which suggests that, despite the controversy over the Goldman trade, foreign investors will keep lining up to buy Pdvsa bonds.\u201cThis is the only source of foreign currency the government has,\u201d said Mr. de Sousa, the Venezuelan expert at Oxford. \u201cSo I think the government will continue to sell more of these types of bonds to foreign investors.\u201dNicholas Casey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He defeated Maxime Bernier, a free-market conservative from Quebec, after 13 rounds of ballot counting.Mr. Scheer, who was first elected to Parliament at age 25, presented himself as a compromise candidate during his leadership campaign, which was mostly light on policy proposals. He suggested that under Stephen Harper, the former prime minister who stepped down as the party\u2019s leader after Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals won the 2015 election, the Conservatives had been too negative in their approach to voters.The next national election is expected to happen in 2019.Mr. Scheer served for four years as speaker of the House of Commons, a nonpartisan post that does not involve advancing the government\u2019s legislative agenda. He represents an electoral district in the prairie province of Saskatchewan, though he was born in Ottawa and has spent much of his adult life in the capital because of his political career.Mr. Scheer has said he personally opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, views that gained him support among social conservatives. But he has been accused of playing both sides of such issues during his leadership campaign. He said the party must accept that same-sex marriage is the law in Canada, and while he said he would not reopen the abortion debate, he dodged questions about whether he would let other Conservatives introduce anti-abortion bills.Speaking to party supporters after Saturday\u2019s victory, Mr. Sheer largely avoided social issues, apart from a promise to end federal grants to universities \u201cthat shut down debate and can\u2019t stand different points of view.\u201d He repeated his pledge to repeal Mr. Trudeau\u2019s plan to to put carbon pricing in effect nationwide.He spent much of the speech attacking the Liberals and Mr. Trudeau, who promised \u201csunny ways\u201d when he took office after a decade of Conservative dominance. \u201cSunny ways don\u2019t pay the bills,\u201d Mr. Scheer said. \u201cI think the forecast for sunny ways was like so many weather forecasts we\u2019ve seen.\u201dThe leadership vote was restricted to dues-paying members of the Conservative Party, about 259,000 people. Just over 141,000 of them cast ballots, most through the mail. The leadership campaign struggled to attract public attention, possibly because there were 14 candidates, often turning the debates into turgid affairs.Follow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianraustenAdvertisement"}

Nominated for your Broadway debut!I keep waiting to wake up from this dream.Why did you want to be on Broadway?I felt like it would help me grow as an artist, as a singer and certainly as an actor. I wanted to choose a role that I knew would be as much of a learning experience as a rewarding experience.\u00a0How are you similar to Pierre, the character you play?I went to the Met Ball last night, and just found myself having that social anxiety that washes over you when you're walking through a hall full of models. There is a part of Pierre that I resonate with \u2014 the feeling of \u201cDo I belong here?\u201d And also his wont to get off the hedonistic treadmill and find simplicity.What will you do after leaving the show in July?I'm going to take a little time off \u2014 I need to recharge \u2014 and then I'll write and record and maybe tour in 2018. And I'm also going to scope out possible next trips to the Great White Way.How much of your own life is in this Nora?What are you thinking today? It was immensely exciting, and a nail-biter, because I feel there was a lot of strong work in this category this year. So the moment was filled with anxiety and uncertainty and surprise and delight.It took you a long time to get to Broadway.I don't think of the long journey. I think about the work that was done around \u201cSweat,\u201d and how many people contributed, and I feel thrilled that this is a reflection of lots of people's effort. Why this topic and this setting?Reading was really representative of the post-industrial cities across America that once had robust, thriving economies and now are struggling with economic stagnation.Do you think this play has a different meaning now that Donald Trump is president?I certainly think that the play resonates differently. Initially when we did the play, a certain segment of the audience felt somewhat distant from the people onstage. Now, audiences can no longer separate themselves from the struggles of what's happening in Middle America because those struggles have really impacted our day-to-day lives. \u2014 MICHAEL PAULSONMr. Platt was nominated for best leading actor in a musical for playing the title character in \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d a new musical about a teenager with social anxiety whose popularity improves when a classmate dies. The show was nominated for nine awards, including best new musical.\u00a0Congratulations.\u00a0It's pretty nuts. I've been watching the Tonys since I was a little kid. This musical theater world is all I've ever wanted to be part of. It's a dream, without a caveat.How are you like (or not like) Evan Hansen?I would like to think I have a bit more social ability \u2014 a tad more confidence in social situations \u2014 although I still get pretty anxious, and I can certainly relate to feeling on the outside.\u00a0Why do you think people are responding so strongly to your character?A lot of people feel their loneliness or isolation is unique. Evan allows people to feel they aren't alone in that.Why are you an actor?\u00a0I feel most at home onstage. I think I've known that from a young age. That's where I feel most tuned in and connected and present.What have you learned from doing this role?What are you thinking this morning?Grateful is the word. My knees are a little bit sore because I was just on my knees, thanking the Creator for this opportunity.What really penetrates is the humanity \u2014 the relationships, the father-son issues, the husband-wife issues and just survival, particularly in this wild time that we're living in.Now that all 10 plays in the cycle have been on Broadway, what's next for his work?\u00a0I think we start again. We revisit. We pay attention to some of the plays that were a little more neglected when they came out. I'm going to hold August Wilson's hand as long as they'll let me.You were trying for a long time to get \"Jitney\" to Broadway.I didn't have a major star, other than August. I had great theater actors. That was the holdup for 10 years. People have done that before, with plays from Ireland or Scotland or England, but they have rarely allowed it with a play by a black writer. And then the audiences in New York City embraced it.It's getting better, but we need to be in decision-making positions so we can consider people other than the status quo. People of color have sung and danced forever, but you can't get to five fingers naming black Broadway directors. We need to do a better job of that. \u2014 MICHAEL PAULSONFirst of all, how are you feeling? Physically, I mean.Fantastic. I\u2019ve been making extreme progress for the type of injury I had. I\u2019m back in all eight shows this week and couldn\u2019t be happier. I took the matinees off last week, per doctor\u2019s orders.It\u2019s your third nomination. Where were you when you got the news this time?If you win, do you know where you\u2019ll put your Tony?Is there one person in particular you will thank?That question has changed in the past three weeks. Once you have a moment where you feel like it\u2019s all over, and then you have the support of people from every walk of life \u2014 I\u2019m in love with everybody. \u2014 ERIK PIEPENBURGAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Medicaid, My Life", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byDisabilityThe reality of being a disabled person on Medicaid is far more complex and nuanced. Many people do not even know the difference between Medicaid and Medicare and simply consider them \u201centitlement programs,\u201d as if tax breaks and corporate subsidies aren\u2019t entitlements by another name. Medicaid is more than a health care program. It is a life-giving program.Like the thousands of people sharing their stories at town halls about how the Affordable Care Act saved their lives, I am sharing my Medicaid story to illustrate its value and the potential consequences of \u201creform.\u201dI am an Asian-American woman with a disability and a daughter of immigrants. When I turned 18, my dad told me that I needed to make an appointment at the county office and apply for Medicaid. Living in an affluent suburb of Indianapolis, I was indignant. Medicaid was for \u201cthose people,\u201d the \u201cindigent.\u201d I learned that my parents paid exorbitant monthly premiums for my health care. Only one company in our state would cover me because of my pre-existing condition (spinal muscular atrophy, a congenital motor neuron disease). I had no idea of the financial pressure placed on our family for basic health insurance because of my disability.I graduated from high school in 1992, two years after the Americans With Disabilities Act was passed. Learning about disability history and realizing I was a member of a protected class encouraged me to imagine and create the life that I want. Once I got over myself and realized I had a right to Medicaid, it made a difference immediately.I began to receive several hours a week of services to help me with personal care. When I went away to college I was able to hire attendants and live independently for the first time. It was an exhilarating taste of freedom that showed me a glimpse of what was possible. Before Medicaid, my family members, including my siblings, provided all of my care, including bathing, dressing and toileting. Now I had choices and the basic human right of self-determination.Unfortunately, Indiana made cuts to Medicaid the following year that resulted in fewer hours of services. Our family couldn\u2019t manage both tuition and private pay for personal care, so I made the heartbreaking decision to leave the school I loved and move back home.When you are disabled and rely on public services and programs, you face vulnerability every day. This vulnerability is felt in my bones and my relationship with the state. Fluctuations in the economy and politics determine whether my attendants will receive a living wage and whether I\u2019ll have enough services to subsist rather than thrive. The fragility and weakness of my body, I can handle. The fragility of the safety net is something I fear and worry about constantly.\u201cProgram flexibility\u201d is code for the decimation of Medicaid that will put lives like mine at risk. Some people with disabilities may have to live in nursing homes if community-based services wither away under this flexibility and reform. We cannot disappear again after a history of segregation and institutionalization. When Republicans talk about freedom and choice, they don\u2019t realize that Medicaid gives those very things to people with disabilities.This past March marked my 25th year of being a recipient of Medicaid. When I was young, I felt shame and embarrassment at being one of \u201cthose people\u201d on benefits. Today I am unapologetically disabled and a fully engaged member of society. None of that would be possible without Medicaid.Every day I resist forces that label me as the Other or a scapegoat for society\u2019s problems. With the disability community, I share our stories and speak out against threats to our future by using my privilege and tools such as social media. I hope my story will continue for decades to come.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Age-Old Question: Who Are We?", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorChicago \u2014 We have been through this before. Well, almost.In the 1960s, American and European cities were convulsed by riots and antiwar protests, and in the early 1970s the Watergate scandal threatened to derail American democracy. Then, as now, the Kremlin was jubilant as Western democracies seemed to teeter on the brink.But soon enough, Americans were landing on the moon, the Vietnam War ended, Nixon was forced to resign, and it was the Soviet Union\u2019s crumbling facade that could no longer disguise its own social rifts and divisions. Within the next two decades, Western democracies continued to thrive, if unevenly, while the Soviet Union lost its empire and itself fell apart.A century ago, preparing the ground for the Bolshevik Revolution, Vladimir Lenin famously predicted that the chain of imperialism could be broken at one of its weaker links, Russia. Today, too, behind a seemingly resurgent Russia and its strongman leader lies a weak and fragile Russian state that may prove Lenin prescient again.The Russian Federation has an economy overdependent on oil and gas; together with armaments, they account for 90 percent of its exports. With long-term economic prospects ever dimmer, Russian demographers are also warning that the country is about to enter a demographic crisis similar to the one in the 1990s. Even when there is a population growth, the numbers of the newborn vary dramatically depending on religion and ethnicity, with an average Muslim growth rate far exceeding the national average. If this trend continues, Russia is on track to become a majority-Muslim country in the middle of this century. Like Israel, Russia may one day face a choice between ruling over a predominantly Muslim population or giving sovereignty to its Muslim enclaves.To forestall that possibility, two months ago the Russian parliament passed a law that would allow anyone who speaks Russian or has any connection to Russia and the former Soviet Union to become a Russian citizen. The goal is to increase Russia\u2019s population by millions from among those living in neighboring countries and occupied territories. It is one indicator of how large a role Russia\u2019s demographic crisis plays in Moscow\u2019s expansionist ambitions toward neighbors that used to be part of the Soviet Union.But attempts to increase Russia\u2019s Slavic population do not help define Russian national identity, an existential question that has consumed many generations of educated Russians. It continues to raise questions about the sustainability of the Russian Federation, in which a multitude of ethnic and religious groups are spread across 21 republics and occupied Crimea.\u201cWho are we and why?\u201d asks the protagonist in a recent novel, \u201cMaidenhair,\u201d by the Russian writer Mikhail Shishkin. Where does the Russian empire end and the Russian nation begin? On a global scale, what is Russia\u2019s relationship to the West? These have always been the principal questions in Russia\u2019s perennial search for its national identity, and still there is no clear answer in sight.The Kremlin\u2019s most recent idea of a law defining the Russian nation came to an inglorious end on March 2, after five months of deliberations. It had not even reached the draft stage, despite President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s full support and encouragement. The resistance came from many quarters: Russian nationalists who want the dominant status of Russians enshrined in law; the Orthodox Church, which fears losing its present position as a national church; and above all, the non-Russian ethnic elites, who suspect that this was a Kremlin ploy to deprive them of the privileges that their current national and territorial autonomy allows them within the Russian Federation.Emil Pain, an expert on national issues in Russia and a prominent critic of the law, compared it to the notorious notion of \u201cofficial nationality\u201d \u2014 an imperial, autocratic idea adopted under Emperor Nicholas I in the 1820s. The problem, Mr. Pain maintains, is that instead of promoting the idea of a nation of free citizens, the Kremlin wants a nation subordinate to the state and its leader. As Valery Tishkov, an adviser to Mr. Putin who was charged with drafting the law, acknowledged, \u201cThe society is not quite ready to accept a notion of a united nation that encompasses all nationalities\u201d \u2014 yet another reminder that Russia remains less than the sum of its parts.Here lies Russia\u2019s historic conundrum, born of its enormous size and diversity: One cannot forge what Mr. Pain calls a \u201ccivic nation\u201d \u2014 a pluralistic and participatory democracy \u2014 from a tapestry of religions, tongues and customs without devolving power away from Moscow. But that would risk encouraging demands for more autonomy from some of the 21 non-Russian republics within the Russian Federation. On the other hand, concentrating power solely in the Kremlin and its strong leader means continuing an imperial tradition of keeping the country together through what the Soviet-era human rights leader Andrei Sakharov derided as a \u201cmessianic expansionism.\u201d So defining Russia in opposition to the outside world, the West in particular, has become the standard Kremlin default position.In the last decade, Mr. Putin tried to find a path toward restoring Russia\u2019s imperial identity through a number of ill-fated projects: the Eurasian Commonwealth, the Russian World and the Russian Civilization \u2014 all in opposition to the West and its liberal political ideals.If the 19th century gave us Russian literature and arts, and the 20th science and a fatally flawed ideology of totalitarian socialism, 21st-century Russia has little to offer beyond subversion of Western democracies and revanchist forays along its borders. Stuck between apocalypse and revolution, in the words of the 20th-century Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, fragile Russia is still searching for a sense of national identity.Recent anti-corruption demonstrations have occurred in more than 100 Russian cities, a strike by truckers is now in its third month, and a younger generation has grown less susceptible to television propaganda. With Mr. Putin clearly not ready for any compromise, those are among a few indications that Putinism, as a political system, may be headed for a crisis \u2014 one in which Russia could ultimately go the way of the Soviet Union.If it does, however, given the ruthlessness of its leader and the enormous fortunes at stake, the next demise may turn out to be far less peaceful than that of the Soviet empire that Lenin began.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Act Repeal Could Threaten U.S. Job Engine", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byFrom Akron to Youngstown and Canton to Cleveland, as in cities and towns across the country, workers who once walked out of factories at the end of each shift now stream out of hospitals.While manufacturing employment has fallen nearly 40 percent in northeastern Ohio since 2000, the number of health care jobs in the region has jumped more than 30 percent over the same period. In Akron, the onetime rubber capital of the world, only one of the city\u2019s 10 largest employers still makes tires. Three are hospitals.\u201cPeople who used to make deliveries to factories are now making them to hospitals,\u201d said Samuel D. DeShazior, Akron\u2019s deputy mayor for economic development.Akron\u2019s transformation is echoed in places as varied as Los Angeles, Birmingham, Ala., and Pittsburgh, along with rural areas like Iron County, Mo., where health care accounts for one-fifth of all employment.Nor is the growth limited to hospitals. With help from the vast expansion of Medicaid enrollment that began three years ago, nursing homes, outpatient centers and medical labs have also grown, turning a fragmented industry into a strong political force.Governors on both sides of the aisle, as well as many moderate Republicans on Capitol Hill, have expressed concern over whether the repeal will hurt local economies, especially in places where health care has softened the blow from struggling industries like retailing now or manufacturing in the past.Moreover, in a recovery plagued by uneven growth and widening income inequality, the sector has been a reliable source of steady gains. Health care now equals almost one-fifth of gross domestic product, up from 13 percent in 2000, and it is poised to leapfrog retailing and leisure and hospitality as the second-largest source of overall employment, after professional and business services, accounting for one in eight private sector jobs.The boom in health care did not begin with the Affordable Care Act. The industry was among the only parts of the economy to emerge relatively unscathed from the Great Recession, and it has flourished under Democratic and Republican presidents alike.\u201cIt\u2019s not trivial, and it\u2019s much easier to constrain activity than to promote it,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. \u201cReversing Obamacare is negative for the economy in the next year or two.\u201dThe cost of providing coverage to millions more Americans has its own economic consequences.Many employers, particularly small businesses, complain that they are straining under the demands imposed by the law. They argue that the A.C.A. stifles economic growth by forcing companies to pay heavy taxes and meet cumbersome regulatory burdens. Critics of the law, including many of the Republican backers of the proposed overhaul, say businesses and individuals are also being forced to pay for overly generous coverage.Whatever the macroeconomic dangers, economists say the potential effects on individual consumers are just as worrisome. The House version of the repeal legislation does include significant tax cuts, which usually stimulate economic activity, but with most of the savings going to wealthier households, that bounty is likely to be saved, not spent.At the same time, losing insurance coverage tends to constrain household spending while increasing financial insecurity among families, according to Matt Notowidigdo, a professor of economics at Northwestern.A 2016 paper Mr. Notowidigdo worked on showed that an uninsured hospital stay doubles the risk of bankruptcy for individuals, while lowering credit scores and leaving consumers with an average of $6,000 in unpaid bills.The proposed legislation poses more risks for some parts of the country than others, said Mark Duggan, a professor of economics at Stanford.For example, about 9 percent of the population in Florida buys coverage through the new exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, more than any other state. \u201cIf you lower the subsidies for coverage of 1.8 million Floridians, that will reduce what they can spend on other goods and services,\u201d he said.Mr. Duggan said states like Kentucky, Arkansas, New Mexico and West Virginia would be hard hit by the planned cuts in Medicaid, estimated at more than $880 billion over 10 years.Another vulnerable slice of the population is workers who are a few years away from 65, when Medicare kicks in. \u201cIf there is a group that loses out the most, it\u2019s near-seniors,\u201d said Craig Garthwaite, director of the Healthcare Program at Northwestern\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. \u201cTheir health care is so expensive, but the tax credit in the House bill caps out at $4,000.\u201dMr. Garthwaite, who is a registered Republican and describes himself as a conservative economist, said there were few benefits for local economies in the bill, \u201cand from an individual standpoint, it will be financially crippling for the poor.\u201d Already, he added, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing hospitals pause and adjust to the uncertainty by rethinking expansion plans.\u201dHospitals in particular have been able to grow in recent years, with more of their patients now covered by either Medicaid or insurance purchased in the new exchanges.At the same time, an aging population and expensive new treatments like drugs to treat hepatitis C and once-fatal forms of cancer have increased demand from consumers at many health care providers, even as they have strained budgets. Health care now accounts for nearly a fifth of overall consumer spending.The potential loss of billions of dollars in federal money to states like New York, where large health systems like Northwell and Mount Sinai Health are among the biggest private employers, has helped turn state officials like Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo into vehement critics of the repeal efforts. The state estimated that the repeal could shift more than $2.4 billion in costs onto taxpayers and hospitals each year.Economists on both the left and right say the Affordable Care Act needs substantial changes to ensure its long-term sustainability. They warn, however, that the current House legislation is so sweeping and its changes so abrupt that it carries economic risks of its own, especially given the size of the health care sector and how slowly other parts of the economy are growing.Health care workers, too, have been watching the developments in Washington warily.Oscar Onteveros, 37, began working as a nursing assistant at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center three years ago, after working for years in factories and in temporary jobs.\u201cI thought it would be more stable than working in labor and I would be able to move up,\u201d he said. \u201cI am worried about what happens next because nothing seems certain.\u201dIn assessing the impact of the Republican House bill in an earlier form, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 24 million people would lose insurance over the next decade as a result of cuts to the Medicaid program and the decline in people able to pay for individual coverage.Potential changes to Medicaid are \u201cgoing to put incredible pressure on the states, that will put incredible pressure\u201d on what hospitals receive in payments, said Daniel Steingart, who follows the industry for Moody\u2019s Investors Service. How states would react could vary significantly, he said, with some doing more to make up for the shortfall from the federal government.Safety-net hospitals and academic medical centers that cater to low-income populations are likely to be hardest hit by any cuts, Mr. Steingart said.The overall industry has benefited from the strong economy and the coverage expansions under Medicaid, he said. \u201cPeople have jobs and they have insurance,\u201d he said. About 20 million people gained coverage under the federal health care law. Hospitals have seen significant demand, and they \u201care hiring like crazy,\u201d Mr. Steingart said.Hospital executives said they faced tremendous uncertainty. Many, like Dr. Akram Boutros, the chief executive of the MetroHealth System in Cleveland, were talking with lawmakers to make the case against the bill\u2019s abrupt cuts to Medicaid, hoping for some relief in the Senate. The Ohio Medicaid expansion has \u201cbeen incredibly important to the health of the community,\u201d he said.Like other executives, Dr. Boutros argues that health system groups need to find ways of reducing the overall cost of care.\u201cThe system as constituted today is underperforming and failing the American public,\u201d he said. Hospitals could deliver better care for less money, he said, pointing to a program at MetroHealth that improved the health of people with hypertension and diabetes while saving $1,500 a patient a year.Mr. Steingart agreed, arguing that with Washington fixated on the issue of coverage, the difficult debate over how to control costs has not yet taken place. \u201cWhat\u2019s been missing is what makes health care so expensive in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tackled that issue, and it\u2019s a big one.\u201dThe House health care bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, which seemed likely to soften some large cuts outlined in the House version that were put in to make the legislation more palatable to conservative Republicans.Still, the prospect of cuts of any size has challenged hospitals to try to provide lower-cost care while preparing themselves to absorb the loss of paying patients.Many health systems say their expenses are climbing much faster than the payments from government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. This month, Advocate Health Care, one of the Chicago area\u2019s largest employers, announced plans to cut expenses by $200 million. Advocate Health blamed the cost of providing care for which it was not reimbursed. \u201cOur expenses must be adjusted to meet current and projected Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance payment rates,\u201d Jim Skogsbergh, the chief executive, said in a memo to employees.Atlantic Health System in Morristown, N.J., which benefited from the expansion of Medicaid and the falling number of people without insurance, faces the possibility of losing $65 million a year in revenue.The system\u2019s chief executive, Brian Gragnolati, talked to his staff on Thursday about the possible impact of the House bill. \u201cWhat I worry about in our organization is how are we going to lean into the changes we need to make while we have this uncertainty hanging there,\u201d he said.But Mr. Gragnolati also worried about the health bill\u2019s potential effects on patients, some of whom have gained access to care for the first time.\u201cWhat is going to happen here is when people don\u2019t have access now to care, they will go back to the emergency departments for their primary care, waiting and waiting and waiting\u201d to get a condition treated, Mr. Gragnolati said. \u201cI just feel like we\u2019re going back in time to a place where we were a decade ago. It\u2019s an absolute shame.\u201dJennifer Medina contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Le Pen and Macron Clash in Vicious Presidential Debate in France", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 He said she was telling lies. She called him arrogant. He accused her of repeating \u201cstupidities.\u201d She cut him off and told him not to lecture her. He shook his head sadly, and she laughed sarcastically.But it was also a stark demonstration of two radically different visions of France that voters will have to choose between on Sunday in the election\u2019s final round. Mr. Macron, 39, the former banker and cool technocrat, educated at France\u2019s finest schools and the beneficiary of a meteoric rise, faced off against Ms. Le Pen, 48, the scion of one of the country\u2019s most notorious political families, the inheritor of a far-right party who has tried to move it toward the center.The two candidates did not hide their disdain for each other, and their total divergence on all the issues \u2014 Europe, terrorism, France\u2019s stagnant economy, Russia \u2014 explained why.\u201cThe high priestess of fear is sitting in front of me,\u201d Mr. Macron said derisively, having cast his opponent as a dangerous extremist with deep ties to her party\u2019s dark past. He made a point of repeating her name, to remind viewers of her parental filiation: her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the National Front and is associated with its historical posture of anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and stigmatization of immigrants.\u201cYou are the France of submission,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said with scorn; Mr. Macron was merely a heartless banker, in her view. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the choice you\u2019ve made, the cynical choices, that reveal the coldness of the investment banker you have never ceased being.\u201dHe leads her by 20 points in polls and is considered likely to win on Sunday. The debate is expected to move some voters, but not enough to make up for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s substantial polling deficit. She has seen some slight improvement in recent polls and was clearly hoping to destabilize her younger opponent as she did in the first-round debates, when other candidates were present. With nothing to lose and everything to gain, she went for direct frontal attacks.But Mr. Macron generally kept his cool, laying out his program point by point through the shouting, while Ms. Le Pen, true to the scrappy, guerrilla-style party that she leads \u2014 it is stronger on combat than on policy \u2014 spent much of the two-and-a-half-hour contest attacking him. What policy proposals she offered appeared sketchy.Mr. Macron offered his view of a France open to Europe and free trade, staying in the common currency, reinforcing its ties with European nations, dealing firmly with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and overhauling its stultifying and voluminous labor code in order, he said, to generate more jobs.\u201cWe are in the world,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cFrance is not a closed country.\u201dMs. Le Pen depicted a France with a \u201ctotal collapse of our industries,\u201d preyed upon by Islamist extremists, demanding ever more government protection from economic vicissitudes and urgently needing to close its borders. \u201cI\u2019m the candidate of that France that we love, who will protect our frontiers, who will protect us from savage globalization,\u201d she said at the outset.Mr. Macron was a ruthless capitalist in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s familiar neo-populist depiction, ready to sell French industry down the river to hurt workers and help employers. She repeatedly tied Mr. Macron to the failed government of the incumbent Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in which Mr. Macron served for two years before quitting to start his own political movement.\u201cYou defend private interests,\u201d Ms. Le Pen sneered. \u201cAnd behind that there is social ruin.\u201dMr. Macron replied evenly, \u201cWhat\u2019s extraordinary is that your strategy is simply to say a lot of lies and propose nothing to help the country.\u201d He pointed out the weaknesses in her generous spending plans, noting the lack of revenue-raising measures to back them. \u201cFrance and the French deserve better,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t say stupid things. You are saying a lot of them.\u201dSome of the sharpest exchanges came over terrorism, which polls show is a major preoccupation for the French. Ms. Le Pen cast herself as tougher on the issue, reeling off a series of antiterrorism measures \u2014 experts have suggested that they are either impractical or ineffective \u2014 and saying Mr. Macron was a weakling on security. Nonetheless, it is one of her signature issues, always drawing a thunderous response when she invokes it at rallies. \u201cYou are for laxism,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said.\u201cYou are complaisant toward Islamist fundamentalism,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to eradicate fundamentalist ideologies. You won\u2019t do it, because they support you.\u201dBristling, Mr. Macron pointed out the impracticality of expelling the thousands of people who are in the government\u2019s so-called S-files because they are considered to constitute some potential danger to the country\u2019s security. \u201cThe S-files are just information files,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cYou can be an S-filer merely for having crossed paths with a jihadist.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be much more surgical than Ms. Le Pen,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat you are proposing, as usual, is merely powder,\u201d he said, pointing out that as a member of the European Parliament, Ms. Le Pen voted repeatedly against antiterrorism measures.She dismissed these criticisms, as she did the entire European Union project. Under her, she said, \u201cFrench laws will be superior to laws given out by some commissioner whose name we don\u2019t even know.\u201dMr. Macron posited a diametrically opposed view, insisting that France\u2019s place was in a stronger Europe that could stand up to Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia and President Trump\u2019s United States. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s idea is that \u201cwe\u2019re going to leave Europe because the others can make it, but we can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the face of this spirit of defeat, I am for the spirit of conquest, because France has always succeeded.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Is Becoming More Fenced Off, Vindictive and Callous", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 In the summer of 2013, Britain\u2019s Home Office unveiled a new campaign to tackle unwanted immigration. For a month, vans toured six London boroughs, bearing a poster that read: \u201cIn the U.K. illegally? Go home or face arrest.\u201dThe campaign was a failure. According to an official evaluation, only 11 people left the country as a result of the advertisements, and the vans were swiftly retired amid widespread criticism of their authoritarian rhetoric. But they marked a turning point in how Britain approaches immigration: the extension of border control into everyday life.The minister in charge of the vans was Theresa May. At the time, Mrs. May was the home secretary, the cabinet position responsible for border enforcement, and she said her intention was to make Britain a \u201chostile environment\u201d for unwanted migrants. Today, she is prime minister, leading the Conservative Party, on an anti-immigrant platform, into a general election on June 8 that it will almost certainly win.The popular image of a border is a fence or a wall at the geographical frontier of a country. But in a world where capital, communications and people are more mobile than ever before, what is of increasing importance is the way a state distinguishes between who\u2019s included or excluded within its territory. In Britain, these measures have proliferated.Today, if you want to rent a house, get a driver\u2019s license or open a bank account, you must first show your passport or produce evidence that you\u2019re in the country legally. A crackdown on employers means that uniformed immigration raids have become a regular feature of life in multiethnic neighborhoods. Public bodies that previously had no role in border control are being roped in, too. Since 2016, schools have been asked to collect data on pupils\u2019 nationality and country of birth, which was supposed to be shared with the government department responsible for immigration enforcement until public criticism made officials water down the policy. (An earlier proposal had been to make teachers actually carry out immigration checks.)Most of the measures were not in place a decade or even five years ago. Mrs. May first put forth the idea of a \u201chostile environment\u201d in 2012: enact rules that would either make it difficult for people with irregular immigration status to go about their everyday lives, thus encouraging them to leave, or that would bring them to the attention of the state so that it can deport them.This crackdown, encoded in the 2014 Immigration Act, was in part the result of political expediency. The governing Conservative Party was elected in 2010 with a promise to \u201ccap\u201d immigration at the tens of thousands. For as long as Britain remains part of the European Union, this cap can\u2019t apply to migrants from within the union because of the common agreement on free movement. But around half the immigrants to Britain \u2014 net migration was 273,000 in the year ending September 2016 \u2014 come from elsewhere. To make up the numbers, the government has been making life as difficult as possible for would-be migrants from outside Europe. Visa fees are charged at punitive rates, while there is a hefty minimum income requirement for anybody who marries a non-European Union citizen and wants to bring them to live in Britain. Another act, passed last year, has introduced even tougher penalties for those with irregular status, including the new crimes of \u201cillegal working\u201d and \u201cdriving when unlawfully present in the U.K.\u201dAfter last year\u2019s Brexit vote, Mrs. May has risen from home secretary to prime minister \u2014 and her appeal rests on using the power of the state to draw lines between the British people and outsiders. \u201cIf you believe you\u2019re a citizen of the world, you\u2019re a citizen of nowhere,\u201d she declared last autumn.This project has a human cost, with minorities the worst affected. Already, there is evidence that ID checks for tenants are encouraging landlords to discriminate. A report in February by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants found that more than half of landlords surveyed said they were less likely to rent to foreigners as a result of the new policy. The study also found that British citizens of black and ethnic minority backgrounds were finding it harder to rent, too. \u201cBritish\u201d is still too often treated as a racial identity.The charges and restrictions in the National Health Service mean that some migrants are avoiding treatment for medical conditions, which threatens not only the individuals concerned but also public health. Women are particularly at risk: A growing number of pregnant women with uncertain immigration status are avoiding prenatal care, according to Doctors of the World, while asylum-seeking women trapped in abusive relationships are being denied access to state-funded safe houses and told to stay with their partners if they want to keep their right to stay in Britain. These measures raise questions, too, about how a government that behaves in this way will treat its own citizens.At root is a problem affecting much of the world today: How do states maintain control \u2014 and a sense of national cohesion \u2014 within a global economy? But in Britain, where questions of identity, sovereignty and perceived threats to the nation have come to the fore, it is particularly acute.The prime minister has staked her reputation on tough immigration controls, having done more than any other politician to push borders into everyday life. She has taken us into a Brexit process and an election campaign where her opponents have been variously characterized as rootless, \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and \u201csaboteurs.\u201d Her party\u2019s election manifesto released earlier this month repeated the pledge to cap immigration and promised further efforts to discourage refugees from claiming asylum in Britain. Unless these trends are challenged, Britain looks set to emerge with a fenced-off, more vindictive and more callous society.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coal Country\u2019s Power Plants Are Turning Away From Coal", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byCoal is on the defensive in the nation\u2019s power industry. Even in coal country.The pressure to shift more of the country\u2019s electric supply to renewable sources is not just a rallying cry for environmentalists. Some of the power industry\u2019s biggest customers, like General Motors and Microsoft, have made a commitment to clean energy. And to help them meet it \u2014 and keep them from taking their business elsewhere \u2014 utilities are changing their ways.West Virginia, where coal is king, is no exception.Appalachian Power, the leading utility there, is quickly shifting toward natural gas and renewable sources like wind and solar, even as President Trump calls for a coal renaissance. Appalachian Power still burns plenty of coal, but in recent years it has closed three coal-fired plants and converted two others to gas, reducing its dependence on coal to 61 percent last year, down from 74 percent in 2012.Chris Beam, the company\u2019s president, made the industry\u2019s shifting dynamics clear in an encounter with Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, at his inaugural ball in January.\u201c\u2018Look, I\u2019d like to see you guys build another coal plant,\u2019\u201d he recalled the governor saying. \u201cAnd our answer was: We\u2019re not going to build another coal plant.\u201d (The governor confirmed the account, but added in an email, \u201cI\u2019ll continue to encourage power companies to burn more coal to put our miners back to work.\u201d)It\u2019s the same story in Virginia, where Dominion, a leading utility based in Richmond \u2014 near where commercial coal mining got its start \u2014 designed a special rate to make it easier for Amazon Web Services and similar customers to buy renewable energy.In Kentucky, a chance meeting between a state regulator and a Facebook employee ultimately led the Public Service Commission to advise utilities that they could offer customers renewable energy packages, part of an effort to attract new business and hold on to automakers like G.M. and Toyota.And in Wyoming, the nation\u2019s leading coal producer by far, Black Hills Energy worked with Microsoft to create a complex arrangement for the technology giant to get enough wind energy to fulfill current and future needs at Microsoft\u2019s data center in Cheyenne.\u201cI\u2019ve not spoken to a single utility that\u2019s truly holding on to a future of more coal,\u201d said Brian Janous, who directs energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to attract, as in the Appalachian case, new customers, and those customers aren\u2019t attracted by coal.\u201dAlmost half of the Fortune 500 companies have adopted at least one climate or clean-energy goal, with 23 of them pledging eventually to run their businesses on 100 percent renewable energy, including Walmart, Bank of America and Google, according to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund and other environmentally minded organizations and investors.Though corporations are buying renewable energy across the country, energy executives and analysts say it is notable that the trend is taking hold in states where coal production is part of the economic heart and soul.Coal executives say that they are watching the impact of the renewable-power demands on the coal industry, but that it is a matter of rising unease.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about it,\u201d said Harry Childress, president of the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance. \u201cWe see the pressure from these companies is pushing power producers more away from coal, which is a cheaper power.\u201dFive years ago, corporate renewable-energy partnerships with utilities were barely a blip on the electric industry radar. But they are rapidly increasing, according to a recent report by the World Resources Institute, which has helped to promote them.Last year, utilities made deals with corporate customers through rate arrangements known as green tariffs for 220 megawatts of power, enough to run about 40,000 average American homes. Thus far this year, there have been 360 megawatts worth of agreements, with an additional 465 megawatts under negotiation.\u201cThis is what these corporations want and, for the electric companies, they have to figure out how to do it,\u201d said Lisa Wood, executive director of the Institute for Electric Innovation at the Edison Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the utility industry. \u201cThis is a tremendous driver. These are very, very large customers.\u201dOne reason for the rapid acceleration is that utilities and regulators \u2014 often with technical assistance from environmental groups \u2014 are learning how to devise rates and transaction structures to accommodate the energy purchases.Appalachian Power\u2019s switch from coal was in part pushed as a result of a summit meeting that its parent company, American Electric Power, held at its headquarters last fall with corporate giants including Walmart, Facebook, Hilton, Procter & Gamble and Marathon Petroleum.Those companies stressed that if they were going to expand their businesses in A.E.P. regions, they would need access to low-carbon energy. American Electric Power organized a second meeting in Washington in May that included Amazon, Caesars Entertainment, DuPont, Marriott International and Starbucks.With the goal of attracting big business to coal country, Mr. Beam is now in the market to buy, lease or build a fleet of wind and solar power farms across West Virginia and Virginia. The goal is to increase Appalachian Power\u2019s renewable-energy fleet to 34 percent of its power capacity by 2031 from 17 percent today.An announcement for a new wind farm in southern West Virginia is expected within weeks, as discussions with big companies \u2014 which American Electric Power executives refused to identify \u2014 continue.\u201cSpecific customers are looking specifically for renewables and to what degree you are moving toward a new clean energy economy,\u201d said Nicholas K. Akins, A.E.P.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cShareholders are more interested in sustainability going forward and improvements from a climate change perspective and carbon emissions perspective.\u201dMr. Akins said American Electric Power, which serves over five million customers in 11 states, intended to respond to the demands of customers whatever policies were dictated in Washington. He added, \u201cWe are trying to make our company long-term sustainable regardless of administration.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These contracts have long been routine among senior executives. But they are rapidly spreading to employees like Mr. Bollinger, who do the kind of blue-collar work that President Trump has promised to create more of.\u2014\u00a0Keith Bollinger, a factory manager in Conover, N.C. Employment lawyers say their use has exploded. Russell Beck, a partner at the Boston law firm Beck Reed Riden who does an annual survey of noncompete litigation, said the most recent data showed that noncompete and trade-secret lawsuits had roughly tripled since 2000.\u201cCompanies of all sorts use them for people at all levels,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a change.\u201dEmployment lawyers know this, but workers are often astonished to learn that they\u2019ve signed away their right to leave for a competitor. Timothy Gonzalez, an hourly laborer who shoveled dirt for a fast-food-level wage, was sued after leaving one environmental drilling company for another. Phillip Barone, a midlevel salesman and Air Force veteran, was let go from his job after his old company sent a cease-and-desist letter saying he had signed a noncompete.Then there is Mr. Bollinger, whose long-running legal battle is full of twists and turns that include clandestine photography, a private investigator, a mysterious phone call and courthouse victories later undone by losses in appeals court.\u201cThis is the strangest noncompete case I have ever been involved with, or even heard of,\u201d said Michael P. Thomas, Mr. Bollinger\u2019s lawyer and a partner at Patrick, Harper & Dixon in Hickory, N.C.By giving companies huge power to dictate where and for whom their employees can work next, noncompetes take a person\u2019s greatest professional assets\u00a0\u2014\u00a0years of hard work and earned skills\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and turn\u00a0them\u00a0into a liability.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a bump in the road and be in between jobs for a little while; it\u2019s another thing to be prevented from doing the only thing you know how to do,\u201d said Max Burton Wahrhaftig, an arborist in Doylestown, Pa., who in 2013 was threatened by his former employer after leaving for a better-paying job with a rival tree service. He was able to avoid a full-blown lawsuit.Noncompetes are but one factor atop a great mountain of challenges making it harder for\u00a0employees\u00a0to get ahead.\u00a0Globalization\u00a0and automation\u00a0have\u00a0put American workers in competition with overseas labor and machines. The rise of contract employment has made it harder to find a steady job.\u00a0The decline of unions has made it tougher to negotiate.\u2013 Max Burton Wahrhaftig, an arborist in Doylestown, Pa.When a noncompete agreement is\u00a0litigated\u00a0to the letter, a worker can be barred or ousted from a new job by court order. Even if that never happens, the threat alone can create a chilling effect that reduces wages throughout the work force.In 2011, Timothy Gonzalez started working as a labor hand for a company called Singley Construction. He was 18 years old\u00a0and\u00a0already a father, and the extent of his education was a high\u00a0school equivalency test. In other words, he needed money and did not have many options.Mr. Gonzalez started at a little over $10 an hour in a job he described as \u201cpretty much shoveling dirt.\u201d Nevertheless, he signed an employment contract that included a noncompete clause, enforceable for three years within 350 miles of Singley\u2019s base in Columbia, Miss.\u201cAll I heard \u2014 at that age and the situation I was in \u2014 was just, \u2018If you want a paycheck, sign here,\u2019 and so I signed there and went to work,\u201d said Mr. Gonzalez, who is now 24 and lives in Milton, Fla.Mr. Gonzalez was later promoted to a job where he\u00a0operated\u00a0an environmental drilling rig.\u00a0After leaving the company two years ago,\u00a0and\u00a0subsequently\u00a0taking a better-paying position with a competitor, Mr. Gonzalez was sued for violating his agreement not to compete. \u2013 Timothy Gonzalez, a laborer for an environmental drilling company. Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s new boss, Gary Hill, owner of Walker-Hill Environmental, an environmental drilling company, said he ignored the suit for two weeks because he didn\u2019t believe it was real.\u201cI said,\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s no way this will happen,\u2019 but I\u2019ll be danged if I didn\u2019t have to attorney-up and fight the thing,\u201d said Mr. Hill, who settled the case out of court. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous \u2014 it\u2019s slavery in the modern-day form.\u201dRepresentatives of Singley Construction declined to comment.The surprise Mr. Gonzalez got is not uncommon. Many workers, not just blue\u00a0collar\u00a0but people\u00a0who\u00a0went to college or have an advanced degree, have only a vague understanding of what a noncompete is, and they are often asked to sign one when they have little chance to negotiate.\u201cBy then,\u00a0they had said yes to their company, and no to the other companies they were negotiating with,\u201d Mr. Marx said.Companies have always owned their employees\u2019 labor, but today\u2019s employment contracts often cover general knowledge as well. In addition to noncompete clauses, there are nonsolicitation and nondealing agreements, which prevent employees from calling or servicing customers they have worked with in the past. There are nonpoaching agreements that prevent employees from trying to recruit old colleagues.Put it all together, and suddenly some of the main avenues for finding a better-paying job \u2014 taking a promotion with a competitor, being recruited by an old colleague \u2014 are cut off.\u2013 Russell Beck, a partner at Beck Reed Riden LLP in Boston.Companies say this is a natural reaction in an economy that is more about knowledge and less about sweat. Data makes up a larger share of many companies\u2019 assets, and the more people work around the clock, and remotely, often switching between company-owned and personal devices, the more difficult it becomes to guard it.\u201cWhen a person takes a trade secret and walks across the street to another company, how am I going to know that?\u201d said Paul T. Dacier, a longtime technology executive who was once general counsel for EMC Corporation (now Dell EMC), and\u00a0today\u00a0serves in the same position for an agriculture technology start-up called Indigo. \u201cAnd when I do find out, it\u2019s too late.\u201dSome workers end up idle, collecting unemployment and using programs like Medicaid. Many others take jobs well below their means, robbing the nation of their skills.\u2013 Paul T. Dacier, general counsel for Indigo, an agriculture technology start-up. Two years ago, Phillip Barone left his job doing sales and marketing for a military magazine to take a similar job, with a pay increase of about 10 percent, at a rival publication. A few months later,\u00a0his old employer sent a letter saying he had violated a noncompete agreement that barred him from working with other military publishers.Since his new company was unwilling to defend him, and since he was unable to pay the legal bills himself, Mr. Barone resigned and lived on unemployment while looking for a new job, but found nothing. When his unemployment ran out, he took a $15-an-hour job with a landscape firm, where he whacked weeds and planted flowers.\u201cMy whole mission was to do whatever I could to bring in some money to take care of my family and make sure nobody could take my house from me,\u201d said Mr. Barone, who lives in Lake in the Hills, Ill.Mr. Barone left his landscaping job\u00a0this year and is now a sales manager elsewhere. And he will be free of his noncompete eventually.\u201cThese things slow your ascent up the job ladder,\u201d Mr. Starr said.Moreover, many\u00a0burn through\u00a0their\u00a0savings and pile up debt while searching for a job\u00a0from\u00a0a weakened negotiating position. Several years ago, Patricia O\u2019Donnell, a market researcher in Philadelphia, spent 18 months unemployed after being laid off\u00a0by\u00a0a company whose noncompete prohibited her from working for a number of major pharmaceutical companies,\u00a0thus\u00a0limiting her\u00a0prospects in\u00a0a major\u00a0local\u00a0industry. She finally found a job,\u00a0but only recently got clear of the bills she racked up.\u201cIt took years to get rid of that credit-card debt,\u201d she said.\u2013 Patricia O\u2019Donnell, market researcher who spent 18 months unemployed after she was laid off from a company whose noncompete blocked several major employers in her field.The great counterexample, which comes up in just about every discussion of the subject, is the growth of\u00a0Silicon Valley.California law prohibits noncompete clauses, contributing to the inveterate poaching with which the state\u2019s technology industry was founded. It can be brutal for employers, but it helps raise wages\u00a0and has created a situation where any company looking to hire a bunch of engineers in a hurry, be it an established giant or a start-up, feels it should locate there.Mike Schultz, the bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, framed it with the most conservative of talking points:\u00a0the right to work. \u201cIf an employer can fire anybody for any reason,\u201d he said,\u00a0\u201cemployees also need to have the right to walk.\u201dMr. Bollinger, the factory worker in North Carolina, started working when he was 14,\u00a0and by his senior year of high school,\u00a0he\u00a0was the assistant manager of a local shoe store. He didn\u2019t like retail, so in 1982, shortly after graduating, he took a job in the textile industry.He began in a position that entailed\u00a0pulling the fabric off cardboard rolls,\u00a0and worked his way up from there, one job to the next, hourly wages to a salaried position, until eventually he was the quality control manager for two plants owned by a company called TSG Finishing.TSG is a 115-year-old, family-owned company that works with textile manufacturers and others. It doesn\u2019t make fabrics but is an intermediary, treating them with chemicals and laminates, giving them special finishes and properties like fire resistance.Mr. Bollinger, as quality control manager, worked with customers to make sure they got what they wanted. Still, he said, the job was about learning a general process, not absorbing any specialized knowledge.\u201cI don\u2019t know how to make the goop, I just know how to apply the goop,\u201d he said.TSG would disagree. The company declined to comment beyond an emailed statement, but its lawsuit described Mr. Bollinger as instrumental to the company, and said he knew important details about things like pricing, proprietary processing methods and customer preferences.In 2007, in exchange for a $3,500 bonus and a $1,300 annual raise that brought his salary to a little over $70,000, Mr. Bollinger had signed an employment agreement that included a confidentiality clause and noncompete agreement. The list of prohibited territories began with a list of states and ended with \u201cNorth America.\u201dThen the financial crisis struck, leading to bankruptcies and layoffs across the textile industry. \u201cI saw people get laid off that I didn\u2019t think would ever lose their job,\u201d Mr. Bollinger said.His pay shriveled, and by 2013, after TSG had gone into and out of bankruptcy, he was on pace to make about $61,000, according to income statements he provided. Six miles away, however, the economic recovery was taking hold.The assets of Premier Finishing, a TSG competitor that had also fallen into bankruptcy, were purchased by American Custom Finishing, which was owned by a chemist and entrepreneur named Gary Harris.The two spoke, and eventually Mr. Harris offered Mr. Bollinger a job and a raise, to $75,000, a little above his pre-recession pay. Mr. Bollinger said American advised him to check his employment agreement, and a lawyer he hired said that the noncompete was probably unenforceable.He assumed his defection wouldn\u2019t go over well, so on the day he gave notice, while his boss considered the rival\u2019s offer, he quietly packed up his office and loaded things like his family pictures and a framed B.B. King concert ticket into his car. It turned out to be a good idea; a few hours later,\u00a0he was escorted off the property.Two months later, he was served papers at work: TSG had sued him for violating his confidentiality and noncompete agreements, and had asked a court to remove him from his job. The suit did not allege that Mr. Bollinger had stolen anything, but said he knew so much about TSG\u2019s business that he would \u201cinevitably\u201d disclose trade secrets that the company wanted to protect.Calvin E. Murphy, a superior court judge, did not grant TSG\u2019s wish. In a written order, Judge Murphy said,\u00a0\u201cEnforcement of the noncompete provision in the manner articulated\u201d by TSG would effectively bar Mr. Bollinger \u201cfrom seeking employment anywhere in North America in the only profession he has practiced since graduating high school.\u201dTSG appealed, however, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed the decision. A little after that, Mr. Harris, American\u2019s chief executive, called Mr. Bollinger at home and told him not to return to work.\u201cMy heart was broken,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Bollinger said.About a year after the Appeals Court decision, TSG filed an amended complaint against Mr. Bollinger and others, alleging that he had quietly continued working for American even while the injunction was in place, and asking the court to prohibit him from working there ever again.The new complaint cited evidence, like photos of Mr. Bollinger\u2019s wife\u2019s car parked at American\u2019s facility, and a phone call TSG had received from \u201ca female who would not reveal her identity,\u201d who said Mr. Bollinger had continued to work there. At one point,\u00a0TSG hired a private investigator to look into it.\u201cIt is regretful that a great deal of money and resources have to be spent in our court system which could be otherwise spent on employee raises or investing in new equipment to make us more competitive,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Harris\u00a0said\u00a0in an emailed statement.Perhaps more important, the whole ordeal had caused a \u201cstrain\u201d between TSG and its customers. The complaint said that in 2015 one customer had said it planned to transfer its business to American; another had asked TSG to resolve the dispute in a way that allowed Mr. Bollinger to continue at his new job.\u201cWhen a competitor has the opportunity to poach that knowledge without making the investment in research and development, it gives them an unfair advantage, which a three-judge panel agreed happened in this case,\u201d said Jack Rosenstein, TSG\u2019s chief executive, in an emailed statement.As with everything else in business, the case came down to money.\u00a0This\u00a0past\u00a0week TSG accepted a $200,000 offer of judgment from American and the other defendants, freeing Mr. Bollinger from the lawsuit. The case had gone on so long that the noncompete has lapsed, and Mr. Bollinger has found another manufacturing job elsewhere.But the financial scars remain: Mr. Bollinger and his wife, Sandie, drained their savings to pay the legal bill. They have borrowed from friends and relatives, and racked up\u00a0$50,000 in credit card bills and other debt.Mr. Bollinger said the saddest part to him is that such a small sum of money, the $14,000 raise from American, could have started the whole dispute in the first place.During a recent interview, he talked about his last day at TSG and the emotions of walking away from a plant where he had worked for two decades. That job, and the advancement that came with it, had given him the means to raise a family, as well as middle-class luxuries like the musical instruments in his house and the framed concert tickets he hung on his office wall.\u201cIf all they would have said is,\u00a0\u2018Keith, we want to keep you, and we are going to reinstate your pay,\u2019\u201d he said,\u00a0\u201cI would have taken all that stuff out of my car and hung it back up in my office.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fiat Chrysler, in Settlement Talks With U.S., Is Under More Pressure", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, one of the world\u2019s biggest carmakers, said on Thursday that it was in talks with the Department of Justice to settle an investigation into diesel deception, as growing evidence points to the carmaker\u2019s use of illegal software to evade emissions tests.The settlement talks add to the pressure on Fiat Chrysler at a time of meager profitability.The German carmaker Volkswagen, which faced a similar scandal, has been hit with billions of dollars of settlements and fines, and seen several executives investigated or charged. Though Fiat Chrysler\u2019s financial damage is unlikely to be as costly as Volkswagen\u2019s, the emissions cheating, if proved, could still be expensive.The investigation is following much the same path.Now, a new academic study is lending credence to the claims.Researchers from the University of the Ruhr in Bochum, Germany, and the University of California, San Diego, said they found evidence of a so-called defeat device in a diesel Fiat 500X, a compact S.U.V. sold in Europe. Software in the engine\u2019s computer reduced pollution controls 26 minutes after the car was started, according to the study. A standard emissions test procedure lasts a little less than 26 minutes. Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on allegations of cheating in the 500X.The authors, who are professors and graduate students, provided The New York Times and several other news organizations with advance copies of the study, which is scheduled to be published next week.The company said in a statement that it was in talks with the Justice Department and \u201cis seeking a fair and equitable resolution to this matter.\u201d But Fiat Chrysler also said it would defend itself \u201cagainst any claims that the company deliberately installed defeat devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests.\u201dThe term \u201cdefeat device\u201d refers to software installed on vehicles to allow them to deliberately evade pollution standards by detecting when a car is being tested in a laboratory for its emissions levels.Volkswagen\u2019s use of such illegal software in 600,000 Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche diesel cars sold in the United States, out of 11 million fitted with the device worldwide, has caused it enormous problems.Six employees have been charged in the United States over the deception and another has pleaded guilty while Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive is being investigated by German prosecutors. The company has already agreed to pay criminal and civil penalties of $4.3 billion under the terms of a plea agreement with American authorities.But other carmakers are also under scrutiny.Daimler, the maker of Mercedes cars, has disclosed that the Justice Department is investigating emissions of its diesel vehicles in the United States and that prosecutors in Stuttgart, Germany, have opened a criminal investigation. The French government is investigating possible emissions fraud by Renault-Nissan.In Europe, diesel pollution has become a major political issue. Volkswagen\u2019s cheating exposed weak enforcement of emissions regulations by governments protecting their domestic automakers. European governments have been pointing fingers at one another, straining relations.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.In all the cases, the countries are accused of not enforcing common European rules on emissions.Studies by the French, British and German governments have established that diesel vehicles by virtually all carmakers pollute far more on the road than in the carefully controlled conditions of an emissions testing lab. In a French study, the Fiat 500X was one of the cars with the biggest discrepancies between road and lab emissions.With the exception of Volkswagen, though, European carmakers have been able to escape consequences because of loopholes in European rules that allow carmakers to throttle down pollution controls to protect the engine.Carmakers have made liberal use of that exception. But there is a growing backlash from residents angry about bad air quality caused by diesel cars in big cities like Paris and Stuttgart, the home of Daimler.Diesel sales in Europe have been slumping as buyers become more aware of the cost to human health and the environment. That is a big threat to carmakers. Diesel accounts for about half of all cars sold in Europe, and it is also crucial for automotive manufacturers to meet fuel efficiency standards. Diesel engines burn fuel more efficiently than gasoline ones, but they produce more harmful nitrogen oxides.The researchers sought to detect defeat devices by analyzing engine software, which is less time consuming and less expensive than analyzing tailpipe emissions from moving cars.The study, financed by the European Union and the National Science Foundation in the United States, asserts that documentation for the Fiat 500X\u2019s engine software described two modes.One mode, labeled \u201chomologation,\u201d or approval, kept emissions low. During a second mode, labeled \u201cRDE\u201d \u2014 an acronym for \u201creal driving emissions\u201d \u2014 pollution control equipment was dialed back to improve fuel economy.Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on the findings of the report.The study also raises question about Bosch, the German company that supplied engine computers and software to both Fiat and Volkswagen.\u201cWe find strong evidence that both defeat devices were created by Bosch and then enabled by Volkswagen and Fiat for their respective vehicles,\u201d the study said.Bosch said it could not comment in detail because of continuing investigations and lawsuits.But it said in a statement, \u201cBosch supplies these components to the automaker\u2019s specifications. It is always each automaker\u2019s responsibility to calibrate and integrate components into the overall vehicle system, as well as to obtain approval from the local registration authorities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s First Lady, a Confidante and Coach, May Break the Mold", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 If France\u2019s president-elect has broken every rule in the political playbook, consider Brigitte Macron, the country\u2019s next first lady.She met her future husband, Emmanuel, when he was 15 and she was his 39-year-old drama teacher, married with three children. She and his parents at first tried to discourage him from pursuing her, and she has said they did not have a \u201ccarnal\u201d relationship when he was in high school, but he eventually won her over.By all accounts, she was present at every stage of his political evolution, coaching him on his speeches and public demeanor, and she is the one he turns to for an unsparing critique. He treats her as an equal partner and says she will define her future role.France being France, this unusual couple is already stirring a lively and erudite debate about sexism, ageism, masculinity, contemporary marriage, political stagecraft and what a modern French first lady should actually be.\u201cIt\u2019s like a breath of fresh air in this country,\u201d said Natacha Henry, a writer on gender issues. \u201cI think he won because he didn\u2019t do any kind of macho performance, and that\u2019s what we need. If she\u2019s done that for him, great.\u201dSome women see the Macrons as breaking with a pattern of powerful men adorning themselves with younger women; others say French history is replete with examples of younger men seeking out older women, from Henri II\u2019s affair with Diane de Poitiers in the 16th century on.To some, Mr. Macron, 39, is a welcome antidote to past hypermasculine French politicians, and he surrounds himself with strong female advisers and models an egalitarian marriage. Others have mocked him as being under the thumb of a mother figure and even accused him of a gay affair, which he was driven to publicly deny.The candidate he defeated, Marine Le Pen, could not resist a dig at the marriage during their final debate: \u201cI can see you want to play this teacher and pupil game with me, but it\u2019s not really my thing.\u201d\u201cMadame Macron\u2019s age is a feminist issue here,\u201d Ms. Henry said. \u201cI was at the hairdresser\u2019s at a very small town in Orl\u00e9ans the day he was appointed minister of economy, and all the ladies were so happy she was so much older than him. We\u2019re so fed up with these older guys with young actresses.\u201dThe Macrons both grew up in the northern city of Amiens, Brigitte Macron as the sixth child of a family whose chocolate business was a local institution founded in 1872. She married a banker in 1974 when she was 21, had two daughters and a son, and taught French, Latin and drama in high school.Like many schoolboys, Emmanuel Macron developed a crush on his teacher. Ms. Macron, during an interview she gave in 2016 to Paris Match magazine, described falling in love: \u201cI felt that I was slipping, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI then asked him to go to Paris\u201d to finish his education, and his parents were also eager to separate them.While the age of sexual consent in France is 15, it is illegal for teachers to have sex with students under the age of 18; Ms. Macron told the authors of a book about the couple that they did not consummate the relationship while he was in high school. She declined a request for an interview.In a documentary aired this week on French television, she said he had called her every day and had gradually worn down her resistance. \u201cHe assured me that he would return,\u201d she told Paris Match. \u201cAt the age of 17, Emmanuel told me, \u2018Whatever you do, I will marry you.\u2019 Love took everything in its path and led me to divorce.\u201dThey married in 2007, a year after she formally divorced. A video clip of their wedding shows him thanking her children for accepting him; her daughters were active in his campaign, and the documentary shows him hunting for Easter eggs with his seven stepgrandchildren.Anne-\u00c9lisabeth Moutet, an analyst of French politics and culture, notes that the presentation of the Macron marriage, including Ms. Macron\u2019s interviews, has been carefully staged to try to get out ahead of what might otherwise have been seen as a liability.In this, she said, they have had the canny advice of Mich\u00e8le Marchand, known as Mimi, one of France\u2019s best-known celebrity handlers and the owner of a photo agency, who was often photographed at their side during the campaign.\u201cThey decided that it was bound to be an image problem if it was not tackled in a clever way,\u201d Ms. Moutet said.Candice Nedelec, an author of a book on them, \u201cLes Macron,\u201d said Mr. Macron would emerge backstage from a campaign appearance and reflexively ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s Brigitte?\u201dMr. Macron has sometimes come off as wordy, theoretical or hard to follow. Ms. Macron told him bluntly to cut parts of his campaign book because they were too boring, Ms. Nedelec said. The documentary shows Ms. Macron rehearsing a speech with him, telling him that he had not spoken loudly enough.\u201cDuring a presidential campaign, it\u2019s usually the king and his court,\u201d Ms. Nedelec said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who won\u2019t hesitate to tell him the truth.\u201dLeah Pisar, an expert in Franco-American relations who worked in the Clinton White House, said Ms. Macron served as his gatekeeper: \u201cYou want to get to him, you go through her.\u201dIn this, Ms. Macron also appears maternal, protecting her husband as many French wives are expected to do. She is seen chiding him not to eat junk food on the trail in a documentary that followed his campaign for several months.But Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, a campaign adviser on gender issues, and others who know the couple warn against painting her as a Pygmalion figure.They say that he frames policy and that she is more of a sounding board, contributing only on issues she knows well, including education, culture and women\u2019s rights. Ms. Nedelec said Ms. Macron had urged her husband to include proposals for smaller classes for students in disadvantaged areas.She and one of her daughters pushed him to help advance women in politics; he has pledged that half the candidates his party will field in the coming legislative elections will be women and that he will appoint many to his cabinet.Some of these may be issues that Ms. Macron takes up as first lady, a role that is undefined in France and has no government-paid staff \u2014 and polls show the French public wants to keep it that way, said Robert Schneider, who wrote a book about first ladies in France.Some first ladies in France have been virtually invisible, like Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. During Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s presidency, there was no official first lady. He left his companion, the journalist Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, for an actress, Julie Gayet.\u201cThe role of first lady evolved as women in French society evolved,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cWe went from de Gaulle\u2019s wife, who was very submissive, taking care of the children, very discreet \u2014 it corresponded to a bourgeois French family. Then with Carla Bruni and Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, we came to modern women who take their place, and that will be accepted.\u201dBut there is less support for overtly political first ladies, he said.\u201cShe can\u2019t be someone who whispers in the ears of the president,\u201d said Alix Bouilhaguet, a journalist who covered the spouses of the presidential candidates. \u201cWe had that with Val\u00e9rie. She created a blurring of the lines, and people didn\u2019t like it.\u201dMs. Nedelec said that she had spoken with Ms. Macron a few days ago and that Ms. Macron was thinking about Michelle Obama as a model. \u201cBrigitte said she knows it was her husband who was elected and not her,\u201d Ms. Nedelec said.Yet in a television interview after he made it to the presidential runoff, her husband made it clear that she was not vanishing: \u201cShe will have a say in what she wants to be. She will have a presence, a voice, a look. She will have it privately by my side as she always has, but she will have a public role because that\u2019s how it goes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Work Requirement Became a Theme of the Trump Budget", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byA Question of IncentiveThe new White House budget proposal is built on a deep-rooted conservative belief: The government should help those who are willing to work, and cull from benefit rolls those who aren\u2019t.That emphasis on work underlies deep cuts and proposed changes to food stamps, cash assistance and health benefits for the poor in a budget that boosts spending for the military and border security. Expect the poor to work in exchange for aid, the White House argues, and antipoverty programs will work better while costing the government less.If that strategy sounds as if it lacks compassion, says the budget director, Mick Mulvaney, the Trump administration is trying to balance compassion for taxpayers, too.\u201cWe need people to go to work,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said this week. \u201cIf you\u2019re on food stamps, and you\u2019re able-bodied, we need you to go to work. If you\u2019re on disability insurance and you\u2019re not supposed to be \u2014 if you\u2019re not truly disabled, we need you to go back to work. We need everybody pulling in the same direction.\u201dMr. Mulvaney did not specify how work requirements might be phased in for food stamps \u2014 or how much it would cost to police such requirements for any of these programs \u2014 but he questioned whether everyone receiving help today truly needs it.The economy will take off for all of us, by Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s rationale, when each able-bodied American embraces the civic duty to hold down a job. He and other conservative proponents of work requirements say the expectation is a fair one. If you want government help, you have to help yourself, by getting a job. And over time, those jobs would theoretically enable the poor to move off government assistance, shrinking the programs in the process.The best evidence supporting work requirements \u2014 much of it after passage of the 1996 welfare overhaul law \u2014 was collected during a much stronger economy, however. And research suggests that demanding work in exchange for government aid is a dubious way to lift people out of poverty.\u201cThere was a mantra associated with some aspects of welfare reform \u2014 \u2018a job, a better job, then a career\u2019 \u2014 that led people to think getting off welfare into the work force would be the beginning of an upward progression until you enter the middle class,\u201d said Jeffrey Grogger, a professor of urban policy at the University of Chicago who has studied welfare reform. \u201cWe never saw much of that.\u201dCritics of work requirements also assert that they strip aid from people with legitimate obstacles to finding employment, which can push the poor deeper into poverty. The real problem, opponents argue, isn\u2019t that low-income adults don\u2019t want to work, but that they can\u2019t for hard-to-fix reasons \u2014 they lack skills or child care, or have criminal records or health challenges that don\u2019t qualify as a disability.They need flexible support and training programs, the argument goes, not a shove into the labor pool. But programs that successfully build skills and sustainable careers aren\u2019t cheap.\u201cThe president\u2019s budget has this tension where they\u2019re basically saying we want people to go to work, and they\u2019re cutting the resources that would allow people to get there,\u201d said LaDonna Pavetti, vice president for family income support at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, citing cuts in Mr. Trump\u2019s budget to work force training, cash assistance and food stamps. \u201cIt is all about a mandate. It\u2019s all about saying, \u2018You go to work,\u2019 and hoping that somehow miraculously the labor market will change.\u201dThe Trump budget disproportionately cuts programs that benefit women.In the two decades since welfare overhaul passed, Ms. Pavetti added, the economy has changed, the labor market has changed, and the population in need of help has changed. The number of would-be workers with criminal backgrounds that disqualify them from many jobs has risen. And so has the importance of education in the labor market, as many living-wage, low-skilled jobs have disappeared.Her argument underscores the fundamental difference in how conservatives and liberals view the role of work in poverty programs: The liberal view assumes that people want to work, but that they may need assistance to get there, and that government should take on that role. The conservative philosophy assumes that some people choose not to work \u2014 or are incentivized not to by government benefits.\u201cThe bottom line is that a work requirement serves as a kind of gatekeeping device,\u201d said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who cheers the White House\u2019s embrace of the idea. A work requirement separates people who truly need assistance, he says, from those who don\u2019t but are happy to take free government help. Push those people off the rolls, and that serves another conservative goal: shrinking the size of poverty programs.\u201cThe primary goal is reciprocity,\u201d Mr. Rector said. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral goal in the sense that what you want to say is, \u2018We will give aid to those who need aid, but we expect constructive activity in exchange for aid.\u2019 That\u2019s the whole principle.

But when Defiant worked with an audio designer in Melbourne, more than 1,000 miles away, Mr. Jaffit knew it would be quicker to send a hard drive by road than to upload the files, which could take several days.\u201cIt\u2019s really the big file sizes that kill us,\u201d said Mr. Jaffit, the company\u2019s co-founder and creative director. \u201cWhen we release an update and there\u2019s a small bug, that can kill us by three or four days.\u201dAustralia, a wealthy nation with a widely envied quality of life, lags in one essential area of modern life: its internet speed. Eight years after the country began an unprecedented broadband modernization effort that will cost at least 49 billion Australian dollars, or $36 billion, its average internet speed lags that of the United States, most of Western Europe, Japan and South Korea. In the most recent ranking of internet speeds by Akamai, a networking company, Australia came in at an embarrassing No. 51, trailing developing economies like Thailand and Kenya.For many here, slow broadband connections are a source of frustration and an inspiration for gallows humor. One parody video ponders what would happen if an American with a passion for Instagram and streaming \u201cScandal\u201d were to switch places with an Australian resigned to taking bathroom breaks as her shows buffer.But the problem goes beyond sluggish Netflix streams and slurred Skype calls. Businesses complain that slow speeds hobble their effectiveness and add to their costs. More broadly, Australia risks being left behind at a time when countries like China and India are looking to nurture their own start-up cultures to match the success of Silicon Valley and keep their economies on the cutting edge.\u201cPoor broadband speeds will hold back Australia and its competitive advantage,\u201d said John O\u2019Mahony, an economist at Deloitte Access Economics. A 2015 report by Deloitte valued the nation\u2019s digital economy at $58 billion and estimated that it could be worth 50 percent more by 2020. \u201cThe speed of that growth is at risk if we don\u2019t have the broadband to support it,\u201d he said.The story of Australia\u2019s costly internet bungle illustrates the hazards of mingling telecommunication infrastructure with the impatience of modern politics. The internet modernization plan has been hobbled by cost overruns, partisan maneuvering and a major technical compromise that put 19th-century technology between the country\u2019s 21st-century digital backbone and many of its homes and businesses.The government-led push to modernize its telecommunications system was unprecedented, experts say \u2014 and provides a cautionary tale for others who might like to try something similar.\u201cAustralia was the first country where a totally national plan to cover every house or business was considered,\u201d said Rod Tucker, a University of Melbourne professor and a member of the expert panel that advised on the effort. \u201cThe fact it was a government plan didn\u2019t necessarily make it doomed. In Australia, we have changes of governments every three years, which really works against the ability to undertake long-term planning, and the long-term rollouts of networks like this.\u201dAustralia poses natural connectivity challenges. It lies oceans away from other countries, and any network would have to connect far-flung cities separated by its sparsely populated interior.\u201cYears of failed policy have left Australia as a broadband backwater,\u201d said Kevin Rudd, then the prime minister and leader of the Labor Party.But the government share of those costs quickly climbed until taxpayers were responsible for all of it. The technology was slow to roll out, in part because of negotiations with Telstra, Australia\u2019s big telecommunications provider, over installing the fiber. (A Telstra spokesman said the company did not believe the talks added to delays.) The government-funded effort drew fire from the Liberal Party, the opposition at the time, which said the job should have been left to the private sector.The result, critics say, was slow speeds that still did not stop rising costs.\u201cAustralia had an aggressive, forward-looking, visionary government project to build a fiber network,\u201d said Mike Quigley, who was chief executive of the project until 2013. He added, \u201cthat opportunity\u2019s been absolutely lost because of bad judgments, ideologically and politically driven.\u201dA spokeswoman for the Liberal Party said that under its stewardship, the initiative was connecting more new users than the Labor Party ever did. But neither party placed fixing the internet high on their campaign platforms in national elections last year, perhaps indicating how difficult the problem will be to solve.Average speeds have more than doubled since 2013, according to Akamai, but other countries are connecting their populations faster, meaning Australia\u2019s lag with the rest of the world has grown. Big businesses can opt to pay for fast connections, but the cost can be considerable for smaller companies.GO1, an education technology company near Brisbane, spent about $22,000 on a speed upgrade in September 2015. It now pays nearly $1,000 a month for its high-speed, 100 megabit connection. \u201cAs a software company, our two main costs are internet and staff,\u201d said Andrew Barnes, the chief executive and co-founder. \u201cIf the former was lower, then we have more to spend on building up the team.\u201dMr. Barnes said that employees in Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam, had far fewer issues joining the company\u2019s weekly webinars.\u201cVietnam\u2019s one of those countries where you look out the window and the telephone wires are just a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cBut somehow, despite the obvious infrastructure problems, the internet there is much, much better.\u201dThe video game industry in particular has pushed for better speeds. \u201cRight now, we are all on dirt roads,\u201d Ben Britten, chief technology officer at Mighty Games Group, said at a Senate hearing last year on his industry\u2019s future. \u201cWe are trying to push huge semi trucks down dirt roads, and we just need to have some highways.\u201dOthers, for their part, look for ways around the barriers \u2014 including old-fashioned radio.Nick Lorenzi, who lives in Cairns, in northeastern Queensland, was frustrated with his copper-wire speeds, especially since a friend just a few miles away had a much faster fiber connection. Investigating online, Mr. Lorenzi, 25, an information technology worker, found out how to bum bandwidth from the friend using two transmitter dishes that cost $440 total.\u201cI just knew that the internet was rubbish where I was, so I thought, what else can I do here?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up really high on a hill, so I can take advantage of that.\u201dMr. Lorenzi has since moved, and he says his copper-based connection speed once again is \u201cjust rubbish.\u201d\u201cFor a country as far along as we are, our internet\u2019s just not aligned with that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just pathetic, really.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Colorado River and Its Unnatural World", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The waterways of the West now exist as monuments to an ambitious desert civilization. Across this vast region of America, few, if any, rivers flow without hosting one or more dams, concrete channels, diversions or other human-made \u201cimprovements\u201d that allow people and farming to flourish in this dry country. And few, if any, rivers reveal this unnatural world more than the Colorado, which no longer reaches the sea or carries along its entire 1,450-mile length much of the reddish silt that inspired its name.The prolific author and New Yorker contributor David Owen details what has happened to the river that once carved the Grand Canyon in his new book, a brisk and informative travelogue that wends from headwaters in the state of Colorado to where the water trickles to a halt in a riverbed cracked by the heat of the desert sun in Mexico. This is well-traveled territory, including Marc Reisner\u2019s classic book from 1986, \u201cCadillac Desert,\u201d which remains the definitive work on the West and its water woes. The problem then, as now, is people \u2014 and what we have chosen to do with the water.The people of the Western states, in collusion with the federal government, have opted for irrigation, power and sprawling cities in the desert like Los Angeles and Phoenix. The glass of Colorado River water is either half-full or half-empty, depending on whether you think water woes bring out the cooperative side of people, or the litigious. As Owen discovers on his journey, both are true \u2014 lawyers and legislators make a good living adjudicating claims, but owners of water rights also often work it out among themselves without drying anybody out. This is a system that muddles through on a blend of threats and collaboration, with the underlying understanding that everybody must win or everyone will lose, as the longtime water reporter John Fleck explores in his illuminating recent book \u201cWater Is for Fighting Over.\u201d It remains to be seen what the likely shortfall of rain and snow brought by global warming will do to this already fraught series of arrangements.Owen\u2019s travelogue serves as a primer on a system ruled by \u201cWater Buffaloes,\u201d the men and women who decide among themselves where the water goes and who gets what, an arcane group perhaps better called beavers for their overwhelming desire to dam and shunt flowing water. But the flow of Owen\u2019s journey also sometimes bogs down in distracting asides, from lodging recommendations to incompletely explored tidbits of provocative history like the mass-killing Anglo-Irish hunter Sir St. George Gore, for whom one canyon Owen visited is named, or the effort to frack free natural gas with nuclear bombs. Owen has the keen observation of a birder combined with the breezy writing to draw you in with unusual insights \u2014 like the vagaries of an American economy that make a vineyard in Colorado a loss leader for tourism dollars, or quagga mussels invading the river and its reservoirs \u2014 but he also often wanders off course, away from the river and an explanation of where its water goes.The core conundrum of the Colorado in Owen\u2019s view is efficiency, which happens to be the subject of his last book. Using less water to flood fields or lawns means more water to build suburbs in desert cities. And water is not just water, it\u2019s electricity \u2014 both generation at dams but also massive coal-burning to power pumps \u2014 as well as food. Without Colorado River water, much of America could not enjoy salad greens in winter, for example.There is a brand of upbeat defeatism in Owen\u2019s exploration of this efficiency paradox: There is nothing I can do as an individual to solve this problem so perhaps I might as well not bother trying and just go golfing. Yet it is a host of individual actions and amendments in thinking that add up to a necessary society-level change, like the way oil pipelines have become a subject of protest rather than a matter of course, or the exile of smoking from American life. Like the individual snowflakes that add up to the snowpack that gives the Colorado River its force, seemingly small shifts can feed a flood of change. The \u201cWater Buffaloes\u201d of Arizona may waste and store Colorado River water today just so California can\u2019t claim it, but that is not an immutable fact. There is precedent for hopeful change, including the hilariously understated, patiently negotiated bureaucratic codicil known as Minute 319, where every Colorado River state and nation, from Mexico to the native peoples of what is now the Western United States, got something, including nature \u2014 a one-time \u201cpulse\u201d flow of water in 2014 to see what might happen if the Colorado reached the sea anew.John Wesley Powell, who led the first American expedition to navigate the Colorado River, issued a prophecy later in his life: \u201cThere is not sufficient water to supply these lands.\u201d It is a prophecy that has echoed down through the decades in a host of books and laws and rulings, and yet the water is still there, as are more and more people whose life the water makes possible. \u201cWhere the Water Goes\u201d raises more questions than it answers, but if wondering where the water comes from prompts readers to plumb this voluminous literature around the Colorado River more deeply, then Owen\u2019s book will have done important work.\u201cThe world\u2019s gathering environmental problems are deeply interrelated, and they can\u2019t be effectively addressed in isolation: water here, energy there, transportation somewhere else,\u201d Owen writes. There\u2019s a term among scientists for those interrelated, gathering problems: the Anthropocene. As Owen shows, the Colorado River is a great, sad, terrifying, possibly hopeful example of the pervasive, permanent mark people are making on the planet, earning us a potential place in the record written in rock. Part of the work of the next few decades is to imagine and build a better future rather than letting inertia reign.David Biello is the science curator for TED Talks and the author of \u201cThe Unnatural World: The Race to Remake Civilization in Earth\u2019s Newest Age.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alitalia Files for Bankruptcy, but Italy Balks at a Third Bailout", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byWhen the Italian airline Alitalia went bankrupt in 2008, the government swooped in with taxpayer money and Pope Benedict \u2014 a regular rider \u2014 offered the carrier a blessing. Six years later, as Alitalia stumbled into debt yet again, the government engineered another rescue.But on Tuesday, even a papal decree would not have been enough to save Alitalia from what threatened to be its final stand, as Europe\u2019s most troubled airline filed for bankruptcy once more, this time amid signs that the government, and the Italian people, were fed up from providing life support.Like the Italian state, Alitalia has always been too big to fail. The carrier has already cost Italian taxpayers an estimated \u20ac7 billion over the decade.This time, officials say there will be no new bailout of the airline, which has been a fixture of the economy and one of Italy\u2019s largest employers since it was founded in 1947. No other carriers have come forward to express interest in taking it over, including Lufthansa, which had been cited as a possible white knight.After the Italian government approved the bankruptcy filing on Tuesday, Alitalia will be put into the hands of special administrators charged with devising a last-ditch plan to turn around the carrier within 180 days, sell it, or put it into liquidation.Company officials had said that in order to keep the carrier alive, adjustments were needed in the 12,400-strong work force, which operates about 120 planes and had 22.6 million passengers last year. By contrast, its low-cost rival Ryanair has around 11,000 employees for 300 planes and more than 100 million passengers.But when unions and management negotiated a rescue plan involving 1,600 layoffs, an 8 percent pay cut and more working days a year in exchange for \u20ac2 billion in new financing, employees rejected it.They seemed to be gambling that the state would come to the rescue, given the political and economic consequences of letting Alitalia collapse.In the meantime, the situation has outraged some Italians, who took to Facebook and Twitter to protest spending any more taxpayer money on top of the billions already doled out by the government.\u201cAlitalia bankruptcy is due to bad management and #ConsumerChoice. Italian state shouldn\u2019t give any money to save it,\u201d Luca Bertoletti, the European affairs manager at Consumer Choice Center, an Italian consumer rights organization, said in a message on Twitter.The Middle Eastern airline made new investments and financed a revision of Alitalia\u2019s business plan to compete better with low-cost carriers. But losses started to mount again in 2015, to nearly \u20ac200 million, as Alitalia failed to ward off fierce competition from low-cost airlines, and terrorist attacks in Europe hurt travel.Alitalia sought to recover this year with a plan to slash \u20ac1 billion in costs, cut 2,000 workers and reduce salaries by up to 30 percent. Unions negotiated all those demands down in a deal struck last month that would have released new financing.Instead, pilots and cabin crew rebuffed the accord, throwing Alitalia yet again into an uncertain future.\u201cIt seems that Alitalia workers have all gone nuts,\u201d Simone Filippetti, a finance and economy reporter at the Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore, wrote in a column. \u201cWhy did they reject a plan that involved a hard sacrifice but a chance of recovering to instead face the risk of a total company disruption and liquidation, and ultimately all lose their jobs anyway?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re Getting Awfully Close to Full Employment", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThat is the apparently simple yet oh-so-complex question that matters most for both policy makers at the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration, and for ordinary Americans who want to see bigger paychecks and rising standards of living. In an economy at full employment, pretty much anyone who wants a job can get one, companies have incentive to offer pay raises, and firms are more inclined to offer training, flexible work arrangements and other concessions that benefit their workers.The good news from the April numbers is that we\u2019re quite clearly getting there, if not yet fully arrived.The headline numbers for April are terrific. The economy added 211,000 jobs in April, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent. That is not just the lowest jobless rate in a decade; it also matches the lowest level reached during the mid-2000s expansion. The last time it was lower was May 2001, 16 full years ago.Broader measures of unemployment tell the same story. The so-called U-6 rate, which captures people who are working part-time but want a full-time job, and those who would like a job but have given up looking out of frustration, is also back down to its level before the last recession. It fell to 8.6 percent in April from 8.9 percent, and the last time it was lower was November 2007.Taken in isolation, these numbers would seem to suggest that the economy is most certainly at full employment and maybe even running a little hot \u2014 that is, revving faster than will be possible in the long run without just fueling inflation.But we can\u2019t take the unemployment rate in isolation. Other data, including in the April report, show a more nuanced picture, one that suggests there is room to run. One of the central economic problems of our time is prime-aged adults, especially men, who are out of the work force entirely and aren\u2019t even looking for a job. The number of people not in the labor force actually climbed by 162,000 in April, and the proportion of the population in the labor force edged down a tenth of a percent.A single month\u2019s moves may well be random blips, but if you look at these and related numbers over a longer horizon, it\u2019s hard to find a discernible trend. The labor force participation rate was 62.8 percent in April 2016 and 62.9 percent in April 2017.There can be a lot of churn beneath those numbers. Baby boomers who are retiring are being offset by younger workers entering the labor force, leaving the overall ratio roughly level. And in fact, the proportion of 25- to 54-year-old Americans working has risen to 78.6 percent in April, up nearly a full percentage point over the last year.But that number was 80.3 percent at the peak in the last economic cycle and peaked at 81.9 percent in 2000, which implies that there are millions more people in prime working years who might be coaxed into the work force if conditions were right.Which brings us to wages. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent in April, and are up 2.5 percent over the past year. But that\u2019s really nothing special \u2014 indeed, it\u2019s broadly consistent with the kind of wage growth that has been evident for years. What\u2019s more, while numbers like that amounted to meaningful gains in living standards when inflation was very low, with inflation measures getting near 2 percent, a mere 2.5 percent gain in pay doesn\u2019t amount to much at this stage of the expansion.But beyond employer caterwauling, the best sign that the economy has reached full employment will be if wage gains return to their pre-recession norms. Wage growth for nonmanagerial workers of 4 percent or more was normal in 2006 and 2007; now that number is only 2.3 percent.Yes, inflation is lower now, and productivity growth is weak, both factors that suggest we should expect weaker wage growth. But nonetheless, it\u2019s not worth declaring victory and deciding that full employment is achieved when employers are still not showing it in their pay practices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Freeze Syria War, Russia Proposes Setting Up \u2018De-escalation Zones\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Russia is circulating a draft proposal to Syrian rebel groups and diplomats that envisions pausing the war in Syria through the creation of safe \u201cde-escalation zones,\u201d with outside troops possibly acting as buffers between the antagonists.The draft proposal, shared with The New York Times on Wednesday by participants at Syria talks held in Astana, Kazakhstan, is one of the most detailed suggestions to emerge in recent months in the rocky negotiations to halt the war, now in its seventh year.The proposal would apply to Syrian government and rebel forces in the four main areas of the country where insurgents unaffiliated with the Islamic State still hold significant territory.But it faces a number of challenges, most notably acceptance by the Syrian government and the insurgent groups attending the talks.The insurgent groups suspended participation in the talks on Wednesday to protest what they described as heavy bombing by the Syrian government\u2019s Russian-backed forces the day before that killed dozens, including civilians.The Russian proposal does not specify measures to prevent government warplanes from carrying out such bombings. Rebels said they remained suspicious of Russian guarantees, regardless, because Russia has been unable or unwilling to curb government attacks on civilians.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Wednesday that the proposal had the backing not only of Russia but also of Iran, another ally of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and Turkey, which backs some anti-Assad groups.\u201cWe as guarantors \u2014 Turkey, Iran, Russia \u2014 will do everything for this to work,\u201d Mr. Putin said in remarks carried on Russian television, speaking in Sochi, Russia, after meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.The proposal was made as the United States, another supporter of some anti-Assad groups, appeared to be re-engaging in the negotiations after a prolonged absence.Stuart E. Jones, the acting assistant secretary of state, was in Astana, the most senior American official to participate in Syria talks since President Trump took office.The draft proposal calls for \u201cde-escalation zones\u201d of safety to be established in four areas: Idlib Province, almost entirely held by jihadist and other rebel groups; Eastern Ghouta, a large area of the Damascus suburbs besieged by government forces; a besieged pocket north of the central city of Homs; and southern Syria along the Jordanian border, where rebel groups backed by the United States and its allies have made gains in recent months against both Islamic State and government forces.Under the proposal, checkpoints ringing those areas would be maintained by both government and rebel forces to allow the free movement of civilians and relief aid. That provision could offer respite from siege warfare, which has been a main weapon of the government.The proposal also says rebel groups would be required to fight the Islamic State and the formerly Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, now called Tahrir al-Sham, which are not part of any peace process.But the proposal offers few details on how fighting would be thwarted inside the secure zones.An earlier draft circulated by some opposition members included a provision that Syria\u2019s air force would be grounded in those zones \u2014 but no mention is made of that provision in a longer draft. It was removed, participants said, because of Syrian government objections. But without that provision, rebels would probably reject the proposal.Analysts in Damascus close to the government of Mr. Assad said the government had rejected any proposal that would accept rebel control of any area, even temporarily. The government has long insisted that it aims to take back all of the country, and it has so far refused any territorial or political compromise with its opponents.The proposal raises the possibility of outside forces\u2019 helping to guarantee a cease-fire. It says military units or \u201cguarantors\u201d would be deployed as monitors.Rebel representatives said they would not accept any from Iran or Russia. Russian news outlets, including the Interfax news agency, said the forces could be from former Soviet states \u2014 Kazakhstan was floated as a possibility \u2014 or members of the bloc of emerging economies that include Russia, Brazil and India. Those reports also mentioned Arab countries, leading to speculation that Egypt could contribute. Egyptian officials have denied any intention of sending forces to Syria.Changes on the ground in Syria have given credence to the possibility of cease-fire zones as outlined in the Russian proposal. On Tuesday, pro-government militias opened a new commercial corridor between government and rebel-held areas in the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh in southern Syria, imposing a tax of 20 percent. The tax essentially formalized smuggling routes that have profited militants on both sides and could presage the opening of routes in other areas.Hisham Skeif, a former member of the opposition council in Aleppo and now a political spokesman for a rebel faction, was skeptical of the Russian proposal, saying it needed clarification on the precise boundaries of the cease-fire zones and the identities of the monitoring forces.\u201cIt was thrown by the Russians as a step in the air,\u201d he said. Russia and the government have typically described rebel fighters as jihadists as a justification to bomb them, he said, \u201cso we are back to the same vortex.\u201dNeil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow, Maher Samaan from Paris, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Assault on Colleges \u2014 and the American Dream", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byThe country\u2019s most powerful engine of upward mobility is under assault.Public colleges have an unmatched record of lofting their students into the middle class and beyond. For decades, they have enrolled teenagers and adults from modest backgrounds, people who are often the first member of their family to attend college, and changed their trajectories.Over the last several years, however, most states have cut their spending on higher education, some drastically. Many public universities have responded by enrolling fewer poor and middle-class students \u2014 and replacing them with affluent students who can afford the tuition.The situation is particularly demoralizing because it\u2019s happening even as politicians from both parties spend more time trumpeting their supposedly deep concern for the American dream. Yet government policy is hurting, not fostering, many people\u2019s chance to earn the most reliable ticket to a good job and a better life.The decline of economic diversity at top public colleges is the clearest pattern in The Times\u2019s third annual ranking of leading colleges \u2014 the roughly 170 nationwide with a five-year graduation rate of at least 75 percent. (Yes, you can be disappointed that so few colleges clear that bar.)The ranking, called the College Access Index, is based on how many low- and middle-income students colleges graduate and how much those students must pay. The index is a measure of which top institutions are doing the most to promote the American dream.Welcome to the third annual College Access Index, a ranking of colleges based on their commitment to economic diversity.Many are doing less than they once did. At the public colleges in the index, the average share of last year\u2019s freshman class receiving Pell grants \u2014 which means they typically come from the bottom half of the income distribution \u2014 fell to 21.8 percent, from 24.3 percent in 2011-12. Campuses with declining economic diversity include the Universities of Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pittsburgh and Wisconsin, as well as Binghamton, Ohio State and Rutgers.By comparison, the Pell share has recently held roughly constant at top private colleges, around 16 percent.Given these trends, the declines in state funding are stunning. It\u2019s as if our society were deliberately trying to restrict opportunities and worsen income inequality.In the last few years, many flagships have begun to recruit more upper-income students from outside their state, including from overseas. Those students don\u2019t qualify for in-state tuition or for much financial aid \u2014 and thus help bolster the colleges\u2019 budgets.Often, college officials describe the strategy in different terms. They say that they are trying to lift their campus\u2019s national profile, not to mention its U.S. News ranking. To do so, they must recruit a larger pool of students with high test scores than exists in their own state.But the net result, to put it bluntly, is bad for the country. Top state universities are displacing impressive low-income students, who have often overcome troubled neighborhoods and high schools. Many of those students then enroll instead in colleges with fewer resources and higher dropout rates. In the process, the higher-education system becomes a bit less meritocratic.The story in California is a bit more nuanced, but still disappointing, particularly given the state university\u2019s history. Since its founding, during a burst of national investment during and just after Abraham Lincoln\u2019s presidency, no other university in the world has combined academic excellence and broad access so well.Yet even as California remains a leader, it is also inching away from its legacy.What would be a better solution?But such cuts are not the only answer, even if some governors and state legislators claim otherwise. This country should also be investing more of its resources in education.The alternative \u2014 which is the path we\u2019re now on \u2014 is just about the worst economic-development strategy imaginable.In a follow-up column next week, I\u2019ll focus on the private colleges in the College Access Index.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cheryl Strayed on Richard Ford\u2019s Masterly Memoir of His Parents", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byNonfictionThere are two sentences in William Faulkner\u2019s \u201cAs I Lay Dying\u201d that I\u2019ve returned to often in the 20-some years since I first read them: \u201cIt takes two people to make you and one people to die. That\u2019s how the world is going to end.\u201d I\u2019ve often puzzled over why those sentences have repeatedly reeled me back to them. They aren\u2019t all that profound. They don\u2019t say anything surprising or new. Usually, when I take my aged copy of the book from my shelves and turn to Page 39 to find those lines once more, I\u2019m disappointed. In my memory of them they\u2019re more piercing than they turn out to be on the page, where they state only what\u2019s plainly true: We are born of two and we die alone.I pondered Faulkner\u2019s lines again recently, as I lay awake at 1 a.m. thinking about Richard Ford\u2019s new memoir \u201cBetween Them: Remembering My Parents,\u201d which I had finished the hour before. The book is composed of two discrete, novella-length memoirs that were written more than 30 years apart. Ford wrote the first, about his father, Parker, a traveling salesman who died in 1960 when Ford was 16, recently; he wrote the second, about his independent, no-nonsense mother, Edna, shortly after her death in 1981. Together they form an illuminating portrait of a slightly unconventional white couple born in the early years of the 20th century. With a depth of perception that\u2019s both affectionate and insightful, Ford tells the stories of his parents\u2019 lives and deaths by turn, as they move from Arkansas to Mississippi, from near-poverty to the middle class, from 15 years of child-free marriage to the surprise of parenthood at an age that was then considered late in life, and from his father\u2019s sudden, early death of a heart attack, to his mother\u2019s widowhood and eventual death by cancer.This book is about them, but it\u2019s also about the boy they made and what he has come, 70-plus years on, to make of them. In showing his mother and father to us, Ford \u2014 an ordinary child, who grew up to become one of our most distinguished fiction writers \u2014 has, inevitably, shown a fair portion of himself.A lot of that is done by way of Ford looking outward rather than inward. \u201cBetween Them\u201d is driven by the author\u2019s curiosity about who his parents were \u2014 both who they seemed to him to be in their lives and who, in retrospect, he imagines they might have been beyond his view. It\u2019s through this innate desire to know, paired with Ford\u2019s exceptional abilities as a prose craftsman, that these two ordinary people are made vital and vivid to us on the page. His depictions and examinations of his parents before and after he was born \u2014 their mannerisms and bearings, their wounds and silences, their squabbles and pleasures \u2014 offer a master class in character development and narrative economy, as in this passage, in which Ford describes his parents around the time of their first meeting:\u201cHis large malleable, fleshy face was given to smiling. His first face was always the smiling one. The long Irish lip. The transparent blue eyes \u2014 my eyes. My mother must\u2019ve noticed this when she met him \u2014 wherever she did. In Hot Springs or Little Rock, sometime before 1928. Noticed this and liked what she saw. A man who liked to be happy. She had never been exactly happy \u2014 only inexactly, with the nuns who taught her at St. Anne\u2019s in Fort Smith, where her mother had put her to keep her out of the way.\u201dThere is no god in memoir. We all have a dazzling lack of authority about the inner lives of even the people with whom we are most intimate. In \u201cBetween Them,\u201d Ford uses this to his advantage. His deep interrogation of the things he didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t know about his parents runs alongside the fact that no one knew them better or remembers them as accurately as he did or does. Precisely in the passages that give way to this convergence of conjecture and knowledge, memory and supposition, Ford comes the closest to grasping most fully who his parents were. His deep, attentive, almost methodical wondering about them \u2014 in other words, the things that may or may not be actually true \u2014 bring the private realities of their existence most palpably to life. Of his father, out on the road selling laundry starch, a job that kept him away from home each week Monday morning through Friday evening, Ford writes:It has often been said that to pay attention is the greatest act of love, and Ford has paid masterly attention in \u201cBetween Them.\u201d But he has also done more. In this slim beauty of a memoir, he has given us \u2014 the same way he has given us many times in his fiction \u2014 a remarkable story about two unremarkable people we would have never known, but for him. Which he couldn\u2019t have written, but for them.Cheryl Strayed\u2019s books include the memoir \u201cWild\u201d and the nonfiction collection \u201cTiny Beautiful Things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump Tries to Engage the Muslim World", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byEditorialNo American president in modern times has disparaged Islam as much as Donald Trump. From the attempted visa ban on Muslim-majority countries to his campaign claims that \u201cIslam hates us\u201d to his Islamaphobic advisers, the president\u2019s record of hostility is well documented.Does that mean Mr. Trump has changed his stripes? Given his casual approach to the truth and his malleable belief system, it\u2019s impossible to know his true views on Islam. What we do know is that he needs all the help he can get from Muslim countries to fight the Islamic State. If he uses the speech and the trip to set a new tone with the Muslim world, that would be greatly in America\u2019s interest.The Saudis, who came to loathe President Barack Obama, are falling over themselves to turn the page. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to visit Saudi Arabia \u201clays to rest the notion that America is anti-Muslim,\u201d the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told reporters early this month, ignoring the fact that the real issue is not whether America is anti-Muslim but whether Mr. Trump is. It was he, after all, who stoked xenophobic fires to win the election.Mr. Obama worked hard to cultivate the Saudi-American relationship, selling the kingdom $115 billion in arms, providing support in the Saudi war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, pushing Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations and making Riyadh his first stop in the Arab world.But the Saudis never forgave him for endorsing the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt; for refusing to intervene directly in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad; and for negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran, its Shiite enemy, even though the deal made the region safer.Along with other Sunni Arab countries, Saudi Arabia is obsessed with Iran, which is unquestionably playing a troubling and mischievous role in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, and the Saudis are pleased with Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Iran line. But focusing only on Iran ignores the destabilizing activities of Saudi Arabia in Yemen, where Saudi bombs have killed untold numbers of civilians. It also ignores the fact that Saudi Arabia\u2019s conservative brand of Islam has done much to inspire ISIS and other extremists.Mr. Obama tried to forge a more neutral path, engaging Iran on the nuclear deal and admonishing the Saudis to find a way to live with Iran. There is speculation that the Sunni Arabs and Israel might cooperate in a regional security arrangement. This could be constructive, but not if its only purpose is to ostracize Iran.With Mr. Trump embattled at home, there\u2019s a real danger that in his eagerness for a successful visit he will agree to almost anything his hosts desire, like more American involvement in proxy wars against Iran in Yemen and Syria. Also, he has shown little interest in human rights and in pressing authoritarian countries to treat their people \u2014 especially women, in Saudi Arabia\u2019s case \u2014 with respect.This trip is Mr. Trump\u2019s first chance to act as a global statesman. He will define that role not by accommodating Arab demands but by pursuing a strategy that advances America\u2019s security interests as well as those of its partners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Awaits Trump Decision on U.S. Future in Paris Accord", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Momentous arguments inside the West Wing over the future of the Paris climate accord became a messy public spectacle on Wednesday, with some aides saying that President Trump had decided to abandon the landmark global warming agreement while others insisted that no decision had been made.In addition, three other officials said later Wednesday that they expected him to withdraw from the agreement, though they said that decision could still change. Hours later, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had made his decision and would announce it in the Rose Garden at 3 p.m. Thursday.The White House\u2019s legislative affairs office has suggested another route: Sending the Paris agreement to the Senate for ratification as a treaty. Since it would require an impossible two-thirds vote, that alternative would also lead to withdrawal.Other White House insiders disputed those reports, saying that no verdict had been reached. Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, offered only that \u201cI\u2019m hearing from a lot of people, both ways,\u201d and promised a decision \u201cvery soon.\u201dWith the world watching nervously, the feuding among the president\u2019s aides further exposed the fault lines of a chaotic decision-making process that has swirled around Mr. Trump since he took office.Signs have been increasing for weeks that Mr. Trump was heading toward pulling out of the Paris agreement, apparently believing that a continued United States presence in the accord would harm the economy; hinder job creation in regions like Appalachia and the West, where his most ardent supporters live; and undermine his \u201cAmerica first\u201d message.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?At home, he faced urgent pleas from corporate leaders, including Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, who told Mr. Trump on Tuesday that pulling out was wrong for business, the economy and the environment. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, threatened to resign from two White House advisory boards if the president withdrew from the Paris agreement.On his recent trip to Europe, Mr. Trump waved aside a barrage of private lobbying by other heads of state to keep the United States in the agreement.A frustrated Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said he opposed \u201cbehaving as vassals of the Americans\u201d and assailed Mr. Trump for failing to even understand the mechanics of a withdrawal, which he said could take three or four years to fulfill.\u201cThis notion \u2014 \u2018I am Trump. I am American. America first, so I\u2019m going to get out of it.\u2019 \u2014 that is not going to happen,\u201d Mr. Juncker said. \u201cWe tried to make that clear to Mr. Trump in clear, German principal clauses in Taormina, but it would appear that he did not understand.\u201dHe added, \u201cNot everything in international agreements is fake news.\u201dMr. Trump has shown a willingness to shift direction up until the moment of a public announcement. He met on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who has advocated that the United States remain a part of the Paris accord. Other advisers pressing Mr. Trump to remain were furiously making their case.In the past, such appeals have worked. In April, Mr. Trump was set to announce a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement, but at the last minute changed his mind after intense discussions with advisers and calls from the leaders of Canada and Mexico. Last week, a senior administration official said Mr. Trump would use a speech in Brussels to explicitly endorse NATO\u2019s Article 5 mutual defense provision, which states that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all. He did not.The exit of the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas polluter, would not dissolve the 195-nation pact, which was legally ratified last year, but it could set off a cascade of events that would have profound effects on the planet. Other countries that reluctantly joined the agreement could now withdraw or soften their commitments to cutting planet-warming pollution.\u201cThe actions of the United States are bound to have a ripple effect in other emerging economies that are just getting serious about climate change, such as India, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton, and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group that produces scientific reports aimed at informing global policy makers.Once the fallout settles, he added, \u201cit is now far more likely that we will breach the danger limit of 3.6 degrees\u201d \u2014 the average atmospheric temperature increase above which a future of extreme conditions is considered irrevocable.The aim of the Paris agreement was to lower planet-warming emissions enough to avoid that threshold.\u201cWe will see more extreme heat, damaging storms, coastal flooding and risks to food security,\u201d Professor Oppenheimer said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the kind of world we want to live in.\u201dForeign policy experts said the move could damage the United States\u2019 credibility and weaken Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to negotiate issues far beyond climate change, like trade and terrorism.\u201cFrom a foreign policy perspective, it\u2019s a colossal mistake \u2014 an abdication of American leadership,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a retired career diplomat and an under secretary of state for President George W. Bush.\u201cThe success of our foreign policy \u2014 in trade, military, any other kind of negotiation \u2014 depends on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Burns said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more destructive to our credibility than this.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, particularly coal-state Republicans, have cheered the move, celebrating it as a fulfillment of a signature campaign promise. Speaking to a crowd of oil rig workers last year, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the agreement, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, has pushed the president to withdraw from the accord as part of an economic nationalism that has so far included pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade pact, and vowing to renegotiate Nafta.Coal miners and coal company executives in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia have pushed for Mr. Trump to reverse all of President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change policies, many of which are aimed at reducing the use of coal, considered the largest contributor to climate change.As President Trump decides whether to stay or leave the international climate agreement, political and corporate leaders on both sides of the debate are lobbying him fiercely.In a May 23 letter to Mr. Trump from Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia and nine other state attorneys general, Mr. Morrisey wrote, \u201cWithdrawing from the Paris agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.\u201d He added, \u201cThe Paris agreement is a symbol of the Obama administration\u2019s \u2018Washington knows best\u2019 approach to governing.\u201dAlthough the administration has been debating its position on the Paris agreement for months, the sentiment for leaving appears to have the upper hand over the views of Mr. Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and close adviser.Other countries have vowed to continue to carry out the terms of the Paris agreement, even without the United States.President Xi Jinping of China, the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas polluter, has promised that his country will move ahead with steps to curb climate change, regardless of what happens in the United States.During a telephone call in early May with President Emmanuel Macron of France, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mr. Xi told the newly elected French leader that China and France \u201cshould protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement.\u201dBut the accord\u2019s architects say the absence of the United States will inevitably weaken its chances of being enforced. For example, the country has played a central role in pushing provisions that require robust and transparent oversight of how emissions are monitored, verified and reported.Without the United States, there is likely to be far less pressure on major polluting countries and industries to accurately report their emissions. There have been major questions raised about the accuracy of China\u2019s emissions reporting, in particular.\u201cWe need to know: What are your emissions? Where are your emissions?\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the lead climate negotiator during the Obama administration. \u201cThere needs to be transparent reporting on countries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions. If the U.S. is not part of that negotiation, that\u2019s a loss for the world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the institution of which Jean-Claude Juncker is the president. It is the European Commission, not the European Union.Melissa Eddy and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Can\u2019t Sustain Its Debt-Fueled Binge, Moody\u2019s Says", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has gone on a spending spree, borrowing money to build cities, create manufacturing giants and nurture financial markets \u2014 money that has helped drive the economic powerhouse in recent years. But the debt-fueled binge now threatens to sap the energy of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.With its economy maturing, China has to pile on ever more debt to keep its growth going, at a pace that could prove unsustainable. And the money is increasingly flowing through opaque channels that operate outside the regulated banking system, leaving China vulnerable to blowups.A major credit agency sounded the alarm on Wednesday, saying the steady buildup of debt would erode China\u2019s financial strength in the years ahead. The agency, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, cut the country\u2019s debt rating, its first downgrade for the country since 1989.China\u2019s debt problems stem from the global financial crisis in 2008. As world growth faltered, China unleashed a wave of spending to build highways, airports and real estate developments \u2014 all of which kept its economic engine chugging.To finance the construction, local officials and state-run companies borrowed heavily. Even after the worst of the crisis passed, China continued to rely on debt to fund growth.But debt no longer packs the same economic punch for China. An aging work force, smaller productivity gains and the sheer math of diminishing returns mean it must borrow more money to achieve less growth.China\u2019s debt has been increasing lately by an amount equal to about 15 percent of the country\u2019s output each year, to keep the economy growing from 6.5 percent to 7 percent. Overall debt in China, by the same measure, barely changed from 2001 to 2008, when the country achieved some of its fastest double-digit growth rates.As a percentage of economic output, China\u2019s total debt \u2014 including the government, households and businesses \u2014 is now high for a developing country. It has similar levels to those of many developed Western countries, though its debt load is still considerably smaller than Japan\u2019s, according to the Institute of International Finance, a trade group of global banks. Some economists now compare China to Japan, where a lack of willingness to deal with its deeply indebted companies has led to what is commonly called the Lost Decade, a period of sluggish economic activity there.Against that backdrop, Moody\u2019s on Wednesday lowered its rating on China\u2019s sovereign debt by one notch, to A1 from Aa3. The move brings it in line with another major ratings company, Fitch Ratings. A third, Standard & Poor\u2019s, rates China a notch higher but with a negative outlook, which means its next move is also likely to be downward. Moody\u2019s changed its outlook for further rating changes to stable from negative.\u201cThe downgrade reflects Moody\u2019s expectation that China\u2019s financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economywide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows,\u201d the credit rating company said.China criticized the move within hours, saying that Moody\u2019s failed to understand China\u2019s legal or financial systems and underestimated the country\u2019s efforts to restructure its economy to achieve more sustainable growth. More broadly, experts inside and outside China believe Beijing probably has the power to stop a meltdown of the kind that slammed the United States and much of the rest of the world a decade ago, thanks to the Chinese government\u2019s considerable financial firepower and ironclad grip on the country\u2019s banking system.Economists at the International Monetary Fund and at Goldman Sachs have issued a series of increasingly strong warnings about the pace at which the debt is rising. China\u2019s financial system has traditionally been firmly under the control of the central government, giving many economists confidence that Chinese officials could contain a crisis of the sort that gripped the world in 2008. Still, fast growth and signs of fragility in the financial system have given pause to economists and Chinese regulators alike.Chinese corporate debt has been mounting, and China\u2019s banks show little inclination to force companies to do something about it. China\u2019s banks have kept lending to the country\u2019s state-owned companies, even to those in trouble, to help them make payments on previous loans. That helps those companies stay in business and helps the economy keep growing despite mounting debt.Regulators and economists are also questioning where China\u2019s lending comes from.Traditionally, China\u2019s lending has come from four big, state-controlled banks with a solid deposit base. But in recent years, local and provincial banks that lack the deposit base and nationwide branch network of their bigger brethren have grown rapidly, and they now account for half of the assets in the banking system.The worry is that if the public loses confidence and stops buying these wealth management products from smaller banks and nonbank firms, a wave of defaults could spread across the economy.In a series of interviews over the last two weeks, current and former Chinese officials contended that the structure of their country\u2019s debt made it inherently much more stable than the debts of other nations.For starters, China owes little to other countries. Brad Setser, a former Treasury official specializing in China\u2019s finances who is now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China\u2019s $3 trillion in foreign reserves far exceeded the country\u2019s overseas debts and gave it a large financial cushion.Within China, most households also appear to have manageable debts, in contrast with the United States before its mortgage crisis. Only in the past year and a half has China allowed rapid growth in mortgages to help the construction industry as well as its suppliers, like steel mills and cement factories. Overall mortgage debt is still fairly low.The central government in China also owes little over all, with total debts equal to less than 40 percent of the economy. That means the government has a lot of capacity to borrow money and bail out troubled borrowers.By far, the biggest category of debt in China is corporate debt, which equals almost 170 percent of annual economic output. This debt consists overwhelmingly of loans by state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises.On Wednesday, the Finance Ministry said the downgrade was a mistake because it applied to China\u2019s central government bonds, even though the central government was not on the hook for the debts of local governments and state-owned companies.Still, China could end up paying the tab. The central government could decide to tell the state-owned banks to write off a lot of their bad loans, and then recapitalize the banks by providing money to them. Mr. Setser, at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he thought that a large, government-led recapitalization of the banks was likely but that the central government had the financial strength to handle it.Stock markets in China and Hong Kong opened lower on Wednesday on the news but soon recovered their losses and closed with little change. The Australian dollar, which is widely considered a barometer of investor sentiment about China because Australia sells such a large amount of its raw materials to that country, weakened against the United States dollar.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia, This Time the Victim of a Cyberattack, Voices Outrage", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia was again at the center of a global hacking scandal when computer systems the world over were frozen this weekend by a variant of malicious software known as WannaCry. But this time, Russians were among the victims of the attack, not suspected of being the perpetrators.In fact, of all the countries afflicted in the first wave of the spread of the malicious software, Russia was hit the hardest: The virus tried to infect more computers in Russia than anywhere else, according to an analysis by Kaspersky Lab, a Russian antivirus company.While government computers were crashing, banks, cellphone operators and railroads in Russia were fending off attacks designed to freeze their systems in demand for ransoms to unlock the data.Now on the business end of a cyberattack, Russian officials were quick to voice outrage.\u201cHumanity is dealing here with cyberterrorism,\u201d said Frants Klintsevich, the deputy chairman of the Russian Senate\u2019s defense committee, according to the state-run Tass news agency. \u201cIt\u2019s an alarming signal, and not just a signal but a direct threat to the normal functioning of society, and important life-support systems.\u201dComputer researchers have yet to determine the origin of the \u201cransomware\u201d attack, but Mr. Klintsevich said the hackers\u2019 intended targets were global.Hacking \u2014 far from an exclusive trick of the Russians \u2014 is a global scourge, Russian officials have said, and the ransomware attack became a painful illustration of their point.The malware was based on a program developed by the N.S.A. and stolen in a breach of the United States government\u2019s servers. The version of the program used to demand ransoms from the operators of frozen computer systems exploits vulnerabilities in older and unlicensed versions of Microsoft Windows, used widely in Russia, that did not have security patches.On Friday, Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry reported attacks on about 1,000 computers using the Windows operating system, but said the computers had been isolated from ministry networks.A spokeswoman for the ministry, Irina Volk, told Russian news agencies that key servers had been unaffected because they were running domestic software, including a little-known operating system called Elbrus, first developed in the late Soviet period.A new strain of ransomware spread rapidly around the world on Friday.Russian cybercriminals were among the pioneers of ransomware, although there is no evidence linking them to the latest WannaCry attack.In recent years, a prominent Russian malware system called Gameover Zeus, which had been used for bank thefts and government espionage, also distributed a particularly ruthless ransomware program called Cryptolocker.In December, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on the Russian hacker associated with Gameover Zeus, Evgeniy M. Bogachev, who is also wanted by the F.B.I. in connection with cybercrimes including bank fraud, money laundering and identity theft.Mikhail Delyagin, the director of the Institute of Problems of Globalization in Russia, said he suspected the United States government was behind the WannaCry attack, saying it could be the retaliation the Americans threatened against Russia for its hacking efforts last year.\u201cI respect the honesty of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThey threaten us with a cyberattack, and a cyberattack follows. It\u2019s logical.\u201dStill, prominent Russian computer researchers have refrained from blaming the United States, although the malicious software originated with the N.S.A.\u201cSpecial state cyberforces evidently would not exercise such a stupid attack,\u201d Igor Ashmanov, a member of the Council for Digital Economy, a government advisory body, said in an interview. Any government-backed attack on Russian institutions would be considered an act of war, he said.And this time, he said, \u201cof course it wasn\u2019t Russian hackers,\u201d given that Russia appeared to be a main target.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of the agency that the malware used in a global cyberattack was stolen from.

{"Headline": "As C.E.O. Pay Packages Grow, Top Executives Have the President\u2019s Ear", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "The top 200 chief executives, who make more than last year, are holding meetings with President Trump, who is considering rolling back Dodd-Frank regulations.Supported byPerhaps the pay surge reflects the times: Stocks are coming off a strong run. Unemployment is low. The economy is percolating.And President Trump is not only promising to roll back what he calls excessive business regulations but also listening keenly to what corporate America has to say. Since taking office on Jan. 20, the businessman-turned-politician has met with hundreds of executives, including at least 41 of last year\u2019s 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, a New York Times analysis shows.Several executives in the top 10 are in the media or tech industries.Mr. Rutledge, 63, stormed to the front of the pack after closing his company\u2019s mega-merger, a $65 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller competitor.For that, he got a big bump in pay. The year before, his compensation totaled $16.4 million.This combination \u2014 the gains in pay for chief executives, the president\u2019s pledge to deregulate and cut corporate tax rates \u2014 sets the stage for perhaps the most consequential moment for corporate governance since the financial crisis of 2008. Rising executive compensation only widens the gap between top executives and most American workers. Mr. Rutledge, for instance, made about 2,617 times the average American worker\u2019s salary of $37,632, according to figures maintained by the A.F.L.-C.I.O.Discrepancies like that helped fuel the populist frustration that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s election and, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, led to the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul act.Yet the president\u2019s team is considering rolling back a Dodd-Frank rule that, starting next year, would make it much easier for employees at a publicly traded company to compare their own pay to the chief executive\u2019s.In the meantime, pay for top executives is reaching staggering levels. Mr. Rutledge\u2019s compensation swelled to $98 million largely thanks to a stock options award valued at roughly $78 million. The Charter board awarded Mr. Rutledge that grant, which runs through 2020, about a month before completion of its big merger in May 2016.Over all, technology company chief executives are well represented on the list of 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, along with executives from financial services companies and media companies. The best-paid female chief executive is Oracle\u2019s Safra A. Catz, whose total package was valued at $40.9 million, making her the eighth-highest-paid C.E.O. in 2016.Mr. Trump, who sees himself as the nation\u2019s C.E.O., is hardly the first president to savor the company of corporate executives. But he\u2019s made the pageantry of meetings with C.E.O.s at the White House or at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which he has dubbed the southern White House, a priority during his first few months in office. The visits have become an opportunity for the president to trumpet the progress he says his administration is making in creating jobs and reducing regulations.But Mr. Trump may be getting a one-sided perspective on policy recommendations by spending so much time with a large swath of highly paid executives \u2014 at least 307 since Inauguration Day \u2014 whose views on taxes and economic inequality tend to differ from those of average Americans.Unleashing business by reducing regulations was the subtext of Mr. Rutledge\u2019s meeting on March 24 with Mr. Trump.Justin Venech, a Charter spokesman, said Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of a lighter regulatory environment had enabled the company to commit to locating those new jobs in the United States over the next four years, and to spend billions on broadband infrastructure.What is clear from the Equilar study is that many C.E.O.s were doing quite well even before Mr. Trump took office. Average compensation for the 200 highest-paid executives list \u2014 which changes from year to year \u2014 rose about 2 percent, to $19.7 million, from 2015. For the 200 specific individuals on this year\u2019s list, 2016 was especially kind. Those executives saw an average gain of 16 percent over what they received in 2015.On a percentage basis, Ronald D. Croatti at UniFirst, one of the nation\u2019s largest uniform manufacturers and distributors, had the biggest bump in pay last year. Mr. Croatti, 74, died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia, the company said. His pay package in 2016 rose 740 percent, to $17.69 million, according to Equilar.Steven Sintros, chief financial officer for UniFirst, said Mr. Croatti\u2019s large compensation package merely reflected the way companies are required to report the valuation of stock grants.In all, Equilar reports that the median salary for chief executives at all publicly traded companies with annual revenues of at least $1 billion came in at $6.14 million, down slightly from $6.19 million in 2015.Elon Musk, the brash inventor and chief executive of Tesla Inc., clocked in with a $99.7 million pay package in the Bloomberg survey. But Mr. Musk did not appear in the Equilar survey because Equilar valued stock grants, even ones spread out over several years, at the time they were awarded, as the Securities and Exchange Commission requires.The total compensation for Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric slid 33 percent in 2016, to $17.7 million, according to Equilar. His payout under the company\u2019s long-term compensation plan fell by about $6 million, and his annual bonus shrank by $1 million to $4.3 million, according to the company\u2019s proxy. In 2016, G.E. shares rose just 4 percent compared with 12 percent for the S.& P. 500.Mr. Immelt remained on the list, however. Notable extremely wealthy chief executives who did not appear include Tim Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. Both own enormous quantities of their companies\u2019 stock, but their compensation in 2016 was not high enough to qualify.The list also excludes executives who run big divisions but not entire public companies, even when they make more than the corporate boss.Digging deeper, Equilar found that Marc Lore, president and chief executive of Walmart\u2019s online operation, had the biggest payout of all executives at publicly traded companies, earning an eye-popping $243.9 million in total compensation.His total pay was more than 11 times greater than the $21.8 million pay package awarded to C. Douglas McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive.Another big winner was Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google at Alphabet. Mr. Pichai got a compensation package worth just under $200 million. Like Mr. Lore, Mr. Pichai gets a small base salary and most of his compensation is in stock grants. Last year, Alphabet\u2019s board awarded Mr. Pichai stock valued at $198.7 million.By comparison, Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, draws an annual salary of $1 a year. He hardly needs the salary: Forbes estimates the net worth of the co-founder of Google at $45 billion.The Equilar study points up a trend in compensation: Companies are increasingly moving away from cash bonuses and toward stock grants to reward top executives.Many large investors favor them because they give corporate executives an additional incentive to produce results that increase a company\u2019s share prices. Some critics, however, contend that stock grants and stock options can encourage executives to cut costs and take other short-term steps that don\u2019t invest in a company\u2019s long-term prospects.Supporters of stock grants are winning. Over the past five years, the median cash bonus awarded to the 200 best-compensated C.E.O.s declined to just under $3 million, from $3.37 million, according to Equilar. Meanwhile, the median value of stock awarded to those chief executives last year was $9.2 million.\u201cThe issue with cash bonuses is that they have become a given for most executives,\u201d said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer with the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, or Calstrs. \u201cThere are still companies where they award the same bonus year after year, and the stock price doesn\u2019t reflect any value added.\u201dMs. Mastagni said a cash bonus \u201cis not money at risk,\u201d as is a grant of stock.The board at AMC Networks \u2014 which has produced hit television shows like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d \u2014 has decided to phase out the long-term cash award for its chief executive and other top executives. AMC\u2019s compensation committee decided that a stock award \u201cbetter aligns the interests of its senior officers with those of stockholders.\u201dBut in 2016, Joshua W. Sapan, AMC\u2019s chief executive, hit the daily double of sorts. Mr. Sapan got a big cash award of $15.1 million, which will become much smaller in 2018 under the board\u2019s policy. But he also got a big stock award, valued at $13.2 million, consistent with the board\u2019s new directive on corporate pay. In all, Mr. Sapan\u2019s total $30.5 million pay package soared 72 percent over 2015, even as the company\u2019s stock dropped nearly 30 percent last year.No matter how you look at it, the pay gap between corporate executives and most everyone else in America keeps getting bigger.Some 50 years ago, the typical chief executive made just 20 times what an employee did, according to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. By comparison, it calculated that the average C.E.O. today made 347 times the average salary of an American laborer, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: $37,632.Reversing this ever-widening pay gap is a union rallying cry, especially at companies that have been shedding jobs in the United States.Take Mondelez, the global snack company. Outside the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on May 17 in Chicago, union members protested its decision to eliminate 600 jobs at a local factory that makes Oreo cookies, and shift some operations to Mexico.\u201cMondelez is emblematic of everything that is wrong with our economy, which works for C.E.O.s, but not for working Americans,\u201d said Brandon Rees, who works in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s Office of Investment.Irene B. Rosenfeld, the company\u2019s chief executive, received a 2016 pay package valued at $15.8 million, according to Equilar, a decline of 13 percent. Michael Mitchell, a Mondelez spokesman, said the company\u2019s compensation program is \u201cwell aligned with shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\u201dBut Mr. Rees said the company\u2019s failure to hit certain performance targets, and a 13 percent decline in Mondelez revenue last year, accounted for the decline in her compensation, adding that her pay package was still too high. He said she had focused too much on cutting costs and share buybacks, and not enough on investments that would keep jobs in the United States.Amid populist anger over income inequality, the S.E.C. in 2015 required publicly traded corporations to begin providing standard information in 2018 on the disparities between pay for chief executives and rank-and-file workers. That so-called pay-ratio rule would give investors and employees another metric for evaluating C.E.O. pay.The chairman of Business Roundtable is Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase and the 25th-best-compensated chief executive in the Equilar survey. His pay package rose 49 percent last year, to $27.2 million. Mr. Dimon, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s C.E.O. advisory group, visited the White House on Feb. 3 and has praised the president for awakening \u201canimal spirits\u201d in the economy.Alan Johnson, managing director of the pay consulting firm Johnson Associates, said he supports the opposition to the pay-ratio rule because it \u201cis a cooked-up thing to embarrass firms with a lot of part-time workers.\u201d He added that focusing on compensation leads to \u201cpay envy\u201d and does not do anything to address a fundamental problem, which is that average workers need better job training and job assistance programs.But Susan R. Holmberg, a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal public policy group, said that if the pay-ratio rule encourages employees to join unions, it is a good thing for workers, since it could lead to future wage gains.Mr. Trump \u201cran on this populist message,\u201d she said, and it is odd that the administration would be taking another look at the pay-ratio rule, because \"C.E.O. pay is the No. 1 populist issue.\u201dStill, there is some progress on the pay inequality front.This year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Equity Index Fund and the New York State Common Retirement Fund reached an agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company, to include new language on executive and employee compensation in its proxy statement. It says the company is taking a \u201cnon-elitist\u201d approach by awarding stock options to all of its 5,500 employees, not just to executives. The change has helped lead the union and the New York pension system to withdraw a proposed shareholder amendment on the issue of pay.Alexandra Bowie, a Regeneron spokeswoman, said the revised language in the company\u2019s filings did not reflect a change in policy but a \u201cbroader effort to include more detailed and accessible language.\u201dAs for Leonard S. Schleifer, the chief executive of Regeneron, his total compensation for 2016 was $28.2 million, almost 40 percent less than the year before, and nearly matching the 32 percent slide in the company\u2019s share price.Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, said company boards need to be sensitive to issues of income inequality. \u201cI have no problem with someone doing well, who creates value,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I do think a company and a board as they look at compensation need to make sure everyone down the chain is also benefiting from the performance of the company.\u201dBoards need to consider not only how much top executives are getting paid, she said, but also whether rank-and-file workers are being compensated fairly too. The crucial question is this, Ms. Sheehan said: \u201cAre they investing enough in the human capital in the company?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Ronald D. Croatti, the chief executive of UniFirst, who died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia. He was 74, not 73.An article last Sunday about executive compensation misidentified a company that Charter Communications \u2014 whose chief executive, Thomas M. Rutledge made the most last year among chiefs of 200 public companies with annual revenue of at least $1 billion \u2014 took over. It was Time Warner Cable, not Time Warner.Kitty Bennett contributed research. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google, Not the Government, Is Building the Future", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut don\u2019t be fooled by expensive juice. The idea that Silicon Valley no longer funds big things isn\u2019t just wrong, but also obtuse and fairly dangerous. Look at the cars, the rockets, the internet-beaming balloons and gliders, the voice assistants, drones, augmented and virtual reality devices, and every permutation of artificial intelligence you\u2019ve ever encountered in sci-fi. Technology companies aren\u2019t just funding big things \u2014 they are funding the biggest, most world-changing things. They are spending on ideas that, years from now, we may come to see as having altered life for much of the planet.At the same time, the American government\u2019s appetite for funding big things \u2014 for scientific research and out-of-this-world technology and infrastructure programs \u2014 keeps falling, and it may decline further under President Trump.This sets up a looming complication: Technology giants, not the government, are building the artificially intelligent future. And unless the government vastly increases how much it spends on research into such technologies, it is the corporations that will decide how to deploy them.Consider Google. On Wednesday, the internet search company kicked off its annual developer conference near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company showed off several advances to its voice-enabled assistant and its mobile operating system. Among other things, you can now point your phone at an object in the real world \u2014 a flower, a sign in another language, a marquee for a rock concert \u2014 and the phone will give you more information about what you\u2019re looking at (for instance, a button to buy tickets for the concert).The real advances at Google are in that second category. At last year\u2019s show, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, inaugurated what he called a new era for Google. The search company would henceforth be an \u201cA.I.-first\u201d company \u2014 that is, most of its advances would be driven by artificial intelligence techniques.A lot of these plans will fail, but Google isn\u2019t making big, long-term bets out of altruism. The company understands that the A.I.-based projects that succeed could be transformational: They will alter existing industries and create huge new ones, including a stream of new businesses from which Google can profit.Google is not alone in this quest to build a future out of A.I. Its parent company, Alphabet, is spending billions to inject machine intelligence into much of the global economy, from self-driving cars to health care.There are two ways to respond to the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in the intelligent future. On the one hand, you could greet the news with optimism and even gratitude. The technologies that Google and other tech giants are working on will have a huge impact on society. Self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives a year, for instance, while computerized methods for diagnosing and treating disease could improve our health and cut the cost of care.What\u2019s more, experts in the field say that many tech giants are currently approaching A.I. with a kind of academic ethos. For instance, they regularly publish papers on their findings, and \u2014 through their cloud server businesses \u2014 they are allowing third-party companies to access some of their latest A.I. tech.But the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in A.I. might also be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government.\u201cWe created OpenAI partly because industry is investing such vast sums of money into A.I. research that commercial, private entities were on track to create the first powerful A.I. systems, and these entities don\u2019t have a built-in mechanism to ensure that everyone benefits from advances,\u201d Mr. Brockman told me in an email.He went on to note that one reason the internet has been so successful is that it was created through government funding to be open and accessible to everyone. If it had been created by a single company, it might have ended up like the phone network: useful for certain tasks, but not a broad-based engine of economic opportunity.\u201cSimilarly, as powerful A.I. systems come online, the intent and motivations of their creators will be major factors in determining their impact,\u201d Mr. Brockman said. \u201cIf A.I. development is done entirely in for-profit companies, then these systems are likely to be deployed to benefit just one organization and group of people.\u201dWhat\u2019s interesting is that many in the tech industry agree with the need for greater federal funding. OpenAI was created by Elon Musk and other tech luminaries, and it has received funding from Microsoft, Amazon and Y Combinator, the start-up incubator.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America\u2019s greatest advantages,\u201d he wrote.In other words, the tech giants that are building the future would like some help changing the world. We would be wise to chip in \u2014 or let them take over the future for themselves.An earlier version of this article incorrectly included Peter Thiel as among those who helped create OpenAI. While Mr. Thiel was among those who sponsored it, he was not a creator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Green Party Is Poised to Shift Power Balance in British Columbia", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byA progressive environmental political party is poised to claim the balance of power in British Columbia, home to Canada\u2019s fastest-growing economy and the front line in battles over oil pipelines, soaring real estate prices and the economic benefits of extractive resources.Voters on Tuesday handed three provincial legislative seats to the Green Party, in its best-ever electoral performance nationally, denying a majority to the ruling British Columbia Liberal Party or its main opponent, the left-leaning New Democratic Party.The win underscores mounting discontent with a two-party system in the province, and offers the Green Party a new influence over provincial politics.\u201cWe\u2019re attracting voters from across the political spectrum who want politics to be done differently in British Columbia,\u201d Andrew Weaver, the Green Party leader in the province, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cPeople are sick and tired of corporate influence in B.C.\u201dFor now, the Liberals, who despite their name are conservative, will try to form a minority government \u2014 the first time the province has had one in 65 years. That could change after absentee ballots and judicial recounts in certain districts are tallied later this month. But Premier Christy Clark, leader of the Liberals, has signaled her willingness to adapt to a new political reality.\u201cWhatever the outcome is, whether it\u2019s a minority or a majority, I do intend to work across party lines,\u201d she told reporters on Wednesday.The Liberals, in power in British Columbia since 2001, won the most seats and the popular vote.But the bitter election provides important lessons about a province hankering for new leadership amid rising costs of living, cuts to education and distrust over the Liberals\u2019 embrace of unlimited political donations, said Hamish Telford, a political-science professor at the University of the Fraser Valley in Abbotsford, British Columbia.\u201cThe Liberals lost a lot of their more liberally inclined voters, particularly around Vancouver,\u201d he said. \u201cEven now that the economy has improved and the books are balanced, there was a narrative that the Liberals had been in power for too long and had grown too comfortable.\u201dIf the Liberals remain in a minority government, their chances of sustaining long-championed policies and costly infrastructure projects vehemently opposed by the New Democrats and even more progressive Greens will be reduced. While the province waits for the final vote tally to begin on May 22, the parties are likely to be embroiled in furious negotiations aimed at forming a coalition.\u201cThe N.D.P. and the Liberals are both going to be talking to the Greens,\u201d Dr. Telford said. The Greens\u2019 leader, Mr. Weaver, has made clear that his first priority will be to ban corporate and union political donations, which the Liberal Party has steadfastly refused to do. But a potential coalition with the Greens may force Ms. Clark\u2019s party to accept a new governing tactic: compromise.The Liberals have long supported major infrastructure projects that are anathema to the Green Party, including a 715-mile expansion of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain oil pipeline, a proposed $20 billion liquefied natural gas export initiative and the controversial $7 billion Site C hydroelectric dam and power station, which Mr. Weaver had promised to cancel.Founded in 1983 as an environmental party, the Green Party has made fighting climate change central to its platform. Mr. Weaver, a former climate scientist, entered politics largely to stop further investment in fossil fuels. But over the past decade, the party has worked to broaden its focus with a push for representational voting reform and more money for education and poverty reduction.On Wednesday, Mr. Weaver vowed to prohibit corporate and union donations. \u201cThis now means big money is banned from B.C. politics,\u201d he said. But he declined to say which party the Greens would seek to form a minority government until the final votes were tallied. \u201cIt would be reckless and irresponsible of me to show my cards until that\u2019s done.\u201dBoth Ms. Clark and her rival New Democratic leader, John Horgan, praised the Green Party\u2019s performance and highlighted their intent to work with Mr. Weaver. The New Democrats are more ideologically aligned with the Greens, but a coalition may come down to whether the Liberals are prepared to sacrifice core policies for power.\u201cThe Liberals want to govern,\u201d Dr. Telford said. \u201cThe question is what price are they willing to pay to continue governing?\u201dReflecting a deepening rural-urban divide, the Liberals won 43 of the province\u2019s 87 electoral ridings, or districts, just shy of the 44 needed to form a majority. The New Democrats won 41 ridings. In one riding, the party won by just nine votes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scandal in Brazil Raises Fear of Turmoil\u2019s Return", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Just a few days ago, Brazil seemed to be turning a corner. The stock market was soaring. Bankers were cheering. The nation\u2019s cutthroat lawmakers were lining up to curb spending. Inflation had been tamed.Brazil, it appeared, was finally on the mend.Then, in a matter of hours, it all started falling apart. President Michel Temer, long embroiled in graft scandals, suddenly became tangled in a new one, accused of taking millions of dollars in illicit payments and caught on tape discussing how to obstruct an anticorruption drive.The allegations \u2014 including testimony released Friday in which executives at one of the world\u2019s largest food companies accused him of taking about $4.6 million in illegal campaign contributions \u2014 have ignited broad calls for Mr. Temer\u2019s resignation, sent markets whipsawing and set off fears that Brazil will slide back into the political and economic turmoil that has rattled it for the last two years.The testimony, released by the Supreme Court, also described tens of millions of dollars in illicit payments into offshore accounts intended to benefit his impeached predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, and her mentor, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, both of whom have denied any wrongdoing in the matter.The bombshell made it clear that the political and economic upheaval in Latin America\u2019s largest country is far from over. Mr. Temer, who took over after Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster only a year ago, is facing the biggest crisis of his already rocky presidency. Mr. da Silva, who has been angling for a comeback, was facing multiple corruption investigations even before the allegations were revealed on Friday.On top of that, the politicians in line to take over if Mr. Temer falls \u2014 including the speaker of the house and the leader of the Senate \u2014 are also embroiled in corruption investigations, raising deep concerns over the nation\u2019s leadership and future.\u201cThe damage done to our institutions and to rule of law needs to be stanched,\u201d Paulo S\u00e9rgio Pinheiro, a former secretary of human rights, wrote in the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, describing the latest crisis as a \u201cunique and tragic moment in our history.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at the end of the line,\u201d he said.Beyond the torrent and staggering scale of the accusations, many Brazilians have been shocked that the latest scandal became public because Mr. Temer, a veteran of Brazil\u2019s Machiavellian politics, stepped into a trap that has ensnared him before: He was caught on tape by someone he trusted.\u201cIt\u2019s stunning that this isn\u2019t even the first time Temer has been recorded and betrayed in recent months,\u201d said Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cYou\u2019d think a Brazilian president would be less careless.\u201dEven then, the double crossing should not have come as a surprise. At each turn in Brazil\u2019s long-simmering political crisis, secret recordings have produced one revelation after another, tripping up some powerful politicians.Now, Mr. Temer is on tape again, this time caught by one of Brazil\u2019s richest men.The latest scandal involves Joesley Batista, 44, an heir to JBS, a food empire with operations across Brazil and the United States. The secret recording is not only raising anxiety over what Mr. Temer did, but also his susceptibility to subterfuge in a political system where leaders often rush to inform on one another.In a move worthy of a plot twist in a thriller, Mr. Batista handed over the recording to investigators as part of a plea deal. The tape caused jaws to drop over Mr. Batista\u2019s description of moves that seem to crudely refer to buying off a prosecutor and judges, as well as bribing Eduardo Cunha, the jailed politician who helped to orchestrate the impeachment of Ms. Rousseff.\u201cI\u2019m good with Eduardo, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Batista is heard telling Mr. Temer on the recording, emphasizing that he had \u201cpaid up\u201d his obligations to Mr. Cunha.\u201cYou need to keep that up, got it?\u201d Mr. Temer replied.At other points in their conversation, which occurred at Mr. Temer\u2019s official residence, Mr. Batista described \u201ctaking care\u201d of two unnamed judges and counting on a prosecutor who had informed him about a fraud investigation at Brazil\u2019s largest pension funds.Mr. Temer insists that he did nothing wrong and is rejecting calls to resign. But the recording offers a glimpse into how one of Brazil\u2019s richest men bragged about obstructing justice to the nation\u2019s president.Critics of Mr. Temer argue that he should never have met in the first place with Mr. Batista, who is the target of a graft investigation. Mr. Temer\u2019s growing chorus of opponents is also asking why the president took no legal action upon being told by Mr. Batista about an array of illicit activities.Mr. Temer was already struggling with dismal approval ratings as he sought approval for cutting pension benefits and curbing the influence of unions. Now a new phase in Brazil\u2019s instability seems to have started \u2014 just when it appeared Brazil was turning the page on political upheaval.Mr. Temer has governed under a cloud of scandal since taking office a year ago. Ministers in his cabinet have resigned amid claims of trying to stymie corruption inquiries. Mr. Temer also faces accusations that he negotiated a $40 million bribe for his party in 2010, a claim he denies.After being gripped by panic selling on Thursday, Brazilian markets stabilized somewhat on Friday as investors tried to gauge how Mr. Temer\u2019s refusal to step down would affect Brazil\u2019s economy. Unions were already marshaling resistance to the austerity measures he has proposed.\u201cI don\u2019t even have a job yet and they want us to work until we die,\u201d said Julia Canedo, 21, a university student who expressed disgust with Mr. Temer\u2019s proposed overhaul of the pension system, which allows many Brazilians to retire in their 50s. \u201cEveryone is lost and can barely follow what\u2019s going on because it\u2019s so crazy and unstable. I want him to leave.\u201dIn addition to the secret recording, executives at JBS, Mr. Batista\u2019s company, said that they paid about $4.6 million in illegal campaign contributions to Mr. Temer in 2014, some of which he pocketed himself, according to the court testimony released Friday.It also described deposits of tens of millions of dollars into offshore accounts to benefit Ms. Rousseff and Mr. da Silva, both of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party.The JBS executives recounted a remarkably ambitious effort to get public loans for the company\u2019s global expansion into markets like the United States. They described efforts to influence officials across Brazil\u2019s public bureaucracy, regardless of their party affiliation.\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t go,\u201d the newspaper warned, \u201che\u2019ll drag Brazil through an even more profound political crisis.\u201dStepping down, however, could also expose Mr. Temer to an array of legal battles: He would lose the privileged legal standing that senior officials enjoy in Brazil, often allowing them to avoid prison.If Mr. Temer resigns, \u201che can be tried and convicted,\u201d said Daniel Vargas, a law professor at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a university in Rio.Dom Phillips, Vinod Sreeharsha and Anna Jean Kaiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brigitte Macron, Liberator", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 This is a city of stolen moments, its romance tied to realism about the vagaries of the heart. Nothing surprises. Little is judged. In the realm of sex and coupling, a shrug of the shoulders is what you get from the French. Or as they would put it with dismissive bluntness: \u201cBof.\u201dIntimacy, for the French, is nobody else\u2019s business. A strong respect for privacy prevails. It is combined with reluctance to attach any moral baggage to people\u2019s love lives. The effect is liberating. France does sex and food with aplomb. Guilt is not really its thing.People come to France for its beauty, but what finally beguiles them is its civilization, at once formal and sensual, an art of living and loving.There have been magazine pieces about the couple, including an interview with Brigitte in Paris Match. As Le Monde put it, \u201cIt is together that this atypical couple scaled the steps of power. Never has the wife of a candidate been as present in a presidential campaign.\u201d But prurience and sexism have been in short supply.What\u2019s new in a French political context is that Macron and his wife cooperate so intensely. She is a principal adviser. She gave up a job as a French teacher to work with Macron when he became economy minister in 2014, and has remained at his side. For many, she has helped humanize the technocrat-banker with a tendency (now contained) for highfalutin jargon. Born into a provincial family of chocolatiers, she has good antennae for \u2018\u2018la France profonde\u201d (deep France.) Not since the song was released a half-century ago has a more emphatic affirmative answer been given to the Beatles\u2019 question: \u201cWill you still need me, will you still feed me, when I\u2019m sixty-four?\u201dAt the \u00c9lys\u00e9e in recent decades, spousal convergence of the Macron variety has been rare. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who will hand over the office on Sunday to Macron, left his companion, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, early in his presidency for the actress Julie Gayet. The mother of his four children, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, has meanwhile served in his cabinet.No sooner was Hollande\u2019s predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, installed at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e than he split up with his wife, C\u00e9cilia Ciganer; later he married Carla Bruni. Jacques Chirac and his wife had separate apartments. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand led a double life; his wife and mistress were both at his funeral.The French have shrugged. That\u2019s life. That\u2019s passion. They are not orderly.I was chatting about all this to Sarah Cleveland, a distinguished American law professor on sabbatical in Paris from Columbia University. She recalled how, in ninth grade, at school in Birmingham, Ala., she was made to study the reproduction of earthworms at considerable length. But when it came to the chapter on human reproduction, the embarrassed teacher said: \u201cGo study this at home. You won\u2019t be tested.\u201d Nobody did, of course.Her teenage son and daughter have had a different experience at school in Paris. \u201cThere\u2019s a straightforward no-nonsense approach to sex education. In a recent segment my daughter had, students \u2014 boys and girls \u2014 acted out scenarios to deal with issues of consent and unwanted overtures and saying no. They\u2019ve had classes on rape, on masturbation, on sexually transmitted diseases, even positions for sex. As a result I feel my kids are not embarrassed or afraid. They are better prepared to interact with the world. They\u2019ve learned that sex is a normal aspect of human existence that people need to know about.\u201dThat knowledge, that comfort, is very French, as are Macron and his wife. Theirs is a liberating victory.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanctuary Bills in Maryland Faced a Surprise Foe: Legal Immigrants", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byELLICOTT CITY, Md. \u2014 When lawmakers in Howard County, Md., a stretch of suburbia between Washington and Baltimore, declared their intention to make the county a sanctuary for people living in the country illegally, J. D. Ma thought back to how hard he had worked studying English as a boy in Shanghai.Stanley Salazar, a native of El Salvador, worried that the violent crime already plaguing Maryland\u2019s suburbs attributed to immigrant gangs would eventually touch his own daughters.Hongling Zhou, who had been a student in Beijing during the Tiananmen Square uprising, feared an influx of undocumented immigrants, and their children, would cripple the public schools.At first blush, making Howard County a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants had seemed a natural move: The county has twice as many Democrats as Republicans and a highly educated population, full of scientists and engineers. One in five residents was born abroad.But the bill met stout opposition from an unlikely source: some of those very same foreign-born residents.In passionate testimony before county legislators, and in tense debates with liberal neighbors born in the United States, legal immigrants argued that offering sanctuary to people who came to the country illegally devalued their own past struggles to gain citizenship.Some even felt it threatened their hard-won hold on the American dream.Their objections stunned Democratic supporters of sanctuary here and helped bring about the bill\u2019s demise in March. A similar proposal for the state collapsed this month in the Maryland Senate, where Democrats also hold a two-to-one advantage. Some of the same immigrants spoke out against it.The failure of the sanctuary bills in Maryland reveals a potentially troublesome fissure for Democrats as they rush to defy Mr. Trump. Their party has staked out an activist position built around protecting undocumented immigrants. But it is one that has alienated many who might have been expected to support it.What follows are the stories of four immigrants in Maryland who oppose sanctuary status \u2014 people whose voices have rarely been heard in the long debate over how to fix the nation\u2019s immigration system.Some supporters of sanctuary had dismissed them as white-collar professionals whose personal struggles could not compare with those of undocumented people now facing possible deportation.But anyone who thought their journeys were easy, these immigrants said, has never walked in their shoes.Growing up in China, J. D. Ma shared a small room with his parents and sister in a communal apartment in a working-class district of Shanghai. They had to take turns with two other families \u2014 14 people in all \u2014 to use a single bathroom.His maternal grandfather, a history teacher, was sent to a labor camp in 1957 under Mao Zedong. The family eventually received a letter saying he had committed suicide.But still, they considered themselves lucky: They lived in the city. They had running water.From the age of 9, Mr. Ma was pushed to learn English by his mother. \u201cStudy harder,\u201d she told him. \u201cScore higher.\u201d At 12, he won entry into a highly selective boarding school where he toiled for 13 hours a day.Today, Mr. Ma, 45, is a patent attorney, living in a stately home in Clarksville, Md., after years of study at universities in New York, Utah and Virginia and a first career as a software engineer. His wife, also a Chinese immigrant, works for the National Weather Service. Two-thirds of their daughter\u2019s second-grade classmates have parents from China or India.Mr. Ma sees his whole life as a struggle to achieve his Americanness.\u201cBeing in America is such a high privilege,\u201d he said, sitting in his brightly painted kitchen. \u201cAs an immigrant I really feel it.\u201d He added: \u201cYou cannot easily give that privilege to somebody without going through some kind of process. It\u2019s like giving lots of gold for one dollar.\u201dMr. Ma voted for Hillary Clinton. But hearing liberals talk about undocumented immigrants confuses him: The fact that their entering the country broke the law is somehow sidestepped, like a crude remark at a polite dinner party. Democrats oppose deportation on the grounds that it breaks up families, Mr. Ma said. But so do other aspects of the justice system \u2014 without setting off the same outcry.\u201cIf a single mother commits a crime and has to go to jail,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, we can\u2019t do that, because it will break her family.\u2019\u201dThis perspective baffled the sanctuary bill\u2019s supporters.Why, they asked, were naturalized citizens like Mr. Ma so threatened by the act of protecting people living in the country illegally \u2014 many of whom had worked just as hard, and put down roots of their own, thanks to years of lax immigration enforcement and an economy that depended on their labor?Undocumented immigrants, after all, live much more tenuous existences. Mr. Ma said that a liberal friend had chided him for not understanding his own advantages, compared with \u201cpeople who were here babysitting and doing all the cleaning and cutting grass for people.\u201dMr. Ma has thought about this argument a lot. But he has concluded that it is irrelevant to the broader issue of legality.Rather than treating the nation at large as complicit, he focuses on personal responsibility.\u201cJust because you are a productive member of society, working hard, mowing lawns, that should not be the reason to give you that gold,\u201d he said. \u201cYou kind of jammed something down America\u2019s throat. You said, \u2018I understand you haven\u2019t given me permission to contribute, but I want to contribute. So here I am doing it.\u2019\u201dMany Hispanics welcomed Democrats\u2019 efforts to make Maryland a sanctuary. Stanley Salazar, 37, did not.A carpenter in Silver Spring, he compares living in the country illegally to being a guest in someone\u2019s home: Be on your best behavior. Make your bed and do the dishes. Any misbehavior \u2014 drinking and driving, for example \u2014 could mean you are no longer welcome.Mr. Salazar, who is from El Salvador, knows this because he himself was illegal.He first visited the United States when he was 10. His mother, a biology teacher, had a sister in Reno who had married an American. Mr. Salazar still remembers being amazed by his first all-you-can-eat buffet, and playing an arcade game called Paperboy, in which you raced on a bike, tossing newspapers and dodging obstacles on a suburban street.His journey back, and to American citizenship, was long, but compared with more recent immigrants\u2019, relatively painless: He left law school in El Salvador in 2001 and traveled to Maryland on a tourist visa, but violated its terms by painting houses for cash. After several extensions, his visa expired. But he spoke English, thanks to his mother\u2019s tireless teaching. She had a green card. And he had a driver\u2019s license, a bank account and a car. By 2007, he had his own green card.Now, he lives in a small house with his wife, their daughters and his mother, 73, who rides the subway into Washington every morning to her job serving sandwiches in a museum.Mr. Salazar thinks sanctuary would be bad for Maryland. He bases this on what has already happened in Montgomery County, where he has been part of a Hispanic population boom.The Salvadoran gang MS-13 has gained strength in the area recently, the authorities say, partly because of an influx of undocumented children arriving without their parents. The young arrivals are more susceptible to recruitment by gangs.Mr. Salazar sees the statistics: At least 16 homicides in the county have been attributed to gangs since June 2015. About half have been linked to MS-13, including the killing of a 15-year-old girl in Gaithersburg.\u201cI have three daughters right now and I\u2019m thinking about them,\u201d Mr. Salazar said, sipping a milkshake at a Burger King in Gaithersburg. \u201cDon\u2019t I have the right to be afraid that this kind of stuff is increasing?\u201dBut that burden is borne unequally, he said. The high school Mr. Salazar\u2019s daughters would attend, where more than 40 percent of students receive subsidized lunch, is ranked far below one in affluent Bethesda, where fewer than 5 percent qualify.Mr. Salazar dismisses proponents of sanctuary as liberals living in areas that are insulated from the potential consequences. He believes politicians \u201care using us like flags,\u201d casting immigrants as blameless victims.But immigrants are people with flaws, he said. They need a way to gain legal status, not a safe space to remain here illegally.\u201cWe are not unicorns jumping over rainbows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are people. This is life. And life is hard.\u201dOn a recent spring afternoon here, a school bus bumped down a residential street, passed a woman wearing a bright green sari and came to a halt in front of a brick house with a lawn worn from soccer games and a well-used goal. The son and daughter of Biplab Pal stepped down and scampered home.Immigrants have been coming here for years: Koreans at first, Indians more recently. Mr. Pal, 43, arrived in 2008, drawn by good schools. A third of the children in his son\u2019s fourth-grade class are Indian-American. Their parents are highly educated: Mr. Pal\u2019s real estate agent has a Ph.D. in biochemistry.Gregarious and sharp-witted, Mr. Pal talked with Indian friends about the Howard County sanctuary bill. They did not like it.Some told of sacrifices like missing a parent\u2019s funeral back in India, because traveling home could jeopardize the yearslong pursuit of a green card. With so many people waiting in line for years, the idea of providing sanctuary for those who had broken the law left a sour taste.The more pressing priority, they told him, should be improving legal immigration.\u201cYou see the Indians get very angry because they have suffered so much to get a green card,\u201d said Mr. Pal, sitting at a table laden with Indian sweets. \u201cThey think a country with one-sixth of the world\u2019s population should have more slots. But instead, everybody is fighting for illegal immigration.\u201dMr. Pal got his own green card in just a few months, as part of a special category reserved for inventors and researchers. His company makes software that tracks the functioning of factory equipment.He had a different objection to sanctuary: He believed it would lead to an increase in crime.He used to live in Los Angeles, in a neighborhood with many undocumented immigrants and lots of crime. He saw a connection.But now the talk is of sanctuary, which Mr. Pal believes would amount to an invitation. \u201cDo we really want more illegal immigrants in our country?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the answer is yes.\u201dMost undocumented immigrants are Latino, and some sanctuary supporters believe that the Asian-Americans who oppose it \u2014 and who came to this country by airplane to earn graduate degrees \u2014 look down on those who crossed the border on foot, as a matter of race, class or misplaced fear.Perhaps legal immigrants should be more understanding, Mr. Pal said, but that might be asking too much.\u201cFrankly speaking, each immigrant has their own little story of how they struggled in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cTo tell the truth, illegal people have suffered 1,000 times more. But people only see their own suffering.\u201dHongling Zhou was born in 1966, the year Mao Zedong started the Cultural Revolution. Politics followed her throughout her young life.She was a graduate student in math when the 1989 student movement ignited protests across the country. She remembers days of protesting and nights staying up late talking about change. When the military killed hundreds of protesters in Beijing, she could not bear to stay.\u201cWe left after that \u2014 a lot of us left after that,\u201d she said, sitting at her kitchen table.At Indiana University, she earned a master\u2019s degree in statistics while working part time in a hospital. Now, Ms. Zhou lives in Clarksville, Md., with her husband, a software engineer who also emigrated from China, and their son and daughter.She knocked on doors for a presidential candidate before she could even vote \u2014 in 2004 in Pennsylvania for John Kerry. She was angry about the war in Iraq. Her first vote after becoming a citizen in 2007 was for Barack Obama.But never has she been more politically active than during the short life of the sanctuary bill in Howard County.Ms. Zhou first learned of it on WeChat, a messaging app popular among Chinese-Americans. She talked to friends and neighbors. Nobody liked the idea. Many were afraid that carving out a safe space for illegal immigrants would mean that more would come, and that public-school classes would swell and teachers would be spread thin.So on a cold night in early January, about a dozen people gathered around Ms. Zhou\u2019s long wooden dining table, drafted short speeches and took turns delivering them over steaming bowls of sweet bean soup with chia seeds. Most, she said, had never done anything more political than vote.\u201cI read my draft, but then I totally changed it,\u201d Ms. Zhou recalled. \u201cI talked a lot about how many years it took to get citizenship, and I actually started crying. One person said, \u2018Don\u2019t do that!\u2019 And someone else said, \u2018Let her cry!\u2019\u201dBut Ms. Zhou saw things differently. Immigrants double up in houses, she said. They rent apartments or mobile homes. Her cleaning lady, who she recently discovered is undocumented, lives in a trailer in the county.Though she opposes sanctuary, Ms. Zhou said that immigrants in the country illegally should be given a chance to gain citizenship, not be deported. But that is a nuanced position, and these are polarized times.Ms. Zhou and several dozen opponents posed for a group photograph after testifying in Annapolis. They were smiling. Many wore yellow T-shirts made for the occasion.On Facebook, someone commented: \u201cTrump Terrorists.\u201dMs. Zhou felt stung, but also confused. All she had done was disagree.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Has Its Own Hard-Line Populist, and He\u2019s on the Rise", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 For months now, a black-turbaned cleric from eastern Iran has been campaigning in provincial cities, presenting himself as an anticorruption hero as he rallies support among the poor and the pious in an underdog effort to win the presidency in Friday\u2019s election.While the candidate, Ebrahim Raisi, 56, a hard-liner who made his career in Iran\u2019s judiciary, seems to have come out of nowhere, he is seen as a favorite and possible successor to Iran\u2019s 78-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Winning the presidency, many analysts say, could be a major step in his ascent to that all-powerful position.\u201cWhen he speaks I hear our leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei,\u201d said Hadi Seifollah, 32, who runs a shop selling prayer mats, religious rings and the white-and-black checkered scarves worn by Iran\u2019s paramilitary basij forces.\u201cRaisi believes first in the Islamic Republic, its ideology,\u201d he added. \u201cHe will deal with corruption. Other candidates only talk about the economy.\u201dOn Monday, though, the second-most-popular conservative in the race, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the mayor of Tehran, suspended his campaign and threw his support to Mr. Raisi, possibly raising what analysts say are his chances of pulling off an upset.While Mr. Ghalibaf is nominally a conservative, he bases his appeal on his management skills, not ideology, so it is unclear how much, if at all, he might actually help Mr. Raisi.In 1979, the impoverished and religious masses from what was then a vast rural population were the driving force behind the revolution. Iran today is far more urban and educated, but the split endures. Mr. Raisi is calculating that by pounding away at the themes of inequality and corruption he can reap enough votes from the declining provincial sector to propel him to victory.Many of those voters, who strongly believe in the Islamic Republic\u2019s anti-Western ideology or feel strangled by poverty, hail Mr. Raisi as a savior, ready to set Iran back on the right course.At the same time, Mr. Raisi has refrained from raising any of the social issues his faction usually cares so much about, such as Islamic dress codes and segregation of men and women, as they might put off potential voters.His critics see him as a hypocrite, a consummate insider who has suddenly adopted the stance of a populist outsider and corruption fighter. \u201cMr. Raisi misuses religion and makes empty promises,\u201d said Hossein Ghayyoumi, a reformist cleric who supports Mr. Rouhani. \u201cWhy has he not fought corruption within the judiciary, where he has been for the past 38 years?\u201dHe also has a dark episode in his past as a judiciary official, accused of involvement in the mass execution of political opponents in 1988 \u2014 something that Mr. Rouhani is not shy about mentioning.Mr. Raisi and Mr. Rouhani are both Shiite Muslim clerics and staunch defenders of the idea of an Islamic Republic ruled by clerics, with some direct elections. But the similarities end there. To a surprising extent, their differences mirror those in Europe and the United States: the establishment versus populism, globalists versus nationalists.Mr. Rouhani is the globalist, seeing the way forward in outreach to other countries and foreign investment to reinvigorate the ailing economy. A critical element in that strategy was the completion of the nuclear agreement with the United States and other world powers, which the president sold as an essential first step. It has not worked out that way, however, as existing, unilateral United States sanctions have hindered foreign investment and banking.Sensing Mr. Rouhani\u2019s vulnerability, Mr. Raisi as nationalist has criticized the pact, saying on Wednesday, \u201cWhere in the world does a government weaken its defensive potentials, missiles for preventing wars?\u201dHe says the solutions for Iran\u2019s problems must be found \u201cinside the country\u201d and asserts that one of the main reasons Iran is stable and secure is its military support for Shiite fighters in Iraq and Syria.\u201cThe only attitude to solve problems is a revolutionary spirit,\u201d Mr. Raisi said in an interview with state television. He has promised to create millions of jobs using what he likes to call \u201cjihadi management,\u201d and to increase monthly cash handouts for the poor.\u201cHe will bring the economists and experts who have been neglected in past years and fix things,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst.Mr. Raisi\u2019s campaign has been quick to pick up on new opportunities offered by social media, now available in Iran. He regularly posts on Instagram and has channels on Telegram, where his campaign spreads video clips of him speaking or meeting personalities.However, liberal economists dismiss Mr. Raisi\u2019s ideas as fanciful and dangerous. \u201cHis economic and social policies are like those from former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: disastrous,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to President Rouhani. \u201cWhat foreign company will invest in Iran if he becomes president?\u201dMr. Raisi enjoys the support of many in Iran\u2019s security forces, including the powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps and the members of the paramilitary basij forces. He also appears to have the support of Ayatollah Khamenei, who like Mr. Raisi is a staunch guardian of the country\u2019s anti-Western ideology.In a recent speech he criticized the government\u2019s signing of a Unesco agreement on education and the equal rights of men and women, which he said was contrary to Iran\u2019s cultural values. \u201cWhy have they signed this?\u201d he asked publicly.Ayatollah Khamenei has also criticized the liberal economic policies of the Rouhani government, stressing that Iran must be self-sufficient and embrace what he calls the \u201cresistance economy,\u201d which presumably is not that different from Mr. Raisi\u2019s \u201cjihadi management.\u201dNevertheless, Ayatollah Khamenei is also a pragmatist who has signed off on important decisions \u2014 like negotiating directly with the great Satan, the United States, in brokering the nuclear agreement \u2014 that contradict some of the Islamic Republic\u2019s longstanding political views. After the deal was completed, Iran opened up further politically by inviting European and Asian leaders long shunned by hard-liners.Moreover, in Iran presidents typically serve two terms. Mr. Khamenei is generally not one to break with tradition, so while anything can happen in the voting, he may be comfortable with a second term for Mr. Rouhani, especially after a bruising fight that leaves the president weakened.But Mr. Raisi is not to be lightly dismissed. Believed by adherents to be a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, he is currently the custodian of the Shrine of Imam Reza, the wealthiest religious endowment in the Middle East.He was born and raised in the eastern city of Mashhad, the son of a cleric, and joined the revolution at a young age. During those turbulent days, the 20-year-old was propelled into a series of sensitive positions, serving as a prosecutor in several cities and trained by Ayatollah Khamenei as a promising young bureaucrat. In 1985, he became the deputy prosecutor of Tehran.It was in that position that Mr. Raisi was implicated in one of the bloodiest episodes in the history of the Islamic Republic. He and three others, including the current minister of justice, Mustafa Pourmohammadi, sat on a committee that sent thousands of political prisoners to their deaths.Mr. Raisi has not commented specifically on the event, but has said that as a prosecutor he \u201cnever sent anyone to their deaths.\u201dHe is married to the daughter of the hard-line Friday prayer leader of Mashhad, Ahmad Alamolhoda, who recently led a successful fight against pop concerts there, saying they do not befit a holy city.In a campaign video Mr. Raisi elaborated on the controversy, saying, \u201cI remember when there was such a hype over the concerts, I told my friends, the government should think up a solution for the concerts of poor people, the concerts of slum-dwellers, and the concerts of salaries below 1 million toman,\u201d about $250. The government should listen to the complaints of the poor, Mr. Raisi said, before worrying about pop concerts.As the head of the Astan Quds Razavi, the religious foundation, Mr. Raisi potentially has access to billions of dollars, a fact that Mr. Rouhani has raised repeatedly in recent attacks.In his campaign video, however, Mr. Raisi played down the power of the institution.\u201cRight now I am in charge of a very small foundation,\u201d he intoned. \u201cJust imagine what we could achieve if it was at the national level.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Will Reject Trump\u2019s Budget, but Still Try to Impose Austerity", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byOn WashingtonMoving forward with the cuts outlined in the $4.1 trillion spending plan created by the budget director, Mick Mulvaney, formerly one of the most determined fiscal hawks in Congress, would no doubt have major repercussions and compound the peril of Republicans already facing upheaval over their health care proposals. It would most likely hurt some of the very voters in rural and economically distressed corners of the nation who catapulted Mr. Trump to the White House and Republicans to control of the House and Senate. The effect on those constituents would be quickly felt.Presidential budgets, especially in times of divided government, are traditionally labeled dead on arrival. This one, with its deep domestic spending reductions, never even drew a breath, despite unified Republican control of Washington. But it will influence the coming congressional spending deliberations, and its most consequential effect may be to push authors of House and Senate budget and spending bills to the right.In short, the Trump administration\u2019s cuts will not become law. But Republicans on Capitol Hill may seize the moment to impose some austerity of their own without going nearly as far as Mr. Mulvaney or Mr. Trump would like.Government spending would be cut substantially. See how every budget item would be changed.\u201cAt least we now have common objectives,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said, noting that the \u201clast president never proposed, let alone tried, to balance the budget.\u201dSenator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, hinted at Republican plans to look at the budget cycle as a way to reorder federal spending. He said it presented \u201can opportunity for Congress to re-examine programs across the government, and to address the significant fiscal challenges that face our country.\u201dThe spending package approved by Congress this month made clear that lawmakers intend to reassert themselves as the prime force in federal spending policy, and they hope to achieve some level of bipartisan support. Unless Democratic votes can be rounded up, Congress would quickly revert to a cycle of short-term spending bills, and both sides would like to avoid that disruptive situation.To do so, Republicans will have to veer significantly from Mr. Trump\u2019s budget plan given the outrage of Democrats who see the proposal as an amalgam of punishing cuts in the social safety net coupled with obvious budget gimmicks deployed to disguise the true extent of the fiscal damage.The Trump administration on Tuesday released its 2018 budget, called \u201cA New Foundation for American Greatness.\u201d\u201cThis heartless spending plan attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the American middle class and would make life much harder for families and seniors,\u201d said Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. He predicted that if passed, it \u201cwould likely send our country into an economic free fall.\u201dThe budget plan submitted by Mr. Mulvaney is reminiscent of the conservative House budget alternatives written by the Republican Study Committee, the group he belonged to before defecting to form the even more conservative House Freedom Caucus. Those budgets were routinely rejected by Democrats and significant numbers of Republicans, and were seen more as ideological documents than fiscal plans. Now Mr. Mulvaney is writing budgets for the White House.Republicans were virtually unanimous in their estimation that Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would be heavily rewritten. The health care debate has reminded many congressional Republicans that large numbers of their constituents facing tough economic conditions rely on Medicaid and other federal support programs. They know cutting too deep could have hurt them in the 2018 midterms. And nearly $50 billion in proposed cuts to agriculture over the next decade immediately set off alarms with farm-state Republicans who thought their Trump-embracing constituents deserved better.In a joint statement, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas and Representative Mike Conaway of Texas, the Republican chairmen of the Senate and House Agriculture Committees, said they would \u201cfight to ensure farmers have a strong safety net so this key segment of our economy can weather current hard times.\u201d But they left the door open to cuts in food stamp programs managed by the Agriculture Department.This is the quandary for many Republicans: They are all for reining in spending but want to make certain that their home-state priorities are walled off. For each Republican worried about farm subsidies, there are others who do not like the sound of less money for health research, the State Department, transit projects and popular programs like Head Start.For instance, Representative Earl L. Carter, Republican of Georgia, said that curbing \u201cWashington\u2019s spending addiction\u201d was overdue. At the same time, though, he said he would \u201cfight for our ports, the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, the Coast Guard, our military installations, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and other critical projects as discussions continue.\u201dMr. Mulvaney was unapologetic about a fiscal approach that critics found meanspirited and in conflict with an American tradition of asking the haves to provide for the have-nots.\u201cCompassion needs to be on both sides of that equation,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cYes, you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds, but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it.\u201dDemocrats will do all they can to try to make Mr. Trump, his economic team and Republicans on Capitol Hill own this budget proposal even though many elements will not survive. The challenge for congressional Republicans will be to enact spending policies that advance their desire to be more frugal without going so far that voters decide to restore budget power to the Democrats.Advertisement"}

The police said about 8,000 people took part in the march, some of whom lobbed bottles and fireworks at officers clad in riot gear keeping the demonstrators from the revelers.Earlier in the day, 14,000 people marched elsewhere in Berlin under the banners of the German Federation of Trade Unions, calling for a reduction in the number of temporary contracts that companies can offer and for guaranteed social benefits for all employees. The march was one of hundreds organized by unions across the country that have faced dwindling membership in recent years.Members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions marched in Seoul holding red umbrellas, which symbolize the right of workers to form labor unions. Among their demands: that companies stop using temporary employees. The trend of circumventing traditional labor protections by classifying workers as independent contractors or as freelance labor is a major theme of the protests.Members of the Communist Party-affiliated All-Workers Militant Front held a 24-hour nationwide strike and protests against looming spending cuts that were demanded by the country\u2019s creditors in return for a third government bailout.

As in much of the developing world, they are becoming a potent political force, with former agricultural laborers moving to sprawling cities for jobs in manufacturing and in service industries.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Afloat on the Erie Canal: Sonar Gear, Ferris Wheel Parts and Beer Tanks", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byWATERFORD, N.Y. \u2014 It has been 200 years since a corps of men and mules started to dig what was known as \u201cClinton\u2019s ditch\u201d across hundreds of miles of farmland, forests and other decidedly dry terrain in upstate New York, creating the Erie Canal and, with it, a range of prosperous towns from Albany to Buffalo.The canal\u2019s heyday has long passed, and in recent decades it has been relegated as a recreational byway, drawing pleasure boats, fishing lines and the occasional canal fan.Lately, however, there has been a curious sight along the Erie Canal and some of its offshoots: commercial shipping \u2014 a small rebound pegged to the canal\u2019s use as a niche waterway for cargo whose size or weight make it impossible, impractical or too expensive to haul any other way. All told, the state anticipates more than 200,000 tons of shipping on the canal system in 2017, a milestone not reached since 1993, according to state officials. Still, that is a far cry from the millions of tons of cargo the canal regularly trafficked during the 19th and early 20th centuries.Unlike the frontier farm goods that once headed east to market, these new shipments often have a distinctly modern feel. They have included electrical transformers and turbines, Navy sonar equipment, and huge pedestals to support the New York Wheel, a towering Ferris wheel being built on Staten Island.And giant beer cans.Over the past 10 days, 12 enormous beer tanks have been slowly floating on the canal to Rochester, where the Genesee Beer Company plans to use them to brew a whopping eight million bottles of beer at a time. They are expected to arrive early this week.Like many of the other items seen lately along the canal, the tanks are simply too big for the roads or rails, the company says. So, for the past week, the tanks have been bobbing their way about 225 miles on four barges: a virtual beer flotilla, and an opportunity for canal \u2014 and beer \u2014 aficionados to see Clinton\u2019s ditch in action.\u201cThis is history,\u201d said Thomas Schlegel, a self-described fan of \u201cGenny,\u201d as the beer brand is known, who came to Waterford to watch the first barge head into the canal. \u201cThey should utilize the canal more often.\u201dThat, it seems, is exactly the plan under the New York Power Authority, which operates the state\u2019s canals \u2014 all 524 money-losing miles of them.Gil C. Quiniones, the chief executive of the authority, said the Erie Canal was once critical to economic activity upstate, and could be again, noting its uses in manufacturing, agriculture and tourism. He likened the canal system to the High Line in Manhattan, the West Side freight train track that was converted into a park and now is regularly mobbed.\u201cThere may not be a High Line idea for the whole 524 miles,\u201d Mr. Quiniones said, \u201cbut maybe there are sections where we could have a big idea.\u201dBut the shipment has not come without criticism, including objections to the use of state money and the use of a Chinese manufacturer in a state where Mr. Cuomo has promoted the concept \u201cBuy American.\u201d\u201cThe last place New York State should be taking its business is China,\u201d said Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat from Utica. \u201cDecisions like this one make taxpayers scratch their heads and business owners shriek.\u201dBut Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Empire State Development, rejected the notion that its investment in the brewing center in Rochester somehow amounted to supporting the offshoring of jobs.\u201cGovernor Cuomo and Empire State Development support New York State businesses, period,\u201d Mr. Conwall said, noting that the state had not spent any money on Chinese equipment.Such sniping, however, seemed a long way from the lazy pleasures that some found in watching the tanks float along. Paul Coffey brought his three grandchildren to see the barge enter Lock 2 at Waterford, just north of Albany, where a series of locks lift \u2014 or lower \u2014 boats into downstream stretches of the Mohawk River.Mr. Coffey, a New York history buff who can recall colonial trivia with the best of them, said he was skeptical of any plan to try to return the Erie Canal to its golden past.\u201cI think it\u2019s wasted money,\u201d he said, adding that he thought \u201cthe dams and locks should just be opened and let the waterways go back to their natural level.\u201dThat said, he still admired the moxie of Gov. DeWitt Clinton \u2014 who was mocked in the early 19th century for pushing for the canal, but was later celebrated \u2014 and the manpower it had taken to make the ditch a reality.\u201cTo sit and think men dug, by hand, a ditch and leveled it, 365 miles, less than 50 years after our revolution,\u201d Mr. Coffey said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s just awesome.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Energy, Low and Dirty", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byDonald Trump has two false beliefs about energy, one personal, one political. And the latter may send the world on a path to disaster.More consequential, however, is Trump\u2019s false belief that lifting environmental restrictions \u2014 ending the supposed \u201cwar on coal\u201d \u2014 will bring back the days when the coal-mining industry employed hundreds of thousands of blue-collar Americans.It\u2019s true that in the past few years coal production has finally begun to fall, in part due to environmental rules. Mainly, however, coal is fading because of progress in other technologies. As one analyst put it last week, coal \u201cdoesn\u2019t really make that much sense anymore as a feedstock,\u201d given the rapidly falling costs of cleaner energy sources like natural gas, wind and solar power.There was a time, not that long ago, when advocating clean energy was widely considered an impractical, counterculture sort of thing. Hippies on communes might talk about peace, love and solar energy; practical people knew that prosperity was all about digging stuff up and burning it. These days, however, those who take energy policy seriously see a future that belongs largely to renewables \u2014 and definitely not a future in which we keep burning lots of coal, let alone employ a lot of people digging it up.But that\u2019s not what voters from what used to be coal country want to hear. They enthusiastically backed Trump, who promised to bring those coal jobs back, even though his real agenda would punish those voters with savage cuts in programs they depend on. And Trump cares a lot more about public adulation than he does about serious policy advice.Which brings me back to Trump\u2019s European trip, which was remarkable not for what Trump did but for what he didn\u2019t do.At this point, claims that trying to limit emissions would cause vast economic harm have lost all credibility: The same technological progress in alternative energy that is marginalizing coal would make the transition to a low-emissions economy far cheaper than anyone imagined a few years ago.True, such a transition would accelerate the decline in coal. And that\u2019s a reason to provide aid and new kinds of jobs for coal miners.But Trump isn\u2019t offering coal country real help, just a fantasy about turning back the clock. This fantasy won\u2019t last for long: In a couple of years it will be obvious, whatever he does, that the coal jobs aren\u2019t coming back. But the fantasy won\u2019t even last that long if he goes along with the Paris accord.So am I suggesting that the world\u2019s most powerful leader might put the whole planet\u2019s future at risk so that he can keep telling politically convenient lies, which will soon be exposed in any case? Yes. If you find this implausible, you must not have been reading the news the past few months.Now, maybe Trump won\u2019t really pull the plug on Paris; or maybe he\u2019ll be gone from the scene before the damage is irreversible. But there\u2019s a real possibility that last week was a pivotal moment in human history, the moment when an irresponsible leader sent the whole world careening off to hell in a golf cart.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Presidential Election Splinters the Country\u2019s Culturati", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported by\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t recognize themselves in either of these candidates,\u201d said Sudhir Hazareesingh, a politics professor at Oxford University and the author of \u201cHow the French Think.\u201d The backdrop is a French left that\u2019s divided, especially over the big Cs: capitalism and communism \u2014 and the collapse of the governing Socialist party in this election.Ms. Aram and others worry that this plague-on-both-your-houses sentiment is, in effect, a vote for Ms. Le Pen, the National Front\u2019s candidate \u2014 whom they regard as xenophobic, divisive and authoritarian. And that has prompted a flurry of last-minute mobilizations among the cultural elite to rally left-leaning abstainers, including by the actor Mathieu Kassovitz and the directors Agn\u00e8s Varda, Jacques Audiard and Bertrand Tavernier.In writing her radio riff, Ms. Aram said she had listened to friends and young people. \u201cWhat struck me is the irresponsibility of some of the \u2018Neither-Nor\u2019 supporters,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cI think that equating Le Pen and Macron and standing under a \u2018Without Me May 7\u2019 banner, hoping that other people are going to stop the National Front is totally irresponsible.\u201d\u201cIn terms of threats to liberal democracy, threat No. 1 is the National Front,\u201d Mr. Todd said in an interview. \u201cBut the forces behind Macron, the people who are pro-Euro, pro-Europe, pro-Germany, are a major threat to democracy.\u201dHe said he had voted for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon in the first round and didn\u2019t believe Ms. Le Pen would win on Sunday, so he would sit out the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s the usual French theater,\u201d Mr. Todd said. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the verge of falling into Nazism or fascism at all.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Bruckner compared Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s refusal to back Mr. Macron to the German Communist party leader in 1933 urging Communists to vote against the Socialists rather than against the Nazis. \u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said.\u201cThe French are nostalgic for an ideological, utopian communism, which never existed,\u201d he added.But he added that it was \u201ca very serious political error\u201d that some supporters of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon won\u2019t support Mr. Macron, as it could propel a more dangerous politician into office.Mindful of the possibility of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s victory, cultural figures have ratcheted up their pro-Macron activities in recent days while organizations that normally don\u2019t take sides in elections are weighing in.On Thursday, the Acad\u00e9mie des C\u00e9sars, which doles out France\u2019s version of the Academy Awards, issued a statement offering its \u201cunreserved support\u201d for Mr. Macron.And that same day, at a reception at France\u2019s Culture Ministry to present the French films in competition in this month\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, Audrey Azoulay, the outgoing culture minister, urged France\u2019s film world to help defeat the National Front. \u201cThe far right\u2019s imagery is very strong,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to show a different image\u201d of France, she added, \u201cto show its differences and complexities.\u201dDaphn\u00e9 Angl\u00e8s contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May\u2019s Vapid Vision for a One-Party State", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 Britain today confronts a variety of deep, even existential, uncertainties. The terms of its exit from the European Union, the country\u2019s long-term economic prospects and Scotland\u2019s future within the United Kingdom are all in the balance. In contrast to these unknowns, the outcome of the general election on June 8 already feels concrete: The Conservatives, consistently between 17 percent and 20 percent ahead in the polls, are on course for a landslide victory.In calling this election (despite promises not to) and in her campaigning for it, Prime Minister Theresa May is exploiting this contrast. The Conservatives are being presented as a new type of \u201cpeople\u2019s party,\u201d under which everyone can huddle to stay safe from the multiple storms that are brewing. Mrs. May and her party are treating this election as too important to be reduced to political divides. With no explanation of how, she claims that \u201cevery single vote for me and Conservative candidates will be a vote that strengthens my hand in the negotiations for Brexit.\u201dMrs. May\u2019s idea that her opponents are merely playing self-interested political \u201cgames\u201d is a classic populist trope, one that suggests that constitutional democracy is really an obstacle standing between people and leader. The prime minister\u2019s rhetoric since calling the general election has implied that the best outcome for \u201cthe national interest\u201d would be to eradicate opposition altogether, whether that be in the news media, Parliament or the judiciary. For various reasons (not least the rise of the Scottish National Party) it is virtually impossible to imagine the Labour Party achieving a parliamentary majority ever again, as Mrs. May well knows. To put all this another way, the main purpose of this election is to destroy two-party politics as Britain has known it since 1945.One way in which Mrs. May has aggressively pursued this outcome is in her unusual framing of the choice before the British electorate. We are used to politicians presenting policy proposals and promises to the public. Of course, in practice this involves spin doctors seeking to cast their party\u2019s policies in the best light, news outlets twisting the message depending on their political biases and many voters turning away in disgust because they don\u2019t believe a word politicians say. That\u2019s the routine.By contrast, Mrs. May has made scarcely any statements regarding policy. Her speeches and campaign literature are peppered with the slogan \u201cstrong and stable leadership,\u201d a phrase she then recites on the few occasions that she takes questions from journalists or members of the public. The very basis on which she is asking to be trusted and to be elected seems different from an ordinary policy platform. From a leader of a party still in thrall to Margaret Thatcher, Mrs. May\u2019s virtual silence on the economy is astonishing. The decision to vote Conservative is not to be based on knowledge of what a Conservative government will do \u2014 nobody has much of a clue about anything right now \u2014 but because of the desperate need for \u201cstrong and stable leadership.\u201dPoliticians and parties can scarcely be blamed for wanting more power. That\u2019s what drives them. What is worrying about Mrs. May is that she seems to be deliberately aggravating Britain\u2019s existential anxiety, precisely so as to benefit from it personally. Her extraordinary Trumpian accusation that European Union leaders are seeking to interfere in the election (since repeated by other Conservative ministers) seems to be aimed at stoking nationalist resentment toward the very people who will end up deciding what type of trade deals and \u201cdivorce bill\u201d Britain will be granted. This suggests that she views the destruction of the Labour Party as a more important national priority than Britain\u2019s long-term economic prosperity.Mrs. May clearly has a good emotional antenna, especially when it comes to sensing the fears and resentments of what she calls \u201cordinary working people.\u201d But if it turns out that she is a weak negotiator with the European Union, and if she fails to grasp the magnitude of Britain\u2019s economic vulnerability, the politics of resentment will be all she has to fall back on. Britain\u2019s conservative tabloid press will praise every step in this direction with its usual wartime nostalgia, and she will continue to claim the support of \u201cthe people.\u201d But the reality will be a fractured nation slipping ungraciously to the status of an angry and irrelevant midsize economy.Brexit will be fiendishly difficult, but there is no reason it has to be draped in so much nationalistic gravitas and secrecy, nor does it have to mean the hugely risky departure from the European single market. But that\u2019s the path that Mrs. May has chosen. Her gambit is to present herself and the Conservative Party as the one certainty in an otherwise chaotic political situation, with party politics a symptom of weakness and chaos. This is likely to work to devastating effect, but only because she refuses to acknowledge the crucial contribution that she and her party made to this chaos in the first place.Advertisement"}

The incident was shown in video clips posted by the semiofficial Fars news agency.Mr. Rouhani, who is fighting to be re-elected on May 19, remained in the armored car, with bodyguards hanging from all sides protecting him. Dozens of miners and grieving family members surrounded the vehicle, some wearing hard hats, blocking it from moving.Some miners could be heard swearing, as another, wearing a miner\u2019s helmet and sitting on the roof of the car shouted: \u201cMake way. This is your president.\u201dMr. Rouhani faces five opponents in the elections. The main hard-line candidates, Mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf of Tehran and the head of a religious foundation, Ebrahim Raisi, a cleric, accuse him of having ruined the economy and not solving unemployment.The accident in the mine was the latest in a string of fires and natural disasters. There was even a tower collapse in the center of Tehran.In a separate, edited video circulated by Fars, the presidential car is seen from another angle. As other cars in the convoy slowly make their way forward, the black armored car is seen surrounded by miners.Several members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps are standing at a distance, as one miner starts banging the hood of the car, and kicking it. Seconds later, he can be seen trying to drag down one of the bodyguards hanging from the vehicle. As the presidential vehicle speeds away some miners chase it, throwing stones.In yet another clip, posted by the Tasnim news agency, Mr. Rouhani can be seen standing among miners. One of them complains that they have not been paid for 14 months. \u201cI don\u2019t even have 10,000 tomans,\u201d or around $2.60, \u201cto take my child to the doctor,\u201d he says.Most clips are posted by news agencies opposing Mr. Rouhani.On Twitter, Hamid Aboutalebi, his chief of staff of political affairs, defended him, saying that Mr. Rouhani had insisted on going, despite his advisers\u2019 warnings.\u201cDr. Rouhani opposed me by saying: \u2018I am the president of the people at the time of their pain and tumult. If their yelling at me would result in national tranquillity, I should go,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Aboutalebi wrote on Sunday.\u201cDr. Rouhani said: \u2018I will go to the mine alone so that the miners would achieve comfort and serenity by yelling at the highest national official; this is an honor for me,\u2019 \u201d the chief of staff wrote in another post.Advertisement"}

The first four will arrive in the fall and feature slim seats that reduce seatback depth.\u201cPeople focus on the numbers, but the well-designed seats are set up to be space efficient and improve overall living space,\u201d said Josh Freed, a spokesman for the airline.Thinner seats are quickly becoming the industry norm, and while they may give back some space, frequent fliers complain of discomfort.Not long ago, in the early 2000s, American advertised itself as the airline with more room throughout coach. Instead, the industry has had more success selling seats with extra legroom in new premium economy cabins, cramming the most-cost-sensitive passengers in tighter quarters in the back.Whether other carriers will follow American\u2019s lead remains to be seen. Many expect United Airlines to make a similar move, given that its president, Scott Kirby, was, until August 2016, the president of American Airlines. United Airlines declined to comment.American\u2019s reward may be more revenue, but it could lose customers.\u201cEven if the average traveler doesn\u2019t pay attention to this and has an uncomfortable flight, major travel buyers with corporate contracts care about the experiences their travelers have and the airline may risk losing lucrative business travelers,\u201d Mr. Leff said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Venezuela Stumbled to the Brink of Collapse", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterVenezuela, by the numbers, resembles a country hit by civil war.Its democracy, long a point of pride, became the oldest to collapse into authoritarianism since World War II. Power grabs, most recently to replace the Constitution, have led to protests and crackdowns that have killed dozens just this month.Established democracies are not supposed to implode like this. Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist, said Venezuela was one of \u201cfour or five, ever.\u201d Among those, none was as wealthy or fell so far. \u201cIn most cases,\u201d he said, \u201cthe regime quits before it gets this bad.\u201dVenezuela\u2019s crisis came through a series of steps whose progression is clear in retrospect, and some of which initially proved popular.At democracy\u2019s founding, in 1958, the country\u2019s three leading parties, later narrowed to two, agreed to share power among themselves and oil revenue among their constituents.Their pact, meant to preserve democracy, came to dominate it. Party elites picked candidates and blocked outsiders, making politics less responsive. The agreement to share wealth fostered corruption.Economic shocks in the 1980s led many Venezuelans to conclude the system was rigged against them.In 1992, leftist military officers, led by Lt. Col. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, attempted a coup. They failed and were imprisoned, but their anti-establishment message resonated, catapulting Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to stardom.The government instituted a series of reforms that were intended to save the two-party system, but that may have doomed it. A loosening of election rules allowed outside parties to break in. The president freed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, hoping to demonstrate tolerance.But the economy worsened. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez ran for president in 1998. His populist message of returning power to the people won him victory.Despite Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s victory, the two parties still dominated government institutions, which he saw as antagonists or even potential threats.He passed a new Constitution and purged government jobs. Some moves were broadly popular, like judicial reforms that reduced corruption. Others, like abolishing the legislature\u2019s upper house, seemed to have a broader aim.\u201cHe was reducing potential checks on his authority,\u201d said John Carey, a Dartmouth College political scientist. Beneath the revolutionary language, Mr. Carey said, was \u201cpretty savvy institutional engineering.\u201dDistrust of institutions often leads populists, who see themselves as the people\u2019s true champion, to consolidate power. But institutions sometimes resist, leading to tit-for-tat conflicts that can weaken both sides.\u201cEven before the economic crisis, you have two things that political scientists all agree are the least sustainable bases for power, personalism and petroleum,\u201d Mr. Levitsky said, referring to the style of government that consolidates power under a single leader.When members of the business and political establishment objected to a series of executive decrees in 2001, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez declared them enemies of the people\u2019s revolution.Because populism describes a world divided between the righteous people and the corrupt elite, each round of confrontation, by drawing hard lines between legitimate and illegitimate points of view, can polarize society.Supporters and opponents of a leader like Mr. Ch\u00e1vez come to see each other as locked in a high-stakes struggle, justifying extreme action.In 2002, amid an economic downturn, outrage against Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s policies swelled into protests that threatened to overwhelm the presidential palace.When he ordered the military to restore order, it instead arrested him and installed an interim leader.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s foreign policy shifts, aligning with Cuba and arming Colombian insurgents, had angered some military leaders. His war on the elites turned out to carry risks.The coup leaders overstepped, dissolving the Constitution and legislature, sparking counterprotests that quickly returned Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to power.But his message of a revolutionary struggle against internal enemies no longer felt like a metaphor for reducing poverty.Mr. Carey called it a \u201chugely polarizing moment\u201d that allowed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to portray the opposition as \u201ctrying to sell Venezuelan interests out.\u201dHe and his supporters now saw politics as a zero-sum battle for survival. Independent institutions came to be seen as sources of intolerable danger.The licenses of critical media outlets were suspended. When labor unions protested, they were weakened by blacklists or replaced outright. When courts challenged Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, he gutted them, suspending unfriendly judges and packing the Supreme Court with loyalists.The result was intense polarization between two segments of society who now saw each other as existential threats, destroying any possibility of compromise.Shortly after the coup, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez faced another battle that would prove just as fateful. Workers went on strike at the state-run oil firm, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, which he had long denounced for its associations with business elites and the United States.The strike threatened to destroy the economy and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s presidency. But it also presented an opportunity to stave off another uprising.After the strike collapsed, he fired 18,000 PDVSA workers, many of them skilled technicians and managers, and replaced them with some 100,000 supporters.Much of the firm\u2019s operating budget was diverted into programs for Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s political base, payoffs for government cronies and subsidies to keep his promise of affordable food.In 2011, $500 million from a PDVSA pension fund found its way into a pyramid scheme run by government-linked financiers, none of whom faced prosecution. After running on smashing the corrupt elite, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had merely established his own.As an oil company, PDVSA was ruined. Production dropped despite a global boom in oil prices. The injury rate, measured in lost man-hours, more than tripled.In 2012, a refinery exploded, killing at least 40 and causing $1.7 billion in damage, suggesting that even maintenance budgets had been siphoned.Its cash reserves depleted and development projects stalled, PDVSA, and by extension the Venezuelan economy, was left without a cushion when oil prices dropped in 2014.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had set up Venezuela for not just economic collapse but also a political crisis. If his support relied on oil-fueled patronage, what would happen when the money ran out?The 2002 coup taught Mr. Ch\u00e1vez that an alliance of convenience with armed groups known as colectivos could help him control the streets where protesters had almost brought him down.The colectivos, funneled money and arms from the state, became political enforcers. Protesters learned to fear these men, who arrived on Chinese-made motorcycles to disperse them, often lethally.The colectivos grew in power, challenging the police for control. In 2005, they expelled the police from a region of Caracas, the capital, that had tens of thousands of residents.Though the government never officially approved such violence, it publicly praised colectivos, granting them tacit impunity. Many exploited this freedom to participate in organized crime.Alejandro Velasco, a New York University professor who studies colectivos, said the groups were later joined by criminal \u201copportunists\u201d who learned that \u201cadding a little ideology to their operations\u201d could win them impunity.Criminality and lawlessness flourished, spiking murder rates.In desperation, he parceled out patronage. The military, with which he had less sway than his predecessor, got control of lucrative drug and food trades, as well as gold mining.Unable to pay for subsidies and welfare programs, he printed more money. When this drove up inflation, making basic goods unaffordable, he instituted price controls and fixed the currency exchange rate.This made many imports prohibitively expensive. Businesses shut down. Mr. Maduro printed more money, and inflation grew again. Food became scarce. Unrest deepened, and Mr. Maduro\u2019s survival grew more contingent on handouts he could not afford.This cycle destroyed Venezuela\u2019s economy.It also worsened street violence. With government stores empty, black markets mushroomed. Colectivos, less reliant on government support, took command of the informal economy in some areas. They grew more violent and harder to rein in.Mr. Maduro tried to restore order in 2015, deploying heavily armed police and military units. But the operations became \u201cblood baths,\u201d Mr. Velasco said. Many officers turned to criminality themselves.The political system, after years of erosion, has become a hybrid of democratic and authoritarian features \u2014 a highly unstable mix, scholars say.Its internal rules can shift day to day. Rival power centers compete fiercely for control. Such systems have proved far likelier to experience a coup or collapse.Mr. Maduro has struggled, as leaders of such hybrid systems often do, to assert control.Without Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s personal connections or deep pockets, Mr. Maduro has little leverage with authoritarian elements dominated by political and military elites. Because he is deeply unpopular, his hold over democratic institutions may be even weaker.Venezuela\u2019s paradox, Mr. Levitsky said, is that the government is too authoritarian to coexist with democratic institutions, but too weak to abolish them without risking collapse.With neither side able to exert control, little in the way of an economy or public order to take over, and a political system seemingly unable to break or bend, Venezuela has brought itself from wealth and democracy to the brink of collapse.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regulator in China Takes Aim at Anbang Insurance Group", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 A Chinese regulator announced on Friday that it had taken disciplinary measures against the Anbang Insurance Group, a financial behemoth that has tried to invest tens of billions of dollars overseas, for the improper sale of two investment products.The moves by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission come against a backdrop of broader worries about the country\u2019s financial system, in addition to ones about the insurance industry.President Xi Jinping told Politburo members last month that China should place a strong emphasis on financial stability as a pillar of a strong economy, Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported.Many foreign economists and investors on Wall Street have expressed misgivings about China\u2019s rapid accumulation of debt, particularly at state-owned enterprises, since the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.Chinese regulators began stepping up their scrutiny of banks several years ago, and they have been discouraging some aggressive lending and money-raising programs. Partly in response to that, real estate developers and others who needed to borrow large amounts of money began turning to insurers, which rapidly expanded their financial activities and raised the money to do so by selling a wide array of often speculative investment products.The State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, announced separately on Friday the dismissal of the chairman of the insurance regulatory commission, who has been the subject of a corruption investigation. The government has not linked that investigation to Anbang, however.This week, the insurance regulator said it was barring Anbang from selling two of its investment products.One, the Anbang Longevity No. 5 Annuity, had been presented to regulators as a long-term investment. But the commission said that it was effectively a two-year investment that should have been subject to more stringent regulations on short- and medium-term investments.The other banned investment product, Anbang Endowment Insurance, was put on the market without an actuary\u2019s signature, the commission said.In an uncommonly sweeping warning to the insurer, the regulator concluded its announcement by telling Anbang that it should pay \u201chigh attention\u201d to its full range of investment products and \u201cfix the work on product development and management in strict accordance with supervision policies and requirements.\u201dThe investment-product bans and the broad admonition were part of a direct order to the company that was dated on Thursday and posted on the commission\u2019s website on Friday.Anbang said that it had no immediate comment on the commission\u2019s order. Chinese regulatory decisions typically take effect immediately, particularly if published for the general public to see, and are nearly impossible to appeal.The State Council announced separately on Friday that Xiang Junbo, the chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, had been removed from office. No successor was announced.Anbang has been a leader among insurers when it comes to using so-called wealth management products, a class of lightly regulated investments that promise higher rates of return than conventional investments, but that also carry higher risks that may or may not be disclosed.Wealth management products also tend to promise a quick payback period. But the issuing companies are exposed to liquidity risk if investors ask for their money back instead of reinvesting. The liquidity risk is particularly high if the issuer has put its money into long-term projects that cannot be sold quickly to raise cash.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter @KeithBradsher.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

So his top aides have urgently set about selecting candidates to run in almost every parliamentary district in the country.\u201cA generation is in the midst of disappearing,\u201d said Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist who teaches at Sciences Po, one of France\u2019s most esteemed universities. \u201cAnd you have a new generation that is in the midst of being born and that is questioning yesterday\u2019s political fault lines.\u201d\u201cThey are in the midst of inventing something, one doesn\u2019t yet know what,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they are in the middle of creating something new.\u201dThe meltdown of the party system has suddenly thrust France \u2014 one of the European Union\u2019s core countries, and long one of its most static and resistant to change \u2014 into the same political caldron as countries like Britain, Italy, Greece and Spain. All have seen their politics destabilized in recent years with the implosion of traditional parties and the emergence of populist newcomers.\u201cThere is commonality between the French situation and the general historic moment,\u201d said Pierre Rosanvallon, a historian of politics at Coll\u00e8ge de France, one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious universities.\u201cFrance had rather organized parties, and they are melting down very rapidly; it\u2019s the same thing as in Italy,\u201d said Mr. Rosanvallon, pointing to the decline of Italy\u2019s Christian Democrats and Communists as the populist Five Star movement has ascended.The task for Mr. Macron\u2019s movement, now being renamed La R\u00e9publique en Marche!, is to quickly define itself for voters before the first round of legislative elections on June 11. Runoffs will be a week later.If Mr. Macron does not win a majority, he will be forced to work with shifting majorities from bill to bill, or to form coalitions with other parties, and coalitions \u201care not really in the French tradition,\u201d said Fabienne Keller, a senator from the mainstream party on the right, the Republicans.\u201cBut to elect a president of the Republic who is neither from the Socialists nor from the large movement of the right and center is also unusual,\u201d she added.The need to build from the ground up is not Mr. Macron\u2019s problem alone, however.Both establishment parties \u2014 the Republicans and, on the left, the Socialists \u2014 are facing a painful identify crisis after an unprecedented election that shunted them aside. The populist or more hard-line parties that have risen at either end of the political spectrum are also experiencing growing pains.Issues like globalization, which dominated much of the presidential campaign, have cut across old political dividing lines and are helping to scramble alliances.Mr. Macron\u2019s victory last Sunday is threatening both mainstream parties as some of their politicians look to defect to the winning team. Yet he has characterized his movement as neither of the left nor of the right, thereby giving himself room to pivot in almost any direction.The trap he is trying to avoid is having too many faces from existing parties and having En Marche look simply like a fig leaf for the same old players from a discredited political establishment.That has left Mr. Macron with a difficult needle to thread, trying at once to attract new faces as well as enough old hands for his legislative group to work effectively.Similarly, he\u2019s aiming for a balance of members from right and left, to avoid being seen as too close to either the Socialists or the Republicans.So far, Mr. Macon\u2019s movement has announced it has candidates in 428 of the 577 legislative districts, and it hopes to have more by the filing deadline on Friday. His team said 52 percent of the initial list had never held elected office, and exactly half were women.The team\u2019s presentation was not exactly smooth \u2014 the list first distributed to journalists had several mistakes \u2014 and almost immediately Mr. Macron\u2019s leading centrist ally, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, said he was unhappy with the number of places accorded to members of his party.En Marche initially rebuffed Mr. Valls, but then reached a compromise saying it would not run anyone against him \u2014 implicitly suggesting it could work with him in a coalition.But the party itself has survived, and until Mr. Fillon encountered the scandal, it was seen as the logical successor to the unpopular Socialist government led by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\u201cWe are convinced we were not defeated on our ideas,\u201d Laurent Wauquiez, a vice president of the Republican party, said at a news conference presenting its legislative platform.The Republicans have worked overtime to ensure that none of their legislative candidates defect to Mr. Macron and have trumpeted that none were on En Marche\u2019s recently released candidate list (although the list did include a handful of lower-ranking party members or allies). Also, in several of the districts where En Marche has yet to announce candidates, moderate Republicans are running, suggesting Mr. Macron\u2019s party is leaving the door open to them.If discipline holds, the Republican party stands a chance of becoming the largest group in Parliament. If it musters a majority, it would even have the leverage to insist that one of its members become prime minister, with the potential to wrest control of domestic policy from Mr. Macron.But France\u2019s political shake-up is wider even than the mainstream establishment.That would be a significant increase for both populist candidates, and enough to make themselves a persistent nuisance to Mr. Macron. Now, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front has just two seats, and France Unbowed, formed just last year, has no presence at all.Olivier Faure, who heads the Socialists\u2019 group in the National Assembly, called Mr. Macron\u2019s list of candidates \u201ca blank page\u201d with no \u201ccommon culture\u201d besides the expectation that they will support Mr. Macron\u2019s agenda.\u201cWhat are they going to do in this or that situation? In a crisis, how are they going to react?\u201d he asked. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t know. One knows only that they are robots ready to push the button when they are asked to.\u201dFor now, every day brings new political configurations, and it is likely to be months before a new political topography emerges in France.\u201cWe are in a movie that has not yet ended,\u201d Mr. Faure said. \u201cSo we cannot yet say how it will turn out.\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "President Buhari\u2019s Prolonged Absences Put Nigeria on Edge", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s ailing president, Muhammadu Buhari, had been seen in public so rarely that some Nigerians were convinced he was dead. Some of his supporters have called on him to step down, at least until his health improves.His wife recently defended him, posting on Twitter that the president\u2019s condition was \u201cnot as bad as it\u2019s being perceived.\u201dBut Mr. Buhari, 74, barely reveled in the achievement. He met with the girls briefly Sunday, then flew back to London, where he has spent nearly two months this year on medical leave.Among the well-wishing from those responding on Twitter were expressions of fears about a rudderless country.\u201cJust resign,\u201d read one post.The release last weekend of 82 of the schoolgirls kidnapped from the village of Chibok consumed and elated people around the world. But in Nigeria the news was quickly caught up in another drama: Who, exactly, is in charge of Africa\u2019s biggest economy?Officially, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has taken over while the president is in London. But some Nigerians are asking how Mr. Buhari can run the country when he has been too ill to attend his own cabinet meetings.\u201cThere is today no clear leadership,\u201d said Sylvester Odion Akhaine, an associate professor of political science at Lagos State University. \u201cHis absence harbors potential seeds of instability.\u201dSome critics even contend that the timing of the girls\u2019 release was suspicious, intended to distract the nation from the president\u2019s latest medical trip to London.Ayodele Fayose, the governor of Ekiti State, issued a statement saying it had become commonplace for Mr. Buhari to \u201cresort to flying dubious kites and selling cheap dummies to distract the people and obfuscate the issue at hand.\u201dThe troubles do not end there: Angry residents of the oil-rich south, where many feel cheated out of their share in the nation\u2019s oil wealth, are blowing up pipelines.Given all the uncertainty, various groups have called on Mr. Buhari to resign or take a lengthy medical leave of absence until it is clear he is well enough to lead. Femi Adesina, a special adviser to Mr. Buhari, rejected those calls.\u201cOver 15 million people voted the president into office,\u201d he said. \u201cIf between 15 and 20 people are asking for resignation, their will cannot override the will of millions of others. Millions of Nigerians are praying for, and wishing the president well.\u201dNigerians fear a rerun of 2009, when the president, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, was ill for months, traveled to Saudi Arabia for treatment and never handed over power. Parliament eventually appointed his deputy, Goodluck Jonathan, to take over, and Mr. Yar\u2019Adua died in the presidential villa.Mr. Jonathan served out the term and was later elected to office, presiding over a corruption-plagued administration until he was ousted by Mr. Buhari in the last election.Many Nigerians blame Mr. Jonathan for failing to try to rescue the girls abducted from Chibok immediately after militants stormed their boarding school during exam week in 2014. Even with the dozens released over the weekend, more than 100 of the girls remain unaccounted for, many of them believed to be still in Boko Haram\u2019s clutches.Mr. Buhari came into office in 2015 with two major promises: ending rampant corruption and defeating Boko Haram. He has made progress toward both goals.Under Mr. Buhari, a former general, soldiers have made major gains against Boko Haram, storming forest hide-outs and scattering fighters into the countryside. The group no longer holds large swaths of territory in Nigeria but still stages regular suicide attacks and strikes on military convoys and outposts.Some Nigerians are worried that Mr. Buhari has ceded leadership to what is often referred to as his \u201ccabal,\u201d a group of close advisers who they fear are making political appointments and important decisions for an incapacitated president.Bisi Akande, a former national chairman of Mr. Buhari\u2019s political party, said he worried that this inner circle already was \u201cattempting to feast on the health of Mr. President in a dangerous manner.\u201d\u201cIn the end, it could drag the entire country into avoidable doom,\u201d he said.Last week, a prominent human rights lawyer called for the suspension of bank activity, Parliament and all official business until Mr. Buhari gave up power.\u201cI hereby call upon all the good people of Nigeria across the land to rise up to challenge the cabal that is holding Nigeria to ransom in the face of the apparent incapacity of the president to direct the affairs of Nigeria,\u201d the lawyer, Ebun Adegboruwa, said in a statement.Nigeria\u2019s Constitution calls for a president to be fit and in charge, and lawmakers could have doctors examine Mr. Buhari. Some opponents have sought that, but it seems unlikely lawmakers will resort to such measures.During both his medical trips to London, Mr. Buhari has officially ceded power to the vice president, Mr. Osinbajo. Mr. Osinbajo, a former partner at a law firm who belongs to Mr. Buhari\u2019s party, has been praised during his stints as interim president.Mr. Osinbajo traveled to the Niger Delta in the south of the country to meet with leaders upset about economic inequalities \u2014 a trip Mr. Buhari had scheduled last year but canceled after oil pipeline attacks. He has led cabinet meetings, helped shepherd legislation, and on Monday presided over a major business forum. He even weighed in on a national obsession: arguing over which country has the best jollof rice.His performance has put to rest fears of turmoil in a nation that has suffered through coups, military rule and a bloody separatist movement in the south. But positioning is well underway for who would serve as Mr. Buhari\u2019s replacement on the 2019 presidential ticket for his party, the All Progressives Congress.The jockeying takes into account a principle that has been in place since the 1999 end of military rule: the informal agreement that the presidency rotate after every two terms between the overwhelmingly Muslim north and Christian south.Mr. Buhari is from the north, and if he leaves office before his term is finished, Mr. Osinbajo, a southerner, would take over until the term ends in 2019. But some in their party might argue for a northerner on the ticket for the next election because the north\u2019s stint would be cut short.Mr. Buhari\u2019s supporters are brushing off talk of his successor. They say the president is fully capable of doing his job.Bola Tinubu, an All Progressives party leader and the former governor of Lagos State, released a statement this week calling for Nigerians to stop speculating about the health of their president and focus on his achievements.\u201cHis policies have begun to bear fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the complex menu of problems he has faced, President Buhari has done well in a tough situation.\u201dDionne Searcey reported from Dakar, and Tony Iyare from Lagos, Nigeria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Ruins, a New Push for Statehood", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byIn short, it is difficult to imagine a worse time for governing-party officials in this struggling Caribbean commonwealth to persuade Washington it is ready to become the 51st American state.But they have pledged to make their case anyway.Tell them that it seems impossible, and they will conjure the long moral arc of the universe and how it bends toward Puerto Rican statehood. \u201cThat\u2019s what they told the blacks,\u201d an indignant Ram\u00f3n Rosario Cort\u00e9s, Puerto Rico\u2019s public affairs secretary, said in an interview last week. \u201cThat they were wasting their time attending the marches of Martin Luther King Jr. because nobody was ever going to hear the cry of the people!\u201dBut Mr. Rossell\u00f3 must not simply convince a wary Congress, which, by law, holds the key to Puerto Rico\u2019s relationship with the United States. On the island, the \u201cstatus\u201d issue, as it is typically called, has for decades been the defining \u2014 and most divisive \u2014 question at the heart of Puerto Rican politics.The three main political parties are not really divided along ideological lines; rather, Puerto Ricans know them as the party of statehood, the party of independence and the party that supports some improved version of the status quo. Voters in the June 11 referendum will be asked to choose among those three visions, and Mr. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s allies are making a big push.\u201cTreasure your American citizenship,\u201d read signs posted around the capital. \u201cGuarantee it. Vote for statehood.\u201dBut resistance runs deep. Jose Falu, 63, a black Puerto Rican who served in the Army from 1978 to 1984, was visiting the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in San Juan last week. He said he would like to see the commonwealth receive the same treatment as states \u2014 but not become a state. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in the United States during my period in the Army,\u201d he said, \u201cand they don\u2019t treat the Puerto Ricans the same way as the Americans.\u201dSuch is the swirl of complex feelings toward the mainland in Puerto Rico, obtained by the United States in 1898 as a spoil of the Spanish-American War. Its mash-up Caribbean culture has long encompassed strains of ardent American patriotism and concerns about the dilution of a unique Hispanic heritage, and its compatibility with the broader American project. In San Juan, the Capitol is adorned on the inside with paintings of Puerto Ricans who served with particular distinction and bravery in the American military. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s famous quotation \u2014 \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth\u201d \u2014 graces the exterior.Some Puerto Ricans believe that the best expression of that sentiment would be a declaration of independence from the United States, but their numbers are small: The Puerto Rican Independence Party has never won the governorship.\u201cI don\u2019t feel optimistic at all\u201d about achieving independence, said Humberto Rodr\u00edguez Ortiz, 29, an artist and bartender. \u201cI just hope for it like a little kid.\u201dThe middle ground has long been occupied by the Popular Democratic Party. Its leaders do not want to abandon the autonomy that the current status provides, but they argue that serious changes are needed if the island\u2019s economy is to be saved.In an interview on Tuesday, H\u00e9ctor Ferrer, the party president, argued, among other things, that Congress should modify the Jones Act of 1920, which prohibits non-American ships from carrying goods between the island and the mainland, an exclusion that he said pushes up the prices of consumer goods and gasoline.But he also criticized the referendum language, and warned of the cultural losses that would come with statehood. \u201cWe will lose our autonomy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will lose our culture. We will lose our language.\u201dThe crisis has driven some Puerto Ricans into Mr. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s camp. Erick Storer, 36, became a convert to the statehood movement when he was laid off three months ago from his job in the pharmaceutical industry. The sector had thrived here thanks to generous corporate tax breaks created by Congress in 1976.But Congress began phasing out the breaks in 1996, and they disappeared in 2006 \u2014 one reason, experts say, the economy has taken such a hit. With no representation in Congress, residents like Mr. Storer have been left feeling as if they have little say in policy making.\u201cWe\u2019re part of it, and we\u2019re not part of it, and I don\u2019t like that,\u201d said Mr. Storer, who drives for Uber to make ends meet.Others warn that statehood will not be a panacea. Among other things, Puerto Ricans would have to give up their current exemption from federal income tax for income earned in the commonwealth.For some statehood supporters, the slim chance of convincing Congress of their cause is not as important as sending Washington a strong message. \u201cIt\u2019s just so they can hear our voice,\u201d said Marcos D\u00edaz, 46, the owner of a moving company.But there is also fear that the effort and attention being lavished on the referendum will be just one more distraction from the issues the island needs to address, among them corruption, nepotism and the need for a cleareyed economic plan. The last time a status referendum was held, in 2012, 61 percent of voters chose statehood, but the Popular Democratic Party instructed its followers to leave ballots blank, and argued that the end result had little merit.\u201cI personally think it\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d said Gretchen Sierra-Zorita, a consultant who works with a number of Puerto Rico organizations in Washington. \u201cPuerto Rico puts so much emphasis on electing parties and party leaders that represent a status option as opposed to a good-governance option.\u201dSome of that sentiment was echoed last Tuesday afternoon at Yordy\u2019s Mini-Market. A testament to Puerto Ricans\u2019 enduring knack for industry and improvisation, it is part hardware store and part bar, with drinks mixed next to a key-duplicating machine during happy hour.\u201cNeither Republicans nor Democrats want us,\u201d Roberto Reyes Villegas, 50, a carpenter who works for San Juan\u2019s municipal government, said as he drank a Medalla Light beer.Mr. Reyes described himself as a regular voter who was not loyal to any party. But he said he refused to participate in the referendum. It was little more than a distraction, he said, cooked up by what he called the \u201clegisladrones,\u201d or thieving lawmakers, who, he said, have been \u201csucking millions out of Puerto Rico.\u201dMr. Reyes said the austerity plans had not touched his salary or benefits yet. And at age 50, he is taking a philosophical view of what comes next, paraphrasing Einstein\u2019s contention that the distinction between past, present and future was a \u201cstubbornly persistent illusion.\u201dHe knows that the future is a more concrete and perhaps frightening proposition for his 18-year-old son. But his son, Mr. Reyes said, is smart and bilingual. If things get worse, he said, his son would probably just move away.Frances Robles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: How Laws of Physics Govern Growth in Business and in Cities", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byBook EntryThe new book of Geoffrey West, a theoretical physicist, comes with a mouthful of a subtitle that suggests he has unlocked the secrets of human existence \u2014 \u201cScale: The Universal Laws of Growth, Innovation, Sustainability and the Pace of Life in Organisms, Cities, Economies, and Companies\u201d (Penguin).Spoiler alert: He hasn\u2019t. But don\u2019t let this dissuade you from joining him on an enchanting intellectual odyssey.Mr. West\u2019s core argument is that the basic mathematical laws of physics governing growth in the physical world apply equally to biological, political and corporate organisms. On its face, his book\u2019s objective is to contribute to an overarching behavioral science of what it calls \u201chighly complex systems.\u201dBut the book is also a satisfying personal and professional memoir of a distinguished scientist whose life\u2019s work came to be preoccupied with finding ways to break down traditional boundaries between disciplines to solve the long-term global challenges of sustainability.The central observation of \u201cScale\u201d is that a wide variety of complex systems respond similarly to increases in size. Mr. West demonstrates that these similarities reflect the structural nature of the networks that undergird these systems. The book identifies three core common characteristics of the hierarchal networks that deliver energy to these organisms \u2014 whether the diverse circulatory systems that power all forms of animal life or the water and electrical networks that power cities.First, the networks are \u201cspace filling\u201d \u2014 that is, they service the entire organism. Second, the terminal units are largely identical, whether they are the capillaries in our bodies or the faucets and electrical outlets in our homes. Third, a kind of natural selection process operates within these networks so that they are optimized.These shared network qualities explain why when an organism doubles in size, an astonishing range of characteristics, from food consumption to general metabolic rate, grow something less than twice as fast \u2014 they scale \u201csublinearly.\u201d What\u2019s more, \u201cScale\u201d shows why the precise mathematical factor by which these efficiencies manifest themselves almost always relate to \u201cthe magic No. 4.\u201dMr. West also provides an elegant explanation of why living organisms have a natural limit to growth and life span following a predictable curve, as an increasing proportion of energy consumed is required for maintenance and less is available to fuel further expansion.When he turns to cities, Mr. West shows that infrastructure growth scales in analogous sublinear fashion. Hence, the number of gas stations or length of roads needed when a city doubles its size reflects similar economies of scale. But relevant socioeconomic qualities actually scale superlinearly by the same factor. And while it is good news that large cities produce higher wages and more patents per inhabitant, they also generate relatively greater crime and disease. This conundrum is at the heart of Mr. West\u2019s sustainability concerns. Theoretically, unbounded growth of cities generated by superlinear scaling \u201cif left unchecked, potentially sow[s] the seeds of their inevitable collapse.\u201dDespite his reliance on the analysis of huge troves of data to develop and support his theories, in the concluding chapters, Mr. West makes a compelling argument against the \u201carrogance and narcissism\u201d reflected in the growing fetishization of \u201cbig data\u201d in itself. \u201cData for data\u2019s sake,\u201d he argues, \u201cor the mindless gathering of big data, without any conceptual framework for organizing and understanding it, may actually be bad or even dangerous.\u201dIn presenting his own provocative and fascinating conceptual framework, Mr. West manages to deliver a lot of theory and history accessibly and entertainingly. Yet it is not clear whether that framework is robust enough to be applied productively to the business realm as he attempts to do.Mr. West concedes early on that the strength of mathematical correlations on which he relies decreases as he moves from the biological to the urban to the corporate. Until relatively recently, Mr. West was unable to get funding to access a database of historical corporate information. At one point during the book, he actually seems to blame this challenge for the particularly thin results in this domain. The problems with his analysis of the business sector, however, may be more systemic.First, it is at least questionable whether the constantly shifting hierarchal network structures of corporate organizations are consistent with the three fundamental characteristics of networks upon which his framework is based. Notably, a wide range of behavioral economics research, grounded in the pioneering work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, suggests that the optimization requirement is not likely to be met.Furthermore, the consistent \u201cdecay\u201d rates of corporations identified by Mr. West \u2014 calculated by the longevity of independent public corporations over time \u2014 does not correspond to any consistent change in underlying activity analogous to \u201cdeath\u201d in living organisms. Even in the context of bankruptcy, which Mr. West looks at separately from corporate \u201cdeath\u201d from mergers and acquisitions, good businesses with bad capital structures often continue \u201clife\u201d under new corporate form. It is not evident how meaningful mathematical calculations could be that treat such situations the same as failed businesses that are simply liquidated in bankruptcy for scrap value.That \u201cScale\u201d fails to realize the full promise of its title does not diminish the magnitude of its actual contribution and insight. In the 16th century, Francois Rabelais, a French scholar, admonished that \u201cscience without conscience is the ruin of the soul.\u201dMr. West\u2019s warning that big data without a theoretical framework is the ruin of science is an important contemporary corollary caution that \u201cScale\u201d will hopefully establish for the next generation of scholars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Weirdly Calm. Here\u2019s a Theory of Why.", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsWhen Donald J. Trump won the presidency in November, one bet seemed like a sure thing: We were in for a volatile few years. And in Washington, that forecast has come true. This unconventional presidency is creating an avalanche of uncertainty in areas including global trade, taxes and health care.But on Wall Street, these are the quietest of times. Prices for stocks and many other assets are less volatile than at any time since before the global financial crisis a decade ago, and volatility is, by some measures, near record lows.Consider this: In 2015, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index moved by more than 1 percent on 29 percent of trading days. Last year that fell to 19 percent. So far in 2017, there has been a 1 percent or greater swing in the market in only three trading sessions, or 3.5 percent.This sense of calm would be notable in any event, but the contrast with the sheer variance in the policy world makes it particularly unusual. In a single week, the Trump administration might flirt with exiting the North American Free Trade Agreement, roll out an outline for a multitrillion dollar tax cut and push legislation that would overhaul the health care sector, one-sixth of the United States economy.But while they do a good job of indicating why indexes like the Vix are so low, these technical explanations are less effective at explaining why the actual fluctuations in markets have been so subdued \u2014 realized volatility, to use the traders\u2019 term, as opposed to expected volatility.Something is causing the shares of the most widely owned companies to jump around less than they almost always have in the past. And they also don\u2019t do a great job of explaining why many other markets have also become less volatile than in the recent past, including international stocks, currencies and bonds.Dating to the 2008 financial crisis, markets have swung on every hint of news out of world capitals \u2014 Washington, especially, but also Berlin and Tokyo and Beijing \u2014 because the very future of the global economy seemed to hang in the balance. From the financial crisis to the eurozone crisis to the efforts by Japan to reflate its economy to the effort by China to deleverage its economy, the policies set by central banks and national governments were the prime mover of investor sentiment and the global outlook.Those days are over, at least for the moment. In normal times, markets are driven much less by what governments do and much more by, well, the economic fundamentals. How many people are working, with what level of productivity and savings levels, and what are the resulting economic growth rates, levels of corporate profitability, and interest rates?After all, the assets of those major companies \u2014 Exxon Mobil\u2019s oil rigs and Google\u2019s search algorithm and all the rest \u2014 don\u2019t really change from day to day. All that changes is investor perception about what kind of cash those assets will generate in the future. Isn\u2019t it actually fairly rare that a piece of news should change the fundamental outlook by that much?What makes this moment unusual is that there really are policy choices in play that could have hugely distortive effects on those fundamentals: what happens to trade policy, taxes and health care in the United States; what terms Britain achieves in its exit from the European Union; even whether the E.U. as we know it survives.But if the last few years have taught investors anything, it is that those with a hair-trigger reaction to political news stand to lose, while those who bet on a continued steady and unexceptional expansion will win.You see a bit of that in how subsequent conflicts over United States fiscal policy during the Obama years generated less market volatility. The debt ceiling standoff of 2011 generated huge market swings as traders bet on the risk of a default; the standoffs over the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d at the end of 2012 and a government shutdown in October 2013 caused mere murmurs.Investors learned a lesson that it\u2019s easy to overreact to political developments, and the same seems to have happened globally in the last several months.The risk, of course, is that this generates complacency.Low volatility could make banks, hedge funds and other institutions more comfortable taking on extra leverage, paradoxically making the financial system less stable and more subject to large swings over time.And perhaps most worrisome, sometimes big financial market moves are the mechanism by which policy makers receive the signal that they\u2019re doing the wrong thing. We saw that again and again in the global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis, when it was big market swings that got governments\u2019 attention.So the biggest risk of this period of ultralow volatility is that by looking past the latest headlines out of world capitals, investors won\u2019t send the signals that might prevent political leaders from making a mistake in the first place.Advertisement"}

Mr. Mulvaney argued that this didn\u2019t count as a cut since it still allocated \u201cmore money year on year\u201d for Medicaid.Government spending would be cut substantially. See how every budget item would be changed.While \u201cthere\u2019s a lot to like in the president\u2019s budget,\u201d Representative Bill Johnson, Republican of Ohio, said he did not support the proposal to gut the commission, which he called \u201ccritically important to the people of eastern and southeastern Ohio.\u201dJustifying a $191 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, which provides food stamps for households with low incomes, Mr. Mulvaney suggested a work requirement for \u201cable-bodied\u201d adults to receive benefits.Of recipients who can work, many do \u2014 or at least want to. About 30 percent of adults were employed, and 27 percent were looking for work. Of the remaining 43 percent, it\u2019s unclear how many have disabilities.Over all, 32 percent of food stamp households had earnings, and 44 percent of participants lived in households with one person working. SNAP participation remains high, in part, because while unemployment has declined since the recession, wages have not risen.Asked by Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, about the $72 billion cut to the safety net for disabled workers, Mr. Mulvaney replied, \u201cThis is how I explained Social Security Disability Insurance, Mrs. Schakowsky, which is that we also propose a paid parental leave program.\u201dThe Trump administration on Tuesday released its 2018 budget, called \u201cA New Foundation for American Greatness.\u201dThis claim distorts how the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a nonprofit that funds PBS and NPR stations, operates and its relationship to \u201cSesame Street.\u201d Singling out the Jim Henson Company, which created the \u201cSesame Street\u201d characters, Mr. Mulvaney said, \u201cWhen I do go to that family in Grand Rapids and say, \u2018Look, is this what you want your money to go to?\u2019 I think they might tell me no, that maybe they can afford to do it without us.\u201dFurthermore, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting actually spends much less on programming (about 24 percent) than it does on directly funding public television and radio stations (66 percent).

Now he has eight. His father-in-law, Alfredo Torres, owns Puerto Rico\u2019s oldest bookstore, but it has been going downhill for two years.\u201cThe government is bankrupt,\u201d said Bernardo Rivera, 75, a private bus driver who sometimes earns only $40 all day. \u201cEveryone is bankrupt. There is nothing left. People who do not have jobs do not take the bus to work.\u201dJust days after a May Day strike sent tens of thousands of people to the streets in a protest that turned violent, people gathered at work, in parks and their homes in never-ending debates over the uncertainties. At the R\u00edo Piedras terminal where Mr. Rivera works, the drivers and cleaning crews huddled to gripe about waning business and pensions, as well as ever-rising fees and water and electricity bills.Although the move on Wednesday was hardly a surprise, it left a sense of gloom and anxiety here, as civil servants question whether their pensions will ever be paid and private companies suffer the consequences of the brutal domino effect that results when taxes rise, salaries drop and the middle class takes off on a mass exodus for Florida.\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here, even if I make only $1,\u201d Mr. Rivera said.The government plans sweeping austerity measures in the coming months that will hit teachers especially hard. On Friday, Puerto Rico\u2019s education secretary announced a proposal to close 184 schools. Teachers may see their hours trimmed by two days a month.So while the government seeks protection from lawsuits from the hedge funds and other financial firms that invested in Puerto Rico\u2019s risky debt, residents of this United States territory are taking the squeeze. Fines for parking and other traffic violations have doubled. Dozens of government agencies are on the chopping block, while perks like the annual Christmas bonus and pay for unused sick time make for wistful memories.\u201cAt some point I will have to decide whether I live in a house, or with medical insurance,\u201d said Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, 55, a retired electronics teacher. \u201cAnd the food?\u201d he said, letting the thought trail off.His pension is about $1,900 a month, of which $556 goes to pay his family\u2019s medical plan.Gov. Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3, who took office in January, acknowledged that low-income people without access to health care and parents with children in public schools would be the most vulnerable in the months ahead.\u201cThere has to be sacrifice everywhere,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe have been very clear about what that sacrifice is.\u201dThe last two administrations cut tens of thousands of positions from public payrolls, and now Mr. Rossell\u00f3 has vowed to make \u201cstrategic cuts\u201d that do not cause layoffs but put the government in a position to better negotiate with its creditors. Among the ideas is to cut government pensions by 10 percent, which will hurt retired police officers and teachers most, because they do not receive Social Security benefits.Creditors were unimpressed, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said.\u201cThey don\u2019t think that fiscal plan is appropriate; they think they should get more money and that the people of Puerto Rico should get less,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, my position is I am completely against that, and I will protect the people of Puerto Rico over anything.\u201dWhen he took office, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said his first task was to determine \u201chow deep the rabbit hole went.\u201d He expected a $3 billion deficit, and instead found a deficit of $7.5 billion.\u201cWhat was happening in Puerto Rico is the definition of a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he said.Roberto Pag\u00e1n, vice president of the Puerto Rico chapter of the Service Employees International Union, said he expected that up to 400,000 people would lose health plans because they will not be able to afford it. Public services like filing a child abuse complaint will probably go unattended.\u201cIn this fiscal plan, we see proposals that are very optimistic and hardly realistic,\u201d Mr. Pag\u00e1n said.Mr. Domenech, 50, the general contractor, who lives in Aguadilla in western Puerto Rico, said he had no idea where people like him stood in the new Puerto Rican reality. With the government owing huge sums to credit unions and companies like Microsoft, hedge funds and gasoline suppliers, where do his unpaid bills fit in?Not only are his savings tied up in Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds, but his contracting business also went under, he said, largely because the government did not pay the invoices on an airport renovation project that dragged on and went over budget.\u201cThey left me with no money,\u201d Mr. Domenech said. \u201cI feel frustrated and helpless.\u201dHe has thought about moving to Canada.His father-in-law, Mr. Torres, 63, owns Librer\u00eda La Tertulia, the island\u2019s oldest book store, which depends on the disposable income of students and professors at the University of Puerto Rico\u2019s campus in R\u00edo Piedras. But students protesting severe budget cuts have been on strike for over a month, and the store\u2019s profits dipped up to 70 percent this semester, Mr. Torres said.\u201cIt\u2019s not just me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pharmacy, it\u2019s the grocery store.\u201dHe said that it would be easy for him to blame the slow foot traffic on the student strike but that he looks at the deteriorating urban core around him and blames decades of neglect that pushed more people to suburban shopping malls and still others off the island altogether. The boarded storefronts at Paseo de Diego, a nearby pedestrian mall, underscore his point.\u201cA lot of this is perception, but it\u2019s real,\u201d he said. \u201cGo walk around the plaza.\u201dData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that Puerto Rico\u2019s work force dropped by about 300,000 in the past decade, said Carlos J.

Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez, 53, has spent 30 years sweeping the streets of San Juan, but with the cuts coming to pensions, he estimates that he will have to stay on the job until he is at least 70.\u201cThe fiscal board making all the decisions is going to take it all from us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to.\u201dBoth of Iris D.

{"Headline": "The Wrong Way to Fix Student Debt", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewTens of millions of Americans together owe more than a trillion dollars in student debt. For the financial health of their households and the entire economy, ensuring a fair and smoothly functioning student loan system is critically important.But with a series of regulatory changes, the Trump administration is taking us in the wrong direction, making student loans riskier, more expensive and more burdensome for borrowers.First, the Education Department has weakened accountability for the companies that administer student loans. Second, it has made it more difficult for borrowers to apply for, and stay enrolled in, income-based payment plans. Third, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, has given banks more leeway to charge borrowers high fees \u2014 as much as 16 percent of the balance owed \u2014 if they fall behind.Federal Student Aid, the agency within the Education Department that oversees student loans, outsources loan servicing to private companies. The largest of them is Navient, formerly a part of Sallie Mae. Companies like Navient are the face of the student loan system, and often the source of enormous frustration for borrowers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has documented thousands of cases in which loan companies have misdirected payments, lost paperwork and charged the wrong interest rate on loans.Federal Student Aid allocates business to contractors based on their collection performance, using outcome-based metrics like the default rate on the loans they handle. But the agency did not consider whether a contractor had engaged in illegal behavior until the Obama administration directed it to do so.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has protested this turnabout, stating that borrowers deserve to be protected from illegal actions.When government regulation stifles innovation, it should be pared back. That is not the case here. Borrowers can\u2019t vote with their dollars by shifting their loans to a company that provides better service. Rather, they are locked in with the contractor assigned to them by the Education Department; if the government does not monitor these companies, borrowers are at risk.Income-based repayment plans allow borrowers to pay what they can afford by setting their payments as a percentage of their income. Expanding access to these plans, which are intended to reduce borrower distress and default, was a priority of the Obama administration.These programs require borrowers to document their income, using information from the Internal Revenue Service. The complexity of this part of the application process has frequently tripped up borrowers, keeping them from enrolling and remaining in income-based plans.The I.R.S. Data Retrieval Tool, established in 2009, enabled borrowers to direct their tax data to loan servicers. This eased the process of applying for both income-based repayment and completing the Free Application for Student Aid (known as the Fafsa), which is the gateway to federal and state aid.After a week, the agencies jointly released a statement explaining what they had done, and in late March, announced that the tool would remain out of commission until at least October.The Obama administration had limited the ability of loan companies to impose punitive fees on borrowers who were in default. Before the Obama rules went into effect, borrowers could be required to pay back as much as 16 percent of their loan balance before they were allowed to enroll in an income-based program. On March 16, Ms. DeVos issued a directive that allows loan companies to again charge these fees.If the Education Department fails to protect and assist borrowers, where can they turn for help? During the Obama administration, other agencies stepped in to monitor the behavior of the loan servicers and banks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in particular, appointed a student loan \u201cczar,\u201d who has collected thousands of complaints from borrowers and has published an annual report on student loans.This is unfortunate. Dismantling the regulation of loan companies isn\u2019t likely to unleash an innovative, private market that will improve services for borrowers, who have been assigned to a loan company and can\u2019t shift to a better one. There is therefore no market discipline that will drive the bad companies out of business.Deregulation, in this case, simply leaves borrowers at the mercy of an unaccountable corporate bureaucracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Myanmar, a Lake That Sustained Generations Feels Strains", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byIndawgyi Lake JournalLONTON, Myanmar \u2014 Cresting a mountain pass on a freshly bulldozed road, Indawgyi Lake and its valley appear below, pastoral and calm.The 300-square-mile surface, one of the largest freshwater bodies in Southeast Asia, reflects the clouds. A plaid quilt of rice paddies is squeezed between the water and jungled mountains. Widely spaced hamlets dot the shores.Besides a few spindly cellphone towers, there are few signs of the globalization swamping Myanmar as the nation opens itself after half a century of isolation under a military dictatorship.For centuries, the indigenous Kachin people here in Myanmar\u2019s remote north planted rice when the lake flooded their fields during the monsoon, fished its waters and hunted its wetlands and the surrounding mountains. As Ma Thwe Thwe Win, 32, a local birding guide, explained: \u201cThe lake gives us fish, waters our fields, and brings the birds here. It is everything to my people.\u201dToday, every morning and afternoon, fishermen still paddle out, singing Burmese songs, trailing gillnets with soda bottle buoys. But despite the encircling mountains and buffering remoteness, Indawgyi Lake is straining under many of the same environmental and conflict-related challenges that are stressing the fragile nation.In the mid-1990s, Myanmar\u2019s army captured the Hpakant jadeite mine, the world\u2019s richest, from the Kachin Independence Army, a rebel force of around 10,000 men, about 35 miles north of Indawgyi Lake. The mine was mechanized and expanded, and soon many of Indawgyi\u2019s inhabitants had traded their native villages for squalid mining camps where heroin addiction ran rampant. Increasing commercialization of the region\u2019s economy also led to the expansion of illegal gold mines in the mountains above Indawgyi Lake.At about the same time, young men from other regions of Myanmar began to flood into the valley as their elder brothers inherited what land remained in their hometowns and an ill-conceived dam flooded prime farmland nearby. These migrants established five villages and introduced fishing techniques like small-gauge gillnets and electroshock fishing that began depleting the lake\u2019s fish stocks.Another kind of visitor also appeared: foreign tourists, seeking the peace of rural life or a glimpse of rare migratory lake birds. Adventurous souls would ride the colonial-era train north from Mandalay and then bump over the mountains on the back of motorbike taxis to the tiny town of Lonton, a row of lakeside teak houses on stilts sheltering about 2,800 inhabitants.But then in 2011, a cease-fire broke down, and the army occupied the valley while the K.I.A. locked down the highlands. Today, on the outskirts of town, peasants riding ox carts and dump trucks heading to Hpakant line up at candy-cane striped sawhorses wrapped in barbed wire. Machine-gun-wielding soldiers wave the traffic through after inspecting it, as European backpackers in jean shorts and flip-flops lounge at the town\u2019s four food stalls across the road.Most foreigners visit Inn Chit Thu, a nonprofit ecotourism group, the only tourist-centered business in town beside the guesthouses. From an office decorated with the mounted plumage of two owls, young workers rent out kayaks and bicycles.If fighting is low, as it has been recently, they lead treks into the safe parts of the mountains. They also offer bird-watching tours to see the rare Pallas\u2019s fish-eagles, Oriental darters and sarus cranes.In addition to the international tourists, 80,000 pilgrims camp on the lake\u2019s shores during the annual festival at the \u201cfloating\u201d Shwemyitzu Pagoda, which is said to contain several of the Buddha\u2019s hairs. They summon Hitchcockian swarms of sea gulls with confetti showers of bread crumbs.Their goal is to accumulate Buddhist merit, which could help them avoid reincarnation as such an animal.Just a few miles south of Lonton, the town of Maing Naung straddles Khaung Tong Creek. A decade ago, the waterway coursed pristinely into Indawgyi Lake, but it has since become choked with mud and chemicals from an illegal hydraulic K.I.A. gold mine.Elevated mercury levels and increased sedimentation make some environmentalists fear that the distinctive ecosystem is at risk. Other problems threaten the watershed too. Illegal logging is thinning the forests that once protected hillsides from eroding into the lake. Overfishing and the use of banned techniques like dynamite, cyanide and electroshock fishing have depleted fisheries that many locals depend on.\u201cThe ecology of Indawgyi Lake has been severely impacted by silt and mercury pollution from mining and overfishing, so much that it\u2019s become hard for the local fishers to make a living,\u201d said Oliver Springate-Baginski, a professor at the University of East Anglia who has led an environmental survey of the area.He added, \u201cThe conflict has undermined the effectiveness of regulatory mechanisms, and powerful people have been able to exploit the natural resources at the expense of less influential locals.\u201dNongovernmental organizations, local fishermen and the government are working to address the problems.\u201cNow the lake\u2019s communities, with assistance from NGOs, have established fishing-free zones that have been recognized by the government,\u201d said Julia Fogerite, a Myanmar-based environmental researcher.Despite the nation\u2019s tropical latitude, the mountain elevation chilled the air on a recent night. The inhabitants of Lonton huddled around fires by the roadside, listening to the night frogs as they had in the old days. The asphalt road to Hpakant lay empty, though during the day it was packed with dump trucks and motorcyclists, as the K.I.A. roamed beyond the checkpoints after sunset.Not long ago, mahouts prodded their working elephants to help push trucks free of muddy quagmires on the road. Today, the only unpaved section is in the mountains above \u2014 and when it is completed this year, it will allow the outside world even freer access to Indawgyi Lake.Inside a nearby house, an old boat captain watched DVDs of traditional Indawgyi dances that now are spotted only at festivals. He poured himself shot after shot of whiskey. Each time the short clip finished, he queued it up again.This article was written with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Advertisement"}

Around 10,000 people turn 65 every day in the United States, and by 2030, there will be 72 million people over 65 nationwide.Some 43 million people already provide care to family members \u2014 either their own parents or children \u2014 according to AARP, and half of them are \u201csandwich generation\u201d women, ages 40 to 60.

They carry out tasks or help their customers complete the relatively mundane activities of everyday life, and just need to be able to handle the sometimes physical aspects of the job, like pushing a wheelchair.Medical care is left to medical professionals. Instead, concierges help out around the house, get their client to appointments, join them for recreation, and run small errands.While precise statistics are not available for the elder concierge industry, other on-demand industries have flourished, and baby boomers are a fast-growing worker population.Ms. LeaMond noted that while people like the extra cash, they also appreciate the \u201cextra engagement.\u201dA variety of companies has sprung up, each fulfilling a different niche in the elder concierge economy.The company was founded by Mitch Besser, a doctor whose previous work involved putting H.I.V.-positive women together in mentoring relationships. AgeWell employees come from the same communities as their clients, some of whom are out of reach of medical professionals until an emergency.The goal is to provide consistent monitoring to reduce or eliminate full-blown crises. AgeWell began in South Africa but recently got a grant to start a peer-to-peer companionship and wellness program in New York.The typical Envoy employee works a few hours a week, so it won\u2019t replace the earnings from a full-time job. But it nevertheless involves more interpersonal contact than simply standing behind a store counter.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to pay the rent,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cThey want to be flexible but also make a difference.\u201dKatleen Bouchard, 69, signed up with Envoy three years ago, after retiring from an advertising career. She gets $20 an hour working a handful of hours a week with older clients in her rural community in Sonoma County, Calif. She sees it as a chance to be civic-minded. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to help and be of service,\u201d Ms. Bouchard said.Companies like AgeWell and Envoy are part of the growing on-demand economy, where flexibility and entrepreneurship have combined to create a new class of workers, said Mary Furlong, a Silicon Valley consultant who specializes in the job market for baby boomers. At the same time, many retirees \u2014 as well as those on the cusp of retirement \u2014 worry that market volatility may hit their savings.The extra income from the job, Ms. Furlong said, could help cover unexpected expenses. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the shocks are going to be that interrupt your plan,\u201d she added.Other organizations are looking to help direct older residents to vetted local service providers.The council already works with volunteers and small businesses in 25 cities to make referrals for things like home repair and remodeling, daily money management and legal issues.In the Village to Village Network model, residents pay an annual fee, from about $400 to $700 for individuals and more for households. The organization so far has 25,000 members in 190 member-run communities across the United States, and is forming similar groups overseas as well.\u201cWe feel like we are creating a new occupation,\u201d said Marty Bell, the National Aging in Place Council\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s really needed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Moves to Stabilize Currency, Despite Promise to Loosen Control", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byLate Friday afternoon, however, the Chinese government said, in effect, \u201cnever mind.\u201dBut a move with the currency, the renminbi, would signal that China was retreating from promises it made to the world in recent years to open up its financial system \u2014 and many economists say China needs to do that if it wants to continue to grow at a healthy, sustainable pace.The China Foreign Exchange Trade System, which is controlled by the central bank, said it might change the way it sets a value each morning around which the country\u2019s currency is allowed to fluctuate through the day.On Friday, the government said it was considering introducing a \u201ccountercyclical variable.\u201d A better name might be \u201cfudge factor.\u201d It means that the government would no longer have to follow the previous day\u2019s closing price in setting that day\u2019s benchmark.China does not disclose much about the inner workings of its currency, but some variation of the policy may already be in place. The currency has already settled into trading range at or just below 6.9 to the United States dollar, just below the psychologically important level of 7 to the dollar.Many Wall Street analysts say the currency should be a bit weaker, though they disagree on the degree. More broadly, many say the renminbi is now closer to its true value than it was in earlier years, when Beijing faced deep pressure from the United States and others to more fairly value the currency.China\u2019s financial regulators generally do not announce they are considering a shift in something as essential as the value of the currency unless they have already approved it, so the announcement on Friday was widely viewed as a signal to financial institutions, corporations and investors that change was on the way.For economists and investors, the change would probably bring stability to the currency, at least in the short term. Among the losers, assuming China kept the currency at current rates, would be Chinese manufacturers, who benefit in foreign markets when the currency weakens.The Chinese government contended that the winners would be Chinese companies and households. Their assets are less likely to rise and fall quickly with ups and downs in financial markets.The currency rule change could also reassure the public that the government was firmly in control. In recent weeks, Chinese efforts to rein in some frothy lending caused turbulence in China\u2019s financial markets. President Xi Jinping recently urged the country\u2019s financial regulators to focus on stability.The Trump administration would most likely also be pleased, because although the rule change would amount to Chinese currency manipulation, it would keep China\u2019s currency from weakening. If the renminbi weakened further, it could help Chinese exporters at the expense of American manufacturers.But the change marks a big step back from China\u2019s goal of turning the renminbi into an international currency like the dollar and the euro. Global investors want their currencies to move predictably along with financial markets, not based on decisions made behind closed doors.More broadly, it signals that China is not in a hurry to lower its financial barriers with the rest of the world. Those barriers create long-term imbalances that could rattle the global economy if they became severe enough.But the fund most likely would not publicly chastise China if it changed its currency rules. The organization\u2019s general stance has been that China is now such a large player in the world economy, and particularly in global trade, that to ignore its currency would be a mistake.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hundreds of Thousands Strike in Greece as Cuts Near Approval", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of Greeks walked off the job on Wednesday, heeding the call of labor unions to join a 24-hour general strike to protest a new round of austerity measures nearing approval in Parliament.Greece has been struggling for years to dig its way out of an economic crisis, and even though there has been progress, unemployment is at 23 percent and the country is largely dependent on outside help.Demonstrations were held in Athens and in other major cities, including Thessaloniki, Patras and Iraklio, against the new round of belt-tightening, which calls for pension cuts starting in 2019 and tax increases beginning in 2020 that together would save about 5 billion euros, or $5.5 billion.In a statement, the Greek civil servants\u2019 union, Adedy, called the austerity measures \u201cbarbaric.\u201d It decried what it called the \u201clooting of wages and pensions\u201d and a \u201csellout\u201d of state assets, referring to plans to privatize the power board and other public bodies.\u201cThe memorandums have consciously crushed small- and medium-size businesses,\u201d Thanos Vasilopoulos of Greece\u2019s private sector union, GSEE, told the radio station Sto Kokkino on Wednesday, referring to three foreign bailouts that successive governments have agreed to since 2010. \u201cBasically, they have created an army of 1.5 million unemployed.\u201dThe protests were mostly peaceful, although a group of around 20 hooded youths in Athens broke away from a crowd and hurled stones and flares at riot police officers.As is usually the case, only a small fraction of those on strike joined protests in the street. About 12,000 people gathered in the Greek capital, according to police estimates, a small turnout compared with previous rallies, reflecting public fatigue after years of strikes and demonstrations.Although some members of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government have expressed opposition to the measures, coalition lawmakers are expected to approve them in a parliamentary vote on Thursday.In an effort to win over wavering lawmakers and to placate a public weary of seven years of austerity, the government has also prepared legislation that would introduce some so-called countermeasures, including social benefits for the poor.With Greeks taking to the streets, the government is hoping to secure parliamentary approval before the country\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, meets his eurozone counterparts at a meeting in Brussels on Monday.Officials at the meeting are expected to sign off on the release of around \u20ac7 billion that Greece needs to meet debt obligations due in July. They are also scheduled to discuss relief for Greece\u2019s huge debt burden, which is equivalent to nearly 180 percent of gross domestic product.The fiscal discipline has improved the country\u2019s finances, but it has left one in four Greeks unemployed and cut household incomes by a third, and the ratio of the country\u2019s debt to its gross domestic product is the highest in the eurozone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ways That the 2016 Election Was Perfectly Normal", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byLoyalty to PartyIn actuality, the state of the nation\u2019s economy \u2014 growing slowly \u2014 was predicting a very close election in 2016: a contest that either party could win.For all of the exceptionalism of 2016, the outcome was remarkably typical. The final vote share was very close, as the low growth rate and lack of an incumbent suggested it would be.Self-described Democrats, including those who lean just a little bit toward the party, almost always vote for the Democrat, and the same pattern applies for Republicans and Republican leaners. Partisans did not shy away from their party nominee in 2016 any more than they have in recent years. But in the past, some moves away from party have been pronounced.For Democrats, the pattern has been more dynamic. The party\u2019s presidential candidates between 1952 and 1980 didn\u2019t engender the same level of loyalty from Democrats, largely because of regional differences in rates of support. Southerners were less supportive of the nominee than Northerners in the years before and after the party\u2019s passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. But by the 1990s, Democratic candidates were securing the support of roughly 90 percent of Democrats. This loyalty has persisted in both parties in every presidential election since.In 2016, according to the A.N.E.S., roughly 92 percent of Democrats voted for Mrs. Clinton, and about 92 percent of Republicans voted for Mr. Trump. This is down just 1 percent in each party from 2012. Even when party identification is measured a year before the election \u2014 in 2015 \u2014 as it was in the RAND Presidential Election Panel Survey, the rates of in-party voting remained in the 90 percent range.This pattern of support raises many compelling questions for those who study politics. Has the party label become an efficient shortcut for voters, helping them decide which candidates best meet their priorities and goals? Or is support for a party more like support for a favorite sports team, devoid of any content other than entertainment, drama and identity? The truth is probably a mix of the two, but figuring out how much of party loyalty is purely cheering for your team and how much is rooted in policy views is a tough task.What\u2019s more clear is that the election was always predicted to be close based on things we know historically shape outcomes. Mr. Trump was atypical; voters were not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Prepare for an Automated Future", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byRobot RevolutionThe logical response seems to be to educate people differently, so they\u2019re prepared to work alongside the robots or do the jobs that machines can\u2019t. But how to do that, and whether training can outpace automation, are open questions.How do we educate people for an automated world?At universities, \u201cpeople learn how to approach new things, ask questions and find answers, deal with new situations,\u201d wrote Uta Russmann, a professor of communications at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna. \u201cAll this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life. Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job.\u201dSchools will also need to teach traits that machines can\u2019t yet easily replicate, like creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, adaptability and collaboration. The problem, many respondents said, is that these are not necessarily easy to teach.\u201cMany of the \u2018skills\u2019 that will be needed are more like personality characteristics, like curiosity, or social skills that require enculturation to take hold,\u201d wrote Stowe Boyd, managing director of Another Voice, which provides research on the new economy.Can we change education fast enough to outpace the machines? About two-thirds of the respondents thought it could be done in the next decade; the rest thought that education reform takes too much time, money and political will, and that automation is moving too quickly.\u201cI have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps,\u201d wrote Danah Boyd, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research and founder of Data and Society, a research institute. \u201cI have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socioeconomic factors that are underpinning skill training.\u201dAndrew Walls, managing vice president at Gartner, wrote, \u201cBarring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation, there will be no quantum leap in our ability to \u2018up-skill\u2019 people.\u201dWill college degrees still be important? \u201cHuman bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion, empathy, vulnerability and social-emotional intelligence,\u201d said Frank Elavsky, data and policy analyst at Acumen, a policy research firm.But many survey respondents said a degree was not enough \u2014 or not always the best choice, especially given its price tag. Many of them expect more emphasis on certificates or badges, earned from online courses or workshops, even for college graduates.One potential future, said David Karger, a professor of computer science at M.I.T., would be for faculty at top universities to teach online and for mid-tier universities to \u201cconsist entirely of a cadre of teaching assistants who provide support for the students.\u201dEmployers will also place more value on on-the-job learning, many respondents said, such as apprenticeships or on-demand trainings at workplaces. Portfolios of work are becoming more important than r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\u201cR\u00e9sum\u00e9s simply are too two-dimensional to properly communicate someone\u2019s skill set,\u201d wrote Meryl Krieger, a career specialist at Indiana University. \u201cThree-dimensional materials \u2014 in essence, job reels that demonstrate expertise \u2014 will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker\u2019s skills.\u201dWhat can workers do now to prepare? Consider it part of your job description to keep learning, many respondents said \u2014 learn new skills on the job, take classes, teach yourself new things.Focus on learning how to do tasks that still need humans, said Judith Donath of Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society: teaching and caregiving; building and repairing; and researching and evaluating.The problem is that not everyone is cut out for independent learning, which takes a lot of drive and discipline. People who are suited for it tend to come from privileged backgrounds, with a good education and supportive parents, said Beth Corzo-Duchardt, a media historian at Muhlenberg College. \u201cThe fact that a high degree of self-direction may be required in the new work force means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future,\u201d she said.Even if we do all these things, will there be enough jobs?Jonathan Grudin, a principal researcher at Microsoft, said he was optimistic about the future of work as long as people learned technological skills: \u201cPeople will create the jobs of the future, not simply train for them, and technology is already central.\u201dBut the third of respondents who were pessimistic about the future of education reform said it won\u2019t matter if there are no jobs to train for.\u201cThe \u2018jobs of the future\u2019 are likely to be performed by robots,\u201d said Nathaniel Borenstein, chief scientist at Mimecast, an email company. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t how to train people for nonexistent jobs.

{"Headline": "In a Fight for Land, a Women\u2019s Movement Shakes Morocco", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byOULAD SEBATA, Morocco \u2014 For most of her life, Saida Soukat\u2019s days were filled with the routines of the farm, working the fields and minding the cattle. A recent Tuesday found her doing something far different, though, speaking before a group of women during their biweekly protests to demand a halt in the state-sanctioned privatization of traditional tribal collectives, called the Sulaliyyate lands.\u201cOne foot up, one foot down. For my land, my blood will shed,\u201d she chanted in a megaphone.\u201cThis is really the first movement that is shaking the patriarchal foundation of the society,\u201d says Zakia Salime, an associate professor at Rutgers University who has extensively studied the movement. \u201cThey are saying no, you cannot give land to men, and they are asking also that, in case you privatize the land, we need to have our equal share.\u201dThis is all happening against a backdrop of economic and social change in Morocco that figures prominently in the women\u2019s movement.After King Mohammed VI succeeded his father in 1999, one of his hallmark achievements was the promotion of women\u2019s rights, as the country has tried to position itself as a regional leader. In 2004, a new family code guaranteed women more rights in marriage and divorce, raising the minimum age for marriage and restricting polygamy.In 2011, after the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, the country adopted a new Constitution that established gender equality. Even so, women\u2019s rights advocates say, women are significantly absent from the work force and, in legal matters, often at a strong disadvantage to men.About 35 percent of Morocco\u2019s land is designated as Sulaliyyate, the Interior Ministry says. In 1919, while Morocco was still a French protectorate, management of the land was transferred to the ministry from the tribal authorities, with the idea of discouraging migration from rural areas to the cities.Under this system, while people did not own the land, they were given the right to work designated plots and take their share of the harvest. Shares in the communal lands could be passed only from fathers to sons older than 16.According to tribal law, single women, widows, divorc\u00e9es and those without sons could not inherit the land, which meant that the state could confiscate it without compensation. Over the years, thousands of women \u2014 no one really knows how many \u2014 were forced from their homes and into slums in surrounding towns and cities.The nationwide movement began in 2007 when a woman in the city of Kenitra, close to the capital, Rabat, demanded equality in land ownership.Saida Idrissi, the president of the Rabat bureau of the Moroccan Association for Women\u2019s Rights, helped the women to organize, training them in constitutional law and guiding them in negotiations with the Interior Ministry.\u201cMost of them are illiterate women from the rural world who were scared to talk, so we had to put in place a strategy very specific to this category of women,\u201d she said.Soon after, women living on these parcels began organizing, and in 2009 about 500 from all over the country protested in front of Parliament to demand equal rights to ownership, and compensation if land was expropriated. Since then, hundreds have joined the movement.In response, the Interior Ministry has issued several circulars stating that women should benefit from selling the communal lands and should be a part of the negotiation process. But the circulars are nonbinding, and delegates designated by the tribes as the residents\u2019 representatives can choose to ignore them.The imminence of the threat is visible from the top of a hill just behind Ms. Soukat\u2019s house: a sprawling development of condos wrapped around a golf course, built by a major real estate developer, Addoha. She said a delegate sold the land in 2007 without consulting or involving villagers.\u201cWe aren\u2019t against development projects, but we demand our rights to be respected,\u201d said Ms. Soukat, 27, a mother of two, who left school at a young age and was married when she was 16.At first, the protests were led by men, but women quickly became involved. \u201cIn our traditions, it was shameful for women to leave the house,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the men would get arrested, so women took over. We left our children behind.\u201dSouad Eddouada, a professor at the University of Kenitra who specializes in gender studies, said: \u201cAll over the country, women are at the forefront because they are less vulnerable to police brutality and incarceration. They became very successful in their fight. They had to leave their homes and were supported by the men.\u201dWhile the women have made some gains, the fight is far from over, as they still cannot pass on the rights to their share of the land to their children.\u201cNow we are demanding a law that guarantees these rights. This circular for now is very fragile,\u201d Ms. Idrissi said. \u201cWomen must become a full part of the managing of the collective lands.\u201dNeither the development company, Addoha, nor the Interior Ministry returned calls seeking comment.\u201cWe must fix the Sulaliyyate lands so they can contribute to development efforts,\u201d he wrote, \u201cby integrating the beneficiaries into this national dynamic within the framework of the principles of law and social justice.\u201dLawmakers in Morocco, a constitutional monarchy, have yet to act on the request.So the protests rumble on, and twice a week, a relative of Ms. Soukat\u2019s takes a taxi to join the protest. The relative, Fatima Soukat, is not exactly sure how old she is, but she thinks she\u2019s around 93.She was born when Morocco was ruled by France, celebrated when the country gained independence in 1956 and cheered when women gained significant rights under the new family code in 2004.When many took to the streets in pro-democracy protests in 2011, she joined them. And today she is still fighting for the right to the land where she was born and raised eight children.\u201cI demand the land of my grandfathers,\u201d she said at one recent protest. \u201cWe are beaten. We are oppressed.\u201dSaida Soukat said she had faced threats and intimidation for her role in the movement. In February, she was badly beaten by a man as she was walking alone on a road. But her greatest worry, she said, is that she and her family will be forced off the land and out of their home.\u201cI am scared for my children, but not for myself,\u201d she said, sitting in her living room, sipping mint tea under a picture of the last three Moroccan kings. \u201cThe only thing that is scary is a court decision to vacate. I lose sleep over it at night.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron Campaign Says It Was Target of \u2018Massive\u2019 Hacking Attack", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byThe digital attack, which involved a dump of campaign documents including emails and accounting records, emerged hours before a legal prohibition on campaign communications went into effect. While the leak may be of little consequence, the timing makes it extremely difficult for Mr. Macron to mitigate any damaging fallout before the runoff election, in which he faces the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who has pledged to pull France out of the euro and hold a referendum to leave the European Union.Groups linked to Russia, that are also believed to have been involved in the hacking related to the 2016 United States presidential campaign, have previously been accused of trying to breach the Macron organization. Security experts tracking the activity of suspected Russian hackers say they believe those same groups were involved in this latest attack.In a statement, the Macron campaign said the hackers had mixed fake documents along with authentic ones, \u201cto sow doubt and misinformation.\u201d\u201cIntervening in the final hour of the official campaign, this operation is clearly a matter of democratic destabilization, as was seen in the United States during the last presidential campaign,\u201d the statement said.Earlier on Friday, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign staff said its website also had faced \u201cregular and targeted\u201d attacks during the campaign.It also said that the French authorities had investigated the attacks and, this week, arrested a suspect who was \u201cclose to extreme-left circles\u201d and who had admitted to being responsible for several attacks on Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign website. The arrest occurred on French soil, the statement said.Unlike Mr. Macron, however, it did not appear that Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign documents had been compromised. The authorities did not immediately confirm the Le Pen camp\u2019s account.The Macron campaign said the documents leaked Friday were stolen several weeks ago after the personal and professional emails of staff members at En Marche, his political movement, were hacked.Trend Micro said the attack involved sending emails to campaign officials and others with links to fake websites designed to bait them into turning over passwords.In the attack reported on Friday, Vitali Kremez, the director of research at Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company in New York, said he suspected the involvement of a Russian-linked espionage operation known as APT28. \u201cThe key goals and objectives of the campaign appear to be to undermine Macron\u2019s presidential candidacy and cast doubt on the democratic electoral process in general,\u201d he said.\u201cIf indeed driven by Moscow, this leak appears to be a significant escalation over the previous Russian operations aimed at the U.S. presidential election, expanding the approach and scope of effort from simple espionage efforts towards more direct attempts to sway the outcome,\u201d Mr. Kremez added.Security researchers who have been tracking APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, say it has been moving aggressively against NATO members and a variety of Western targets using various hacking tools, including so-called spear-phishing attacks, but also through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in technologies that allow hackers to invade their targets undetected by security software.The security researchers, who asked for anonymity to discuss an investigation, say they believe APT28 has previously passed stolen information taken from breached accounts to another Russian group. It is that second group of Russian cybercriminals that, in other instances, has published leaked information, security experts say, in large part to distance Russian intelligence operatives from the hacks and maintain a measure of plausible deniability.There was no firm evidence that APT28 was involved in the theft of the Macron campaign documents.Candidates and their staff are prohibited by French electoral rules from campaigning between midnight on Friday and when the last polls close at 8 p.m. Sunday \u2014 meaning that they cannot give interviews to the news media, hold rallies, make speeches or issue statements.The Macron campaign made its statement about the hacking at 11:56 p.m. \u2014 four minutes before the legal prohibition on campaigning went into effect.\u201cIt will take to time to sift through it all, but at first glance, they seem to be utterly mundane,\u201d Numerama said after analyzing the data. \u201cOne finds memos, bills, loans for amounts that are hardly over-the-top, recommendations and other reservations, amidst, of course, exchanges that are strictly personal and private \u2014 personal notes on the rain and sunshine, a confirmation email for the publishing of a book, reservation of a table for friends, etc.\u201dSome of the documents did not appear to have any link to Mr. Macron, Numerama reported.The National Commission for Control of the Electoral Campaign, a regulatory body, said it was contacted by the Macron campaign on Friday night. The commission, which planned to meet on Saturday about the hacking, urged the news media to be cautious in its reporting.\u201cIt therefore asks the media, and in particular their websites, not to report on the content of these data, recalling that the dissemination of false information is liable to fall within the scope of the law \u2014 in particular criminal law,\u201d the commission said.The Macron campaign appealed to journalists to not do the hackers\u2019 bidding by widely publicizing the contents of the emails.\u201cWe call upon the news outlets that wish to report on this operation to shoulder their responsibilities, in all good conscience,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cIndeed, this is not a simple hacking operation but well and truly an attempt to destabilize the French presidential election. It is therefore important to consider the nature of the leaked documents, to be fully aware of the fact that a large part of them are purely and simply fake, and the appropriateness of giving an echo to this destabilization operation.\u201dMr. Macron, 39, an independent centrist and a former economy minister who is making his first run for elected office, has been favored in the polls over Ms. Le Pen, 48, a lawyer and political heir to the National Front movement her father, now estranged, founded in 1972. The party has taken strong stands against immigration, globalization and the European Union.A post-debate poll, by the firm Ipsos \u2014 which was very accurate in its projections before the first round of the elections on April 23 \u2014 found Mr. Macron\u2019s lead over Ms. Le Pen had widened, 63 percent to 37 percent.Aurelien Breeden reported from Paris, Sewell Chan from London and Nicole Perlroth from New York.

{"Headline": "As France Prepares to Vote, Angela Merkel Praises Emmanuel Macron", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 With the French presidential campaign entering its final days, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, a frequent target of attacks from the nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen, stressed her support for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s rival, the pro-Europe Emmanuel Macron, in an interview published on Wednesday.It is unusual but not unprecedented for a leader of one European country to express support for a like-minded candidate in another. In 2012, Ms. Merkel drew sharp criticism from the center left in Germany after backing President Nicolas Sarkozy, who eventually lost to the Socialist candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.The stakes in this year\u2019s French election are even higher, with the fate of the European Union potentially in the balance. Ms. Merkel made her preference clear in an interview with the K\u00f6lner Stadt Anzeiger newspaper published in Cologne.\u201cIt is and of course remains the decision of the French voters, in which I am not interfering,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I would be pleased should Emmanuel Macron win, because he stands for a consistent, pro-European policy \u2014 that I will say too.\u201dMs. Merkel, who heads the center-right bloc in the German Parliament and faces elections in September, when she will be seeking a fourth term, added that success for Mr. Macron \u201cwould be a positive signal for the political center, which we also want to keep strong here in Germany.\u201dIn a speech on Wednesday to business leaders attending a forum ahead of the Group of 20 meeting in July, Ms. Merkel continued to push the theme that isolation was not the way forward in the global economy. The message seemed clearly directed at Britain and the United States.A victory for Mr. Macron on Sunday would also send a positive signal for Franco-German relations, Ms. Merkel added. That axis, uniting the Continent\u2019s two biggest powers, has traditionally determined the \u00e9lan and effectiveness of the European Union.Ms. Merkel, who said last week that Mr. Macron would make a \u201cstrong president\u201d for France, made no mention of his rival. Ms. Le Pen criticized the German chancellor in 2015, when Ms. Merkel visited the European Parliament with the current president of France, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.Berlin has been careful to refrain from publicly commenting on the campaign of Ms. Le Pen, who has indicated that she might seek a referendum on France\u2019s use of the euro, if not on membership of the European Union.There are concerns across Europe that a victory for Ms. Le Pen, in conjunction with Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, would call into question the viability of the bloc.It\u2019s unclear whether Germany will revise its economic and financial policies if Mr. Macron wins and seeks changes in European Union affairs. But backing for Mr. Macron from the powerful chancellor would certainly be a prerequisite for any new direction for Europe\u2019s economy, or for the euro.Mr. Macron already had explicit backing from Ms. Merkel\u2019s vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, a leading member of the center-left Social Democrats in Ms. Merkel\u2019s grand coalition government.Mr. Gabriel, who also holds the post of foreign minister, got to know Mr. Macron when they were their countries\u2019 economy ministers. \u201cHe would be a great president,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said after Mr. Macron finished first in the initial round of the French election, on April 23.Mr. Macron, 39, is a former banker, and relatively new to politics. His pro-European stance has made him the obvious candidate for the European elite and for citizens who see the European Union as a source of stability and strength that unites 500 million people in one bloc.Supporters of the European Union are hoping that France will provide a third straight defeat for nationalist candidates. A pro-Europe candidate won Austria\u2019s largely ceremonial presidency in December, beating back a strong challenge from right-wing populists. Then Dutch voters denied the populist nationalist Geert Wilders a first-place finish in parliamentary elections in March.The difficulties of negotiating Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and the presidency of Donald J. Trump in the United States have added to doubts among some Europeans about the viability of conservative populism of the kind embraced by Ms. Le Pen.Ms. Merkel said before the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in June that she hoped Britain would choose to stay. Since then, she has appealed strongly to the 27 other member states to stick together and strengthen the European Union.An earlier version of this article misstated the day a newspaper interview with Angela Merkel was published, and the day she gave a speech to business leaders. Both were on Wednesday, not Thursday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Contemporary Art Buyers Cautious After Wall Street Dips", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byThe 71-lot sale raised $448.1 million with fees against a low estimate of $339 million. Ninety-six percent of the works found buyers \u2014 helped by the auction house\u2019s guaranteeing the minimum price of no fewer than 39 works \u2014 but bidders were conspicuously cautious, and few lots sold significantly above their estimates. Fifty-five percent of the lots were bought by American bidders, Christie\u2019s said.\u201cIf Wall Street hadn\u2019t taken a dive, there would have been fireworks,\u201d said David Benrimon, a New York dealer. \u201cWhile the sale was strong over all, it did change the mood among American bidders, and these contemporary sales are about Americans.\u201dMs. Sanders\u2019 most highly valued Spiegel collection works at Christie\u2019s were Sigmar Polke\u2019s 1964 Ben-Day dot canvas, \u201cFrau mit Butterbrot,\u201d and \u201cUntitled,\u201d a 1988 Christopher Wool word painting emblazoned with \u201cPLEASE\u201d six times. Both works sold toward the low end of their estimates to telephone bidders, for $17 million and $17.2 million.The Spiegel pieces, all of which were guaranteed \u2014 which can in itself sometimes dampen demand \u2014 raised $116 million against an estimate of $79 million.Tellingly, the two highest-bid lots in Christie\u2019s sale were both offered without guarantees. Cy Twombly\u2019s six-foot-tall abstract, \u201cLeda and the Swan,\u201d was fresh to the auction market and was valued at $35 million to $55 million. It attracted at least five bidders before going to the dealer Larry Gagosian, who was in the room to bid the night\u2019s top price of $52.9 million.\u201cThe Bacon could have done a bit better,\u201d said Ivor Braka, a private dealer based in London. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t glazed, it lacked luster.\u201dMr. Braka added that the bidding was \u201cmeasured and stable \u2014 unlike the politics in this country.\u201dMr. Braka said that demand was all the more measured because of some ambitious estimates. Eyebrows were raised before the sale by Christie\u2019s $13 million valuation on a monumental and thickly textured abstract by Mark Grotjahn, \u201cUntitled (S III Released to France Face 43.14),\u201d dating from 2011. The painting had been acquired by Patrick Seguin, a collector and dealer in 20th-century design based in Paris, directly from the artist for an undisclosed price.Paintings by Mr. Grotjahn, who is based in California, are on the shopping lists of many wealthy collectors, but this work was valued \u2014 and guaranteed by a third party \u2014 at a level that was exactly double the artist\u2019s previous auction high. Nonetheless, two telephone bidders pushed the price up to $16.8 million.\u201cIt was a strong estimate, but we went for it,\u201d said Alex Rotter, Christie\u2019s co-chairman of postwar and contemporary art in the Americas. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive environment, and that leads to certain price expectations. I was worried when I looked at the stock market today, but if a lot sells for a couple of ticks above estimate, that\u2019s a success.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Border Tax\u2019s Apparent Demise Jeopardizes G.O.P. Overhaul Plan", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After months on life support, the border adjustment tax looks as if it\u2019s finally dead.The rifts raise the likelihood that Republicans will struggle to meet their goal of enacting a sweeping rewrite of the tax code in 2017. It\u2019s just as likely that Mr. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, will need to find alternatives to their proposed border adjustment tax on imports. The idea is the linchpin of a plan produced by House Republicans last year, but it has drawn fierce resistance from retailers, energy companies and small businesses.At a standing-room-only House Ways and Means Committee hearing Tuesday about the tax proposal, it was not only Democrats who were uneasy about the path that Republicans have been charting on taxes. \u201cI know we have to pay for these tax cuts, but I don\u2019t want it to be on the backs of everyday hardworking American taxpayers,\u201d said Representative Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania.Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican, was more explicit in his opposition. \u201cI cannot support the border adjustability provisions as introduced last year in the blueprint,\u201d he said.Other Republicans echoed Mr. Kelly\u2019s fears, expressing concern that importers would face higher tax bills and that consumers, in turn, would be harmed by higher prices. Without their support, a bill that includes the tax could die in the committee.As proposed, the border adjustment tax would impose a 20 percent tax on imports and exempt taxation of exports. It would raise more than $1 trillion in revenue over a decade, helping Republicans cut tax rates permanently without adding to the deficit. In theory, it would level the playing field between American manufacturers and their competitors around the world.The proposal has ignited a frenzy of lobbying activity, with retail executives scrambling around Washington to \u201ceducate\u201d lawmakers on the evils of an import tax. At the same time, companies that are heavy exporters are working to push the concept forward in hopes that their income tax bills will shrink. The retail lobby and advocacy groups financed by the billionaire Koch brothers are spending millions in an effort to kill the tax.On Tuesday, lawmakers heard these arguments in the public glare. \u201cThe people who shop at Target are middle-class working families whose budgets are already stretched,\u201d Brian Cornell, chief executive of Target, told lawmakers. \u201cFor them, this new tax would be a budget breaker.\u201d\u201cThis whole thing needs to be thought out,\u201d said Tee Miller, owner of Black Mingo Outfitters in South Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make a model on a spreadsheet, but this whole thing is pretty complex.\u201dWitnesses at the hearing debated the effects that a border adjustment tax would have on currency markets and the economy. While some cautioned that it could create upheaval, others, such as the chief executive of the food processing company Archer Daniels Midland, said that the change to the tax system would make companies like his more competitive globally.Others discussed the possibility of phasing in a border tax to give sectors that are worried about sudden disruptions time to adapt. Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former director of President George W. Bush\u2019s National Economic Council, proposed starting with a smaller import tax to essentially let companies get their feet wet.\u201cLet\u2019s try something minor,\u201d Mr. Lindsey said.But the appetite for making such a drastic change to America\u2019s tax system does not appear to be there.Democrats are primarily interested in middle-class tax cuts and are opposed to any changes to the tax code that could raise prices for working-class families.Senate Republicans are currently crafting their own plan, and none in that chamber have publicly embraced the one pitched by Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady.The Trump administration has also been cool to the border tax idea. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin threw more cold water on it during a conference hosted by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation on Tuesday.\u201cOne of the problems with the border adjustment tax is that it doesn\u2019t create a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIt has the potential to pass on significant costs to the consumer.\u201d\u201cThe tax plan, as you know, is in its very early stages,\u201d Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said during a budget briefing on Monday afternoon.Despite all of the resistance, Mr. Brady does not appear to be giving up on the border adjustment tax. Speaking at the Peterson forum after the hearing, he insisted that it was the best way to give the economy a boost and help American businesses.\u201cIf someone has a better solution,\u201d he said, \u201cbring it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
