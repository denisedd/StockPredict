{"Headline": "The Art Market Is Still Waiting for an Online Revolution", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byYet at least one sector seems firmly resistant to the convenience of the click: the buying and selling of fine art.\u201cIt\u2019s still tiny,\u201d Robert Read, head of art and private clients at Hiscox, said of the online art market. \u201cThe market is crowded and fractured, and still has to deal with trust issues.\u201dThe Hiscox report, compiled by the market analysts ArtTactic based on responses from 758 art buyers and 42 company managers, found 59 businesses actively engaged in either selling art directly online or using some kind of web-based platform to facilitate such sales. It said no dominant player had yet emerged from the competitive shuffle. Established auction houses with physical showrooms have made a comeback over e-commerce specialists.Hiscox\u2019s 2017 ranking of the top 25 online art sales platforms, based on the sample\u2019s usage and satisfaction rates, was led for the second year by Christie\u2019s, a 250-year-old auction house that values online sales more as a marketing tool than as a revenue stream. Sotheby\u2019s, its 273-year-old rival, was ranked second.\u201cThe single biggest reason for our online sales is to bring in buyers to Christie\u2019s,\u201d said Marc Sands, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cLive auctions have a certain barrier. It\u2019s not the case with online. It\u2019s brought in a whole new vista of audiences.\u201dHiscox said, however, that the level of existing art buyers converting to online sales remained static for the third consecutive year. \u201cHesitant art buyers remain unconvinced about buying art online,\u201d its report said. \u201cLack of physical inspection remains the key challenge.\u201dThat might be the case for higher-priced unique works, which represent an immovable mountain of value in the art market, but, as the Hiscox report notes, online bidding is making an impact lower on the price chain, particularly at auctions of prints.One such print sale, Phillips\u2019s Editions auction in New York last month, raised $6.2 million, the most ever by the company in this category. Eighty-eight percent of the lots found buyers, with 35 percent going to online purchasers. More than half of those internet buyers were using Phillips\u2019s own online channel, with the remainder bidding through intermediaries such as Artsy, Invaluable and eBay, said Andy Foster, the auction house\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\u201cThe job of the digital area is to get every other possible bidder internationally,\u201d Mr. Foster said, adding that $100,000 remained a ceiling for many online buyers.\u201cIt turned out to be a sleeper,\u201d said Lark Mason, an Asian art specialist who is president and founder of the iGavel and Lark Mason Associates auction companies. Mr. Mason added that a Western client had bought the vase, now thought to be a rare 15th-century example, without seeing it in person against competition from 14 other bidders.Mr. Mason, like the Hiscox report, sees online auctioneering as the key battleground for e-commerce in 2017, with the major auction houses facing down dozens of online companies that are now going sink or swim in a smaller pool of available business. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a drop in demand and the market is dependent on regional auctions at the lower end,\u201d Mr. Mason said. \u201cBut because of the open access of the internet, now everybody is competing against everybody else.\u201dArtsy, with its depth of editorial content and network of commercial partnerships with major auction houses, dealers and art fairs, is No. 3 in the Hiscox rankings, followed by 1stdibs and Artnet. Definitive sales figures, let alone profits, are hard to find in the online sector. But the 16-year-old 1stdibs, which provides an online sales platform for dealers, is bringing in more than $150 million per year, according to the report.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge market,\u201d said Mr. Fabre, who estimated that as much as $8 billion worth of art could have been left unsold at auction last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the most glorious. The auction houses don\u2019t look at it. I do.\u201dThe site displays items with a catalog description and recommended price, but does not reveal the identity of the auction house. When a sale is negotiated, Auction AfterSale splits the buyer\u2019s fee with the house. At least, that is the business plan.Mr. Fabre said he had approached more than 500 auction houses worldwide to collaborate on after-sales. So far, no major auction house has agreed.Auctionata, which is based in Berlin, has not survived. Paddle8, with headquarters in New York, has reopened as an independent company through a management buyback.\u201cI\u2019m surprised there hasn\u2019t been more consolidation. I know it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Mr. Read, Hiscox\u2019s head of art and private clients, who wrote the foreword to the insurer\u2019s report. \u201cBut in the art world, there will always be a bricks-and-mortar market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emboldened by Trump but Divided by Generations, Democrats Look to 2020", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 A vast array of Democratic leaders, divided by generations but uniformly emboldened by President Trump\u2019s perceived vulnerability, have begun taking palpable steps toward seeking the White House in an election that is still three and a half years away.A prominent member of that group, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., may have sounded a starting gun for the 2020 race on Sunday night as he delivered a tough-love manifesto for the party\u2019s future to a crowd of Democrats here.Mr. Biden called on Democrats to deliver an optimistic message aimed at the needs of struggling Americans and to emphasize issues like health care and education, which he described as largely sidelined in the last election. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely positive they want to be with us,\u201d he said of people in economic distress. \u201cWe have to prove, again, we understand that hopelessness.\u201dMr. Biden said he was prepared to storm the country to help revive the party, and boasted of his comfort in wooing areas that voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cWherever you want, just let me know, because it\u2019s important,\u201d he said.His appearance in New Hampshire, with its crucial early primary, brought into the open some of the maneuvering among Democrats that has already gone on for months behind the scenes. The list of candidates may ultimately be the largest since 1976, when Democrats lined up after Watergate for a nomination seen as offering a short path to the White House.In a largely leaderless party, two distinct groups are emerging, defined mostly by age and national stature. On one side are three potential candidates approaching celebrity status who would all be over 70 years old on Election Day: Mr. Biden, and Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.All three are fiery speakers inclined toward economic populism, and they have urged the Democratic Party to shift in that direction since its defeat in November.Mr. Sanders, the runner-up in the 2016 primaries, may loom largest over the next Democratic race. He is already planning his first return trip to early-voting Iowa in July, and plans to be the keynote speaker at the convention of a social justice organization that works closely with his political group, Our Revolution.Ms. Warren, the only one of the three who has not run for president before, has mapped out an intensive speaking schedule. Last weekend, she traveled to Detroit to address the annual fund-raising dinner for the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., excoriating Mr. Trump for stirring \u201cdeep ugliness\u201d in the country. Introducing Ms. Warren was Representative Maxine Waters of California, who hailed her as a woman who \u201cmight just be the next president.\u201dAnd at a $25-per-person fund-raising event for Ms. Warren at the same venue, she was greeted with chants of \u201c2020!\u201d as she addressed supporters, according to Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan.Competing against the Democrats\u2019 senior cohort is a large and relatively shapeless set of younger candidates who span the ideological spectrum: governors, senators, mayors, wealthy executives and even members of the House. They are animated by the president\u2019s turbulent debut and the recent history, from Barack Obama\u2019s victory in 2008 to Mr. Trump\u2019s last year, of upstart candidates\u2019 catching fire.In the Senate alone, as much as a quarter of the Democrats\u2019 48-member caucus are thought to be giving at least a measure of consideration to the 2020 race, among them Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kamala Harris of California. All are closer to 40 than 80.Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of conventional qualifications for the presidency may draw outside-the-box challengers who see him as having opened a range of unconventional paths.Allies of Mr. Garcetti acknowledged that national donors had broached the subject of 2020 but said that was the extent of his attention to the race. Mr. Garcetti is weighing a campaign for governor of California next year.For now, however, it is the party\u2019s septuagenarian trio that is casting the longest shadow over 2020, and all three have taken steps to extend or expand their leadership status in the party.Mr. Biden\u2019s appearance in New Hampshire was bathed in allusions to the presidency. Speaking before Mr. Biden, New Hampshire\u2019s two senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, said they missed having him in the White House. Describing academic centers he has set up since leaving office, Mr. Biden said they housed \u201cthe people who literally would be running\u201d the State Department under Hillary Clinton.And he drew boos from the crowd when, in noting the news media\u2019s attention to his speech, he seemed to joke to the press section, \u201cGuys, I\u2019m not running.\u201dThe former vice president has kept intact much of his political brain trust, and he has extensive relationships in the early primary states. He and his aides have begun to map out party-building activities. He plans to address a major fund-raising event for Florida Democrats in June, and during a visit to South Carolina in April, he met with a state legislator, James Smith, to urge him to run for governor next year.Mr. Smith, a friend of Mr. Biden\u2019s and a supporter of his past campaigns, said he had been noncommittal about his own future.\u201cWhat the country needs is authenticity, truth, and I think he exudes that,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI tried to talk about his future, but he wasn\u2019t interested in talking about his future. We talked about the future of the country, and we talked about South Carolina.\u201dMr. Sanders, who is enormously popular on the left, has already begun campaigning for Democrats in the midterm elections, stumping for candidates from Nebraska to Virginia. He will go to Montana in May, before his Iowa encore.While Mr. Sanders is mistrusted by much of the Democratic establishment, including many leading donors, he retains a huge political network, and his advisers view him as a favorite for the nomination. His decision on whether to run will shape the Democratic race, most notably for candidates like Ms. Warren, who shares much of his political base.\u201cIf he decides to run again, he\u2019d be an enormously formidable figure and would start as the front-runner,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, who helped guide Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign.Mr. Longabaugh, unprompted, offered a comparison between Mr. Sanders\u2019s grass-roots following and political infrastructure and Mr. Biden\u2019s. \u201cWith all respect to the vice president, when you stack those assets up, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s close,\u201d he said.This week, Ms. Warren will be the guest of honor at a fund-raising gala for Emily\u2019s List, the Democratic women\u2019s group, and in June, she will be the final speaker at a daylong liberal organizing meeting in San Francisco spearheaded by Susie Tompkins Buell, a prominent Democratic donor.While some Democrats worry about running yet another candidate of Mr. Trump\u2019s generation for president, Ms. Buell said in an interview that 2020 might be too soon for some of the party\u2019s biggest talents \u2014 like Ms. Harris, who took office in January, and Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, who is running for governor.Younger Democratic hopefuls are unlikely to share Ms. Buell\u2019s reservations. In the Senate, Mr. Booker, Ms. Gillibrand and Ms. Klobuchar have been reaching out to national donors and planning travel beyond their home states. Ms. Klobuchar is scheduled to address a Democratic Party dinner in Iowa next weekend.Mr. Booker, who has long cultivated a donor network on the West Coast, visited Los Angeles in April to raise money and collect an award from the Humane Society. Steve Westly, a former eBay executive and major fund-raiser for the Obama and Clinton campaigns, said Mr. Booker had privately indicated that he was open to a 2020 campaign.\u201cHe\u2019s saying: Look, we\u2019re all doing our best to sort out what the Trump presidency means and push back in the appropriate way,\u201d Mr. Westly said.Among Democratic governors, Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Terry McAuliffe of Virginia are seen as especially active in laying groundwork for 2020. Former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, who ran in 2016, has already returned to early primary states to campaign for Democrats.Mr. Cuomo, little seen outside New York since becoming governor in 2011, hosted a fund-raising event for the Democratic Governors Association in April, and his emissaries have approached Florida donors about a fund-raising trip this year.Mr. McAuliffe, a former Democratic Party chairman, has reasserted himself as a political field marshal for the national party. Over the weekend, he headlined fund-raising events in Boston and New York for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. And he has brought two trusted advisers to the organization, the former Clinton campaign officials Robby Mook and Michael Halle, who are well connected with Democrats across the country.Democratic power brokers acknowledge that the field could grow further after the 2018 elections if a backlash against Mr. Trump brings a throng of new faces into high office.\u201cThere\u2019s very little downside in testing the waters and nosing around,\u201d said Harold Ickes, a longtime Democratic strategist. \u201cOne of the lessons of 2016 is that you just don\u2019t know. Trump is Example A of that, and Sanders is Example B.\u201dAlexander Burns reported from Manchester, and Jonathan Martin from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going Digital to Rescue Food", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byFixesLike many people in America, I went to Trader Joe\u2019s on a recent Sunday. Unlike other shoppers, though, I parked around the back near the loading dock and hauled away seven trash bags and cartons stuffed with food the store wasn\u2019t going to sell. Seven minutes later, I pulled up at the side entrance of a men\u2019s homeless shelter, rang the bell and watched as two staff members unloaded the food.That was fun.So later in the week, I did it again, this time on foot in New York City, as part of a group that rescued surplus fried chicken and biscuits from a restaurant and delivered it to a nearby emergency family shelter.At the same time, one out of eight American households don\u2019t have enough to eat.Wasted food. Hungry people. How do we get the two to meet?One answer is: Create an app. Just as Airbnb connects producers and consumers of short-stay housing, and eBay connects producers and consumers of, well, everything, new apps can connect stores and restaurants with soup kitchens, pantries and shelters that need their excess food. And apps can also organize volunteers who make the deliveries by car, bike or foot power.Now Feeding America matches donors and recipients with an algorithm. A restaurant can go on Meal Connect to post an offer of, say, eight trays of fried chicken and biscuits. Meal Connect will automatically match that offer with the closest food pantry or soup kitchen that can get it up right away.Diana Aviv, Feeding America\u2019s chief executive, said that Meal Connect makes it possible to rescue prepared food and smaller quantities of food \u2014 and to do so quickly. \u201cThis allows us to provide real hot meals \u2014 virtually at the same time that someone coming off the street and paying for it would get it,\u201d she said.Food rescue in America began in 1981, when Helen verDuin Palit, a soup kitchen manager in New Haven, ordered potato skins at a nearby restaurant. She asked the chef what he did with the insides of the potatoes, and he told her he threw them out. \u201cWe could really use those potatoes,\u201d she said. The next day, the soup kitchen received 30 gallons of cooked potatoes.The next year, Palit founded City Harvest in New York.Today, City Harvest rescues and delivers 55 million pounds of food a year, most of it fresh produce. New York City has 1.4 million people who can\u2019t put food on their table. It\u2019s not clear how many of them eat because of City Harvest, but it\u2019s a lot.Perishable food then goes directly to food pantries, soup kitchens and mobile produce trucks that park in food-insecure neighborhoods. The organization has 22 refrigerated trucks, including two tractor-trailers. Nonperishable foods and excess perishables \u2014 a truckload of apples, for example \u2014 go to the 45,000-square-foot food rescue facility in Queens, where they are divided up.City Harvest is a New York phenomenon. New York is dense \u2014 a City Harvest truck may need to drive only 50 miles in a day, Sposato said. The city has an unusual quantity of fancy food and events featuring food. And in New York, City Harvest can raise the $28 million per year (in addition to $95 million in donated food) necessary to run all this.For what else needs to happen, we can turn to John Oliver. Here\u2019s his story on food waste from 2015.Misfits is run by Robinson Fresh, a giant wholesaler of all kinds of fruit and vegetables. The company buys cosmetically undesirable produce and sells it to retail chains: at the moment, the Midwest-based Hy-Vee and Meijer, and the New England-based Hannaford.Jim Lemke, president of Robinson Fresh, said that while some chains are receptive to Misfits, others worry about how to manage it internally. \u201cThere are questions around how do we segregate this? How do we catalog them and differentiate them? We\u2019re using lots of different experiments to figure out the most efficient way.\u201dAll 242 Hy-Vee stores feature a Misfits bin in the produce section, with playful, colorful signage advertising bags of tasty but funny-looking peppers, squash, cucumbers, oranges, apples, pineapples and other produce, sold at around a 25 percent discount. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised with sales,\u201d said Brett Bremser, Hy-Vee\u2019s executive vice president of perishables. \u201cThe biggest challenge has been educating consumers. They\u2019re used to searching through the aisle to find the perfect orange.\u201dOne advantage for Hy-Vee, he said, is that its stores are in so many Midwestern farming communities. \u201cOur customers understand agriculture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey totally get that this product could have ended up in a landfill.\u201dAdvertisement"}

My apartment would instead become a glorious pleasure den from which I would enter the brightly colored world of my favorite game: The Legend of Zelda.Zelda is a gaming series set in a fantasy world, where the main character must complete a mission, solving puzzles, munching on bat wings and fighting terrestrial jelly monsters on the way. The newest installment, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is world class, apparently. If I had a Switch, and Zelda, I\u2019d traverse forest ranges on horseback, while my bills would go unpaid, my dogs would die of hunger and my work deadlines would fade into the background, secondary to what\u2019s really important: defeating an evil boar king.Each morning, I look at the news and want to flush my head down the toilet. Lucky jerks around the nation are meanwhile firing up their Nintendo Switches. Facebook is full of photos snapped by annoyed spouses: prone adults on couches with controllers in their hands, home on the weekends playing Switch, on a break from the real world.I have an online shopping alert set to notify me the second the new Nintendo Switch stock arrives (retail price $299.99). But I\u2019m not going to get one. I\u2019m just a curious observer is what I tell myself.There is a history to my Nintendo fanaticism. When I was 12, my family lived in Australia. We\u2019d emigrated from Yugoslavia (now Serbia) when the wars began. I was in charge of looking after my 7-year-old sister, and all we did was play games in the dining room we had renamed the \u201cNintendo Room.\u201dRather than deal with real life, my sister and I escaped into Zelda. There, our actual circumstances became minor details. There were no immigrants in the world of Nintendo. Being different wouldn\u2019t get us teased, our social status was irrelevant, and anyway we had a more important task to focus on: rescuing a princess from a dungeon.I have not actually touched a Nintendo Switch with my own hands or even been in the same room as one, but from my sophisticated online snooping, I can tell you that the controller vibrates and can be detached, and the graphics are elaborate, unlike the pixelated eight-bit renderings of my memories, punctuated by a primitive synthesizer score. In the several decades I\u2019ve been out of the game, the Nintendo has grown up. What a reunion it would be, the two of us together again as adults, I often think.I\u2019m at a point in my life when a lot of big decisions need to be made. My partner, Michael, annoyingly wants to talk about them. I want the opiate release of a Nintendo Switch.I\u2019ve dropped Michael many hints to this effect. I\u2019ve signed him up for the notification, too. If he is the one who actually buys it, then I am absolved of responsibility, and my life of lying on the couch absorbed in escapist gameplay can begin.\u201cYou know, people are selling Switches on eBay for a couple hundred dollars more than the retail price!\u201d I say, leaving my computer open to the purchase page, as I conveniently disappear to \u201cget some air.\u201d But my hints fall on (sensible) deaf ears. I\u2019m pretty sure Michael\u2019s not going to order me a Nintendo Switch.And yet. Whenever a package arrives, I lose my mind. I clutch it to my chest as I run back up to the apartment. I tear the packaging with my keys because I can\u2019t waste time procuring a better implement. But it\u2019s dog poop bags. It\u2019s always dog poop bags.The new stock of Nintendo Switches should be hitting the shelves any minute now. I\u2019ll just be sitting here, stewing. Unless someone \u2014 and I don\u2019t really mind who it is \u2014 gets one for me.Advertisement"}

There was a library near us in San Francisco. It was the West Portal Public Library. I would ask my father to drive me there at night and pick me up when it closed. I think he was worried about this routine but never let on. Also, I kept this a secret from my friends, as I don\u2019t think it would have been considered the \u201ccoolest\u201d habit. It was the \u201950s, and the card catalog and the Dewey Decimal System were in fashion. I hung out in the 812 section \u2014 American theater and plays. This is where I first read Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d and was transfixed. I remember staring into space for what seemed an eternity after reading Linda Loman\u2019s final speech. I\u2019ve been a fan of libraries ever since and all but wept when my kids got their first cards. No, I wept! I always got that same feeling of \u201cexpectancy\u201d when entering the library \u2014 it\u2019s the same feeling when the lights are turned down in the theater and that hush goes through the audience. It is sacred.As part owner of a bookstore in Los Angeles, what\u2019s your favorite part of the book business? Your least favorite? Which section of the bookstore do you frequent most often?Full disclosure: I now live in New York, so I haven\u2019t been able to visit the store in person as much as I would like \u2014 but I still have \u201cbragging rights.\u201d Owning a bookstore was right up there with acting in life goals, but other than swaggering around the store, I\u2019m not much use. The manager and staff are devoted and steeped in reading and literature. I love standing in the aisles and watching people browse, especially the younger crowd \u2014 the millennials, Xers and Yers are off their equipment and opting for paper, I\u2019m here to tell you! And my very favorite is the Skylight readings, where writers come and share from their books. (Did I mention that I will be doing this in May \u2014 can you say \u201cbucket list\u201d?) We have had authors from all fields \u2014 and one can even hear these on iTunes. But the power of an author standing at a podium opening the pages of their book and reading to a live audience in a bookstore \u2014 very, very powerful. Yep, it\u2019s theater. Different venues \u2014 same goal \u2014 as E. M.

But the other night we all sprawled out on the sofa, and I read from Judy Blume\u2019s \u201cTales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\u201d \u2014 we all screamed with laughter at Fudge and his family, all of us, I think Dad the most. Judy Blume is a national treasure and should be required reading in every household \u2014 with or without children. Hi, Judy! Dr. Seuss is worshiped in our house and is a go-to even now in the Tambor family. (Yes, I played Mayor Who in the \u201cGrinch\u201d movie; so what?)

To me, reading is reading is reading is reading. I am co-owner of a bookstore (Skylight Books in L.A., and I am on my 12th Kindle \u2014 that should tell you everything you need to know). Also, I read on my Android. And over people\u2019s shoulders on the subway.

A friend recently recommended Cheryl Strayed\u2019s \u201cTiny Beautiful Things\u201d \u2014 a genre I thought I abjured \u2014 but Ms. Strayed has alternatively made me laugh, cry and underline in my book like someone possessed. Wit and wisdom is all throughout this book \u2014 wonderful. I love novels of course, but Alice Munro\u2019s short stories have affected me for life. And another passion: Detective fiction is owned and operated by Michael Connelly \u2014 his Detective Bosch goes to the same places and eateries I did, when I lived there. Even Musso and Frank\u2019s on Hollywood Boulevard. Try the mixed grill. Fantasy and I don\u2019t get along \u2014 as soon as I see a map on the front page with \u201cso-and-so\u2019s house next to this castle and that cave,\u201d I am lost \u2014 my mind goes into a fugue state, and I find myself unable to go on. But we do have a wonderful fantasy section at our Skylight bookstore in Los Angeles. Shameless, I know!What\u2019s the best gift book you\u2019ve received?This is so odd. A little while ago I received in the mail Garry Shandling\u2019s \u201cThe Autobiography of Larry Sanders\u201d \u2014 the book had a heartfelt inscription to me from Garry. There was a card saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me until now to return this to you.\u201d Had I lent it? Did I unintentionally give it away to the library? And there was an eBay receipt on the back \u2014 $37.32 \u2014 which said, \u201cNicely signed.\u201d And it\u2019s a year \u2014 a year \u2014 as I write this, since Garry passed. It is the best book I have ever received as a gift. Whoever sent it \u2014 thank you.What moves you in a piece of literature?How do you organize your books?What\u2019s your favorite book about acting? About show business?What book should the president read?Anything by Dr. Seuss. For example: \u201cThe more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you\u2019ll go.\u201d Just turn off that TV.An expanded version of this interview is available at nytimes.com/books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poster Passion: A Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Fan\u2019s Lifelong Quest", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byDavid Swartz, an intrepid collector of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll concert posters and memorabilia, has amassed over 5,000 first-edition pieces. His collection is worth a total of well over $10 million, or about 9.4 million euros. Mr. Swartz, 54, was one of the heirs to the Timberland outdoor clothing and footwear brand, which was sold in 2011. He spent 14 years in the family business until 2000, when he left to pursue his interests and investments, including his passion for music mementos.He has spent almost 30 years competitively searching for, and obtaining, posters that highlight iconic bands of the 1960s, psychedelic venues and clubs, and geographic areas in New England. (He is originally from Boston.) He now lives in New York City with his wife, Diana Castellanos, and their two children. Following is a condensed and edited version of a conversation with Mr. Swartz.Q. Why posters?What are some favorites?I own the Beatles \u201965 & \u201966 at Shea Stadium; Dylan \u201963 at Town Hall, which was considered his first major concert venue gig; Joplin \u201968 at the opening of Bill Graham\u2019s Fillmore East; the Stones \u201964 at Carnegie Hall, which was the final two shows of their very first U.S. tour; and an original \u201962 poster for J.F.K.\u2019s birthday at the Garden where Marilyn sang him \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201dWhich fairs have you been to?Paper, record, antique, and sports. I\u2019ve done flea markets, and auction houses. The most important one for this industry is TRPS, The Rock Poster Society. The annual show is in October in San Francisco.Best find at a fair?Out of the 200 or 300 posters I\u2019ve bought at fairs, most of which were haphazardly tossed under tables or thrown in milk crates, my best two were a \u201965 Beach Boys surfing poster, which I bought for $200 and is worth $2,500; and the Who at the Music Hall, \u201968, for which I paid $175 and is worth $7,000 to $10,000.How do you navigate the fairs?They can be overwhelming but are invaluable. It\u2019s where you meet legitimate resources, players, dealers, artists, and can network. Lap first, take everything in, and know what people are selling. See if artists are doing signings. These can cost an additional $100 to $150, or as much as half more than the original asking price. But it can be worth it. Look for rarity, condition, dates, artist credit, low number of printing and first prints, which are always better investments than reprints or second printings.What\u2019s something no one tells you?There was a time when posters were plentiful, now they\u2019re not, so people are looking for strategic advantage. Collectors, and some dealers, don\u2019t want to share information about what\u2019s valuable, or give hints as to how to search or where to look. But you can still find something unique or special.First significant hunt?Eleven years ago, I\u2019d found this guy in Buffalo who had this amazing collection of posters from the Boston area. I was hit hard with the flu, and it was snowing. I\u2019d spent six years talking with him, hoping he would invite me to his home, so when he finally said, \u201cO.K.,\u201d I couldn\u2019t turn it down. I felt horrible, but got on a plane. My wife thought I was crazy, but I left with 15 to 20 posters. The thrill of the chase is sometimes better than the prize, but this was equally as great.Which poster would you save in a fire?The Hendrix \u201cwire hair\u201d \u201969, done by the artist G\u00fcnther Kieser. The colors are rich and resonate with Jimi\u2019s aura. It\u2019s a rare original that\u2019s visually compelling, historical, and perfectly crosses over from poster to art, as Kieser\u2019s work has been showcased in the MoMA, among other museums.First poster you bought?The Who, \u201973, done by the artist David Singer, which I found at an antique store on Newbury Street. I was in my 20s and paid $100 or $150, which was a big investment back then. As a kid, I would go to Harvard Square to buy bootleg vinyls. Posters were a natural evolution from the audio format to the visual one.How do you find these artifacts? It\u2019s a research game and hunting people down. Being in the field you develop a network of dealers, collectors, promoters and artists who created the posters. I\u2019ve bought college yearbooks to find the student body and social committee responsible for putting on the shows in the hope of locating something. Then there\u2019s eBay, poster shows, art fairs and auction houses.Most expensive poster you own? I have a few from the \u201950s called boxing-style, which were done in big, block lettering. Really rare ones had photos. Four exist of Elvis from his 1956 tour. Each is worth $500,000 to a million dollars. I\u2019m fortunate to have three.Biggest regret? There was a Beatles \u201966 Shea Stadium oversized poster, which was in great condition. Maybe six exist. It was offered to me 10 years ago for $50,000, which was a staggering amount, so I didn\u2019t buy it. At auction shortly after it went for $133,000, the most money a poster has sold for publicly.Advertisement"}
