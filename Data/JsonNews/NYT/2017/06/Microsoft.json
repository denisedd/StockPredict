{"Headline": "In Hong Kong, a Bureau Evolves With Its City", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byFor the past two decades, The New York Times had its Hong Kong bureau in a beautiful apartment halfway up the slopes of Victoria Peak, with a view of the harbor that gradually narrowed as more tall buildings were built farther down the hill.A 20-minute walk downhill was enough to reach many government offices and the Asia headquarters of dozens of multinationals. A nine-minute walk was all it took to reach the famous Peak Tram, pulled by a winch up one of the steepest slopes of any funicular in Asia. Or for some real exercise, which I tried to do several days a week as Hong Kong bureau chief when not on reporting trips, there was a 40-minute walk up many steep switchbacks to the top of the tram tracks, with magnificent views of Victoria Harbor and its skyscrapers in one direction and a glistening reservoir, a verdant valley and the South China Sea in the other direction.In the past 15 years, the journalism was transformed as well. When I arrived as bureau chief in 2002, the city and our news coverage were mostly focused on Southeast Asia. I would write articles in Microsoft Word and email them to New York for editing and publication in a printed newspaper. Photos were often an afterthought, with a photographer sometimes assigned only after a first draft of the article had been filed.By the time The New York Times transferred me to Shanghai last year, Hong Kong and our news coverage were concentrated on the ever-growing economic and geopolitical muscle of mainland China. I was writing stories in a New York Times online system for editing in Hong Kong and immediate posting to the internet.The Times has had offices in Hong Kong almost continuously for many decades. Henry R. Lieberman, living at a particularly prestigious address on Peak Road, was the bureau chief in 1952, when he was the founding president of Hong Kong\u2019s famous Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club. Hong Kong was a safe, well-run British colony then, perched on the almost completely closed border of China, where Mao\u2019s Communists had just won an exhausting civil war and soon after intervened in the Korean War, triggering an international trade embargo against China.The role of Hong Kong and the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club as a base for media coverage of Asia was quickly popularized by an Oscar-winning Hollywood movie in 1955, \u201cLove is a Many-Splendored Thing,\u201d based on an almost identically titled novel by Han Suyin. The novel and movie also examined the dark side of Hong Kong: widespread racial discrimination by the tiny white elite against the ethnic Chinese majority, a chronic problem that would disrupt the city\u2019s politics for decades afterward.Joe Lelyveld was the newspaper\u2019s Hong Kong bureau chief in the early 1970s, when China was still in the throes of the Cultural Revolution and so-called China watchers in Hong Kong studied mainland newspapers and transcripts of radio broadcasts for clues of what was happening in Beijing. Nicholas D. Kristof, now an op-ed columnist for The New York Times, was the Hong Kong bureau chief in the late 1980s. Both exemplified the kind of close students of Chinese politics for which the Hong Kong journalism community was long famous.\u201cHong Kong was a glorious mix of British officials, Chinese communists and spies from Israel to North Korea \u2014 all in a place with the best dim sum in the world,\u201d Nick wrote to me in an email this week.Nick closed the bureau at the end of 1987 when he was transferred to Beijing. He and his wife and colleague, Sheryl WuDunn, won a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.But with the approach of Britain\u2019s return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, The Times decided that it needed a bureau there once again. The foreign desk chose Edward A. Gargan, an experienced correspondent who had previously served as bureau chief in Beijing, New Delhi and Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and had closely followed Chinese politics for many years.An avid jogger, Ed selected Bowen Road, a leafy colonial road near downtown with little traffic. After a year in another apartment on Bowen Road, Ed moved into an aging building next door and converted a four-bedroom apartment into the bureau, with two bedrooms converted into offices for him and for a news assistant and the rest as living quarters. That apartment became The Times\u2019s base as the bureau evolved over the next two decades.Mark Landler, now one of our White House correspondents, succeeded Ed in the apartment in 1998. An experienced business reporter, he began the evolution of the Hong Kong bureau toward covering more business and economic news, initially with an emphasis on Southeast Asia. The Asian financial crisis was triggering violent street protests when Mark arrived, and he spent much of his first year covering the fiery uprisings that led to President Suharto\u2019s ouster in Indonesia.\u201cIt was always such a relief to come home to that fabulous apartment,\u201d Mark said. \u201cIt was like \u2018The Year of Living Dangerously\u2019 meets \u2018The Year of Living Comfortably\u2019.\u201dWhen Mark was transferred to become our Frankfurt bureau chief in early 2002, The New York Times transferred me to Hong Kong from Detroit. I had previously covered telecommunications and then airlines in our New York office, international trade and then the Federal Reserve in our Washington bureau, and then the auto industry of course in Detroit. But moving to Hong Kong posed new challenges, of which the biggest was how to start covering the fast-growing mainland Chinese economy.When I arrived a week before Mark\u2019s departure, it was still almost impossible to get a journalism visa to mainland China from Hong Kong. Business executives and tourists could cross the nearby river to the mainland, but journalists almost never could because the Chinese Communist Party was and remains extremely wary of critical reporting. Some reporters even resorted to flying to Bangkok to apply for visas, because the Chinese embassy there had a somewhat more generous reputation \u2014 but even the embassy in Bangkok was chary of granting journalism visas.Oddly enough, it had become easier to get a journalism visa to live and report in Beijing or Shanghai than to visit China for even a single day from Hong Kong. This was partly because Guangdong province of mainland China, next to Hong Kong, had become fed up with critical reporting from Hong Kong-based foreign correspondents who came briefly across the border, and had discouraged the further issuance of visas. Many news organizations began moving correspondents from Hong Kong to Beijing or Shanghai, and The New York Times itself was expanding its presence on the mainland, particularly in Beijing.The Chinese foreign ministry initially refused to talk to me about the broad subject of journalism visas, saying that its sole authorized interlocutor was the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club \u2014 a designation that the club did not know it had. I organized a campaign by the club for more visas, and tried to enlist top Hong Kong government and business leaders in the effort. Mark had very graciously introduced me to Hong Kong\u2019s top government officials, and I told them that if Hong Kong ceased to be the place to learn about China, I would likely be the last Times correspondent assigned to Hong Kong. The Times would then join a broad move by other publications in posting journalists only to the mainland. That would undermine Hong Kong\u2019s role as a place to get information about China and its role as a financial center \u2014 a prospect that dismayed Hong Kong political and business leaders alike.China\u2019s foreign ministry agreed in November, 2002, to issue more visas. I then joined the club\u2019s board and had myself named as the visa policy negotiator, a role I held until I left last year. The ministry started issuing visas allowing a single entry to China, then several years later with two entries, and then, shortly before the Beijing Olympics in 2008, with multiple entries for a month or even three months.I ended up with well over 100 visas over the years. Each visa was a thick piece of paper that filled a whole page of my passport, and was then canceled with a stamp on the opposite page. I was also traveling regularly to places like India for the Mumbai hotels attack in 2008 and to the Philippines for coverage of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. So my passport would become as thick as a paperback novel before I had to replace it.Halfway around the world, The New York Times was buying out The Washington Post\u2019s stake in the Paris-based International Herald Tribune in 2003. The following year, The Herald Tribune opened an Asia newsroom in the North Point neighborhood of Hong Kong. Initially a handful of editors, that operation has grown and grown in the years since then, mainly adding editors but also correspondents specializing in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and mainland China. The International Herald Tribune has been gradually integrated into The New York Times\u2019s operations over the years. The Hong Kong newsroom, now with a staff of several dozen, edits the printed edition of what has become the international edition of The New York Times, as well as editing our coverage from most of Asia for our website and for printed editions in the United States. Journalists in the Hong Kong newsroom also write about events across the region.When the opportunity arose last year for me to become Shanghai bureau chief, I took it. The Chinese foreign ministry had become far more cautious once again about issuing journalism visas in Hong Kong, partly because of the Umbrella Revolution protests in Hong Kong in 2014 and partly because of mainland China\u2019s steady shift toward greater caution in dealings with the West.We gave up the apartment on Bowen Road, as it was no longer needed. The venerable title of Hong Kong bureau chief disappeared, as it no longer made sense to have such a position. Philip Pan, our Asia editor, now oversees our Asia operations from the North Point newsroom.\u201cHong Kong is more important to the Times than ever, part of a global, 24-hour digital operation that also includes newsrooms in New York and London,\u201d Phil wrote in an email.The timing, as it turns out, may have been lucky: the faded apartment building where my predecessors and I had lived and worked for so many years is about to undergo an extensive rehabilitation for 18 months. Scaffolding has already appeared at its base, and the building\u2019s gurgling pipes, drafty windows and creaky elevators will all be replaced.Like Hong Kong: the building is being renewed and remade. Mainland Chinese have been moving to the city by the hundreds of thousands, buying up apartments and taking many high-paid jobs but also displacing many longtime residents, who find themselves struggling for employment and affordable housing.While working in the past two weeks on an article on the twentieth anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese rule, it was hard not to look occasionally up the hill with more than a little nostalgia at the aging building that for so many years housed our bureau.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Businesses Cheer \u2018New Sheriff in Town\u2019 After Climate Pact Exit", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byAs news that President Trump was pulling out of the Paris climate accord hit at a luncheon for small-business owners in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday, an already happy crowd suddenly turned euphoric.\u201cIt was like a major win at a football game,\u201d said Rick Longenecker, a management consultant who had been among the 50 or so attendees who gathered to trade thoughts amid a rapidly improving local economy.While multinational corporations such as Disney, Goldman Sachs and IBM have opposed the president\u2019s decision to walk away from the international climate agreement, many small companies around the country were cheering him on, embracing the choice as a tough-minded business move that made good on Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to put America\u2019s commercial interests first.This full-throated support from the small-business community comes even as the Trump administration struggles to advance health care legislation and tax reform plans through Congress \u2014 and despite the swelling controversy over Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.In Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and beyond, many small businesses are reporting improved sales and bigger work forces \u2014 regardless of what is going on in Washington.\u201cThere is a new sheriff in town,\u201d said Louis M. Soltis, the owner of a company in Toledo that manufactures control panels for large factories. \u201cBut the biggest frustration that I have is that there is so much resistance that is keeping him from moving forward.\u201dIn the months following Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, as stock markets hit historical highs and companies kept adding jobs, the business community as a whole seemed willing to give the president a chance to follow through on his bold promises to revitalize the economy by cutting taxes and rolling back regulations.Many small-business leaders in the Midwest, on the other hand, were largely unfazed.For those more concerned with their local economies than global greenhouse gas emissions, walking away from the Paris agreement was just another example of a bottom-line business decision made by a president who knows a good deal from a bad one.\u201cThis just heightens the divide between big business and small business,\u201d said Jeffrey Korzenik, an investment strategist for Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati who spends much of his time talking to small businesses in the Midwest. \u201cThey really have different worldviews.\u201dAt the root of this disconnect is a sense that companies that employ up to a few hundred workers \u2014 such companies make up 99 percent of businesses in the United States and account for half of its private sector employment \u2014 are held to a more onerous standard than their larger peers when it comes to complying with regulations.At the Toledo luncheon, for example, much of the discussion centered on the fact that the climate treaty is nonbinding. To businessmen who have spent the past 10 years complaining of ceaseless rules and regulations, the very idea that the climate pact lacked teeth was galling.\u201cWhen companies here do business with a Ford or a G.M., they sign a contract that is not only binding \u2014 in many cases it is pretty harsh,\u201d Mr. Longenecker said. \u201cNow we have this deal to prevent a global catastrophe, and it\u2019s nonbinding? That is ridiculous. And it makes us think that there is a hidden agenda, that we are just transferring trillions of dollars to China.\u201dTo some small business executives, seeing the president talk tough to the Europeans and the Chinese was a reminder of why they voted for him in the first place.\u201cI think that we\u2019re making a very big deal over a molehill,\u201d said Dave Griggs, owner of Dave Griggs Flooring America in Columbia, Mo. which employs 16 people. \u201cI think the president is exactly right, we need to certainly renegotiate.\u201dBut local business leaders are not without their worries.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a Republican Congress, a Republican president; hopefully we can get some initiatives passed,\u201d Mr. Griggs said. \u201cI am highly optimistic.\u201dBut by and large, local business leaders said they remained supportive of the president and believed the attention on his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia was overblown.John Bagge, 64, who runs a catering company in Kirkland, Wash., with his wife and two daughters, said his business was booming \u2014 so much so that this was the first summer he has had to turn away customers in 40 years.The chief executives of big American companies were less sanguine, and many distanced themselves from Mr. Trump.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, both resigned from the president\u2019s economic advisory council on Thursday.\u201cClimate change is real,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter. \u201cLeaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\u201dOther big company executives \u2014 including the chief executives Douglas McMillon of Walmart and Virginia M. Rometty of IBM \u2014 voiced their opposition to the president\u2019s decision but said they would remain on the council.\u201cDisappointed in today\u2019s news about the Paris Agreement,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cWe think it\u2019s important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201dDespite remaining broadly supportive of the president, some businessmen said that the whirlwind of controversies was beginning to raise questions about just how effective this administration could be.Jim Stouffer, Jr. the president of Catawba Island Club, a local resort in Port Clinton, Ohio, said he supported the decision to leave the Paris agreement, but added that he was growing more uncertain of what the future holds.\u201cI don\u2019t know what his endgame is,\u201d he said.Rachel Abrams contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The company, based in San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, has already raised about $500 million over the past three years and was valued by investors last year at about $4 billion.In the past few years, Slack has also stirred acquisition interest from potential buyers, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, according to three people with knowledge of the acquisition offers. Most recently, Amazon expressed interest in acquiring Slack, these people said.Slack\u2019s messaging product, introduced in 2014, was initially a cult hit that grew mostly by word of mouth, a rare feat for a company that caters to businesses rather than consumers.Tools made by Slack are now used daily by five million people, up from four million in October. For about 1.5 million of those, Slack is paid $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search, but most customers use a free version. The company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable.Stewart Butterfield, Slack\u2019s chief executive, has said publicly that he wants to build a giant company and that he has therefore been opportunistic about amassing a war chest of capital.Slack is trying to sign on more large companies as customers. It recently expanded its sales and marketing teams. Last fall, it brought in a seasoned sales executive, Kevin Egan, who had most recently worked at Dropbox.

{"Headline": "HomePod Speaker and New iMacs: What We Saw at Apple\u2019s WWDC", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported by\u2022 Apple gave a sneak peek of HomePod, a speaker, to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home. It\u2019s the first brand-new hardware product for Apple since the Apple Watch.\u2022 The company also showed new iPads at its annual developer conference, which typically focuses on software instead of hardware.\u2022 Also unveiled: a new iMac Pro, upgraded iMacs and MacBooks, and updates to its operating systems.Amazon, with the Echo, pioneered a device that lets you play music, look up basic information and control your lighting and other home accessories. Now Apple\u2019s answer to the Echo \u2014 the HomePod \u2014 is here, kind of. Apple showed off HomePod on Monday, and it will be available in December.So how will Apple compete? In a very Apple-like manner: The speaker, powered by the Siri voice assistant, looks spiffier than either Amazon\u2019s or Google\u2019s version \u2014 it is a seven-inch-tall canister wrapped in a shiny mesh speaker. The company also said it had prioritized the speaker\u2019s sound, which can be lackluster on rival devices. HomePod has an array of speakers to create virtual surround sound.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know what any of that is; just know that it sounds incredible,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s marketing chief, who added that HomePod would be priced at $349.Although Apple appears to be trying to make up ground on Amazon and Google, the primary casualty may be Sonos. That company offers a wireless multispeaker system that allows users to listen to music throughout the home, similar to HomePod\u2019s ability to chain together speakers.The big question, though, is whether the intelligence inside Apple\u2019s speaker is good for anything beyond music. Apple was early to the voice game with Siri on the iPhone, but rivals have since lapped it \u2014 their voice-command devices are faster, they know more, and they are less annoying to use. Apple promises the new Siri is better, but the improvements it showed were only minor.Apple\u2019s developer conference typically showcases software improvements. In a departure from that routine, Apple showed a lot of new hardware this time.That included updated versions of the iPad, which has been declining in sales. Apple showed that it was continuing to bet on the tablets by unveiling an iPad upgrade that the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said was pushing the device \u201cfurther than it ever has before.\u201dThe new version of the iPad Pro has a 10.5-inch display, 20 percent larger than the previous 9.7-inch model, and it will start at $649. Apple said the size made it perfect for displaying a virtual keyboard comparable to a full-size physical keyboard. The company also highlighted a feature called ProMotion that increases the refresh rate and makes motion smoother in video content.After Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad in 2010, tablets exploded in popularity, but iPad sales have slumped for more than a year now. So Apple, under increasing pressure from investors to strengthen its revenue, has upgraded iPads more frequently than many of its other products. The company introduced a cheaper version of the 9.7-inch iPad, priced at $329, in March and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compatible with an Apple stylus and keyboard, in 2015.Apple\u2019s predicament seems to be that for existing iPad customers, their tablets are still quite capable and running strong, giving them little reason to upgrade. For new customers, the iPad may be overkill for basic tasks, especially if you can just pay $50 for a media tablet from Amazon.One of Apple\u2019s splashiest hardware debuts was a brand new iMac Pro that will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega. Translation: It is Apple\u2019s all-in-one desktop on steroids.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the most powerful Mac we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d said John Ternus, Apple\u2019s vice president for hardware engineering.The new iMac Pro may help compensate for Apple\u2019s previous professional desktop, the Mac Pro, which was widely panned by critics and customers. The iMac Pro will start at $5,000 and ship in December.With this device, Apple is broadly catering to members of the professional community, like filmmakers and hard-core coders. For years, these users have felt left behind as Apple has focused on consumer-oriented products like the iPhone, shifting away from high-performance equipment for professionals.The company also announced upgrades of its 27-inch and 21.5-inch iMacs, its desktop computers, which will start at $1,099, with additional models at $1,299 and $1,799. And Apple lowered some prices for its MacBooks and said the MacBook Air, its entry-level lightweight laptop, would get a speed increase. The 21.5-inch model with 4K high resolution will start at about $1,300, with a new 13-inch MacBook Pro starting at $1,300.Every year, Apple updates the underlying operating systems that power its devices. The changes are geeky \u2014 remember, they are aimed at software developers \u2014 but they eventually trickle down to how we use iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches.The most important update was to iOS, the operating system that underpins Apple\u2019s biggest seller, iPhones, as well as iPads. Apple introduced iOS 11, with improved camera software; upgrades for Siri; an expansion of its mobile payment system, Apple Pay; and a new version of Apple Maps, with indoor mapping and features to prevent distracted driving.Because the show is about giving new tools to developers, Apple also focused on emerging technologies. Specifically, Apple highlighted augmented reality, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.Apple demonstrated changes to the operating system for the Apple Watch including a new watch face that uses Siri to suggest directions, show calendar items and generally predict what you will want to see. The most substantive changes focused on fitness, including the ability to track new types of high-intensity workouts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cyberattack Hits Ukraine Then Spreads Internationally", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byIn Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, A.T.M.s stopped working. About 80 miles away, workers were forced to manually monitor radiation at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant when their computers failed. And tech managers at companies around the world \u2014 from Maersk, the Danish shipping conglomerate, to Merck, the drug giant in the United States \u2014 were scrambling to respond. Even an Australian factory for the chocolate giant Cadbury was affected.The outbreak was the latest and perhaps the most sophisticated in a series of attacks making use of dozens of hacking tools that were stolen from the National Security Agency and leaked online in April by a group called the Shadow Brokers.The National Security Agency has not acknowledged its tools were used in WannaCry or other attacks. But computer security specialists are demanding that the agency help the rest of the world defend against the weapons it created.\u201cJust because you roll out a patch doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be put in place quickly,\u201d said Carl Herberger, vice president for security at Radware. \u201cThe more bureaucratic an organization is, the higher chance it won\u2019t have updated its software.\u201dBecause the ransomware used at least two other ways to spread on Tuesday \u2014 including stealing victims\u2019 credentials \u2014 even those who used the Microsoft patch could be vulnerable and potential targets for later attacks, according to researchers at F-Secure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm, and others.A Microsoft spokesman said the company\u2019s latest antivirus software should protect against the attack.The Ukrainian government said several of its ministries, local banks and metro systems had been affected. A number of other European companies, including Rosneft, the Russian energy giant; Saint-Gobain, the French construction materials company; and WPP, the British advertising agency, also said they had been targeted.Ukrainian officials pointed a finger at Russia on Tuesday, although Russian companies were also affected. Home Credit bank, one of Russia\u2019s top 50 lenders, was paralyzed, with all of its offices closed, according to the RBC news website. The attack also affected Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company that employs about 80,000 people, the RBC website reported.In the United States, the multinational law firm DLA Piper also reported being hit. Hospitals in Pennsylvania were being forced to cancel operations after the attack hit computers at Heritage Valley Health Systems, a Pennsylvania health care provider, and its hospitals in Beaver and Sewickley, Penn., and satellite locations across the state.Qantas Airways\u2019 booking system failed for a time on Tuesday, but the company said the breakdown was due to an unrelated hardware issue.The Australian government has urged companies to install security updates and isolate any infected computers from their networks.\u201cThis ransomware attack is a wake-up call to all Australian businesses to regularly back up their data and install the latest security patches,\u201d said Dan Tehan, the cybersecurity minister. \u201cWe are aware of the situation and monitoring it closely.\u201dA National Security Agency spokesman referred questions about the attack to the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security is monitoring reports of cyberattacks affecting multiple global entities and is coordinating with our international and domestic cyber partners,\u201d Scott McConnell, a department spokesman, said in a statement.Computer specialists said the ransomware was very similar to a virus that emerged last year called Petya. Petya means \u201cLittle Peter,\u201d in Russian, leading some to speculate the name referred to Sergei Prokofiev\u2019s 1936 symphony \u201cPeter and the Wolf,\u201d about a boy who captures a wolf.That means anyone could launch the ransomware with the click of a button, encrypt someone\u2019s systems and demand a ransom to unlock it. If the victim pays, the authors of the Petya ransomware, who call themselves Janus Cybercrime Solutions, get a cut of the payment.That distribution method means that pinning down the people responsible for Tuesday\u2019s attack could be difficult.The attack is \u201can improved and more lethal version of WannaCry,\u201d said Matthieu Suiche, a security researcher who helped contain the spread of the WannaCry ransomware when he created a kill switch that stopped the attacks.In just the last seven days, Mr. Suiche noted, WannaCry had tried to hit an additional 80,000 organizations but was prevented from executing attack code because of the kill switch. Petya does not have a kill switch.The hackers behind Petya demanded $300 worth of the cybercurrency Bitcoin to unlock victims\u2019 machines. By Tuesday afternoon, online records showed that 30 victims had paid the ransom, although it was not clear whether they had regained access to their files. Other victims may be out of luck, after Posteo, the German email service provider, shut down the hackers\u2019 email account.In Ukraine, people turned up at post offices, A.T.M.s and airports to find blank computer screens, or signs about closures. At Kiev\u2019s central post office, a few bewildered customers milled about, holding parcels and letters, looking at a sign that said, \u201cClosed for technical reasons.\u201dThe hackers compromised Ukrainian accounting software mandated to be used in various industries in the country, including government agencies and banks, according to researchers at Cisco Talos, the security division of the computer networking company. That allowed them to unleash their ransomware when the software, which is also used in other countries, was updated.The ransomware spread for five days across Ukraine, and around the world, before activating Tuesday evening.\u201cIf I had to guess, I would think this was done to send a political message,\u201d said Craig Williams, the senior technical researcher at Talos.One Kiev resident, Tetiana Vasylieva, was forced to borrow money from a relative after failing to withdraw money at four automated teller machines. At one A.T.M. in Kiev belonging to the Ukrainian branch of the Austrian bank Raiffeisen, a message on the screen said the machine was not functioning.Ukraine\u2019s Infrastructure Ministry, the postal service, the national railway company, and one of the country\u2019s largest communications companies, Ukrtelecom, had been affected, Volodymyr Omelyan, the country\u2019s infrastructure minister, said in a Facebook post.Officials for the metro system in Kiev said card payments could not be accepted. The national power grid company Kievenergo had to switch off all of its computers, but the situation was under control, according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. Metro Group, a German company that runs wholesale food stores, said its operations in Ukraine had been affected.At the Chernobyl plant, the computers affected by the attack collected data on radiation levels and were not connected to industrial systems at the site, where, although all reactors have been decommissioned, huge volumes of radioactive waste remain. Operators said radiation monitoring was being done manually.Cybersecurity researchers questioned whether collecting ransom was the true objective of the attack.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that this attack could have been a smoke screen,\u201d said Justin Harvey, the managing director of global incident response at Accenture Security. \u201cIf you are an evildoer and you wanted to cause mayhem, why wouldn\u2019t you try to first mask it as something else?\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the occupation of Justin Harvey.

{"Headline": "Mystery of Motive for a Ransomware Attack: Money, Mayhem or a Message?", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As governments and organizations around the world grappled on Wednesday with the impact of a cyberattack that froze computers and demanded a ransom for their release, victims received a clear warning from security experts not to pay a dime in the hopes of getting back their data.The hackers\u2019 email address was shut down and they had lost the ability to communicate with their victims, and by extension, to restore access to computers. If the hackers had wanted to collect ransom money, said cybersecurity experts, their attack was an utter failure. That is, if that was actually their goal.Increasingly sophisticated ransomware assaults now have cybersecurity experts questioning what the attackers are truly after. Is it money? Mayhem? Delivering a political message?In the attack that hit computers from Ukraine to the United States on Tuesday, financial gain may be the least likely motive.\u201cEither it was a sophisticated actor who knew what they were doing \u2014 except screwed up horribly on the part where they actually get paid,\u201d said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute and a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, \u201cor it wasn\u2019t about the ransom in the first place.\u201dWannaCry spread by combining traditional ransomware with a worm, or a mechanism by which the attack could quickly grow. It was the first of its kind, said cybersecurity researchers, in that its goal appeared to be spreading as quickly as possible, rather than to successfully collect ransoms from victims.WannaCry\u2019s spread was halted by an independent cybersecurity researcher, who discovered that by registering a single domain for about $10 he could stop the attack in its tracks. Though Tuesday\u2019s assault does not appear to have finished, it is no longer likely to generate significant payments, because a German email provider shut down the email address associated with the ransom.\u201cThey are no longer collecting a ransom,\u201d said Justin Harvey, managing director of global incident response at Accenture Security. \u201cThey are just being destructive.\u201dWhen criminals stage a ransomware to make money, they set up multiple avenues to collect funds from their victims, Mr. Harvey said. By contrast, the recent, widespread attacks used \u201cimmature\u201d methods, like a single email address and a single Bitcoin wallet for electronic payments.But considerable attention was paid to the technical details of launching the attacks and ensuring they would spread as fast as possible.While law enforcement officials struggled to determine who was behind the attack, Microsoft said the assailants initially focused on software run by M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian company specializing in tax accountancy. M.E.Doc acknowledged that its servers had been affected and said in a statement that it was cooperating with Ukrainian cyberpolice.In Mumbai, India, a port terminal operated by A. P. Moller-Maersk, a Danish shipping giant, was shut down on Tuesday afternoon after it disclosed that it had been affected by the malware. In a statement, Indian port authorities said they were working to relieve congestion, including finding places to park stranded cargo.On the Australian island of Tasmania, computers in a Cadbury chocolate factory owned by Mondelez International, an American food company, displayed the ransomware message, the local news media reported.\u201cWe continue to work quickly to address the current global I.T. outage across Mondelez International and to contain any further exposure to our network,\u201d a spokeswoman for the company said, adding that it was not clear when the company\u2019s systems would be back up.The virus also spread to the Australian branches of DLA Piper, a law firm with offices around the world. The firm warned clients that it was dealing with a \u201cserious global cyber incident\u201d and said that it had taken down its communications as a precaution.In China, there were only scattered reports of the malware. Qihoo 360, a Chinese computer security company, said the attack hit far fewer companies and government offices than WannaCry.Yet who was behind WannaCry and Tuesday\u2019s attack, and why they did it, remained unclear.Brian Lord, former deputy director for intelligence and cyber operations at Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, the country\u2019s equivalent to the National Security Agency, said that rather than aiming for financial rewards, the hackers were trying to create the largest amount of disruption \u2014 particularly in Ukraine.But he is not convinced it was a Russian attack. \u201cThe Russians are very smart,\u201d said Mr. Lord, who is now managing director for cyber and technology at PGI Cyber, an online security company. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the blatantness of hitting Ukraine that doesn\u2019t sit well with me about this being a Russian attack.\u201dBut since the tools used in the recent attacks are widely available, a range of hackers \u2014 criminals and state-sponsored \u2014 would have been capable of carrying them out.\u201cThese types of attacks are just going to keep happening, and we\u2019ve known this since we first saw how big WannaCry was going to be last month,\u201d Mr. Harvey, of Accenture Security, said. \u201cThe real questions is whether these are all just practice runs for the big one.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the search for a motive behind a recent cyberattack that spread around the world misstated the name of a cybersecurity firm based in Tel Aviv.

{"Headline": "A Slump in Tech Stocks That Leaves Some Investors Mystified", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byThe laws of gravity apparently apply to technology stocks after all.No one trigger related to the fundamentals of these companies spurred the snap back. As has been the case for years now, these technology giants sit on trillions of dollars in cash, are growing at a breakneck pace and, compared with companies in earlier tech frenzies, do not have absurd valuations.Yet it has been this lack of an identifiable cause \u2014 a disappointing earnings result or a major investor\u2019s unloading stock, for example \u2014 that has been worrying some market specialists.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dOn Monday, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was also slightly lower, off 0.1 percent.Netflix helped lead the way, declining 4.2 percent. Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.In the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.The declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.To the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500\u2019s return of more than 8 percent this year.The bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.UBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.While traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors \u2014 given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market \u2014 will stick with them.According to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today\u2019s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.Hedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer \u201cFaamg,\u201d substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)Compared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins \u2014 exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges \u2014 that is a very small figure.To a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.In the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.Credit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.In the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Kind of Tech Job Emphasizes Skills, Not a College Degree", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byROCKET CENTER, W.Va. \u2014 A few years ago, Sean Bridges lived with his mother, Linda, in Wiley Ford, W.Va. Their only income was her monthly Social Security disability check. He applied for work at Walmart and Burger King, but they were not hiring.Yet while Mr. Bridges had no work history, he had certain skills. He had built and sold some stripped-down personal computers, and he had studied information technology at a community college. When Mr. Bridges heard IBM was hiring at a nearby operations center in 2013, he applied and demonstrated those skills.Now Mr. Bridges, 25, is a computer security analyst, making $45,000 a year. In a struggling Appalachian economy, that is enough to provide him with his own apartment, a car, spending money \u2014 and career ambitions.\u201cI got one big break,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I needed.\u201dThis skills-based jobs approach matters at a time when there is a push to improve the circumstances of those left behind in the American economy, many of whom voted for President Trump.\u201cWe need new approaches, or we\u2019re going to leave more and more people behind in our economy,\u201d said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft.It is unclear whether a relative handful of skills-centered initiatives can train large numbers of people and alter hiring practices broadly. But the skills-based approach has already yielded some early and encouraging results in the technology industry, which may provide a model for other industries.These jobs have taken off in tech for two main reasons. For one, computing skills tend to be well defined. Writing code, for example, is a specific task, and success or failure can be tested and measured. At the same time, the demand for tech skills is surging.In just two years, TechHire\u2019s network has grown to 72 communities, 237 training organizations and 1,300 employers. It has helped place more than 4,000 workers in jobs.TechHire\u2019s mission is partly to chip away at \u201cthe cultural hegemony of the bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d said Byron Auguste, president of Opportunity@Work.Nichole Clark of Paintsville, Ky., heard a radio ad last year for TechHire Eastern Kentucky. The program offered six months of training in software programming that included working with a company while being paid $400 a week. That was not much less than what Ms. Clark, now 24, was making as a manager at Pizza Hut.Without a college degree, Ms. Clark said, her horizons seemed confined to low-wage jobs in fast-food restaurants, retail stores or doctors\u2019 offices. The TechHire program, she said, could be \u201ca doorway to a good-paying job, which is everything here.\u201dAfter four months of taking all-day classes on the basics of writing software and two months of working in an internship alongside Interapt developers, Ms. Clark was hired by Interapt in May. As a member of the team that performs software quality assurance and testing, she is now paid more than $40,000 a year, about double what she made at Pizza Hut.Ms. Clark is growing confident about her employment future. \u201cThere are endless roles you can play, if you have these skills,\u201d she said.In Colorado, Skillful is working to improve the flow of useful information among job seekers, employers, educators, governments and local training groups. The organization focuses on jobs in tech, health care and advanced manufacturing.Ninety companies have worked with Skillful\u2019s staff and partners to refine and clarify their descriptions of skills. That data has contributed to an online \u201ctraining finder\u201d tool \u2014 built by researchers at LinkedIn \u2014 that shows salary ranges, skills required, training programs and nearby openings for different occupations. (Microsoft acquired LinkedIn, a Skillful partner, last year.)Ron Gallegos Jr., 31, has benefited from Skillful\u2019s program. For years, he worked as a facilities manager overseeing cleaning crews in retail locations. Restless, he wanted to pursue a tech career.He had a side gig fixing televisions, gadgets and PCs. But he was self-taught, had no college degree and needed training and credentials.So in late 2015, Mr. Gallegos quit his job to study full time to gain training and certifications as a computer support technician, and later in network security.At his local community college, Skillful representatives offered tips on job searches, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, financial support and networking. At one event, Mr. Gallegos learned of a state grant available for a security course he wanted to take.The program\u2019s career coaches also emphasized the so-called soft skills of speaking concisely, working cooperatively and attending industry and professional gatherings to meet people, Mr. Gallegos said.Not content to just look for jobs, Mr. Gallegos created one for himself, setting up Mile High IT Services last fall. Now he works as a technology-support contractor for small businesses, and his one-man company is gaining traction, with his income exceeding $50,000 a year.\u201cIt\u2019s all pretty bright for me now,\u201d he said.In Rocket Center, where rocket engines were once built and some composite materials for American fighter jets are manufactured today, IBM occupies a few buildings and employs 350 people, including Mr. Bridges. They are working on cloud computing, cybersecurity, application development and help desks.In the last two years, nearly a third of IBM\u2019s new hires there and in a few other locations have not had four-year college degrees. IBM has jointly developed curriculums with the local community college, as well as one-year and two-year courses aligned with the company\u2019s hiring needs.For companies like IBM, which has 5,000 job openings in the United States, new-collar workers can help it meet its work force needs \u2014 and do it inexpensively if those workers are far away from urban centers, where the cost of living and prevailing wages are higher.\u201cIt makes sense for our business, for the job candidates and for the communities,\u201d said Sam Ladah, IBM\u2019s vice president for talent.The company, which stopped disclosing its American employment in 2007 and regularly cuts jobs in declining businesses, declined to say whether it was increasing its total domestic work force.But at the West Virginia center, IBM plans to hire up to 250 people this year, including more like Mr. Bridges.\u201cNow, we\u2019re recruiting for skills,\u201d Mr. Ladah said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley Billionaires Remaking America\u2019s Schools", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byEducation DisruptedIn San Francisco\u2019s public schools, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, is giving middle school principals $100,000 \u201cinnovation grants\u201d and encouraging them to behave more like start-up founders and less like bureaucrats.In Maryland, Texas, Virginia and other states, Netflix\u2019s chief, Reed Hastings, is championing a popular math-teaching program where Netflix-like algorithms determine which lessons students see.In the space of just a few years, technology giants have begun remaking the very nature of schooling on a vast scale, using some of the same techniques that have made their companies linchpins of the American economy. Through their philanthropy, they are influencing the subjects that schools teach, the classroom tools that teachers choose and fundamental approaches to learning.The involvement by some of the wealthiest and most influential titans of the 21st century amounts to a singular experiment in education, with millions of students serving as de facto beta testers for their ideas. Some tech leaders believe that applying an engineering mind-set can improve just about any system, and that their business acumen qualifies them to rethink American education.But the philanthropic efforts are taking hold so rapidly that there has been little public scrutiny.Tech companies and their founders have been rolling out programs in America\u2019s public schools with relatively few checks and balances, The New York Times found in interviews with more than 100 company executives, government officials, school administrators, researchers, teachers, parents and students.Furthermore, there is only limited research into whether the tech giants\u2019 programs have actually improved students\u2019 educational results.One of the broadest philanthropic initiatives directly benefits the tech industry.Mr. Hastings of Netflix and other tech executives rejected the idea that they wielded significant influence in education. The mere fact that classroom internet access has improved, Mr. Hastings said, has had a much greater impact in schools than anything tech philanthropists have done.\u201cIn our society as a democracy, I think it is healthy that there is a debate about what are the goals of public education,\u201d Mr. Hastings added.Captains of American industry have long used their private wealth to remake public education, with lasting and not always beneficial results.What is different today is that some technology giants have begun pitching their ideas directly to students, teachers and parents \u2014 using social media to rally people behind their ideas. Some companies also cultivate teachers to spread the word about their products.Such strategies help companies and philanthropists alike influence public schools far more quickly than in the past, by creating legions of supporters who can sway legislators and education officials.\u201cWe should be asking a lot more questions about who is behind the curtain,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Mr. Benioff, the billionaire behind Salesforce, had a blunt message for San Francisco\u2019s mayor and its schools superintendent.It was 2013, and the two city officials had approached Mr. Benioff hoping to persuade him to pony up a few million dollars to install Wi-Fi in schools and buy some classroom laptops. But the request seemed too penny-ante to the software mogul.\u201cThat\u2019s when I had to say, \u2018You guys need to think bigger!\u2019\u201d Mr. Benioff recalled in an interview in his San Francisco home. He urged the superintendent to imagine \u201cwhat nirvana would look like\u201d in his schools, if money were no object.With that conversation, Mr. Benioff set in motion a transformation of the relationship between philanthropist and public education. He has emerged as a kind of personal venture capitalist to the city\u2019s public schools \u2014 one intent on remaking a traditional school bureaucracy in Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurial image.Mr. Benioff ultimately pledged $100 million over a decade to the San Francisco Unified School District through his company\u2019s nonprofit arm, Salesforce.org. Unlike conventional benefactors, he is hands-on: School district administrators now submit an annual grant wish list to the Salesforce.org board for review. And Mr. Benioff dispenses not just money, but also management prescriptions.\u201cHe\u2019s almost a public-sector V.C.,\u201d said Richard A. Carranza, who was then the superintendent of San Francisco schools.Mr. Benioff rejected the notion that his approach to education philanthropy was venture-capitalist-like. \u201cWe are not giving them a new religion,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are trying to work with them in a smart way and augment what they are doing.\u201dThe partnership with the district kicked off in 2012 when San Francisco\u2019s mayor, Edwin M. Lee, asked Mr. Benioff to help the city\u2019s middle schools. The mayor wanted to give students a better chance at landing tech jobs. And he wanted Mr. Benioff to pay for it.\u201cI would like to give our kids the opportunity, when they graduate, to see themselves working at those tech companies,\u201d Mr. Lee recalled telling Mr. Benioff.But Mr. Benioff\u2019s \u201cthink bigger\u201d mandate also led to culture clashes. Chief among these: He established a Principal\u2019s Innovation Fund, which awards annual unrestricted grants of $100,000 to the principal at each of the district\u2019s 21 middle and K-8 schools.Administrators subsequently asked principals to select projects that fit with the district\u2019s priorities. Principals have used the grants to start robotics clubs, provide English-tutoring programs for immigrant students and redesign a school library with hangout zones where children can sit with their laptops.Mr. Benioff said he knew that his methods pushed some administrators beyond their comfort zones. \u201cYou\u2019d have the same issue at Salesforce if somebody from the outside came in and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to help you to blah-blah-blah,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBureaucrats would try to stop them.\u201dSo far, Salesforce.org has provided about $20 million to the schools. By hiring additional teachers, schools reduced the average class size across eighth-grade math to 24 students from 33 \u2014 enabling teachers to give more individualized instruction, district officials said.\u201cPeople think school districts are too bureaucratic, can\u2019t be nimble and can\u2019t innovate,\u201d Mr. Carranza said. \u201cWe are proving that this is just not true.\u201dThere are limits to Mr. Benioff\u2019s approach: Most school districts will not be able to secure their own billionaire benefactors. But Mr. Benioff said he intended to keep working with local schools for decades to come.\u201cThis is not just a sea gull strategy where we are dumping a bunch of money and leaving town,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are in the trenches.\u201dThey also share a guardian angel: Mr. Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive.In 2009, he heard about a start-up that used artificial intelligence to adapt math lessons to students. The math program worked a bit like the software Netflix used to customize its video recommendations.\u201cIt is probably fair to say I recognized the power of personalization maybe more than other people, because I had seen it in my own working life,\u201d Mr. Hastings said in an interview at Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles office.There was just one problem: DreamBox Learning was running low on cash. So Mr. Hastings stepped in, donating about $11 million to a nonprofit charter-school fund so it could buy the math platform.Today, more than two million students use the program for supplemental math instruction.DreamBox takes elements from animated video games, with some math lessons populated by aliens that whoosh about and animals that cluck. When students complete a math lesson successfully, they earn points that they can use to unlock virtual rewards.Administrators in some districts said that students so enjoyed the math program that some had begged their parents to let them play DreamBox even during trips to the supermarket. But four parents with children in public schools in Baltimore County, Md., said the program was so stimulating that they had curbed its use at home.\u201cIt really can suck a kid in,\u201d said Brenda Peiffer, a former school counselor, whose son, a third grader, was assigned DreamBox for homework. After noticing that he seemed more interested in spending points to customize his avatar than in actually doing math, she put the kibosh on DreamBox. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing it at home,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect solution for everyone,\u201d she said.And some experienced teachers said it was preposterous to think that algorithms could be better than skilled teachers at adapting to students\u2019 abilities. \u201cWhat you are seeing right now is a heavy push to disrupt and diminish the role of teachers as experts,\u201d said Arienne Adamcikova, a high school teacher in San Mateo, Calif.Mr. Hastings saw it differently.DreamBox Learning tracks a student\u2019s every click, correct answer, hesitation and error \u2014 collecting about 50,000 data points per student per hour \u2014 and uses those details to adjust the math lessons it shows. And it uses data to help teachers pinpoint which math concepts students may be struggling with.Mr. Hastings described DreamBox as a tool teachers could use to gain greater insights into their students, much the way that physicians use medical scans to treat individual patients. \u201cA doctor without an X-ray machine is not as good a doctor,\u201d Mr. Hastings said.Is DreamBox effective?DreamBox is among the minority of digital learning start-ups that have allowed independent academic researchers to examine and publicly report on their data. Still, the platform\u2019s effectiveness is difficult to gauge.Even so, Ms. Woolley-Wilson, DreamBox\u2019s chief executive, described the study as good news, saying it confirmed encouraging reports from teachers. She pointed out that, unlike DreamBox, many other education start-ups lacked research to prove even the most basic assumption: that their apps did not harm students\u2019 educational results.\u201cThat sounds like a low bar,\u201d Ms. Woolley-Wilson said. \u201cBut with the history of education technology, it is not.\u201dMr. Hastings (who is a company director but has no financial interest in the math company) said he was enthusiastic about DreamBox\u2019s potential and predicted wider classroom use for the technology as artificial intelligence improved.Still, he emphasized that he did not view technology generally as a panacea for education. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little cynical and jaundiced about technology,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe tech can help, but it is often oversold.\u201dIf Facebook\u2019s Mr. Zuckerberg has his way, children the world over will soon be teaching themselves \u2014 using software his company helped build.It\u2019s a conception that upends a longstanding teaching dynamic. Now educators are no longer classroom leaders, but helpmates.In public remarks and Facebook posts, Mr. Zuckerberg has described how it works. Students cluster together, working at laptops. They use software to select their own assignments, working at their own pace. And, should they struggle at teaching themselves, teachers are on hand to guide them.\u201cWhen you visit a school like this, it feels like the future \u2014 it feels like a start-up,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told an audience last fall in Peru. \u201cYou get the feeling this is how more of the education system should work.\u201dHe is well on his way to achieving this vision. In 2015, 19 American schools introduced the software that Facebook helped develop. This school year, more than 100 schools use it. Next fall, Mr. Zuckerberg said, he expects that \u201cmany hundreds of more schools will upgrade.\u201dThe effort began a few years ago with visits by Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician who is his wife, to Summit Denali, a middle school in Sunnyvale, Calif. There, classrooms lack walls, and students with laptops often zoom around on caster chairs.Mr. Zuckerberg, she said, admired the software that Summit had created for its schools. He offered Ms. Tavenner a team of Facebook engineers to further develop it and make it available free to schools nationwide.Summit developed its student-directed learning approach after administrators there discovered that their teachers had been so supportive of students, Ms. Tavenner said, that many of its graduates were struggling in college, unprepared to pace themselves or seek help.That is how Summit\u2019s platform came to show students every lesson they will need to complete for the year. They may tackle lessons in any order. At the end of each unit, they take a 10-question multiple-choice test.Not all educators agree. Four former Summit teachers said they found the system problematic. They asked that their names be withheld, saying they feared repercussions for their careers.At Summit, they said, they were required to teach students cognitive skills (like how to construct an argument) while making students responsible for teaching themselves underlying lesson material (like how diverse plants and animals coexist). But some students raced through lessons without actually understanding basic facts, the teachers said, making it difficult to help them structure arguments on specific topics, like climate change.Ms. Tavenner of Summit, however, said that was exactly the point: to make students discover for themselves that they cannot succeed on applied projects without learning the fundamentals.Students think to themselves, \u201c\u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to actually go back and deeply understand it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Tavenner said. \u201cThose are the habits of success that we are trying to instill in kids that simply don\u2019t get instilled in the normal system.\u201dIt can be a steep learning curve.\u201cKids were self-pacing to failure,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.Teachers remedied that by helping students set realistic goals. The school is now happy with the program, she said, and has expanded it to the seventh grade. Even so, Ms. Fisher said, \u201cWe definitely have a concern about the quality of the assessments in the curriculum and whether it actually promotes deeper learning.\u201d\u201cOur hope over the next decade is to help upgrade a majority of these schools to personalized learning and then start working globally as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told the audience. \u201cGiving a billion students a personalized education is a great thing to do.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Ukraine Cyberattack Was Meant to Paralyze, not Profit, Evidence Shows", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The day started like most for Roman N. Klimenko, an accountant in Kiev who had just settled in at his desk, typing at a computer keyboard and drinking coffee. He was unaware that concealed within his tax preparation software lurked a ticking bomb.Both had the appearance of hacker blackmail assaults known as ransomware attacks: screens of infected computers warn users their data will be destroyed unless ransoms are paid.But in Ukraine\u2019s case, a more sinister motive \u2014 paralysis of the country\u2019s vital computer systems \u2014 may have been at work, cybersecurity experts said on Wednesday. And many Ukrainians cast their suspicions on Russia.Cybersecurity experts based their reasoning partly on having identified the group of Ukrainian users who were initially and improbably targeted: tax accountants.All are required by law to use a tax preparation software such as that made by a Ukrainian company, M.E.Doc. The software that runs on Microsoft Windows-based computers was recently updated. Microsoft issued a statement on Wednesday saying it \u201cnow has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate M.E.Doc updater process.\u201dCybersecurity experts said that whoever launched the assault \u2014 on the eve of a holiday celebrating Ukrainian independence \u2014 must have known that M.E.Doc software, which is integrated into Ukrainian government computers, was their gateway.\u201cYou don\u2019t hit the day before Constitution Day for no reason,\u201d said Craig Williams, the senior technical researcher with the Talos division of Cisco, the American technology company, which helped pinpoint the origin of the Tuesday attack.Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and computer operations at Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, the country\u2019s equivalent to the National Security Agency, said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the money.\u201d\u201cThis attack is about disabling how large companies and governments can operate,\u201d he added. \u201cYou get a double whammy of the initial cyberattack and then organizations being forced to shut down their operations.\u201dFor Mr. Klimenko, the software update seemed to go fine \u2014 until hours later. \u201cThe screen became red,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cA warning appeared, and everything on the hard drive was scrambled.\u201dMr. Klimenko quickly realized he had lost all past-year filings, a catastrophe for an accountant. \u201cNow I cannot confirm that I filed,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t understand what happened.\u201dYet to be determined is the source of the virus. But Russia was seen as the prime suspect because it has been engaged in overt and covert warfare with Ukraine since the 2014 revolution that deposed a Kremlin-friendly government. A Russian role has yet to be proven and may never be. Nevertheless, analysts said on Wednesday that if the attackers\u2019 object was to sow chaos at the highest levels in Ukraine, M.E.Doc provided an ideal way. Its software is not only widely installed at government agencies and banks, but is mandatory at many Ukrainian businesses and government agencies.M.E.Doc said in a statement that it could not confirm whether the virus had been distributed through the update, but that it was \u201ccooperating with Ukraine\u2019s cyberpolice on the investigation.\u201dIn another indication that Ukraine was a prime target, the national police said on Wednesday that more than 1,500 companies had filed complaints or appealed for help because of computer intrusions. That was far more than in other countries, although Russia seemed to be the second-most widely affected.While analysts remained cautious about assigning blame, there was little reticence in official circles in Ukraine, particularly as it became clear that the country was the primary target. The timing was an especially clear sign of political intent, they said.Adding to their suspicions, just a few hours before the computer strike, a Ukrainian military intelligence officer, Maksim Shapoval, was killed by a car bomb in Kiev. It was the latest in a string of assassinations of opponents and critics of Russia in the Ukrainian capital.\u201cWar in cyberspace, seeding fear and horror among millions of personal computer users, and inflicting direct material damage from destabilizing the work of businesses and the state, is just one part of the hybrid war of the Russian empire against Ukraine,\u201d Anton Gerashenko, a member of Parliament, wrote on Facebook. The assassination of Mr. Shapoval is another, he wrote. Mr. Gerashenko called the spread of the virus the \u201cmost massive computer attack in the history of Ukraine.\u201d He said it was only \u201cmasked as an effort to extort money from computer users,\u201d with the real goal economic disruption.The timing of the attack was suspect in another way, coming after a rare stretch of upbeat news in Ukraine. Last week, the European Union waived visa requirements for Ukrainians, at least those few fortunate enough to have the means to travel. That was a euphoric moment for many Ukrainians, some of whom could be seen celebrating with raised fists after gliding through immigration lanes in European airports.President Petro O. Poroshenko met in Washington with President Trump, undermining what politicians here say is an overarching Russian goal of weakening Ukraine by highlighting the incompetence and corruption of the government.The attack also comes in the context of a long-running trade war between Russia and Ukraine, on the sidelines of the actual shooting war in eastern Ukraine between the government and Russian-backed separatists.In recent months, the authorities in Kiev have banned Russian software imports and blocked coal shipments from areas under rebel control. The coal embargo cut off a vital financial lifeline in the east, forcing Russia to take some of the coal.The police have established a computer headquarters with the domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., and Cisco to analyze the attack in hopes of tying it to Russia. Though cybersecurity experts have not linked the malware to any particular state or criminal group, a Russian computer attack targeting Ukraine\u2019s economy would be consistent with the recent economic skirmishing, analysts say.\u201cIf you look at Ukrainian cyberspace, M.E.Doc is an excellent carrier for a virus,\u201d Ivan Lozowy, director of the Institute of Statehood and Democracy, said in a telephone interview. The software is used by businesses large and small, and it can transmit a virus to government computers, where it is designed to file returns. \u201cThe Russians are interested in Ukraine having as many problems as possible,\u201d he said.Mark Scott contributed reporting from Rome, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cyberattack \u2018the World Isn\u2019t Ready For\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byNEWARK \u2014 There have been times over the last two months when Golan Ben-Oni has felt like a voice in the wilderness.On April 29, someone hit his employer, IDT Corporation, with two cyberweapons that had been stolen from the National Security Agency. Mr. Ben-Oni, the global chief information officer at IDT, was able to fend them off, but the attack left him distraught.In 22 years of dealing with hackers of every sort, he had never seen anything like it. Who was behind it? How did they evade all of his defenses? How many others had been attacked but did not know it?Since then, Mr. Ben-Oni has been sounding alarm bells, calling anyone who will listen at the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office and the top cybersecurity companies in the country to warn them about an attack that may still be invisibly striking victims undetected around the world.And he is determined to track down whoever did it.\u201cI don\u2019t pursue every attacker, just the ones that piss me off,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni told me recently over lentils in his office, which was strewn with empty Red Bull cans. \u201cThis pissed me off and, more importantly, it pissed my wife off, which is the real litmus test.\u201dThe strike on IDT, a conglomerate with headquarters in a nondescript gray building here with views of the Manhattan skyline 15 miles away, was similar to WannaCry in one way: Hackers locked up IDT data and demanded a ransom to unlock it.But the ransom demand was just a smoke screen for a far more invasive attack that stole employee credentials. With those credentials in hand, hackers could have run free through the company\u2019s computer network, taking confidential information or destroying machines.Worse, the assault, which has never been reported before, was not spotted by some of the nation\u2019s leading cybersecurity products, the top security engineers at its biggest tech companies, government intelligence analysts or the F.B.I., which remains consumed with the WannaCry attack.Were it not for a digital black box that recorded everything on IDT\u2019s network, along with Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s tenacity, the attack might have gone unnoticed.Scans for the two hacking tools used against IDT indicate that the company is not alone. In fact, tens of thousands of computer systems all over the world have been \u201cbackdoored\u201d by the same N.S.A. weapons. Mr. Ben-Oni and other security researchers worry that many of those other infected computers are connected to transportation networks, hospitals, water treatment plants and other utilities.An attack on those systems, they warn, could put lives at risk. And Mr. Ben-Oni, fortified with adrenaline, Red Bull and the house beats of Deadmau5, the Canadian record producer, said he would not stop until the attacks had been shut down and those responsible were behind bars.\u201cThe world is burning about WannaCry, but this is a nuclear bomb compared to WannaCry,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cThis is different. It\u2019s a lot worse. It steals credentials. You can\u2019t catch it, and it\u2019s happening right under our noses.\u201dAnd, he added, \u201cThe world isn\u2019t ready for this.\u201dMr. Ben-Oni, 43, a Hasidic Jew, is a slight man with smiling eyes, a thick beard and a hacker\u2019s penchant for mischief. He grew up in the hills of Berkeley, Calif., the son of Israeli immigrants.Even as a toddler, Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s mother said, he was not interested in toys. She had to take him to the local junkyard to scour for typewriters that he would eventually dismantle on the living room floor. As a teenager, he aspired to become a rabbi but spent most of his free time hacking computers at the University of California, Berkeley, where his exploits once accidentally took down Belgium\u2019s entire phone system for 15 minutes.To his parents\u2019 horror, he dropped out of college to pursue his love of hacking full time, starting a security company to help the city of Berkeley and two nearby communities, Alameda and Novato, set up secure computer networks.He had a knack for the technical work, but not the marketing, and found it difficult to get new clients. So at age 19, he crossed the country and took a job at IDT, back when the company was a low-profile long-distance service provider.As IDT started acquiring and spinning off an eclectic list of ventures, Mr. Ben-Oni found himself responsible for securing shale oil projects in Mongolia and the Golan Heights, a \u201cStar Trek\u201d comic books company, a project to cure cancer, a yeshiva university that trains underprivileged students in cybersecurity, and a small mobile company that Verizon recently acquired for $3.1 billion.Which is to say he has encountered hundreds of thousands of hackers of every stripe, motivation and skill level. He eventually started a security business, IOSecurity, under IDT, to share some of the technical tools he had developed to keep IDT\u2019s many businesses secure. By Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s estimate, IDT experiences hundreds of attacks a day on its businesses, but perhaps only four each year give him pause.Nothing compared to the attack that struck in April. Like the WannaCry attack in May, the assault on IDT relied on cyberweapons developed by the N.S.A. that were leaked online in April by a mysterious group of hackers calling themselves the Shadow Brokers \u2014 alternately believed to be Russia-backed cybercriminals, an N.S.A. mole, or both.Both WannaCry and the IDT attack used a hacking tool the agency had code-named EternalBlue. The tool took advantage of unpatched Microsoft servers to automatically spread malware from one server to another, so that within 24 hours North Korea\u2019s hackers had spread their ransomware to more than 200,000 servers around the globe.The attack on IDT went a step further with another stolen N.S.A. cyberweapon, called DoublePulsar. The N.S.A. used DoublePulsar to penetrate computer systems without tripping security alarms. It allowed N.S.A. spies to inject their tools into the nerve center of a target\u2019s computer system, called the kernel, which manages communications between a computer\u2019s hardware and its software.In the pecking order of a computer system, the kernel is at the very top, allowing anyone with secret access to it to take full control of a machine. It is also a dangerous blind spot for most security software, allowing attackers to do what they want and go unnoticed. In IDT\u2019s case, attackers used DoublePulsar to steal an IDT contractor\u2019s credentials. Then they deployed ransomware in what appears to be a cover for their real motive: broader access to IDT\u2019s businesses.Mr. Ben-Oni learned of the attack only when a contractor, working from home, switched on her computer to find that all her data had been encrypted and that attackers were demanding a ransom to unlock it. He might have assumed that this was a simple case of ransomware.But the attack struck Mr. Ben-Oni as unique. For one thing, it was timed perfectly to the Sabbath. Attackers entered IDT\u2019s network at 6 p.m. on Saturday on the dot, two and a half hours before the Sabbath would end and when most of IDT\u2019s employees \u2014 40 percent of whom identify as Orthodox Jews \u2014 would be off the clock. For another, the attackers compromised the contractor\u2019s computer through her home modem \u2014 strange.The black box of sorts, a network recording device made by the Israeli security company Secdo, shows that the ransomware was installed after the attackers had made off with the contractor\u2019s credentials. And they managed to bypass every major security detection mechanism along the way. Finally, before they left, they encrypted her computer with ransomware, demanding $130 to unlock it, to cover up the more invasive attack on her computer.Mr. Ben-Oni estimates that he has spoken to 107 security experts and researchers about the attack, including the chief executives of nearly every major security company and the heads of threat intelligence at Google, Microsoft and Amazon.With the exception of Amazon, which found that some of its customers\u2019 computers had been scanned by the same computer that hit IDT, no one had seen any trace of the attack before Mr. Ben-Oni notified them. The New York Times confirmed Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s account via written summaries provided by Palo Alto Networks, Intel\u2019s McAfee and other security firms he used and asked to investigate the attack.\u201cI started to get the sense that we were the canary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we recorded it.\u201dSince IDT was hit, Mr. Ben-Oni has contacted everyone in his Rolodex to warn them of an attack that could still be worming its way, undetected, through victims\u2019 systems.\u201cTime is burning,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cUnderstand, this is really a war \u2014 with offense on one side, and institutions, organizations and schools on the other, defending against an unknown adversary.\u201dSince the Shadow Brokers leaked dozens of coveted attack tools in April, hospitals, schools, cities, police departments and companies around the world have largely been left to fend for themselves against weapons developed by the world\u2019s most sophisticated attacker: the N.S.A.For his part, Mr. Ben-Oni said he had rolled out Microsoft\u2019s patches as soon as they became available, but attackers still managed to get in through the IDT contractor\u2019s home modem.Six years ago, Mr. Ben-Oni had a chance meeting with an N.S.A. employee at a conference and asked him how to defend against modern-day cyberthreats. The N.S.A. employee advised him to \u201crun three of everything\u201d: three firewalls, three antivirus solutions, three intrusion detection systems. And so he did.But in this case, modern-day detection systems created by Cylance, McAfee and Microsoft and patching systems by Tanium did not catch the attack on IDT. Nor did any of the 128 publicly available threat intelligence feeds that IDT subscribes to. Even the 10 threat intelligence feeds that his organization spends a half-million dollars on annually for urgent information failed to report it. He has since threatened to return their products.\u201cOur industry likes to work on known problems,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cThis is an unknown problem. We\u2019re not ready for this.\u201dWorse still, Mr. Ben-Oni said, \u201cNo one is running point on this.\u201dLast month, he personally briefed the F.B.I. analyst in charge of investigating the WannaCry attack. He was told that the agency had been specifically tasked with WannaCry, and that even though the attack on his company was more invasive and sophisticated, it was still technically something else, and therefore the F.B.I. could not take on his case.The F.B.I. did not respond to requests for comment.So Mr. Ben-Oni has largely pursued the case himself. His team at IDT was able to trace part of the attack to a personal Android phone in Russia and has been feeding its findings to Europol, the European law enforcement agency based in The Hague.\u201cOnce DoublePulsar is on the machine, there\u2019s nothing stopping anyone else from coming along and using the back door,\u201d Mr. Dillon said.More distressing, Mr. Dillon tested all the major antivirus products against the DoublePulsar infection and a demoralizing 99 percent failed to detect it.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the same computers infected with DoublePulsar for two months and there is no telling how much malware is on those systems,\u201d Mr. Dillon said. \u201cRight now we have no idea what\u2019s gotten into these organizations.\u201dIn the worst case, Mr. Dillon said, attackers could use those back doors to unleash destructive malware into critical infrastructure, tying up rail systems, shutting down hospitals or even paralyzing electrical utilities.Could that attack be coming? The Shadow Brokers resurfaced last month, promising a fresh load of N.S.A. attack tools, even offering to supply them for monthly paying subscribers \u2014 like a wine-of-the-month club for cyberweapon enthusiasts.In a hint that the industry is taking the group\u2019s threats seriously, Microsoft issued a new set of patches to defend against such attacks.

They catch them one by one, each in its own compartment, after inspecting each mosquito\u2019s wing beats to be sure it\u2019s a species that researchers want.\u201cWe were the first to have these,\u201d said Mustapha Debboun, director of mosquito control for the Harris County public health department. \u201cI saw something on the internet about them, and I said, \u2018Whoa \u2014 can I get some?\u2019\u201cThey\u2019ve been wonderful,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy would I want to collect a thousand nuisance mosquitoes if I can avoid it?\u201dThe new traps, made by Microsoft, overcome one of the most frustrating aspects of insect surveillance: There are 56 species of mosquitoes in this buggy bayou city, and conventional traps suck in nearly all of them.Entomologists want only a few disease-carrying types, including Aedes aegypti, which carries Zika and dengue, and Culex quinquefasciatus, which spreads West Nile virus.To find them, scientists must freeze whole batches caught in the usual traps and tediously hand-sort them with tweezers under a microscope.Making matters worse, most traps suck the insects through a fan and then whirl them around a mesh basket for hours.\u201cThe white scales get rubbed off, so you lose the white lyre on the back that tells you it\u2019s aegypti,\u201d said Pamela Stark, a county entomologist. \u201cJune bugs get pulled in and stomp around like cows.\u201dThe Microsoft trap, by contrast, has 64 compartments, arrayed like studio apartments in a skyscraper.If it\u2019s a species the county wants, a clear plastic door shuts \u201clike a Venus fly trap,\u201d Dr. Jackson said. The trap can catch the right species almost 90 percent of the time.Each compartment also records and uploads to a website the time, temperature, humidity and ambient light \u2014 data that records when each species hunts for blood, which is a good time to spray.The first 30 prototypes, of which Houston has 10, cost several thousand dollars each, Dr. Jackson said. But he hopes to get the price down below $300, so even poor countries where malaria and yellow fever kill thousands of victims could afford them.Selling traps is not the point, he explained. He has a far more ambitious goal: to have thousands of them around the world gathering viral DNA the way Google Street View gathers pictures \u2014 for the value of the data.He was thinking about Ebola\u2019s long migration from central Africa to Guinea, he said, when he had an idea.Animals are full of diseases that infect humans, but it\u2019s tricky to get blood samples from gorillas, migrating birds, cave-dwelling bats, poisonous snakes and so on.\u201cThen I realized that\u2019s a mosquito\u2019s full-time job,\u201d Dr. Jackson said. \u201cThere are over 3,600 species, but if we can catch the right ones and do metagenetic sequencing on all the DNA and RNA we find in them, we can see the diseases on the move.\u201dMosquitoes, he suggested, could make that go much faster \u201cby being their field biologists.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why France Is Taking a Lesson in Culture From Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byA new start-up incubator in Paris symbolizes France\u2019s tech ambitions, but can the land of the 35-hour workweek overcome its cultural and regulatory barriers to surpass London and other tech hubs? PARIS \u2014 One thousand start-ups in a refurbished train depot as long as the Eiffel Tower lying down. Rooms scattered with Legos and beanbag chairs. Elevated walkways bridging cargo-container offices and open-air desks. Graffitied railway cars transformed into cafes. The vast project in the heart of Paris, Station F, is a symbol of France\u2019s ambitions to be the start-up capital of Europe. Under an arc of glass and curved concrete, it aims to amass the largest group of entrepreneurs, venture capital firms, incubators and accelerators anywhere in the world.The ambitious effort would seem an expensive, even quixotic undertaking for France, a country better known for a 35-hour workweek and rigid labor laws. And plenty of countries are trying to emulate Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem, with varying degrees of success. Mr. Niel sees Station F as a way to help France steal Britain\u2019s crown as Europe\u2019s premier start-up hub. Raised in a gritty suburb of Paris, he is also trying to empower would-be entrepreneurs, especially marginalized youths. And he wants to capitalize on France\u2019s strength as a producer of math and engineering whizzes. \u201cWhen people talk about France, they don\u2019t see it as a small-league player anymore.\u201dTo get into Station F, start-ups had to have a business prototype and a path to growth. A group of 1,000 companies are expected to move into the space by early July. Here are three of them.Artificial intelligenceFood techHigh-tech fabricsTech leaders say France has significant potential. In 2016, French start-ups attracted record levels of investment from business angels, venture capital, growth equity funds and corporate investors \u2014 on par with Israel and in reach of Britain. Back then, the French start-up culture was virtually nonexistent. There was no ecosystem of incubators and funding. He and his co-founders relied on money from family and friends for six years before venture capital funds stepped in.Today, BlaBlaCar is one of four French \u201cunicorns\u201d (start-ups valued over $1 billion), with 45 million users in 22 countries and a global staff of 500. In France, \u201centrepreneurs used to be seen as people with nothing left to lose,\u201d said Mr. Mazzella, sitting in his company\u2019s sleek new headquarters near the Paris Bourse, a couple of floors down from Facebook\u2019s France operations. \u201cNow it\u2019s become acceptable, even desirable, to be a start-up.\u201d Failure is often stigmatized in French society \u2014 so much that the government started a campaign to persuade people that it\u2019s O.K. to take risks. More than three quarters of workers hold so-called jobs for life, and unions protest when businesses demand workplace flexibility. Taxes are high to fund France\u2019s social welfare system, and the 3,400-page labor code introduces new regulatory requirements on companies as they get larger.It is a culture sometimes at odds with entrepreneurial drive. But Mr. Oumnia has struggled to scale up. When he wanted to offer stock options to lure and retain engineers and designers, the French rules were so complex that he dropped the plan. Social\u00a0taxes pushed his employee costs to nearly twice what they would be in the United States.\u00a0The financial infrastructure isn\u2019t fully developed, either. France has around 4,500 angels, investors who take risks on first-stage start-ups, compared with 18,000 in Britain. While more venture capital is flowing into France, the levels still lag Britain, Germany and Israel.\u201cFrance has plenty of talent to create start-ups,\u201d Mr. Oumnia said. \u201cThe problem is to grow them to midsize companies that create jobs in a country where unemployment is high.\u201d \u201cRegulations and taxes have still not evolved enough to allow start-ups to flourish once they get off the ground,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped President Macron would change things. \u201cSo it\u2019s fine to say, let\u2019s create a thousand start-ups. The question is, \u2018Are you creating the environment for them to become champions after?\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe answer is, \u2018Not yet.\u2019\u201d The biggest vote of confidence in Station F is from Facebook.

{"Headline": "Hacks Raise Fear Over N.S.A.\u2019s Hold on Cyberweapons", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byTwice in the past month, National Security Agency cyberweapons stolen from its arsenal have been turned against two very different partners of the United States \u2014 Britain and Ukraine.The N.S.A. has kept quiet, not acknowledging its role in developing the weapons. White House officials have deflected many questions, and responded to others by arguing that the focus should be on the attackers themselves, not the manufacturer of their weapons.But the silence is wearing thin for victims of the assaults, as a series of escalating attacks using N.S.A. cyberweapons have hit hospitals, a nuclear site and American businesses. Now there is growing concern that United States intelligence agencies have rushed to create digital weapons that they cannot keep safe from adversaries or disable once they fall into the wrong hands.In an email on Wednesday evening, Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House, noted that the government \u201cemploys a disciplined, high-level interagency decision-making process for disclosure of known vulnerabilities\u201d in software, \u201cunlike any other country in the world.\u201dMr. Anton said the administration \u201cis committed to responsibly balancing national security interests and public safety and security,\u201d but declined to comment \u201con the origin of any of the code making up this malware.\u201dIn both cases, the attackers used hacking tools that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft software. The tools were stolen from the N.S.A., and a group called the Shadow Brokers made them public in April. The group first started offering N.S.A. weapons for sale in August, and recently even offered to provide N.S.A. exploits to paid monthly subscribers.Though the identities of the Shadow Brokers remain a mystery, former intelligence officials say there is no question from where the weapons came: a unit deep within the agency that was until recently called \u201cTailored Access Operations.\u201dFor the American spy agency, which has invested billions of dollars developing an arsenal of weapons that have been used against the Iranian nuclear program, North Korea\u2019s missile launches and Islamic State militants, what is unfolding across the world amounts to a digital nightmare. It was as if the Air Force lost some of its most sophisticated missiles and discovered an adversary was launching them against American allies \u2014 yet refused to respond, or even to acknowledge that the missiles were built for American use.\u201cWhether it\u2019s North Korea, Russia, China, Iran or ISIS, almost all of the flash points out there now involve a cyber element,\u201d Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and Central Intelligence Agency chief said in a recent interview, before the weapons were turned against American interests.\u201cI\u2019m not sure we understand the full capability of what can happen, that these sophisticated viruses can suddenly mutate into other areas you didn\u2019t intend, more and more,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. \u201cThat\u2019s the threat we\u2019re going to face in the near future.\u201dUsing the remnants of American weapons is not entirely new. Elements of Stuxnet, the computer worm that disabled the centrifuges used in Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program seven years ago, have been incorporated in some attacks.In the past two months, attackers have retrofitted the agency\u2019s more recent weapons to steal credentials from American companies. Cybercriminals have used them to pilfer digital currency. North Korean hackers are believed to have used them to obtain badly needed currency from easy hacking targets like hospitals in England and manufacturing plants in Japan.And on Tuesday, on the eve of Ukraine\u2019s Constitution Day \u2014 which commemorates the country\u2019s first constitution after breaking away from the Soviet Union \u2014 attackers used N.S.A.-developed techniques to freeze computers in Ukrainian hospitals, supermarkets, and even the systems for radiation monitoring at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant.The so-called ransomware that gained the most attention in the Ukraine attack is believed to have been a smoke screen for a deeper assault aimed at destroying victims\u2019 computers entirely. And while WannaCry had a kill switch that was used to contain it, the attackers hitting Ukraine made sure there was no such mechanism. They also ensured that their code could infect computers that had received software patches intended to protect them.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a refinement of these capabilities, and it only heads in one direction,\u201d said Robert Silvers, the former assistant secretary of cyber policy at the Department of Homeland Security, now a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings.Though the original targets of Tuesday\u2019s attacks appear to have been government agencies and businesses in Ukraine, the attacks inflicted enormous collateral damage, taking down some 2,000 global targets in more than 65 countries, including Merck, the American drug giant, Maersk, the Danish shipping company, and Rosneft, the Russian state owned energy giant. The attack so crippled operations at a subsidiary of Federal Express that trading had to be briefly halted for FedEx stock.\u201cWhen these viruses fall into the wrong hands, people can use them for financial gain, or whatever incentive they have \u2014 and the greatest fear is one of miscalculation, that something unintended can happen,\u201d Mr. Panetta said.Mr. Panetta was among the officials warning years ago of a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d that could bring down the American power grid. But he and others never imagined that those same enemies might use the N.S.A.\u2019s own cyberweapons.For the past six years, government officials were comforted by the fact that their most fervent adversaries \u2014 North Korea, Iran, extremist groups \u2014 did not have the skills or digital tools to inflict major damage. The bigger cyberpowers, Russia and China in particular, seemed to exercise some restraint, though Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election added a new, more subtle threat.\u201cWe now have actors, like North Korea and segments of the Islamic State, who have access to N.S.A. tools who don\u2019t care about economic and other ties between nation states,\u201d said Jon Wellinghoff, the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.So long as flaws in computer code exist to create openings for digital weapons and spy tools, security experts say, the N.S.A. is not likely to stop hoarding software vulnerabilities any time soon.Advertisement"}

He has lived in the United States for 32 years and is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump.\u201cTrump is doing the right thing. He\u2019s doing good for U.S. citizens and America,\u201d he said, switching between English and Hindi to explain that he grew up in Gujarat, the state that Mr. Modi led as chief minister before the 2014 election. \u201cAnd I am from both countries.\u201dBut as Mr. Trump has tried to crack down on immigration and withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, singling India out as a country that has gained unfairly from the accord, the meeting of the two leaders with nationalist leanings and sizable social media followings has taken on a more complicated tone for others in the Indian diaspora.Mr. Trump is \u201ca little bit unpredictable,\u201d said Vasudev Patel, who voted for Mr. Trump and is the secretary of the Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party, USA, Mr. Modi\u2019s party. \u201cNobody knows when he will make what comment. And the next day he will say he didn\u2019t say that. He\u2019s like an Indian politician.\u201d\u201cMost immigrants who come are really trying to make a life for themselves and their families. They\u2019re really concerned about the mortgage on the house, the papers to get their green card, family back at home,\u201d said Devesh Kapur, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an author of \u201cThe Other One Percent: Indians in America.\u201d\u201cThis has now become a wake-up call that they cannot stand as aloof,\u201d he added.The diaspora in the United States sees itself as a wealthy and powerful segment of the population, with Indian-born business leaders, including Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, rising to prominence in recent years.The median income of an Indian-American household is $88,000, well above the $49,800 average for the United States as a whole, according to the Pew survey. And 38 percent of Indian-Americans have advanced degrees, compared with just 10 percent of the rest of the United States population.\u201cIndian-Americans or Indians here are politically active,\u201d said Tanvi Madan, the head of the India Project at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey are in the policy space. They have integrated in a substantial way. You see them on prime-time television show and in sports.\u201dBoth Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump have made efforts to woo the migrant community.Weeks before the election last year, Mr. Trump visited another Indian community in New Jersey, where he proclaimed that the two countries would be \u201cbest friends.\u201d Mr. Modi, once barred from the United States on allegations surrounding the deaths of hundreds of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002, held a rally for 19,000 people at Madison Square Garden on his first trip to the United States shortly after taking office.The Indian prime minister\u2019s meeting with the diaspora on Sunday in Washington was relatively low-key.Those in the crowd, like Srujal Parikh, the executive vice president at the Federation of Indian Associations, were eager to voice specific concerns before Mr. Modi\u2019s visit to the White House.Some are concerned about the relationship between the two countries after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Others want the prime minister to address the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s anti-immigrant comments and its tough stance on visas for skilled workers.\u201cI myself am an immigrant, so I always think this country is built on immigration,\u201d said Mr. Parikh, a Democrat. \u201cThese are the people that bring the country up or down.\u201d\u201cWe must be talking about the immigration issue. We must be talking about how they can make a bridge between the two countries.\u201dRai Das, 24, who works at a small Indian restaurant in Little India, talks of feeling scared lately while walking the streets of New York.\u201cThere is some sort of wave going on,\u201d said Ms. Das, who moved to the United States two years ago to study data analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but people are discriminating.\u201dYet Kiran Sethi, 52, the owner of Reema Jewelers across the street from the restaurant, was so torn by last year\u2019s vote that she did not cast a ballot, despite being a Democratic supporter in the past. She believes the new administration will do more to create jobs for her two daughters, who earned college degrees in the United States and are looking for work.\u201cWhen I see them sitting at home for six months, I feel their pain,\u201d said Ms. Sethi, adding that Indian Americans are a \u201cwell respected\u201d part of American society. \u201cDo you know how hard we work? We try our best that our kids go to school and get a good education.\u201dThis week\u2019s meeting could rest mostly on personal rapport. The two men may seem to have a lot in common, but Mr. Modi\u2019s asceticism stands in stark contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s flamboyant style.From his pan shop in Little India, Mr. Patel remained optimistic.\u201cTheir mind-set is the same,\u201d he said, batting away concerns as he took an oversize stick of sugar cane to the juicer. \u201cModi does good for India, and he\u2019s thinking of the public there. And Trump is the same here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of a member of the Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party, USA.

He specifically asked for ideas that could help the world in the near term, a contrast to long-term personal investments he has made in for-profit companies with social impact, like Blue Origin, a space firm, and The Washington Post.Mr. Bezos wrote, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now \u2014 short term \u2014 at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact.\u201dThe prospect of someone with Mr. Bezos\u2019s wealth \u2014 he is the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a fortune of well over $80 billion \u2014 increasing his giving was greeted enthusiastically by people who work in philanthropy.

{"Headline": "Dissecting Marissa Mayer\u2019s $900,000-a-Week Yahoo Paycheck", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byIt will also conclude the remarkable five-year run of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who was paid nearly a quarter of a billion dollars \u2014 a generous sum even by Silicon Valley\u2019s lofty standards \u2014 while presiding over the company\u2019s continued decline.The company ended up so weakened that its board had little choice but to sell.\u201cEveryone acknowledges that it was a difficult situation to come into,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research who has studied Yahoo for years. \u201cBut the company was not run well under her tenure.\u201dSo why did Ms. Mayer receive more than $900,000 a week? The answer, like so many things about Yahoo, is surprisingly complicated. It is rooted partly in the never-lose structure of modern executive compensation packages, but also in two farsighted investments made long ago by one of Yahoo\u2019s founders, Jerry Yang.Ms. Mayer\u2019s pay was mostly in stock and stock options, and she reaped the rewards alongside the other stockholders.\u201cThe only sign you can point to when evaluating a company over a long period of time is how shareholders have done in the exchange,\u201d said David Wise, who heads North American sales at Korn Ferry Hay Group, a firm that advises companies on executive pay packages. \u201cOver the last five years, Yahoo shareholders couldn\u2019t have done a lot better than this.\u201dMore than most chief executives, Ms. Mayer was working for those shareholders.She was essentially hired by one hedge-fund manager, Daniel S. Loeb, who got her predecessor fired and won three seats on Yahoo\u2019s board in 2012. Mr. Loeb was particularly interested in finding a way to unlock the value of Yahoo\u2019s stake in Alibaba, which was already shaping up to be one of China\u2019s leading internet companies. He pushed the board to recruit a star like Ms. Mayer to get people excited about a company that had been stumbling for years.When Ms. Mayer\u2019s early efforts to turn around Yahoo\u2019s business and spin off the Alibaba shares failed to bear fruit, another hedge fund manager, Jeffrey C. Smith of Starboard Value, led a campaign to push for her ouster. Mr. Smith eventually garnered four board seats so he could keep the pressure on.Yahoo declined to comment for this article, citing this coming Thursday\u2019s shareholder vote to approve the Verizon deal. Ms. Mayer and the board chairman, Maynard Webb, who approved her pay packages, also declined interview requests. So did Mr. Smith.\u201cShe was an attractive, high-visibility C.E.O. trying to bring some excitement and glamour to Yahoo,\u201d said Martha Josephson, a senior partner at the recruiting firm Egon Zehnder, who helped Ms. Mayer find several of her top executives. \u201cAs hard as the job was, she didn\u2019t get a break. If she were an ugly man, she\u2019d be a hero.\u201dOn July 16, 2012, the day she was hired, Yahoo\u2019s share price was $15.65. On Friday, it closed at $50.60. The stock\u2019s performance has topped other venerable tech companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco Systems, and matched the gains of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Yahoo\u2019s most direct competitor.As Yahoo shareholders profited, so did Ms. Mayer. By the time the deal closes, she will have made about $239 million, based on Friday\u2019s share price, according to calculations by Equilar, a provider of executive compensation data.To lure Ms. Mayer from Google and compensate her for options she forfeited there, Yahoo\u2019s board offered her a lucrative employment agreement. She initially received restricted stock worth $35 million and stock options worth $21 million, based on 2012 stock prices for Yahoo, along with a cash salary and bonus. Although she gave up a portion of those stock grants after failing to meet performance targets, the rise in Yahoo\u2019s share price more than offset the losses. She received further stock grants in later years, adding to her overall compensation.Yet most of Ms. Mayer\u2019s paycheck ultimately came from the gains in Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments, over which she had little control. Thanks to an investment made in 2005, Yahoo had a 24 percent stake in Alibaba, which today is China\u2019s leading e-commerce company.When Alibaba first sold shares to the public in 2014, Yahoo sold 140 million shares in the offering. It hung on to 384 million shares, which are now worth about $48 billion.Yahoo also owns about 36 percent of Yahoo Japan, now worth about $9 billion, that it received as part of a deal struck in 1996, shortly after Yahoo was founded.The surging value of those investments \u2014 not any brilliant business moves by Ms. Mayer \u2014 is why Yahoo\u2019s shares went up. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone coming into an oil company, and all of a sudden oil prices go up and the stock goes up,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, the director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cWas the return based on what she did?\u201dStill, managing those investments was a key reason that Yahoo\u2019s board hired Ms. Mayer. Mr. Loeb had accused Yahoo\u2019s previous leaders of mishandling both their core business and the Alibaba relationship. When he and two allies gained seats on the board in 2012, they wanted a new chief executive who would fix both problems.Ms. Mayer delegated the Alibaba issue, hiring an experienced dealmaker, Jacqueline Reses, to be the company\u2019s principal liaison to Alibaba and its leaders, Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai. Ms. Reses helped the Chinese company navigate its initial public offering. She also renegotiated an agreement, struck just before Ms. Mayer arrived, that would have forced Yahoo to sell an additional 122 million shares in the offering. Those extra shares are now worth $15 billion.Ms. Mayer, meanwhile, focused on turning around Yahoo\u2019s internet business. It had missed the mobile revolution and was experiencing steady declines in its display and search advertising. There, her record is decidedly mixed.Yahoo had no real strategy for reaching customers on mobile devices when she arrived \u2014 a sure route to obsolescence as smartphones became the principal internet device for most people.Through a combination of acquisitions and hiring, she vastly expanded Yahoo\u2019s mobile team, which initially produced some buzzy hits like the Yahoo Weather app and Yahoo News Digest, along with more prosaic updates of core Yahoo features like fantasy sports and email. Yet Ms. Mayer largely failed in her quest to make Yahoo a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for more users in online video, search and messaging.Yahoo did acquire advertising technology and built a new ad system from scratch, but marketers never embraced it.Yahoo\u2019s board recognized Ms. Mayer\u2019s failure to meet business targets and docked her bonuses and stock awards in four of the five years she was in charge. But under terms of her original employment agreement, it also granted her new shares annually, easing the sting.Given those missteps, was Ms. Mayer overpaid?\u201cFor the existing amount of compensation, could Yahoo shareholders have done better?\u201d Mr. Wieser of Pivotal Research said. \u201cOr for the same outcome, could they have paid less? Ultimately it\u2019s a hard question to answer.\u201dPeter Monaco, who was a vice president for engineering at Yahoo for three years before leaving for Facebook last September, said Ms. Mayer does not get enough credit for transforming Yahoo\u2019s culture. \u201cShe eliminated the dead wood, drove out the politics, put in place compensation policies that rewarded high achievers and energized people to create great products again,\u201d he said.Arguably, Yahoo was unfixable. The company\u2019s DNA and technology were built around its original identity as a web portal \u2014 a powerful position in the early 2000s but increasingly outmoded in the mobile era, as apps and phone platforms like iOS and Android became the gateways to the internet.\u201cGiven the hand she was dealt, I doubt anyone could have done a better job transforming the culture and making Yahoo healthy again,\u201d Mr. Monaco said.Unlike Kilimanjaro, though, the Yahoo challenge proved insurmountable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Advertising Paradise, Reality Is Just a Conversation Away", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingCANNES, France \u2014 The top hitters in media and advertising descended on the beaches of southern France last week, lounging on yachts and sipping wine and frozen ros\u00e9 slushies as the sun sparkled on the cerulean water of the French Riviera. They networked and cut deals at parties in chic hotels \u2014 the type where rooms cost $500 a night.But even in paradise, it did not take long for conversations at the annual industry conference to inevitably turn to the frustrations of the advertising world.\u201cI\u2019m hypersensitive right now,\u201d said Kathleen Hall, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for global advertising and media. \u201cAs a marketer you always think about risk, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily the first thought. I think now you have to be much more sensitive to the idea of risk and how anything might be construed as a political statement or endorsement or issue-based support.\u201d\u201cThe answer, and I think they agree, is just to raise the bar on monetization,\u201d she said.Ms. Hall said that in today\u2019s polarized media environment, people were \u201cjudging and assuming your values are represented by your media placement.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kind of obsessed,\u201d she said, \u201cwith what\u2019s the right balance between people\u2019s freedom of choice, the media\u2019s freedom of expression and our freedom to reach.\u201dHoopla aside, several advertisers said they were taking a harder line with such platforms, though they were eager to continue working with them. Google and Facebook, in particular, are trying to assuage advertisers\u2019 concerns around objectionable content.\u201cThey\u2019ve sort of got away with trying to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re an open-source technology; it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s them,\u2019\u201d Jerry Buhlmann, the chief executive of Dentsu Aegis Network, said about objectionable content online. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting away with it anymore. They\u2019re too big, they\u2019re making too much money, they employ too many people, and it\u2019s too important politically.\u201dOthers are more concerned with creating standards for determining how effectively ads reach people online and being able to compare metrics across platforms \u2014 basically, what a Facebook video view is worth versus an ad viewed on Snapchat.\u201cWhen digital media was a small part of overall advertising, I think we were learning and developing,\u201d said Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever. \u201cBut now it\u2019s starting to become the biggest part of advertising, and I think in that context, we need to make the industry more efficient.\u201dStill, while marketers are more outspoken, the giant online advertising platforms continue to reign supreme \u2014 and attract hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing.\u201cThe duopoly continues,\u201d said Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s biggest ad group, referring to Google and Facebook. \u201cThere\u2019s been all these challenges \u2014 consumer brand safety, what I call political brand safety with terrorist-type stuff, fake news, fraud, transparency. But I don\u2019t think that anything has happened as yet that we\u2019ve seen of great significance in terms of altering the patterns of spend.\u201dWhile Mr. Sorrell likened the timing of the Publicis announcement to a dinner guest\u2019s insulting the host midway through a meal, he noted in an interview that his firm had sent 500 people to Cannes this year, down from 1,000 last year.Advertisers are eyeing ways to work with Amazon, as well as how they can take advantage of the Amazon Echo, particularly as Google and Apple follow the company\u2019s lead in selling voice-activated devices for the home.\u201cWe\u2019re working with Amazon as a retail partner \u2014 which we have a big booming business with them \u2014 and we\u2019re working with them as a media partner,\u201d said Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble. He said Procter & Gamble was moving money there.\u201cI really believe voice is going to be big,\u201d Mr. Weed said. \u201cBrands, of course, are known by their visual representation, but brands don\u2019t have a voice, and I think we\u2019re going to have to think about what is the tone of voice for different brands and how to engage with it.\u201dMs. Lemkau of JPMorgan Chase pointed to Amazon\u2019s data, the millions of verified Chase cardholders who are spending on the site, its media and content arm, its ad serving platform and the potential for marketing through packaging.\u201cI think they will be the biggest presence here potentially one day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you think of alternatives to the big two, they have a really compelling case.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Move Over, Bitcoin. Ether Is the Digital Currency of the Moment.", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byThe price of Bitcoin has hit record highs in recent months, more than doubling in price since the start of the year. Despite these gains, Bitcoin is on the verge of losing its position as the dominant virtual currency.The value of Ether, the digital money that lives on an upstart network known as Ethereum, has risen an eye-popping 4,500 percent since the beginning of the year.With the recent price increases, the outstanding units of the Ether currency were worth around $34 billion as of Monday \u2014 or 82 percent as much as all the Bitcoin in existence. At the beginning of the year, Ether was only about 5 percent as valuable as Bitcoin.The sudden rise of Ethereum highlights how volatile the bewildering world of virtual currency remains, where lines of computer code can be spun into billions of dollars in a matter of months.Against this backdrop, Ether has been gaining steam. The two-year old system has picked up backing from both tech geeks and big corporate names like JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft, which are excited about Ethereum\u2019s goal of providing not only a digital currency but also a new type of global computing network, which generally requires Ether to use.If recent trends continue, the value of Ethereum\u2019s virtual currency could race past Bitcoin\u2019s in the coming weeks. Virtual currency fanatics are monitoring the value of each and waiting for the two currencies to switch place, a moment that has been called \u201cthe flippening.\u201d\u201cThe momentum has shifted to Ethereum \u2014 there is no doubt about that,\u201d said William Mougayar, the founder of Virtual Capital Ventures, which invests in a variety of virtual currencies and start-ups. \u201cThere is almost nothing you can do with Bitcoin that you can\u2019t do with Ethereum.\u201dEven though most of the people buying Ether and Bitcoin are individual investors, the gains that both have experienced have taken what was until very recently a quirky fringe experiment into the realm of big money. The combined value of all Ether and Bitcoin is now worth more than the market value of PayPal and is approaching the size of Goldman Sachs.Investors buying Ether are placing a bet that people will want to use the Ethereum network\u2019s computing capabilities and will need the currency to do so. But that is far from a sure thing. And real-world use of the network is still scant.The fact that there are fewer real-world uses for Ethereum has many market experts expecting a crash similar to the ones that have followed previous run-ups in the price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Even during recent pullbacks, though, the value of Ether has generally continued to gain on Bitcoin in relative terms.The Ether he holds has made him a millionaire many times over, but he has generally avoided commenting on the price increase in Ether.Mr. Buterin was inspired by Bitcoin, and the software he built shares some of the same basic qualities. Both are hosted and maintained by the computers of volunteers around the world, who are rewarded for their participation with the new digital tokens that are released onto the network each day.Because the virtual currencies are tracked and maintained by a network of computers, no government or company is in charge. The prices of both Bitcoin and Ether are established on private exchanges, where people can sell the tokens they own at the going market price.But Ethereum was designed to do much more than just serve as a digital money. The network of computers hooked into Ethereum can be harnessed to do computational work, essentially making it possible to run computer programs on the network, or what are referred to as decentralized applications, or Dapps. This has led to an enormous community of programmers working on the software.But the way that Mr. Buterin and other developers dealt with the problems, returning the hacked Ether to users, won him the respect of many in the corporate world.\u201cIt was good to see that there is governance on Ethereum and that they can fix issues in a timely manner if they have to,\u201d said Eric Piscini, who leads the team looking into virtual currency technology at the consulting firm Deloitte.Many applications being built on Ethereum are also raising money using the Ether currency, in what are known as initial coin offerings, a play on initial public offerings.Start-ups that have followed this path have generally collected Ether from investors and exchanged them for units of their own specialized virtual currency, leaving the entrepreneurs with the Ether to convert into dollars and spend on operational expenses.These coin offerings, which have proliferated in recent months, have created a surge of demand for the Ether currency. Just last week, investors sent $150 million worth of Ether to a start-up, Bancor, that wants to make it easier to launch virtual currencies. If projects like Bancor stumble, Ether could as well.Many of the companies using Ethereum are building their own private versions of the software, which won\u2019t make use of the Ether currency. Speculators are betting that these companies will eventually plug their software into the broader Ethereum network.There is, though, also the possibility that none of these big trials come to fruition, and the current excitement fizzles out, as has happened many times in the past with Bitcoin after big price surges.\u201cI hope this is the year where we start to close the gap between the speculative value and the actual value,\u201d Mr. Mougayar said. \u201cThere is a lot at stake right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charles P. Thacker Dies at 74; Helped Design Early Personal Computer", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "Supported byCharles P. Thacker, an electrical engineer who played an early, central role in some of the most important ideas in personal computing and computer networking, died on Monday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 74.His daughter Christine Thacker said the cause was complications of esophageal cancer.In the 1970s, Mr. Thacker was part of a group that designed the first modern personal computer, the Alto, working out of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, known as PARC.The Alto, completed in 1973, would become part of personal computing lore, in part because of a visit Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, made to PARC for a demonstration of the computer. The visit became famous for what Mr. Jobs took away with him.Mr. Thacker and his colleagues who designed the Alto \u2014 Butler Lampson, Alan Kay and Robert Taylor \u2014 had proved prescient when they built into the computer what is known as a graphical user interface, the technology that Apple and Microsoft would borrow from in creating their Macintosh and Windows operating systems.\u201cThe Alto was the thing that galvanized the hardware and software technology of the next 45 years, and astoundingly it was done by Chuck in just three months,\u201d said Mr. Kay. \u201cWe used to say that Chuck threw the parts up in the air and they fell down Alto.\u201dWith his work on the Alto, Mr. Thacker was also well ahead of his time in tablet computing. In 1968, Mr. Kay had the idea to build a portable computing machine he called the Dynabook, which he envisioned as far more than a stand-alone device. Rather, it would enable a user to stay in a networked environment, the likes of which were just being developed at the time.Knowing such a device would be many years in the making, Mr. Kay described to Mr. Thacker a prototype, much larger than a tablet, that would eventually run the software of the Dynabook.\u201cChuck loved this idea, and this became part of his goals for the Alto,\u201d Mr. Kay said. \u201cIts original name was Interim Dynabook.\u201dMr. Thacker left Xerox PARC in 1983 to help start Digital Equipment Corporation\u2019s Systems Research Center in Palo Alto, where he led the design of an experimental computer called Firefly.But he did not give up on the idea of a tablet computer. (\u201cIn systems research, one of the most motivating things is that you want the device yourself,\u201d he said of his persistence.)In 1997, he went to work for Microsoft and within two years had joined the company\u2019s Tablet PC group and was managing the design of the first prototypes of the new device.Yet commercial success for the tablet remained vexingly elusive until a number of technologies \u2014 processing, display, battery and storage \u2014 could converge. When the Apple iPad was introduced in 2010, the commercial prospects for tablet computing brightened considerably.Although Mr. Thacker was principally a hardware engineer, he was also a deft programmer. \u201cHe was a hardware genius who was also great at software,\u201d Mr. Kay said.Mr. Thacker\u2019s foresight did not stop with computers. While at PARC, he helped invent Ethernet, a combination of hardware and software for linking computers. Like personal computers, Ethernet-based local-area networks have become ubiquitous.Charles Patrick Thacker was born in Pasadena, Calif., on Feb. 26, 1943. His mother, Fern, was a cashier and secretary at Boys, a grocery store in Los Angeles. His father, Ralph, an electrical engineer, left the family when Mr. Thacker was young. His mother raised her two sons on her own.When he was 16, Mr. Thacker received a scholarship to study physics at the California Institute of Technology. He soon transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1963, he met Karen Baker, an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, who had returned home to Pasadena for the summer. In love, Mr. Thacker bucked the norms of the era and followed Karen north, transferring this time to UC Berkeley. They married in 1964. She survives him.Besides her and their daughter Christine, he is survived by another daughter, Kathy Bellairs, and two grandchildren.Mr. Thacker worked his way through UC Berkeley as a machinist for a man named Jack Hawley, whom Mr. Thacker described as \u201cthe sole proprietor of an inventorship\u201d in Albany, Calif.\u201cI made him a deal he couldn\u2019t refuse,\u201d Mr. Thacker told an interviewer for the Computer History Museum in 2007. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll design your electronics for you, if you teach me how to run all your machine tools.\u2019\u201dMr. Thacker received his bachelor\u2019s degree in physics in 1967. \u201cI wanted to be a physicist, not because of the physics but because of the engineering part of it,\u201d he said.Indeed, he had already gravitated to computing while an undergraduate, and in 1968 he went to work for the university\u2019s Project Genie, an effort that resulted in an early computer time-sharing system. The Genie team later formed the Berkeley Computer Corporation, where Mr. Thacker led the design of a processor for a new computer.While the corporation was not a commercial success, it supplied the core group of technologists for the newly formed Xerox PARC. Mr. Thacker, along with a small group of others, went to work there in 1970.Before his retirement from Microsoft, in February, Mr. Thacker was running a research laboratory, moving back and forth between the research and the product development sides of the company. He even did a stint working on Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360 game console when a top engineer on the project became ill.Christine Thacker said her father had been especially animated when he talked about work.\u201cWhen I was 8 years old, he would read to me from \u2018The Feynman Lectures on Physics,\u2019\u201d she said, referring to Richard P. Feynman, the Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist, \u201cand explain to me how bitmap displays render fonts. He\u2019d talk about his work even if we had no idea what it was. Everything he worked on was this great big adventure for him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yet Jeff Bezos\u2019 company won\u2019t walk away with all the spoils. Customers are worried about being locked in, and that will keep competitors in business.Companies have come to realize it is simpler, cheaper and more convenient to store data and run applications on servers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsofts. Uncertainty over the cost implications is receding rapidly, according to surveys conducted by Bain and Morgan Stanley and highlighted by Kleiner Perkins\u2019s Mary Meeker in her annual \u201cInternet Trends\u201d presentation last week.The providers of cloud services have grown rapidly as a result. First-quarter revenue at Amazon Web Services was about 3.5 times as big as in the same period three years ago. At $3.7 billion for the period, it accounted for more than 10 percent of Amazon\u2019s total sales, and it was by far the most profitable slice. The operating margin for Amazon Web Services has nearly doubled over the last two years to around 25 percent.Not coincidentally, information technology managers have started to worry about the difficulty of switching cloud suppliers \u2014 a particular problem if one outfit, like Amazon Web Services, comes to dominate. This concern rocketed between 2012 and 2015, according to Ms. Meeker, with the proportion of respondents bothered by it surging from 7 percent to 22 percent.As in other sectors including, for instance, finance, companies will often ensure that at least two suppliers of each service stay in business, to retain the option of shifting between the two and maintain price competition. This doesn\u2019t always happen in technology. Alphabet\u2019s Google will, for example, claim 78 percent of United States search revenue this year, eMarketer estimated.For all the market sway enjoyed by Amazon Web Services, that means enterprises will want Microsoft and Alphabet to stay in the game.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Business Traveler Worried About Security: You\u2019re Not Alone", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byItinerariesCorporate travel managers have long had their hands full dealing with political unrest, terrorism and severe weather around the world. But now, they are contending with new complications \u2014 issues like security at border crossings and the legalities of data searches of electronic devices at airports.They are holding conferences and seminars, like the Global Travel Risk Summit on Tuesday in New York, to discuss the new concerns about global travel.What, he asked the group, are travel managers at companies doing to adapt their programs? \u201cAre they doing it quickly enough? Smart enough?\u201d he asked.One panelist, Julia Fidler, who manages travel for Microsoft, said, \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more requests from travelers who ask, \u2018Tell me what to do; who do I go to to ask?\u2019\u201dShe added, \u201cThey still want to talk to somebody, know what number to dial, and if there will be somebody there to assist them.\u201d\u201cThe pace of change is faster now than ever before and reaching to more regions not traditionally considered high risk,\u201d Greeley Koch, executive director at the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, said in an interview. \u201cAnd we are starting to see the direct impact on the security and well-being of the traveler.\u201d His group worked with American Express Global Business Travel on the survey.Mr. Koch said more companies were creating policies or strengthening existing ones to clarify what employees can and cannot do and to better assist them when travel disruptions occur. The survey indicated that 47 percent of companies had or planned to introduce training to address safety concerns in the next one to two years; 40 percent were discussing the option.Stephen Barth, a lawyer and professor of hospitality law at the University of Houston, said difficulties often arose from incidents abroad because the legal responsibilities were not clear, even to experts. Workers\u2019 compensation laws in the United States do not always protect employees once they leave the country, unlike in Britain, where the Corporate Manslaughter Act \u201cclarifies the responsibility of employers if an employee is put in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said.Many problems can be prevented or managed with minor precautions, like learning about a foreign country in advance and obtaining travel insurance coverage.There has been a steady increase since 2012 in the number of Americans buying insurance for international trips, for emergency medical care, medical evacuation and repatriation in the case of a political event or act of God, according to the travel insurance comparison website Squaremouth. But many still do not realize the need, experts say.\u201cIt\u2019s a misconception that credit cards will cover\u201d most medical needs abroad, said Chris Carnicelli, chief executive of Generali Global Assistance. For many travelers, he added, buying supplemental coverage has \u201cnot been top of mind.\u201dThe industry trend, Mr. Carnicelli said, is to make policies easier to understand and provide coverage \u201cmore tailored toward individual travel needs.\u201d Identify theft protection, for example, is increasingly important in some countries.\u201cFake accounts are so widespread, it\u2019s an industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world has changed.\u201dNearly a third of travel managers in the corporate travel association survey reported increased concern about data privacy, but few corporations were addressing it with policies. Only 6 percent did not permit the use of public Wi-Fi with business devices.\u201cWe have had to up our game,\u201d said Dennis J. Garritan, co-managing partner of the private equity firm Palmer Hill Capital. \u201cThe old rules proved insufficient.\u201dHe noted that travel to emerging markets was more important as business had become increasingly competitive. Widespread security issues also mean that clients need to be reassured, he said. Sometimes, using a secure line for phone conversations is enough, Mr. Garritan said, but personal trips are increasingly necessary.He and colleagues have strategies to keep themselves \u2014 and their data \u2014 safe on high-risk business trips: no mobile phones, laptops or tablets (disposable phones are used for personal conversations); no charging of devices at airports or hotels; no use of open Wi-Fi, especially in China; required annual travel safety training; changing of all business and personal passwords after travel; wiping clean all borrowed or rented local devices used on trips and more robust travel insurance.Even if a visitor is airlifted out, initial care is local and the first few hours are critical, Dr. Reynolds said. \u201cVisitors are at the same risk as residents. No matter how good your insurance, you can\u2019t buy your way out.\u201dBut there are initiatives to upgrade services, like the move to create a universal emergency response telephone number. Currently, more than 100 numbers are in use worldwide, and about a third of the world\u2019s countries have no number, said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of the department for management of noncommunicable diseases, disability, violence and injury prevention at the W.H.O.The W.H.O. is working to improve emergency care around the world. Much can be done with fewer resources, Dr. Krug said, \u201clike better personnel training and simply equipped ambulances.\u201dDr. Garritan of Palmer Hill Capital said he and colleagues enrolled in the smart traveler program because they do not take GPS-enabled devices on high-risk business trips. \u201cIt is always reassuring,\u201d he said, for the State Department to \u201cknow where you are, when you will be there and when you\u2019re scheduled to come back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Women Don\u2019t See Themselves as Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewFor many Americans, starting their own business is the manifestation of the American dream: Take a risk, work hard, get rich. So why don\u2019t more women do it?\u201cWomen are just outside of those established networks, and if you\u2019re outside the networks, you don\u2019t get the knowledge, you don\u2019t get the opportunities, you don\u2019t get the contacts and you don\u2019t get the funding,\u201d said Susan Coleman, a business professor at the University of Hartford and co-author of the Third Way report. She wrote it with Alicia Robb, a research fellow at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the founder of Next Wave Ventures, for female angel investors.Women are also left out of financing networks, which are predominantly male and often operate through referrals from friends. They are more likely to invest their own money instead of outside capital in their businesses, and when they seek investors, they ask for less.Networks are important for another reason: emotional support. \u201cLaunching an entrepreneurial venture is a lonely and sometimes scary undertaking, and you need to have people to talk to,\u201d Ms. Coleman said.Incubators \u2014 physical spaces where people start businesses and meet other entrepreneurs as well as lawyers, accountants and investors \u2014 don\u2019t help. In a study of 18,000 firms started in incubators, only 6 percent were by women.Jennifer Dionisio said she had no female role models when she started her company, Three Sisters Farm and Dairy, last year. She sells goat milk and beef, and she hopes to start a cheese shop and farm-to-table restaurant.Living in a small town, Pueblo, Colo., made it easier, she said, because she knows the local lawyer and bankers. \u201cI would be apprehensive if I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. Even so, she says, people at the local feed store assume she can\u2019t load bags of feed or drive tractors, and others come to the farm and ask for her boss.She said she was trying to be a role model for her three daughters. She named the farm after them and hopes they will take over someday. \u201cThen they can work for themselves, be independent and still make a living,\u201d she said. \u201cEven my 7-year-old daughter can run a Bobcat\u201d tractor now.Silicon Valley is even more of a bubble than the rest of small-business America.They wanted to find out whether the problem was not enough women with the education, training or desire to start companies, or whether it was factors like bias or closed-off networks.They concluded there were plenty of qualified women. Women earn 40 percent to 50 percent of degrees in science and engineering, and they represent 30 percent of the software industry work force. But they are less likely to have information about how to become an entrepreneur, to see female role models and to know venture capitalists.Female venture capitalists are more likely to invest in female entrepreneurs, Mr. Gompers has found. Yet 91 percent of venture capitalists are male. Eighty-six percent are white, and 11 percent are Asian. Most worked in investment banking, private equity or consulting, and went to Harvard, Stanford or the University of Pennsylvania.Unsurprisingly, the backgrounds of venture-backed entrepreneurs are pretty much the same. Ninety-one percent are men, 80 percent are white and 16 percent are Asian. Most have degrees from a similar set of colleges and have worked at big tech companies like Google or Microsoft.\u201cThe problem when you have five white men who all went to the same business school and worked in the same firms is their networks overlap, so they don\u2019t draw from a very wide source of entrepreneurial deal flow,\u201d Mr. Gompers said.Sheila Lirio Marcelo, the founder of Care.com, a service for helping families find caregivers, was surprised to see that insularity after growing up in the Philippines, where both her parents started businesses.

{"Headline": "Developers Lure Buyers to Cities, Even as Prices Stall", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Peter Fader, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has long yearned for the city life. For 20 years, though, he and his wife, Mina, have deferred that dream, living in a Philadelphia suburb to raise their two children in a 3,500-square-foot home.That will change this month, when the couple \u2014 with the children grown and gone \u2014 moves into a new luxury high-rise in the heart of Philadelphia. They will have expansive 11th-floor views, an easy walk to the shops, restaurants and cultural attractions of downtown and a car-free commute to work.The Faders are like many other empty-nesters in their 50s and 60s, as well as young professionals, helping fuel a boom in multifamily housing in the country\u2019s big cities. The growth has been so strong, for so long, that some leading economists have started warning about overdevelopment, worried that flattening prices could leave builders struggling to pay their debts.The Federal Reserve in February expressed \u201cgrowing concern\u201d about commercial property, including large apartment buildings, in cities like New York, Boston and San Francisco. An index of national commercial property prices from Green Street Advisors, a real estate research company, has gained sharply since the recession although has largely stalled since late 2016.But developers do not appear to be pulling back, no matter the warnings, believing that there are many more people like the Faders. In a sign that the supply of housing will continue to swell in coming months, the number of building permits, a forward-looking indicator, rose 5.7 percent in April compared with a year earlier, the Census Bureau said.\u201cIt\u2019s exploding,\u201d said Ron Caplan, the president of PMC Property Group, a Philadelphia-based developer of rental properties in markets including Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Columbia, S.C., referring to the growth in demand for urban residential rentals.Mr. Caplan said that his company\u2019s experience was at odds with the fears about overbuilding.\u201cSo far the development that we\u2019ve done has been embraced by a continuing larger population,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have found that the buildings continue to fill up.\u201dIn Baltimore, PMC just finished work on a downtown apartment building that has been leased at the quickest rate Mr. Caplan has seen since starting the company in 1981. He expects the property to be fully leased in six months, about twice as fast as is typical.In Columbia, the company is now leasing the Palmetto Compress, a former cotton warehouse, after creating 200 apartments for the local student population. With two months\u2019 leasing to go before the start of the new school year, 90 percent of the building is leased, Mr. Caplan said.He attributed the surging demand to the increasing livability of downtown areas that were once rife with crime and poverty but that have become more appealing with the influx of new residents who are educated, professional and often wealthy.\u201cWhat they have discovered is that it\u2019s a lot more fun being social than it is going home at the end of the day, closing the door and watching television,\u201d Mr. Caplan said.In Seattle, Lake Union Partners, a local developer, has built seven rental-apartment houses since 2012 for a total investment of about $200 million, with a vacancy rate of 4 percent, said Joe Ferguson, the company\u2019s principal.Mr. Ferguson said that the market was being driven by vigorous hiring by major employers, including Amazon and Microsoft, and by employees\u2019 increasing willingness to move to previously marginal areas like Pioneer Square, Seattle\u2019s oldest neighborhood. The employers include Weyerhaeuser, a lumber company, which has responded to the influx of young adults by moving from a suburban location about 40 minutes south of downtown Seattle to a new building in Pioneer Square.\u201cThey are doing this because they are having to compete for a lot of the same talent as the tech companies and other major employers who are recruiting at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to offer something that\u2019s attractive to their future employees.\u201dIn the Milwaukee area, some baby boomers are moving into the downtown area from the suburbs, encouraged by suburban housing prices that have finally recovered from the 2008-9 crash, said Barry Mandel, the president of Mandel Group, a developer of multifamily buildings. Some of the boomers are buying condos while others are opting to rent city properties and preserve the capital from the sale of their houses.Other older clients are driving the construction of urban enclaves, or \u201cnodes,\u201d within suburban developments, where suburban amenities like shops, restaurants and religious institutions are available within walking distance of people\u2019s homes, Mr. Mandel said.The \u201cnodes\u201d are in strong demand from buyers in their 40s and older, Mr. Mandel said, noting that one such development was 100 percent leased before construction ended about 18 months ago, while demand in another community was unexpectedly strong.While suburbanites may welcome the opportunity to sell their lawn mowers or donate clothing to charity when moving to city apartments, there are limits to their zeal for downsizing, said Carl Dranoff, the developer of Philadelphia\u2019s One Riverside building, where the Faders are moving.The 82 apartments originally planned for One Riverside, a 22-story building, have been reduced to 68, the result of combining some units for buyers who wanted more space after years in the suburbs, Mr. Dranoff said. By the official opening on May 2, 80 percent of the building \u2014 the first newly constructed condo tower in central Philadelphia for seven years \u2014 had been sold.The building, offering marble counters, private balconies, and river views, sells 1,000- to 1,100-square-foot apartments for $1.5 million to $2 million, Mr. Dranoff said. A 2,500-square-foot unit costs from $2.5 million to $2.8 million.While such prices are beyond the reach of most buyers, they are contributing to a citywide erosion in affordability, and mirror the trend in other big cities, said Rick Sauer, the executive director of the Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations, which advocates affordable housing, among other causes.\u201cThere is a larger impact on the overall cost of housing in the city,\u201d Mr. Sauer said. \u201cWhile there\u2019s new housing stock being created on the high end in particular to respond to the demand, over all what you are seeing is that housing costs in the city are going up very significantly.\u201dAt One Riverside, the Faders recognized that the building met many of their long-term goals for city living and jumped at the chance to buy.\u201cIt\u2019s the last place we\u2019re ever going to buy \u2014 we\u2019re here for keeps,\u201d Professor Fader said. \u201cWe are all in on the condo because the city has so much to offer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The G.E. Puzzle, and the Pieces a New Chief Will Have to Make Fit", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byJohn Flannery, the new leader at General Electric, has some breathing room. He told G.E. employees on Monday that he would \u201ctake a fresh look at the company\u201d and do so with \u201ca sense of urgency.\u201dMr. Flannery, who will become chief executive on Aug. 1, told Wall Street analysts that his review would be completed by fall.Many investors and analysts are pushing for a smaller, simpler company, which they say would lift earnings and G.E.\u2019s underperforming stock. In a report on Monday, Scott Davis, an analyst at Barclays, declared that \u201cG.E. needs an \u2018AT&T-style\u2019 breakup.\u201dBut as Mr. Flannery examines G.E.\u2019s collection of businesses, he must confront several questions. What is the corporate core? What is less so? What is sure to go? What are unknowns?Here is a look at how the pieces stack up.These are the G.E. heartland operations \u2014 machines representing the most advanced application of the touchstone technologies of the 125-year-old company: materials science and physics.They also exploit what Jeffrey R. Immelt, the departing C.E.O., has termed the emerging \u201cthird pillar\u201d of G.E. technology in the future \u2014 data and smart software.Sensors on a new jet engine, for example, stream data on temperature, fuel consumption, vibration and other measurements so the engine, in its own way, signals that it needs preventive maintenance.Jet engines and power turbines reflect the most lucrative business model for G.E.: an equipment sale that ensures years of revenue from services. The services revenue over the lifetime of a G.E. jet engine, which can be 30 years or more, is eight times the value of the initial engine sale, analysts estimate. That stream of revenue carries high profit margins.The two products use similar technology. A new gas-fired generator for an electrical utility fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit and weighs 950,000 pounds \u2014 and it is essentially a giant, stationary jet engine.Depressed oil prices contributed considerably to the pressure Mr. Immelt felt from shareholders unhappy with G.E.\u2019s profit performance. The price slump battered demand for its oil-field equipment, and operating income in its oil and gas business fell 43 percent last year.Mr. Immelt continued to invest in that business despite the downturn. In October, G.E. announced its plan to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes. It will create a new publicly traded company, and G.E. will pay Baker Hughes shareholders $7.4 billion in a special dividend. The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division approved the deal on Monday, and the European Union gave its O.K. last month.Though in a down cycle, the oil and gas business has characteristics in common with jet engines and power generators. It is heavy equipment that brings in a lot of services revenue, and it lends itself to efficiency gains using sensor data and software.The Baker Hughes deal, analysts say, gives the combined entity a strong lineup of onshore and offshore equipment and services offerings, making it a more attractive property.\u201cIt allows G.E. to make a staged exit from the oil and gas business in the future, if they choose to do so, much as it did with NBCUniversal,\u201d said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, referring to the sale of the media company to Comcast in two steps, in 2011 and 2013.Transportation \u2014 mainly locomotives \u2014 is another heavy-equipment business with solid service revenue. It is not a big business for G.E., but it is a solid one.The health care business combines medical imaging equipment, like CT scanners, and a life sciences business with technologies for use in the fast-growing fields of molecular and precision medicine.That business, analysts say, could be spun out in a few years as a free-standing entity with its own stock, which, if successful, could be valuable not only to shareholders but also as a recruiting tool for luring researchers and a currency for acquisitions.The light bulb is a storied product in G.E. history, but its moment seems to have passed. The company is looking to sell that unit, The Wall Street Journal reported in April, talking to investment banks and seeking a sale of about $500 million.G.E. wants to sell its business in consumer light bulbs and residential LED lighting, but would hold onto a separate business, Current, which supplies commercial LED light and services to cities and companies. That business involves higher-end technology and the sale of energy-management services.Mr. Flannery fully backed Mr. Immelt\u2019s strategy of investing heavily to build up G.E.\u2019s software and data-analysis capability.The future for G.E., Mr. Immelt insisted, is to become a \u201cdigital-industrial company,\u201d with sensor data and software a \u201cthread\u201d for delivering greater efficiency in its factories, products and services.GE Digital, begun in 2011, has been set up as its own unit and employs more than 1,400 people at its headquarters in San Ramon, Calif., east of San Francisco.\u201cJeff Immelt has done a lot at G.E. that he\u2019s not getting credit for now, including the digital strategy,\u201d said Robert Atchinson, a founder and managing director of Adage Capital Management, a fund that holds G.E. shares.\u201cBut we won\u2019t know for two years or so whether these new initiatives pay for themselves.\u201dMr. Davis of Barclays sees the digital strategy as sound but recommends a less costly, less risky approach. A joint venture, he said, \u201cwith someone like Microsoft or Google makes the most sense.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Texas Governor Revives Stalled Transgender Bathroom Bill", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 Gov. Greg Abbott reignited one of the most divisive issues in Texas politics on Tuesday, calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session of the Legislature in part to consider a bill that would reinforce the state\u2019s effort to regulate bathroom use by transgender people in public buildings.An attempt during the regular session by conservative lawmakers and pastors to pass legislation to regulate bathroom use had been unsuccessful by the time the session ended on Memorial Day. But on Tuesday, Mr. Abbott, a Republican, ordered a 30-day special session starting in July and put on the agenda a bathroom bill that would prevent municipalities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances designed to protect transgender people. The special-session agenda also includes bills that would limit property taxes and keep several state agencies operating.\u201cAt a minimum, we need a law that protects the privacy of our children in our public schools,\u201d Mr. Abbott told reporters at the Capitol in Austin.In doing so, Mr. Abbott ignored the concerns of local and national business leaders but earned swift praise from social conservatives, some of whom had complained that he had remained largely on the sidelines in the debate. Critics said Mr. Abbott, a former judge who is viewed by many as more cautious than his predecessor, Rick Perry, had capitulated to the extreme right, and to one of his Republican colleagues, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who led the push for the restrictions.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Patrick praised what he called the \u201cbig and bold special-session agenda,\u201d which he said \u201csolidly reflects the priorities of the people of Texas.\u201d\u201cMy take is that he is clearly panicked about the far right, and he feels the need to shovel as much red meat to the far right of his party as he can,\u201d said State Representative Chris Turner, a Democrat who was the campaign manager for Wendy Davis, Mr. Abbott\u2019s Democratic rival in 2014.In a recent interview at his Capitol office, Mr. Abbott pushed back against that idea. \u201cThe positions that I\u2019ve fought for in my first session and in this session are unalterable conservative principles, so it\u2019s just who I am,\u201d he said.Mr. Straus\u2019s attempt to loosen the bathroom restrictions in the House was rejected by Mr. Patrick and Senate leaders. The resulting stalemate threatened the operation of several state agencies, including the one that licenses doctors. The failure by the Legislature to pass legislation to keep those agencies operating put added pressure on Mr. Abbott to call a special session.\u201cA special session was entirely avoidable,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThere was plenty of time for the House and Senate to forge compromises.\u201dIt would effectively ban local regulation of discrimination. The bill would prohibit cities, counties and school districts from passing anti-discrimination measures to protect any class of people already protected under state law. And it would nullify existing policies in San Antonio, Dallas and other cities that allow transgender people to use the public bathroom that matches their gender identity.Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, and David Montgomery from Austin, Tex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Out With the New at E3, as the Old Stays in Play", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported bySurprises are always a key part of E3, the giant video game convention that opens its doors next week in Los Angeles. Innovative new game titles and hardware are essential for stirring up excitement among gamers, which keeps them emptying their wallets.But the outsize emphasis on the new at E3 disguises an important change in the game business over the past few years: The old has never mattered so much before.It used to be that a game publisher would put out a big title and, if it hit all the right notes, the game would sell well for a few months. But over the past five years, publishers \u2014 especially those of the big console games that dominate E3 \u2014 have used the internet to keep their games fresh with new content, finding new ways of keeping players engaged with the games and spending money on them through sales of virtual goods. Old games seem less old because they are regularly being updated with new things to do and see, giving them a shot of digital Botox.This reflects an important change in the game business toward providing a service that is constantly being enhanced, rather than selling discs wrapped in cellophane that mostly do not change after a customer purchases them.\u201cThe games industry has followed the same example investors have seen with Netflix,\u201d said Joost van Dreunen, chief executive at SuperData Research, a game research firm. \u201cEntertainment in general is undergoing this tremendous shift.\u201dFor an example, look no further than Grand Theft Auto V, the gritty action-adventure game from Rockstar Games, which first came out in September 2013, almost four years ago. Grand Theft Auto V was published so long ago that it was initially released on the last generation of console hardware from Sony and Microsoft, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (Versions followed for newer hardware in November 2014 and for PCs after that.)And yet, there was Grand Theft Auto on the best-selling games list as recently as April, when it ranked sixth in the United States by dollar sales, right up there with games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, according to NPD Group, the market research firm. More than 80 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V have been sold since it was released, according to Take-Two Interactive Software, the publisher that owns Rockstar Games.The constant refurbishing has kept the community of Grand Theft Auto players, who typically have to wait four to five years between totally new versions of the game, paying attention. \u201cIt allows us to stay in touch with consumers between huge, tent-pole releases,\u201d said Strauss Zelnick, the chief executive of Take-Two, in a phone interview.In a significant milestone, Take-Two reported that for its last fiscal year, which ended March 31, slightly more than half of its revenue of $1.78 billion came from digital online sources.Of that digital revenue, a little over half came from people buying full, downloadable versions of games rather than physical copies, while the rest came from purchases of virtual currency and add-on digital content. Grand Theft Auto V has generated digital revenue of $1.6 billion over its life, Mr. van Dreunen of SuperData Research estimated.The funnel of digital revenue between major releases of games means the feast-or-famine cycle that used to characterize Take-Two\u2019s financial results \u2014 huge spikes in revenue after big Grand Theft Auto releases, followed by deep troughs \u2014 is no longer as severe.\u201cWe don\u2019t see as much of that now because every two or three months you\u2019re seeing new content being added to keep users engaged in the franchise universe,\u201d said Yoshio Osaki, president of IDG Consulting, a market research and consulting firm focused on the game industry.Digital revenue also carries higher profit margins than sales of physical game discs, because no manufacturing is involved and distribution costs are lower.Still, most copies of Take-Two\u2019s games, including Grand Theft Auto, are sold on discs in stores. To make a lot of digital revenue on games, Take-Two needs to sell as many physical copies as possible. That means building buzz at events like E3 with new products.\u201cPhysical distribution partners are terribly important for us,\u201d Mr. Zelnick said, \u201cand we expect that to continue for some time to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intelligence Contractor Is Charged in First Leak Case Under Trump", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported byThe report described two cyberattacks by Russia\u2019s military intelligence unit, the G.R.U. \u2014 one in August against a company that sells voter registration-related software and another, a few days before the election, against 122 local election officials.The Intercept said the N.S.A. report had been submitted anonymously. But shortly after its article was published, the Justice Department said that the F.B.I. had arrested Ms. Winner at her house in Augusta, Ga., on Saturday. It also said she had confessed to an agent that she had printed out a May 5 intelligence file and mailed it to an online news outlet.The F.B.I. affidavit said reporters for the news outlet, which it also did not name, had approached the N.S.A. with questions for their story and, in the course of that dialogue, provided a copy of the document in their possession. An analysis of the file showed it was a scan of a copy that had been creased or folded, the affidavit said, \u201csuggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space.\u201dThe N.S.A.\u2019s auditing system showed that six people had printed out the report, including Ms. Winner. Investigators examined the computers of those six people and found that Ms. Winner had been in email contact with the news outlet, but the other five had not. In a statement, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, praised the operation.\u201cReleasing classified material without authorization threatens our nation\u2019s security and undermines public faith in government,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are trusted with classified information and pledge to protect it must be held accountable when they violate that obligation.\u201dEspionage Act charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, although conventional leak cases have typically resulted in prison terms of one to three years.Reality Leigh Winner, an intelligence contractor, was charged with sending a classified report about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election to the news media, the Justice Department announced Monday, the first criminal leak case under President Trump.Once rare, leak cases have become far more common in the 21st century, in part because of electronic trails that make it easier for investigators to determine who both had access to a leaked document and was in contact with a reporter. Depending on how they are counted, the Obama administration brought nine or 10 leak-related prosecutions \u2014 about twice as many as were brought under all previous presidencies combined.Both attacks described in the report relied on so-called spear phishing, a tactic that uses spoof emails to trick users into clicking links or opening attachments that then install malicious software on their computers. The G.R.U. sent the emails from two free American web-based email providers, Google\u2019s Gmail and Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com, it said.The first attack, on Aug. 24, involved an attack on an American company \u201cevidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions.\u201dThat attack was most likely successful. The report said the G.R.U. used data most likely obtained from it to conduct the second set of attacks, a \u201cvoter registration themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations.\u201dSpecifically, it said, in late October or early November, the G.R.U. sent to 122 local elections officials emails designed to look as if they were from that company and containing attachments designed to look like an updated system manual and checklist. Opening the attachment would download malicious software from a remote server, the report said.VR Systems\u2019 website said its products were used by jurisdictions in California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. In a statement, VR acknowledged that there had been a problem, while stressing that none of its products dealt with vote marking or tabulation.\u201cWhen a customer alerted us to an obviously fraudulent email purporting to come from VR Systems, we immediately notified all our customers and advised them not to click on the attachment,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are only aware of a handful of our customers who actually received the fraudulent email and of those, we have no indication that any of them clicked on the attachment or were compromised as a result.\u201dThe headline on an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the charge that Reality Leigh Winner is facing. It is for leaking, not espionage.Advertisement"}

Some excerpts:You\u2019ve said Mr. Wooden wouldn\u2019t thrive today as a college coach. Why?I don\u2019t think he would have been happy in today\u2019s environment, with people that didn\u2019t want to be educated \u2014 this one-and done thing. People came to U.C.L.A. for an education. He considered himself to be a teacher. He wasn\u2019t a coach.How have his lessons shown up throughout your life?I started noticing it when I had to parent and some of his tactics ended up being some of my tactics. My kids would think they knew everything and try something and fail. But I\u2019d let them do it. Then when they\u2019d fail, I had a moment to teach them. I remember inwardly smiling to myself while I was doing that and saying, \u201cYeah, well, there\u2019s coach.\u201dWhat\u2019s on your mind politically right now?I\u2019m just worried about all the division, all the divisive talk and actions to tear us apart. I hope it stops soon. This is a great nation. We don\u2019t need to try to tear it apart.Is it different than in the past?It\u2019s totally different. It\u2019s coming from a different place. It\u2019s more despair than anything else. And that\u2019s the last thing that we should be worrying about here in America.

Instead of drafting the plans for daring new buildings, he is designing training facilities for the Navy SEALs.Since 2007, more than 550,000 people have planned their lives around the program, which helps workers who go into government or nonprofit public service \u2014 police officers, teachers, nurses, public defenders and others \u2014 pay for their educations. Passed by Congress under President George W. Bush and expanded under President Barack Obama, it effectively erases any federal student debt that remains after 10 years of loan payments and public service employment.The program has not yet cost the government anything; the first class of beneficiaries is on track to have any remaining debt erased beginning in October. But it could become expensive. Government estimates show that a quarter of the nation\u2019s workers, with loans adding up to more than $100 billion, could conceivably be eligible.As Congress debates whether to go along with this and many other proposed cuts, some of the loan program\u2019s beneficiaries spoke about how it shaped their decisions about what to do with their lives.Tanika Bango, 37, Orlando, Fla.Chief of staff for an Orlando city commissionerStudent debt: $70,000I\u2019m very grateful for this program because I don\u2019t have an added level of stress, of worrying about how I\u2019m going to pay my bills. My student loans are the biggest debt that I have.Making more money to be able to afford to pay bills is the ultimate goal, so had the opportunity presented itself, I don\u2019t know that I would have said no. But that\u2019s just not the reality.The reality is, students don\u2019t graduate with high-paying salaries; that\u2019s fake news. It\u2019s only a small portion of students that graduate from college that are able to take on high-salary jobs to even afford a student loan payment.I service the community in which I grew up. It\u2019s an urban community and there are a lot of challenges as it relates to poverty and education. And because I have a law degree and am educated, it allows me to be able to inform the community and to give them hope, to say, \u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t limited by the area in which I grew.\u201dDr. Charles Phillips, 32, PhiladelphiaPediatricianEnrolled in a pediatric hematology and oncology fellowshipStudent debt: $300,000We make very good money. We are in the top 1 percent nationally in terms of our income. I cannot complain.It\u2019s a privilege to research pediatric cancer, so I think I would have made the same career decisions ultimately, but I would have taken a different path. I would have delayed a couple years, tried to make as much money as possible in the private sector, paid down loans, and then come back.If everybody who was eligible took advantage of this program, I don\u2019t see how it is financially solvent. If you think of all the teachers, the public defenders, the physicians that are eligible for this, it is an astronomic amount of money.That being said, I would make more money in private practice than by doing research. So if you want people to take that pay cut, you need to have something to offset that.Dominique Whittaker, 29, SeattleCommunications manager, Microsoft; previously worked for a nonprofit serving at-risk youthStudent debt: $114,500I think it gives you a light at the end of the tunnel when you graduate college and you realize, \u201cI have thousands of dollars in debt and the job I just accepted pays a fraction of what that is.\u201dNonprofit work allows you to connect to causes that are really important to you, so for me it was working with at-risk youth, helping them get out of toxic living environments and learn the skills they needed to be an adult in the world.I put in three and a half years of loan payments and recently took a job at Microsoft. (The required 10 years of public service do not need to be consecutive.) My logic was, I\u2019ll hop out of the nonprofit world, go into the corporate world, get on a career track and make enough money so that I can come back into the nonprofit work that I really enjoy, but also be able to afford to live.You need public servants to fill in the gaps where the government falls short, and so, for the government to say they\u2019re going to completely abandon this program because it costs too much is a slap in the face to the people who are taking on the burden that the government leaves on the table.Rafael Enriquez, 37, San DiegoNavy architectStudent debt: $108,000I worked on Hurricane Sandy repairs on the veterans hospital. Now I work on the buildings where Navy SEALs train in San Diego.I never knew a Hispanic architect, and I didn\u2019t see many when I was going to school, either, because on top of getting into college and getting loans, these niche job sectors aren\u2019t diverse because we can\u2019t afford to take on the debt. We\u2019re not independently wealthy from our parents.I\u2019ll get calls and emails from companies asking if I\u2019m interested in jobs that pay more, but in the long term it doesn\u2019t make sense.Honestly, the government work is boring, there\u2019s no creative upside, so if it wasn\u2019t for the financial benefit of it, I would have never joined.Once this program is completed and I\u2019ve paid off my debt, I\u2019m going to go back to the private sector where I can be rewarded not just financially, but creatively too.Joseph Oudin, 24, WashingtonResearch assistant, Global Terrorism Database, University of MarylandStudent debt: $51,000My payments aren\u2019t insurmountable, and I can manage. If the program were to go away, it would create a disincentive for people to stay in public service, which I think is unfortunate because we definitely need well-qualified public sector employees.Terrorism is a very emotional topic for people, and my goal in working in terrorism research is to help alleviate misconceptions that people might have about it, and provide an accurate picture of the scale of the problem.We\u2019re a database of all terrorist attacks globally dating back to the 1970s. The State Department uses our statistics to do their annual report on global terrorism, and a lot of different organizations use our statistics.I sort through thousands of news articles per week to help build our database, and I focus specifically on the outcomes, so I work to estimate how many casualties occurred in each terrorist attack.Neeraj Kumar, 26, Oakland, Calif.Legal fellow for nonprofit advocacy organizationStudent debt: $61,500I\u2019m planning to start a one-year fellowship with a legal nonprofit doing advocacy for Bay Area residents who have criminal records by providing education about corrective remedies, or means by which people with criminal histories can pursue employment and education.The work had always been a dream, but I think the reality of it mostly came as a result of me knowing that I could offset my debt by doing it.Accepting a public interest job in the Bay Area of California in 2017 is not feasible. It\u2019s sort of an economic reality, and I think the fact that that\u2019s being ignored is kind of depressing.Joey Danner, 32, Seminole County, Fla.Middle school teacherStudent debt: $40,000I teach eighth-grade social studies. I wanted to be a teacher for a long time, but the funding of the degree just wasn\u2019t there. After doing the research and finding out about public loan forgiveness, that solidified my decision.I had an arrest record from when I was a young kid, for possession of marijuana. I was on a road trip with some friends \u2014 it was the smallest, silliest amount. We got pulled over for speeding, they searched the car and they found it, and that was that.I had to wait five years to enter the public school system. Personally it was important for me to get a graduate degree to help me obtain a position and rise above that blip on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Last, Jeff Bezos Offers a Hint of His Philanthropic Plans", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported byInside WealthJeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, is well on his way to becoming the richest person in the world, with a net worth of more than $80 billion. What\u2019s less certain is what he plans to do with his fortune, and how he could reinvent philanthropy.Citing a homeless program in Seattle, Amazon\u2019s hometown, that the company is working with, he said he was seeking to help people \u201cat the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you have any ideas, just reply to this tweet...\u201dThe message was classic Bezos \u2014 challenging conventional wisdom, seeking the wisdom of the market and highlighting his various businesses. Yet it failed to answer a question that is likely to follow him more often if and when he becomes the richest man: What are his plans to give away some or all of his wealth?Mr. Bezos, who owns about 17 percent of Amazon, has enjoyed what could be the most rapid personal-wealth surge in history. As Amazon\u2019s share price has more than tripled since 2015, its leader has added more than $50 billion to his net worth, bringing his current total to nearly $83 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is now less than $7 billion shy of taking the title of the world\u2019s richest person from Bill Gates, who has held the crown for 18 of the past 23 years.Mr. Bezos\u2019 wealth is proof of Amazon\u2019s seemingly unstoppable growth and dominance in a wide range of fields, including online retailing and cloud computing. It adds another Horatio Alger story to the mythmaking machine of American wealth \u2014 showcasing someone from the middle class who was adopted by his Cuban-immigrant stepfather, quit his Wall Street job to start selling books online from his garage and created a company now worth nearly a half trillion dollars.Yet until Thursday, his philanthropy remained largely a mystery.Still, Mr. Bezos has never said publicly what he plans to do with his fortune, what causes he might support or even whether he will give away some or most of it.Mr. Bezos declined to comment for this article. His Twitter invitation on Thursday came after repeated questions on Wednesday from The Times about his giving levels and the lack of public information on his philanthropy. A spokesman declined to comment on whether the queries prompted the post.The Twitter post \u2014 while offering the most insight so far about his philanthropy thinking \u2014 did not commit to any funding levels or to creating a foundation or an L.L.C., as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and other billionaires have done.Experts on nonprofits and friends of Mr. Bezos say he has been more focused on building Amazon and would probably turn to philanthropy later. The more wealth he creates today, they said, the more he can give away later.\u201cI took the less safe path to follow my passion,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m proud of that choice.\u201dYet Mr. Bezos has so far refused the kind of charitable pledges common among billionaires today. The Bezoses\u2019 giving has largely been a family affair, with Mr. Bezos\u2019 role hard to determine. Nonprofit experts said the Bezos Family Foundation, while funded with Amazon stock, is mainly led by Mr. Bezos\u2019 mother. The foundation has given away tens of millions of dollars, mainly to causes related to child brain development and early education.And judging from his Twitter post and conversations with people who know Mr. Bezos, he wants to forge a new path for addressing social problems rather than just writing checks to nonprofits. His desire to get ideas from the public and fund \u201chere and now\u201d philanthropy suggests what could be a bold new direction for philanthropy.Mr. Bezos also sees for-profit ventures as a more effective way to solve certain social problems.\u201cIn many cases, for-profit models improve the world more than philanthropy models, if they can be made to work,\u201d he told Charlie Rose in 2010.\u201cWe know that he hasn\u2019t been very receptive to traditional philanthropy,\u201d said Steve Delfin, a Washington-area philanthropy adviser to companies and wealthy families. \u201cMy guess is that at some point, he will create an innovative new model or a hybrid approach. And maybe, like Amazon, he\u2019ll do it better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Silicon Valley Pushed Coding Into American Classrooms", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byEducation DisruptedThe Apple chief\u2019s education mandate was just the latest tech company push for coding courses in schools. But even without Mr. Trump\u2019s support, Silicon Valley is already advancing that agenda \u2014 thanks largely to the marketing prowess of Code.org, an industry-backed nonprofit group.In our tech-driven world, Hadi Partovi argues, computer science has become as essential for students as reading, writing and math. \u201cEncryption is at least as foundational as photosynthesis,\u201d he said.Computer science is also essential to American tech companies, which have become heavily reliant on foreign engineers. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to limit immigration make Code.org\u2019s teach-Americans-to-code agenda even more attractive to the industry.Along the way, Code.org has emerged as a new prototype for Silicon Valley education reform: a social-media-savvy entity that pushes for education policy changes, develops curriculums, offers online coding lessons and trains teachers \u2014 touching nearly every facet of the education supply chain.Mr. Partovi, 44, said he simply wanted to give students the opportunity to develop the same skills that helped him and his backers succeed. He immigrated as a child to the United States from Iran with his family, went on to study computer science at Harvard, and later sold a voice-recognition start-up he had co-founded to Microsoft for a reported $800 million.\u201cThat dream is much less accessible if you are in one of America\u2019s schools where they don\u2019t even tell you you could go into that field,\u201d Mr. Partovi said.Even so, he acknowledged some industry self-interest. \u201cIf you are running a tech company,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s extremely hard to hire and retain engineers.\u201dCode.org is now one of the largest providers of free online coding lessons and more comprehensive computer science curriculums. It has also provided training workshops to more than 57,000 teachers, Mr. Partovi said.The rise of Code.org coincides with a larger tech-industry push to remake American primary and secondary schools with computers and learning apps, a market estimated to reach $21 billion by 2020.Then Mr. Partovi came along with the idea of using a viral video to spark mass demand for the courses.He began by persuading Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, to appear in a short film promoting coding to students. In its first week on YouTube, the video, called \u201cWhat Most Schools Don\u2019t Teach,\u201d racked up roughly nine million views. Within two weeks, Mr. Partovi said, about 20,000 teachers contacted him.Mr. Partovi compared Code.org\u2019s approach to those of start-ups like Airbnb and Uber. \u201cAirbnb is disrupting the travel space, but they don\u2019t own the hotels,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are in a similar model, disrupting education. But we are not running the school and we don\u2019t hire the teachers.\u201dMr. Partovi\u2019s elite connections didn\u2019t hurt.Mr. Partovi, for his part, was hoping to go viral with a message that coding could improve students\u2019 job prospects. Teaching skills that may lead to higher-paying jobs \u201cseems like the kind of idea that everyone in the country can get behind,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi promptly invited Mr. Smith over to preview his celebrity coders video.\u201cWe think computer science is to the 21st century what physics was to the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Smith said.But the movement has also supported legislation that could give companies enormous sway in public schools, starting with kindergarten, with little public awareness.\u201cIt gets very problematic when industry is deciding the content and direction of public education,\u201d said Jane Margolis, a senior researcher at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.The Idaho bill read, in part, \u201cIt is essential that efforts to increase computer science instruction, kindergarten through career, be driven by the needs of industry and be developed in partnership with industry.\u201dWhen a reporter apprised him of the bill\u2019s language, Mr. Smith of Microsoft seemed taken aback, saying he had not endorsed it. \u201cBroad public education should not be grounded first and foremost in the needs of any particular industry \u2014 or in the needs of industry as a whole,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi noted that Code.org had opposed a \u201cmore extreme\u201d coding bill in Florida that would have required students to obtain industry certification. It has also opposed bills that would allow coding courses to count toward foreign-language credits in high schools, he said. Still, Mr. Partovi added, \u201cWe do think that tech companies have a role to play.\u201dThe clout behind computer science has all but obviated a wider debate about whether, to better prepare students, schools might introduce an array of new subjects. It has also overshadowed discussion about whether students would be better off if schools modified traditional math classes to increase the emphasis on fields like statistics.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said that tech companies and philanthropists were simply trying to give voice to an overlooked subject. \u201cWhat we really need is a national conversation about the broad array of intellectual disciplines that will be fundamental to the future of American students,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a broad array, not a single subject.\u201dMr. Partovi concurred. \u201cWe have a lot of debate in this country about how to teach,\u201d he said, \u201cand not enough debate about what to teach.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Lies. China Thrives.", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byOne of the many dangers posed to our society by having a president who\u2019s a serial liar \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t behave like an adult, let alone a president \u2014 is that we more easily ignore him even if he happens to say something true.Yes, some things are true even if Donald Trump believes them. I explored one of them in China last week \u2014 Trump\u2019s charge that China is playing unfair on trade.Chinese men and women friends tell me they don\u2019t carry purses or wallets anymore, only a mobile phone, which they use for everything \u2014 including for buying vegetables from street vendors.\u201cAmerica has been dreaming of becoming a cashless society,\u201d Ya-Qin Zhang, president of Baidu, China\u2019s main search engine, remarked to me, \u201cbut China is already there.\u201d It has \u201cleapfrogged the rest of world\u201d and is now going mobile-first in everything.Wang Xing, the founder of Meituan.com \u2014 a Chinese mobile website that is a combination of Fandango, Yelp, OpenTable, Grubhub, TripAdvisor, Booking.com and Angie\u2019s List \u2014 told me that he has around 300,000 people on electric bicycles who deliver takeout food and groceries to 10 million Chinese mobile internet users daily. \u201cWe are the largest food delivery company in the world,\u201d said Xing.And in an age when raw data from the internet of people and the internet of things is the new oil, the fact that China has 700 million people doing so many transactions daily on the mobile internet means it\u2019s piling up massive amounts of information that can be harvested to identify trends and spur new artificial intelligence applications.Moreover, while Trump is pulling out of the Paris climate deal, China is steadily pulling out of coal. Xin Guo, C.E.O. of Career International, told me two of his hottest job openings in China are in \u201csoftware and new energy\u201d \u2014 everyone is looking for engineers for electric cars, solar and wind. Walter Fang, a top executive at iSoftStone, which helps design China\u2019s smart, sustainable cities, told me that \u201cjust two weeks ago I brought in about a dozen green energy start-up companies from Massachusetts\u201d to show them opportunities in China.And yet, as smart as China has been in adopting new technologies, Trump\u2019s broad complaint that China is not playing fair on trade and has grown in some areas at the expense of U.S. and European workers has merit and needs to be addressed \u2014 now. Before going to Beijing I emailed the smartest person I know inside China on trade (who will have to go nameless) and asked if Trump had a point.He answered: \u201cYour note has arrived as I slide across the Chinese countryside at 300 kilometers per hour from Beijing to Shanghai. There are nearly 60 trains going from Beijing to Shanghai every day, typically with 16 cars able to carry nearly 1,300 people. \u2026 We glide past endless brand-new factories and immaculate apartment buildings in practically every city along the way, with many more still under construction. As you suspect, I have been sympathetic to many of Trump\u2019s trade and industrial policy ideas. But if anything, Trump may be too late.\u201dOuch.The core problem, U.S. and European business leaders based in China explained, is that when the U.S. allowed China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 and gain much less restricted access to our markets, we gave China the right to keep protecting parts of its market \u2014 because it was a \u201cdeveloping economy.\u201d The assumption was that as China reformed and become more of our equal, its trade barriers and government aid to Chinese companies would melt away.They did not. China grew in strength, became America\u2019s equal in many fields and continued to protect its own companies from foreign competition, either by limiting access or demanding that foreign companies take on a Chinese partner and transfer their intellectual property to China as the price of access, or by funneling Chinese firms low-interest loans to grow and buy foreign competitors.Once those companies got big enough, they were unleashed on the world. China plans to use this strategy to implement its new plan \u2014 \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d \u2014 to make itself the world leader in electric vehicles, new materials, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, bio-pharmacy, 5G mobile communications and other industries.The latest annual survey of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, released in January, found that 81 percent of its members felt \u201cless welcome\u201d in China than in the past and had little confidence any longer that China would carry through on promises to open its markets. APCO Worldwide\u2019s James McGregor, one of the keenest observers of China trade, recently noted that China tells the world that its policy is \u201creform and opening,\u201d but on the ground its policy \u201cmore resembles reform and closing.\u201dToday, Alibaba can set up its own cloud server in America, but Amazon or Microsoft can\u2019t do the same in China. China just agreed to allow U.S. credit card giants, like Visa and MasterCard, access to its huge market \u2014 something it was required to do under W.T.O. rules but just dragged its feet on for years \u2014 but now domestic Chinese financial services companies, like UnionPay, so dominate the Chinese market that U.S. companies will be left to fight over the scraps. The world leader in industrial robots, the German company Kuka Robotics, was just bought by the Chinese company Midea; Beijing would never allow the U.S. to buy one of China\u2019s industrial gems like that.This is not fair. China needs to know that some people who disagree with everything else Trump stands for \u2014 and who value a strong U.S.-China relationship \u2014 might just support Trump\u2019s idea for a border-adjustment tax on imports to level the playing field. Because our economic relationship with China is out of whack \u2014 and not just because China makes great products, but because we do, too, and it\u2019s high time they are all allowed through China\u2019s front door.Advertisement"}

This is not a novel idea: It was the key reason Walmart got into the grocery business in the 1980s, a move that accelerated its shift from a regional chain into the world\u2019s largest physical retailer.Yet if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, after years of watching Amazon, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time predicting future possibilities. He is instead consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer\u2019s eyes. The other thing to know about Mr. Bezos is that he is a committed experimentalist. His main way of deciding what Amazon should do next is to try stuff out, see what works, and do more of that.So the best way to think of this deal is to look at Whole Foods as a kind of guinea pig for Amazon \u2014 a pricey, organically sourced one, perhaps, but a guinea pig all the same.Amazon almost certainly doesn\u2019t know yet how exactly Whole Foods will fit into its long-term plans. You can expect it to make few dramatic changes to Whole Foods in the near future. Instead, Mr. Bezos and his team will most likely spend years meticulously analyzing and tinkering with how Whole Foods works. They will begin lots of experiments. When something works, they will do more of that, then more, and then even more. They may take over the world all the same \u2014 and, in the process, probably usher in big changes to large swaths of the economy, affecting everything from labor to urban planning \u2014 but they\u2019ll do it in ways we won\u2019t be able to predict now.\u201cI think they look at this as an opportunity to learn,\u201d said Venky Harinarayan, an early Amazon executive who later worked at Walmart, and who also ran a venture capital firm in which Mr. Bezos was a big investor. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for everyone \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone has figured out yet how to use a store to service online customers at massive scale. That\u2019s the experimental piece.\u201dIn this light, I suspect that the Whole Foods deal starts less with a strategic end-goal and more with this insight: Shopping for food is broken. Both the in-store experience and the many attempts at online delivery \u2014 from Webvan to Instacart to Amazon\u2019s own service, Amazon Fresh \u2014 have failed to create the sort of seamless buying experience we enjoy with nonfood e-commerce.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.But online grocery delivery also isn\u2019t so great. Delivery services tend to be far more expensive than in-store shopping, and it\u2019s still not quite painless: You have to order ahead of time, you often have to deal with last-minute substitutions, and the whole process is still quite labor-intensive and wasteful. (Ask me about the many pounds of ice-filled plastic bags I have to dispose of every time I shop at Amazon Fresh.)But wait a second, isn\u2019t $13.4 billion a lot for an experiment? Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u201cNo doubt it\u2019s a big deal; it\u2019s a large amount of money,\u201d Mr. Harinarayan said. But he also noted that Amazon is flying high.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whole Foods Deal Shows Amazon\u2019s Prodigious Tolerance for Risk", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byUnlike almost any other chief executive, Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, has built his company by embracing risk, ignoring obvious moves and imagining what customers want next \u2014 even before they know it.Key to that strategy is his approach to failure. While other companies dread making colossal mistakes, Mr. Bezos seems just not to care. Losing millions of dollars for some reason doesn\u2019t sting. Only success counts. That breeds a fiercely experimental culture that is disrupting entertainment, technology and, especially, retail.Mr. Bezos is one of the few chief executives who joke about how much money they\u2019ve lost.\u201cI\u2019ve made billions of dollars of failures,\u201d Mr. Bezos said at a 2014 conference, adding that it would be like \u201ca root canal with no anesthesia\u201d if he listed them.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take bold bets, they\u2019re going to be experiments,\u201d Mr. Bezos explained. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re experiments, you don\u2019t know ahead of time if they\u2019re going to work. Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure. But a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn\u2019t work.\u201dIt is an approach baked into the company since the beginning \u2014 and one that is difficult, if not impossible, for competitors to emulate. Consider how Amazon Web Services began as a small internal cloud computing project to help Amazon\u2019s core business. Then the company started selling excess cloud capacity to other companies.If the cloud computing business just grew, Amazon Prime was a bold bet from the beginning, the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet for shoppers: Pay an annual fee and all shipping costs for the year are covered. Amazon\u2019s shipping expenses ballooned, but revenue soared so much that no one minded.\u201cWhen you have such a long-term perspective that you think in decades instead of quarters, it allows you to do things and take risks that other companies believe would not be in their best interests,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, an analyst with the investment firm Robert W. Baird & Company.Amazon began, for those too young to remember, as a discount internet bookseller in 1995. In the headiness of the late-1990s dot-com boom, it became the symbol of how this new invention called the World Wide Web was going to change everything. Then, like many of the leading dot-com companies, it blew up. The world wasn\u2019t quite ready for Amazon. It came very close to going under.One thing the retailer did not do was make much money. In its two decades as a public company, Amazon has had a cumulative profit of $5.7 billion. For a company with a market value of nearly $500 billion, this is negligible. Walmart, which has a market value half that of Amazon, made a profit of $14 billion in 2016 alone.But the tens of millions of customers do not care whether Amazon is hugely profitable. They care if it is making their lives easier or better.\u201cJeff Bezos is making shopping great,\u201d said Chris Kubica, an e-book consultant and software developer who watches Amazon closely. \u201cHe\u2019s made me come to expect better from every checkout counter. Oh, I can scan my entire shopping cart full of groceries in one go, without stopping, as I roll into the parking lot? Yes, please. Where do I park?\u201dAs Amazon pushes on with its ceaseless experimenting, however, it risks being seen as less of a cute disrupter of the old and as more of a menace. It has hired many workers for its warehouses, but it is also betting heavily on automation. Amazon Go, after all, is an attempt to drain the labor out of shopping.\u201cAmazon runs the risk of becoming too big,\u201d Mr. Kekre said.Some Amazon critics would like the Whole Foods deal to be the trigger for reining in the company. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent foe of Amazon, noted that the company is \u201crapidly monopolizing online retail\u201d and that both Prime and Echo \u201care strategies for locking in consumers and ensuring they don\u2019t shop anywhere else.\u201d Amazon declined to comment for this article.Where will it all end? Mr. Kubica has thought about this. Amazon can be understood as a decades-long effort to shorten the time between \u201cI want it\u201d and \u201cI have it\u201d into as brief a period as possible. The logical end of this would be the something Mr. Kubica jestingly called Amazon Imp, short for \u201cimplant\u201d and also \u201cimpulse,\u201d Mr. Kubica said. It would be a chip inserted under the skin.\u201cThe imp would sense your impulses and desires,\u201d Mr. Kubica wrote in an email, \u201cand then either virtually fulfill them by stimulating your brain (for a modest payment to Amazon, of course) or it would make a box full of goodies for you appear on your doorstep (for a larger fee, of course).\u201dEvery desire fulfilled. \u201cI am sure that Amazon even now is building it,\u201d Mr. Kubica said.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Pet Insurance Is the Latest Work Perk", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byJessica Parsons, an intensive-care nurse in Indianapolis, had given little thought to pet insurance. But when her employer, Indiana University Health, offered it as part of the company\u2019s regular benefits package several years ago, she signed up, the $40 monthly premium coming out of her paycheck automatically.It was fortunate timing. Shortly after getting the insurance, her then 2-year-old yellow Labrador retriever, Charlie, slipped under a tractor on her farm and suffered a crushed back and tail. Soon, the dog could no longer move her back legs and had blood in her urine. Rushed to Purdue University Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Charlie underwent one operation to stabilize the spine and one to remove a badly damaged kidney. Her pet insurer, Nationwide, paid most of the $14,000 bill.Today, Charlie is doing well. \u201cCompared with dealing with human insurance, I found it pretty pleasant,\u201d Ms. Parsons said of the experience.Ms. Parsons is part of a fast-growing trend in veterinary medicine: employer-sponsored benefit plans that insure the family pooch or cat ( even the occasional ferret or potbellied pig) against accidents and illness. Some 5,000 companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo, Xerox and Hewlett-Packard, now offer pet insurance, sometimes covering part or all of the costs, in an effort to lure talent but also to recognize the strong emotional bonds between people and pets.It\u2019s a side of the insurance industry that is growing rapidly, said Dr. Carol McConnell, chief veterinary medical officer for Nationwide, the nation\u2019s largest pet insurer. \u201cPeople find this type of insurance more credible if an employer has vetted it first.\u201dPets undergo state-of-the art imaging tests like CT and M.R.I. scans to diagnose problems, and they get valve replacements for ailing hearts, chemotherapy to fight many cancers, surgery to extract impacted teeth, even transplants for failing kidneys.\u201cPet insurance is a game-changer for many pet owners\u201d who otherwise could never afford these procedures, said Dr. Tracey Jensen, a private-practice veterinarian in Wellington, Colo., and a former president of the American Animal Hospital Association, which accredits animal hospitals in the United States and Canada.\u201cPets today occupy a special place in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Dr. Jensen said. \u201cThey\u2019re family members, and their owners don\u2019t want to cut corners on care.\u201dOnly a small fraction of pet owners in the United States carry pet insurance. An estimated 1 to 2 percent of the nation\u2019s nearly 90 million pet dogs and more than 94 million pet cats are insured, industry statistics show.Nevertheless, the marketplace has grown from one pet insurer, Veterinary Pet Insurance (now called Nationwide), in 1982 to at least 11 companies today, including the Hartville Pet Insurance Group (now called Crum & Forster), which offers insurance through the A.S.P.C.A. The North American Pet Health Insurance Association cited a growth rate of 12 to 15 percent in policy holders over each of the last two years.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an uptick in the number of insured pets out there,\u201d said Chris Middleton, president of Pets Best, an insurer in Boise, Idaho. He said that since 2013, the 11-year-old company has seen a 60 percent increase in the number of employers seeking pet insurance for their workers. But unless owners have faced high vet bills in the past (as Mr. Middleton has with his \u201crock-eating hound,\u201d he said), many are deterred by the monthly premiums.Much like human health insurance, pet insurance comes with a dizzying array of options. A basic plan for certain illnesses and accidents can cost $20 or less a month; more comprehensive policies covering annual wellness exams, vaccinations, blood work and a range of treatments start at around $63 a month.In general, cats tend to cost less to insure than dogs. Many pet insurance companies charge more for breeds prone to certain medical conditions, like cancers or heart disease; a large dog, like a Great Dane, will cost more to insure than a Chihuahua.\u201cMy best advice is find others who have the insurance you\u2019re interested in, talk to your vet or ask for referrals from the company,\u201d said Heidi Ganahl, founder of Camp Bow Wow, a dog-boarding and -training franchise. She said that before she sold the company in 2014, she offered her 40 employees pet insurance and always insured her own pets. \u201cThe biggest thing you want in any policy is the catastrophic stuff,\u201d she said.\u201cBy and large, most pet insurance is primarily there for injury and disease,\u201d not for wellness, said Dr. Christopher Gray, the director of Michigan State University\u2019s Veterinary Medical Center in East Lansing. He does not insure his two dogs and two cats. His recommendation: Look at deductibles, co-payments and whether a policy covers a pet throughout its lifetime or ends when it hits a certain age.Dennis Rushovich, senior vice president of the Hartville Group, suggests asking whether a plan covers exam fees as well as any medications or specialized foods a vet may prescribe, and whether the plan has an annual cap on what it will pay.\u201cIf your dog has hip dysplasia, it can get quite expensive\u201d if an insurer caps the costs, said Sam Niccolls, the company\u2019s founder. Some insurers, he said, pay for spaying or neutering along with other relatively inexpensive wellness tests but not the real drivers of veterinary cost: emergencies or chronic diseases.Some critics question the rankings\u2019 reliability. Consumers Advocate makes its money, in part, from partnerships with some of the same insurers it evaluates, though the company says it makes its assessments independently. Others say that rankings may not be up to date (since insurers are continually updating offerings) or may be skewed by bogus consumer reviews, a widespread problem throughout the internet.In a 2016 cost analysis, Consumer Reports looked at coverage from four industry competitors for two pets: a 12-year-old Lab mix with skin cancer named Guinness and a mixed-breed cat named Freddie. It found that for serious diseases, like cancer, all the policies carried a definite financial benefit. But for less dire conditions (an expensive dental cleaning for Freddie), only one company paid more than the annual premiums\u2019 cost.Consumer Reports acknowledged that the limited sample size of the study and the inability to predict the future medical needs of a pet made blanket recommendations difficult. But, it concluded, \u201cif you\u2019d like help with unexpected, large vet bills, a plan may be worth considering.\u201dDuring her veterinary training at Colorado State University, Dr. Christine Hardy remembers, she struggled to pay nearly $5,000 in bills after her golden retriever, Sam, developed elbow problems and tore a cruciate ligament in his knee. \u201cHe was a bit of an orthopedic disaster,\u201d said Dr. Hardy, now the director of operations at the university\u2019s Flint Animal Cancer Center.Sam has since died, but the experience persuaded her to insure her next pet, Winston. The policy covered 80 percent of the nearly $9,000 to treat the 8-year-old dog\u2019s hemangiosarcoma, a blood vessel cancer in an unusual location: the roof of his mouth. \u201cBecause we had insurance, I never felt like finances weighed in our decisions,\u201d Dr. Hardy said. \u201cInstead, we were able to make choices based on what we thought best for Winston.\u201d\u201cI think of pet insurance in the same way as I do car insurance,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s there when things go terribly wrong.\u201dIf your employer offers a plan, she said, at least take a look.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "Supported byOpinionBEIJING \u2014 What worries you about the coming world of artificial intelligence?Too often the answer to this question resembles the plot of a sci-fi thriller. People worry that developments in A.I. will bring about the \u201csingularity\u201d \u2014 that point in history when A.I. surpasses human intelligence, leading to an unimaginable revolution in human affairs. Or they wonder whether instead of our controlling artificial intelligence, it will control us, turning us, in effect, into cyborgs.These are interesting issues to contemplate, but they are not pressing. They concern situations that may not arise for hundreds of years, if ever. At the moment, there is no known path from our best A.I. tools (like the Google computer program that recently beat the world\u2019s best player of the game of Go) to \u201cgeneral\u201d A.I. \u2014 self-aware computer programs that can engage in common-sense reasoning, attain knowledge in multiple domains, feel, express and understand emotions and so on.This doesn\u2019t mean we have nothing to worry about. On the contrary, the A.I. products that now exist are improving faster than most people realize and promise to radically transform our world, not always for the better. They are only tools, not a competing form of intelligence. But they will reshape what work means and how wealth is created, leading to unprecedented economic inequalities and even altering the global balance of power.It is imperative that we turn our attention to these imminent challenges.What is artificial intelligence today? Roughly speaking, it\u2019s technology that takes in huge amounts of information from a specific domain (say, loan repayment histories) and uses it to make a decision in a specific case (whether to give an individual a loan) in the service of a specified goal (maximizing profits for the lender). Think of a spreadsheet on steroids, trained on big data. These tools can outperform human beings at a given task.This kind of A.I. is spreading to thousands of domains (not just loans), and as it does, it will eliminate many jobs. Bank tellers, customer service representatives, telemarketers, stock and bond traders, even paralegals and radiologists will gradually be replaced by such software. Over time this technology will come to control semiautonomous and autonomous hardware like self-driving cars and robots, displacing factory workers, construction workers, drivers, delivery workers and many others.Unlike the Industrial Revolution and the computer revolution, the A.I. revolution is not taking certain jobs (artisans, personal assistants who use paper and typewriters) and replacing them with other jobs (assembly-line workers, personal assistants conversant with computers). Instead, it is poised to bring about a wide-scale decimation of jobs \u2014 mostly lower-paying jobs, but some higher-paying ones, too.This transformation will result in enormous profits for the companies that develop A.I., as well as for the companies that adopt it. Imagine how much money a company like Uber would make if it used only robot drivers. Imagine the profits if Apple could manufacture its products without human labor. Imagine the gains to a loan company that could issue 30 million loans a year with virtually no human involvement. (As it happens, my venture capital firm has invested in just such a loan company.)We are thus facing two developments that do not sit easily together: enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands and enormous numbers of people out of work. What is to be done?Part of the answer will involve educating or retraining people in tasks A.I. tools aren\u2019t good at. Artificial intelligence is poorly suited for jobs involving creativity, planning and \u201ccross-domain\u201d thinking \u2014 for example, the work of a trial lawyer. But these skills are typically required by high-paying jobs that may be hard to retrain displaced workers to do. More promising are lower-paying jobs involving the \u201cpeople skills\u201d that A.I. lacks: social workers, bartenders, concierges \u2014 professions requiring nuanced human interaction. But here, too, there is a problem: How many bartenders does a society really need?The solution to the problem of mass unemployment, I suspect, will involve \u201cservice jobs of love.\u201d These are jobs that A.I. cannot do, that society needs and that give people a sense of purpose. Examples include accompanying an older person to visit a doctor, mentoring at an orphanage and serving as a sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 or, potentially soon, Virtual Reality Anonymous (for those addicted to their parallel lives in computer-generated simulations). The volunteer service jobs of today, in other words, may turn into the real jobs of the future.Other volunteer jobs may be higher-paying and professional, such as compassionate medical service providers who serve as the \u201chuman interface\u201d for A.I. programs that diagnose cancer. In all cases, people will be able to choose to work fewer hours than they do now.Who will pay for these jobs? Here is where the enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands comes in. It strikes me as unavoidable that large chunks of the money created by A.I. will have to be transferred to those whose jobs have been displaced. This seems feasible only through Keynesian policies of increased government spending, presumably raised through taxation on wealthy companies.As for what form that social welfare would take, I would argue for a conditional universal basic income: welfare offered to those who have a financial need, on the condition they either show an effort to receive training that would make them employable or commit to a certain number of hours of \u201cservice of love\u201d voluntarism.To fund this, tax rates will have to be high. The government will not only have to subsidize most people\u2019s lives and work; it will also have to compensate for the loss of individual tax revenue previously collected from employed individuals.This leads to the final and perhaps most consequential challenge of A.I. The Keynesian approach I have sketched out may be feasible in the United States and China, which will have enough successful A.I. businesses to fund welfare initiatives via taxes. But what about other countries?They face two insurmountable problems. First, most of the money being made from artificial intelligence will go to the United States and China. A.I. is an industry in which strength begets strength: The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product. It\u2019s a virtuous circle, and the United States and China have already amassed the talent, market share and data to set it in motion.For example, the Chinese speech-recognition company iFlytek and several Chinese face-recognition companies such as Megvii and SenseTime have become industry leaders, as measured by market capitalization. The United States is spearheading the development of autonomous vehicles, led by companies like Google, Tesla and Uber. As for the consumer internet market, seven American or Chinese companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are making extensive use of A.I. and expanding operations to other countries, essentially owning those A.I. markets. It seems American businesses will dominate in developed markets and some developing markets, while Chinese companies will win in most developing markets.The other challenge for many countries that are not China or the United States is that their populations are increasing, especially in the developing world. While a large, growing population can be an economic asset (as in China and India in recent decades), in the age of A.I. it will be an economic liability because it will comprise mostly displaced workers, not productive ones.So if most countries will not be able to tax ultra-profitable A.I. companies to subsidize their workers, what options will they have? I foresee only one: Unless they wish to plunge their people into poverty, they will be forced to negotiate with whichever country supplies most of their A.I. software \u2014 China or the United States \u2014 to essentially become that country\u2019s economic dependent, taking in welfare subsidies in exchange for letting the \u201cparent\u201d nation\u2019s A.I. companies continue to profit from the dependent country\u2019s users. Such economic arrangements would reshape today\u2019s geopolitical alliances.One way or another, we are going to have to start thinking about how to minimize the looming A.I.-fueled gap between the haves and the have-nots, both within and between nations. Or to put the matter more optimistically: A.I. is presenting us with an opportunity to rethink economic inequality on a global scale. These challenges are too far-ranging in their effects for any nation to isolate itself from the rest of the world.Kai-Fu Lee is the chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm, and the president of its Artificial Intelligence Institute.Advertisement"}
