When LeEco also began selling investment products online, Mr. Li snapped them up, even though the company said little about where the money would go.\u201cWhenever I have leftover money from my salary, I\u2019ll invest it,\u201d Mr. Li said, explaining that he had invested $7,000 in the company. \u201cMy spare change? I put it in.\u201dAll the while, its finances were deteriorating. Even as it continued to raise money, LeEco filled the lobby of its offices with potted plants to keep angry creditors from loitering there.\u201cThe problems are real, but manageable,\u201d said Arthur R. Kroeber, the head of research at Gavekal Dragonomics, an economic research firm based in Beijing. \u201cThe government needs to start managing them.\u201dLeEco, a catchall name for a variety of businesses controlled by the internet tycoon Jia Yueting, poses little threat by itself to China\u2019s financial system. But a review of the company\u2019s finances shows the extent of the opaque ways Chinese firms can use to raise money \u2014 and how failures could ripple through the system.A spokeswoman said LeEco\u2019s efforts to raise money complied with the law. Mr. Jia declined requests for an interview.To borrow more than $2.1 billion since the start of last year, LeEco affiliates have turned to China\u2019s vast but poorly understood informal financial system.LeEco raised $215 million from selling so-called wealth management products online, according to public data. In China, such investments promise a good rate of return and the illusion of a guarantee, but they offer little disclosure. LeEco listed the products on its app as \u201clow risk.\u201dMr. Li, the music teacher, bought LeEco wealth management products that promised an annualized return of up to 7 percent. He is not concerned about getting his money back.\u201cI\u2019m not too interested in where the money is going,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a Le TV and a Le phone. I\u2019m not worried.\u201dAccording to the latest available data, Mr. Jia has pledged 97 percent of his shares in LeEco\u2019s main publicly traded arm, Leshi Internet, to back loans primarily from securities brokerages. In November, those loans totaled $1.7 billion.Venturing into other corners of China\u2019s financial system, LeEco has raised $2.4 billion since last year by selling shares or debt convertible into shares in its various privately owned affiliates. Because those businesses are not publicly traded, they get less scrutiny from Chinese securities regulators than companies that sell shares on a public stock market.Mo Lingmei was among nearly 400 people to buy stakes in Le Sports, a LeEco affiliate that acquires sports broadcasting rights such as the right to show Premier League soccer online in China. Ms. Mo, who sells clothes online, said she drained her family\u2019s savings to come up with half of the $300,000 that a group of friends pooled together to invest in the company\u2019s $1.2 billion funding round last year.\u201cIt was an impulse decision,\u201d she said, adding that Mr. Jia \u201cwas so hot at the time, on TV, in the media, in the paper. I\u2019d never invested in anything before.\u201dMany of the company\u2019s problems have lingered. Last month, LeEco laid off 325 workers in the United States. Some affiliates have started new fund-raising efforts.In April, 37 representatives of small suppliers demanded that they be repaid $10 million owed to them by a LeEco affiliate. They staged a weeklong sit-in in the lobby of LeEco\u2019s office tower in Beijing, until large potted plants were placed in the sitting area. At LeEco\u2019s ride-sharing affiliate, Yidao Yongche, drivers have had trouble getting paid for weeks and have started protesting at several of the company\u2019s offices across China.LeEco says it is on the mend, citing a $2.2 billion injection in January from a Chinese real estate developer. At an investor meeting in May, Mr. Jia acknowledged that layoffs and asset sales were underway but said the moves would \u201callow our core operations, especially the nonpublic businesses, to enter a fast-paced recovery period.\u201dMr. Jia\u2019s commitment has reassured a number of investors, including Hu Yenan, who has formed a company to bring people together and pour money into the conglomerate\u2019s various businesses.One partnership Mr. Hu formed bought into a $1.08 billion offering of debt convertible into shares in LeEco\u2019s electric car start-ups, Faraday Future and LeSee. Mr. Jia, he noted, had personally guaranteed the debt.\u201cIf Warren Buffett comes to you asking for money, would you lend to him?\u201d Mr. Hu asked. \u201cOf course you would.\u201dYufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}

When Henry suspects that the girl next door is being harmed by her stepfather, the town\u2019s police commissioner, he draws Susan into a rescue plan.\u201cI loved how it had a foot in many different worlds,\u201d Ms. Watts said. \u201cOne minute it\u2019s a sweet family movie. Then it moves into some complex dramatic moments, and then it takes some surprising twists into the suspense-thriller genre.\u201dThe English-born, Australian-bred Ms. Watts, 48, lives in New York with Alexander, 9, and Samuel, 8, her sons with Liev Schreiber, from whom she publicly separated in September. In an interview at a hotel in Midtown, she spoke about two other big projects: the return of \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d Sundays on Showtime; and the psychosexual thriller series \u201cGypsy,\u201d debuting June 30 on Netflix. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.What real-life mothering skills did you draw on to play Susan?How far you\u2019ll go to protect your own kids.You previously acted with Jacob in \u201cShut In\u201d and with Jaeden in \u201cSt. Vincent.\u201d Did that bond make it easier to play their mother?Yeah, which is great because how do you create that instant chemistry, especially with kids? You want the kids to jump up on you, or you want to be able to scruff up their hair or kick them on the butt. That\u2019s the nuance you need to create a reality.As a celebrity, it must be an enormous task to protect your own children, especially going through a public separation.I don\u2019t want to get into it too personally. But we\u2019re doing the best we can in a tricky situation, and so far I feel really good about how we\u2019ve dealt with it. The kids seem to be in a good place.Do your sons watch your movies?No, I don\u2019t really see any advantage for them, and they only just watched \u201cKing Kong\u201d a few months ago. I remember showing them the trailer [years earlier] and my littlest one getting completely freaked out. They just don\u2019t want to see their parents under distress or in danger. Now they get it. They came to the set when I was shooting [\u201cThe Impossible\u201d] in Thailand, and I had bruises and wounds, and I worried about them seeing me like that. But I [showed them how] you put on strawberry jam that looks like a bloody wound, and they started to understand.In \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d you\u2019re playing the wife of a Dale Cooper look-alike. How was working with David Lynch again?In \u201cGypsy,\u201d you\u2019re playing a cognitive behavioral therapist who gets a little too involved in her patients\u2019 lives.She\u2019s a well-intentioned woman, but she\u2019s at a point in her life where things are feeling a little stale. And she\u2019s feeling that with her patients as well \u2014 like they\u2019re not getting it, and she really wants to help them. Then, before you know it, her curiosity gets the better of her, and she\u2019s in this whole rabbit hole. She\u2019s neglected a side of her past that was a little bit wilder in order to live this life with more structure. So she goes off in the wrong direction.What\u2019s the moral of the story?It\u2019s a cautionary tale. People often fantasize about things like, who would I have been if I lived this life, or what haven\u2019t I done, and how could I reinvent myself? You don\u2019t have to do that when you watch a TV show. [Laughs] You get to see someone else get into all kinds of trouble for you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Okja,\u2019 a Girl and Her Pig Take on the Food Industrial Complex", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byOkja is a most remarkable pig. As big as a medium-sized elephant, with a snout that looks more canine than porcine, she is slobbery and sometimes flatulent, but also loyal, gentle and brave. Okja is devoted, above all, to a girl named Mija. They have grown up together on a remote mountain farm that belongs to Mija\u2019s grandfather, inseparable companions in a classic literary and cinematic tradition.The bond between Okja and Mija, who is an orphan, is the result of a contract neither one of them has read or signed. The pig is the physical and intellectual property of a multinational corporation, and as such she\u2019s destined not only for the usual slaughter but also for crass and cynical commercial exploitation. The girl, a serious and stubborn child (played with heroic dignity by An Seo Hyun), is fated to lose her only friend.The audience already suspects as much. The first face we see belongs not to a cute computer-generated piglet but to Tilda Swinton, in braces and a blinding platinum bob. Her character, Lucy Mirando \u2014 chief executive of the Mirando Corporation, which she inherited from her father \u2014 steps in front of the camera to preside over the brightly greenwashed presentation of a diabolical initiative. A new superbreed of swine has been created, she says, and 26 shoats will be distributed to farmers around the world to be raised in sustainable, free-range conditions. After 10 years, they will participate in a kind of livestock beauty pageant, overseen by a popular television veterinarian played by an antic and abrasive Jake Gyllenhaal.A conventional name for that something would be humanity, since \u201cOkja,\u201d not unlike \u201cE. T.,\u201d is about how a young person achieves moral insight by connecting with and fighting for a nonhuman creature. Okja\u2019s oppressors, like E. T.\u2019s, are part of a system that refuses to recognize her as anything more than a thing. In this case, that system is specifically the food industrial complex, and her tale is a clear and effective animal rights fable, or at least a protest against factory farming and genetic engineering. (Nobody advocates for the fish and chickens Mija and her grandfather eat at home.)This might make the movie sound heavier and more dogmatic than it actually is. But if you have seen \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d a parable of global inequality set aboard a high-speed train, you know that Mr. Bong juggles delight and didacticism with exquisite grace. Rather than turn out cardboard heroes and villains, he savors the eccentricity of his characters, in the sheer weirdness of our ingenious and idiotic species. He is fascinated by the petty doctrinal arguments and personal rivalries in the ranks of the Animal Liberation Front and also by the boardroom intrigue within the Mirando Corporation. Keep your eye on Giancarlo Esposito, and your ear out for Lucy Mirando\u2019s sister, Nancy.The human performers are all brilliant, but the movie belongs to its title character and her digitally conjured, genetically modified ilk. Okja is a miracle of imagination and technique, and \u201cOkja\u201d insists, with abundant mischief and absolute sincerity, that she possesses a soul.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "HomePod Speaker and New iMacs: What We Saw at Apple\u2019s WWDC", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported by\u2022 Apple gave a sneak peek of HomePod, a speaker, to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home. It\u2019s the first brand-new hardware product for Apple since the Apple Watch.\u2022 The company also showed new iPads at its annual developer conference, which typically focuses on software instead of hardware.\u2022 Also unveiled: a new iMac Pro, upgraded iMacs and MacBooks, and updates to its operating systems.Amazon, with the Echo, pioneered a device that lets you play music, look up basic information and control your lighting and other home accessories. Now Apple\u2019s answer to the Echo \u2014 the HomePod \u2014 is here, kind of. Apple showed off HomePod on Monday, and it will be available in December.So how will Apple compete? In a very Apple-like manner: The speaker, powered by the Siri voice assistant, looks spiffier than either Amazon\u2019s or Google\u2019s version \u2014 it is a seven-inch-tall canister wrapped in a shiny mesh speaker. The company also said it had prioritized the speaker\u2019s sound, which can be lackluster on rival devices. HomePod has an array of speakers to create virtual surround sound.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know what any of that is; just know that it sounds incredible,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s marketing chief, who added that HomePod would be priced at $349.Although Apple appears to be trying to make up ground on Amazon and Google, the primary casualty may be Sonos. That company offers a wireless multispeaker system that allows users to listen to music throughout the home, similar to HomePod\u2019s ability to chain together speakers.The big question, though, is whether the intelligence inside Apple\u2019s speaker is good for anything beyond music. Apple was early to the voice game with Siri on the iPhone, but rivals have since lapped it \u2014 their voice-command devices are faster, they know more, and they are less annoying to use. Apple promises the new Siri is better, but the improvements it showed were only minor.Apple\u2019s developer conference typically showcases software improvements. In a departure from that routine, Apple showed a lot of new hardware this time.That included updated versions of the iPad, which has been declining in sales. Apple showed that it was continuing to bet on the tablets by unveiling an iPad upgrade that the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said was pushing the device \u201cfurther than it ever has before.\u201dThe new version of the iPad Pro has a 10.5-inch display, 20 percent larger than the previous 9.7-inch model, and it will start at $649. Apple said the size made it perfect for displaying a virtual keyboard comparable to a full-size physical keyboard. The company also highlighted a feature called ProMotion that increases the refresh rate and makes motion smoother in video content.After Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad in 2010, tablets exploded in popularity, but iPad sales have slumped for more than a year now. So Apple, under increasing pressure from investors to strengthen its revenue, has upgraded iPads more frequently than many of its other products. The company introduced a cheaper version of the 9.7-inch iPad, priced at $329, in March and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compatible with an Apple stylus and keyboard, in 2015.Apple\u2019s predicament seems to be that for existing iPad customers, their tablets are still quite capable and running strong, giving them little reason to upgrade. For new customers, the iPad may be overkill for basic tasks, especially if you can just pay $50 for a media tablet from Amazon.One of Apple\u2019s splashiest hardware debuts was a brand new iMac Pro that will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega. Translation: It is Apple\u2019s all-in-one desktop on steroids.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the most powerful Mac we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d said John Ternus, Apple\u2019s vice president for hardware engineering.The new iMac Pro may help compensate for Apple\u2019s previous professional desktop, the Mac Pro, which was widely panned by critics and customers. The iMac Pro will start at $5,000 and ship in December.With this device, Apple is broadly catering to members of the professional community, like filmmakers and hard-core coders. For years, these users have felt left behind as Apple has focused on consumer-oriented products like the iPhone, shifting away from high-performance equipment for professionals.The company also announced upgrades of its 27-inch and 21.5-inch iMacs, its desktop computers, which will start at $1,099, with additional models at $1,299 and $1,799. And Apple lowered some prices for its MacBooks and said the MacBook Air, its entry-level lightweight laptop, would get a speed increase. The 21.5-inch model with 4K high resolution will start at about $1,300, with a new 13-inch MacBook Pro starting at $1,300.Every year, Apple updates the underlying operating systems that power its devices. The changes are geeky \u2014 remember, they are aimed at software developers \u2014 but they eventually trickle down to how we use iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches.The most important update was to iOS, the operating system that underpins Apple\u2019s biggest seller, iPhones, as well as iPads. Apple introduced iOS 11, with improved camera software; upgrades for Siri; an expansion of its mobile payment system, Apple Pay; and a new version of Apple Maps, with indoor mapping and features to prevent distracted driving.Because the show is about giving new tools to developers, Apple also focused on emerging technologies. Specifically, Apple highlighted augmented reality, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.Apple demonstrated changes to the operating system for the Apple Watch including a new watch face that uses Siri to suggest directions, show calendar items and generally predict what you will want to see. The most substantive changes focused on fitness, including the ability to track new types of high-intensity workouts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Far Right Wants to Be the New \u2018Alternative\u2019 Culture", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsAn always-useful thought experiment is to imagine seeing all the media around you for the first time \u2014 consciously, like a teenager freshly awakened to the existence of politics or an artificial intelligence that has just blinked across some humanoid threshold. This is especially handy lately, in our strange moment of flux. A wide-\u200beyed observer of today\u2019s political media wouldn\u2019t just see different voices and outlets with contrasting tendencies. It would see a disorienting game of rhetorical appropriation, in which it is constantly unclear who stands for which principles and why.An essential feature of the rise of Trumpism has been the brazen inversion, that trusty maneuver in which you wield your critics\u2019 own values against them \u2014 say, borrowing the language of social justice to argue that the \u201coppressor\u201d is actually oppressed or suddenly embracing progressive social causes in the service of criticizing Islam. It\u2019s a blunt but effective rhetorical confiscation, in which a battle-ready right relishes its ability to seize, inhabit and neutralize the arguments and vocabularies of its opponents, reveling in their continued inability to formulate any sort of answer to the trusty old \u2018\u2018I know you are, but what am I?\u2019\u2019Early in the 2016 election cycle, \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 was much closer to being a literal description of the pro-Trump media coterie: They stood in opposition not just to \u2018\u2018mainstream\u2019\u2019 media or the presumptive Democratic nominee but to the Republican establishment as well. Now, though, the word is both more broadly applied and less obviously applicable. This so-called alternative media is not just amplifying voices that more established media would rather not deal with; it is echoing and amplifying the voice of a Republican president presiding over a unified government. Critics may guffaw at Kellyanne Conway\u2019s \u2018\u2018alternative facts,\u2019\u2019 express revulsion at the white nationalist Richard Spencer\u2019s \u2018\u2018alt-right\u2019\u2019 or tilt their heads at Sean Hannity\u2019s attempt to brand an \u2018\u2018alt-left.\u2019\u2019 But the cumulative effect is undeniable: The \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 appropriation is working, and far more quickly than anyone might have expected.To that end, there are now explicitly ideological online platforms vying to create a whole alternative \u2014 and \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 \u2014 infrastructure for practicing politics and culture online. Fringe-right media is extremely active on Twitter, but when its most offensive pundits and participants are banned there, they can simply regroup on Gab, the platform Breitbart recently described as a \u2018\u2018free speech Twitter alternative.\u2019\u2019 Reddit, a semireluctant but significant host to right-wing activists, has a harder-right alternative in Voat, where users are free to post things that might get them banned elsewhere. Or there\u2019s the politics community on 4chan, which has long been the de facto \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 to other online communities, serving as a lawless exile, a base for war with the rest of the web and, in recent years, a shockingly influential source of political memes \u2014 the closest thing the new right has to a native culture.There is no burgeoning right-wing \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 Facebook or YouTube yet, but that development feels inevitable. The structures and communal ideals of the internet\u2019s biggest platforms \u2014 the closest thing that exists to a dominant culture online \u2014 are just waiting to be inverted, seized and used for new ends, like the liberal discourse before them.In retrospect, the essay is both overheated and prophetic, clearly ideological and narrow in its context. But its sensibility is clear. It demands safety from, not access to, the vast corporate system against which it defines itself. And more than anything, it presents the alternative as skeptical of, and in some ways incompatible with, power.The new reactionary \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 movement is also keenly aware of power, but it craves it, worships it, is constantly devising plans to acquire it. It has traded a siege mentality for a war bearing; its platforms are less gathering places for expressions of dissent than staging grounds against the venues to which they\u2019re opposed and against which they expect to win. Their rhetoric and style want to evoke, in some ghoulish upside-down way, heroic rebellion, regardless of how well their aims align with the powers that be. And so we get, for instance, the consummate \u201990s outsider Alex Jones \u2014 against the world but also taking over the world, under attack from elites but also on the phone with the president.At first glance, this seems incoherent. It\u2019s a libertarian resistance with an authoritarian program; a counterculture that yearns for tradition. But again, fresh eyes might help us avoid underestimating what is happening here. This \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 is not limited by consistent adherence to its own principles. This self-described underdog sees nothing problematic in its affinity for power. In fact, it believes, rightly, that to the right audience, contradiction is exciting. Nothing could be better for an insurgent political force than to be seen as a scrappy outsider. And nothing could be better for the aspiring mainstream \u2014 this time not corporate, or cultural, but political \u2014 than to adopt the permanent pose of the alternative.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

These are indisputably signs of progress and, as such, something to toast. But that progress has come too slowly. None of it should have to be so surprising, special or rare in the year of our Lord 2017.\u201cIt\u2019s where we are in our culture,\u201d said Sue Kroll, the president for marketing and distribution at Warner Bros., the studio behind \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d \u201cWhen things work on this kind of massive scale, people are surprised.\u201dOf course, she noted, they shouldn\u2019t be.That\u2019s the way it has been for so long in Hollywood, where until relatively recently men almost exclusively called the shots, made the rules and rarely faced accountability for their behavior.

Look at what happened last week in Austin, Tex., where the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema\u2019s Ritz theater announced that it would celebrate \u201cWonder Woman\u201d with a women-only screening this Tuesday.Seemed innocent enough. The theater holds all sorts of specialty screenings, for veterans and active-duty military, for kids, for lesbians and gay people, for the hearing impaired.Another man wrote, \u201cIf people can bring a lawsuit against a baker for not making homosexual couples a cake, this place should undoubtedly be receiving many lawsuits for gender discrimination.\u201d\u201cThe notion of a woman hero is a fine example of women\u2019s eagerness to accept the appearance of achievement without actual achievement,\u201d the email read. \u201cAchievements by the second-rate gender pale in comparison to virtually everything great in human history was accomplished by men, not women.\u201dThe Austin dust-up carried whiffs of the row over the 2016 Sony Pictures remake of \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d which cast women in the starring roles.But her publicist told me that it wasn\u2019t the time, though maybe it would be down the line \u2014 apparently closer to its premiere. That, obviously, would better suit marketing imperatives.It was a good reminder that the real currency in Hollywood is less principle than success.That\u2019s fitting. If real change is going to come for women in Hollywood, it may just take a superhero.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Soft Children Confront a Hard World in Maile Meloy\u2019s New Novel", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesMaile Meloy\u2019s third novel for adults begins as two young couples and their children board a cruise ship in Southern California. The plan is to travel down the coasts of Mexico and Central America and do a turnaround at the Panama Canal.Cruise ships, those fun-house microcosms of society, offer rich and sometimes lurid settings to social observers. Witness James Agee\u2019s savage reportage in \u201cHavana Cruise,\u201d published in Fortune in 1937, for example, or Katherine Anne Porter\u2019s novel \u201cShip of Fools\u201d (1962), or the title essay in David Foster Wallace\u2019s \u201cA Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019ll Never Do Again\u201d (1997). You cruise, these writers suggest, and fundamentally you lose.Meloy\u2019s \u201cDo Not Become Alarmed\u201d is not that sort of energetic, swivel-eyed production. It\u2019s an earnest and surprisingly generic children-in-jeopardy novel, one that makes few demands on us and doesn\u2019t deliver much, either.The story told in \u201cDo Not Become Alarmed\u201d is every parent\u2019s nightmare. The two mothers, along with a third mother they met on the ship, and their six children leave the vessel to go on a zip-line outing in Central America. When their guide\u2019s van breaks down, and they learn that a replacement van will take hours, they decide to spend the day where they are, on a remote beach.While their children play in the water, two of the mothers fall asleep. A third disappears into the woods with the handsome guide for a bit of light and uncharacteristic fooling around.Meloy pokes around in some profound subject matter. This novel returns more than once to the notion that these children are too soft and tame, that their parents have not prepared them properly for the world.Plush first-world lives come in for scrutiny. \u201cThe karmic bus had mowed her down,\u201d one of the mothers thinks. \u201cShe was being punished for living in a false world, spongy and insulated from the reality around her. For living in a house with an alarm system, in a neighborhood where the only Latinos were gardeners and day laborers.\u201dAnother mother \u2014 the one who fooled around with the guide \u2014 thinks: \u201cThe one time she had slipped, she had been punished like Job. God had sent a lightning bolt to destroy everything she cared about.\u201dThese women and their husbands aren\u2019t distinct characters; they\u2019re upper-middle-class types. The crunchy details, the chili-rub and panko crust that would bring them to life, are absent. The mom who\u2019s the movie executive doesn\u2019t feel like one.Perhaps the longest description of her work is clich\u00e9d and halfhearted, and comes from her husband: \u201cThat was good for Liz \u2014 to be offline and away from the studio. Even when a movie got made, the path it took always sounded to him like a drug deal gone wrong. Lies, threats, incrimination, betrayal, last-minute bargaining, total lunacy. She needed a break.\u201dYou wait for her to turn into Sherry Lansing and chew some scenery, but it never happens. Meloy tells this story from multiple perspectives \u2014 the most tantalizing character is the American-educated son of a drug-world figure \u2014 but there is a sameness of tone to the narrative strands.\u201cDo Not Become Alarmed\u201d grows darker than you might expect. The kids are not all right. What\u2019s more, the novel becomes interested in the notion not just of moral culpability but of hate.The children turn on one another and their parents. The parents turn on one another. One father thinks: \u201cHe could kill those women with his bare hands.\u201dIt is impossible to read anything in 2017, or write anything, without thinking of America\u2019s political and moral predicament. It\u2019s tendentious to mention it in every review, but I am thinking about it while writing every line of every review.Near the end of this novel, one of the luckier parents thinks: \u201cHe and his family had escaped, leaving chaos behind them. It was the American way.\u201dAn earlier version of this review misidentified the intended audience for the books in The Apothecary Series. They are middle-grade novels, not young-adult novels.Advertisement"}

And it\u2019s not a fight between Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s not rich versus poor or urban versus rural. This is a fight to define what kind of country we are. It\u2019s a fight to determine what kind of country we will be. And it\u2019s a fight to determine whether we are willing to stand up for our deepest values.

You can do that. We elder people may not see that kind of world. But you can see it and you can enjoy.\u201d\u201cThere is no such thing as comfortable Christianity. We are what we tolerate. Moral stagnation always leads to spiritual apathy. And truth must never be sacrificed on the altar of political, cultural or sexual expediency.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re never not afraid. I\u2019m still afraid. I was afraid to write this speech. And now, I\u2019m just realizing how many people are watching me right now, and it\u2019s scary.

{"Headline": "The Resistance: Impeachment Anxiety", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byLast week, in highly anticipated Senate testimony, fired F.B.I. Director James Comey delivered a stinging rebuke and strong indictment of Donald Trump as an abuser of power, twister of arms and, above all, a spewer of lies.No fewer than five times did Comey accuse Trump of lying.Trump took to Twitter on Friday morning, writing:\u201cDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication ... and WOW, Comey is a leaker!\u201dThat too was a lie.During a Rose Garden press conference Friday afternoon with the president of Romania, Trump answered the question of why he felt \u201ccomplete vindication\u201d by speaking in a hodgepodge of hashtags:\u201cNo collusion, no obstruction, he\u2019s a leaker.\u201dIf America is confronted with a he-said, he-said standoff between Trump and Comey, the former having a documented history as a pathological liar and the latter not, to whom one grants the benefit of the doubt is easily answered: Comey.And yet, there was something many seemed to find unsatisfying about Comey\u2019s testimony: There was no knockout blow. It wasn\u2019t the penultimate moment that guaranteed impeachment, but rather just another moment in what will likely be a plodding inquiry.This becomes the critical and increasingly urgent question for many: Will Trump be impeached \u2014 or indicted \u2014 and when? The anticipation has produced a throbbing anxiety. There is so much emotional investment in Trump\u2019s removal that I fear that it blinds people to the fact that it is a long shot and, in any case, a long way off.\u201cWould the Constitution allow Mr. Mueller to indict Mr. Trump if he finds evidence of criminal conduct? The prevailing view among most legal experts is no. They say the president is immune from prosecution so long as he is in office.\u201dAs to the point of impeachment, the founders made this difficult on purpose.Only two American presidents \u2014 Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton \u2014 have ever been impeached by the House of Representatives. The Senate refused to convict in both cases, and both men remained in office.Richard Nixon might well have been impeached, but resigned before the House could vote on his articles of impeachment.Yes, there is a first time for everything, and this may well be the first time that a president is impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, or that a president is successfully indicted, but think hard about how remote that possibility is.At this moment both the House and Senate are led by Republicans who show no inclination to hold Trump accountable and who in fact are now making excuses for his aberrant behavior.Sorry folks, ignorance \u2014 even the towering ignorance of Trump \u2014 is no excuse.A damning report from Mueller could change Republican reticence, but such a report is likely quite far off. (Fifteen months passed from the time a special prosecutor was appointed in the Watergate investigation and the time Nixon resigned.)Unfortunately American expectations are tuned to a Netflix sensibility in which we want to binge a complete season in a single sitting. A proper investigation will not indulge our impatience.The best bet is for Democrats to win a majority in the House in 2018, which is possible and maybe even likely, but winning a majority in the Senate that year is a much steeper climb \u2014 not impossible, but improbable.I know well that the very real obstacles to removal injure the psyche of those worn thin by the relentless onslaught of awfulness erupting from this White House. I know well that impeachment is one of the only rays of hope cutting through these dark times. I\u2019m with you; I too crave some form of political comeuppance.But, I believe that it\u2019s important to face the very real possibility that removal may not come, and if it does, it won\u2019t come swiftly. And even a Trump impeachment would leave America with a President Pence, a nightmare of a different stripe but no less a nightmare.In the end, the Resistance must be bigger than impeachment; it must be about political realignment. It must be built upon solid rock of principle and not hang solely on the slender hope of expulsion. This is a long game and will not come to an abrupt conclusion. Perseverance must be the precept; lifelong commitment must be the motto.Advertisement"}

And it\u2019s been a great year for revivals in general, especially that one they revived down in Washington, D.C. It started off-Broadway in the \u201980s. Way off Broadway, over on Fifth Avenue.

But, we know this stuff changes. One show gets on, a few will sell, and a couple shows go off, and then we go back to the white TV land we\u2019ve had before.\u201dThis creative awakening stems in large part from a bottom-line revelation: What was once considered only a niche market is now valued as an eager and highly engaged television audience.\u201cFor marketers, our data shows that 73 percent of whites and 67 percent of Hispanics believe African-Americans influence mainstream culture,\u201d said Andrew McCaskill, the senior vice president of communications and multicultural marketing at Nielsen. \u201cCreating smart, culturally relevant advertising campaigns that are inclusive of minority populations allows brands to build loyalty within communities of color while maintaining general population acceptance.\u201dAt the same time, the rise of streaming services like Netflix and the continued proliferation of quality series from cable networks like AMC and FX have spurred other networks, both old and new, to keep pace. No longer are reruns, videos and cheap reality and talk shows enough to guarantee viewers and ad dollars.But by 2012, OWN found a glimmer of hope with the docu-series \u201cWelcome to Sweetie Pie\u2019s,\u201d about Robbie Montgomery and her family as she runs a soul food restaurant in St. Louis.\u201cI think we were a little surprised about how successful \u2018Sweetie Pie\u2019s\u2019 was going to be,\u201d Erik Logan, the president of OWN, said. \u201cUpon reflection, the show worked because the central character in that show, Miss Robbie, is somebody that our audience could see themselves in. She was a single mom, she raised her son, Tim, who fell into crime, became incarcerated, came out of prison and is dealing with a very real issue that is facing the community at that time and even still today. What it taught us was that we need more authentic, real story lines.\u201dInspired by that success, Ms. Winfrey then partnered with the movie hitmaker Tyler Perry to produce shows, including \u201cThe Have and Have Nots\u201d and \u201cIf Loving You Is Wrong,\u201d exclusively for OWN. \u201cWhat his shows did,\u201d Mr. Logan said, \u201cwas shine a light on a different style of storytelling for us and the network: the scripted word.\u201dIn 2016, OWN added two dramas: Craig Wright\u2019s megachurch drama, \u201cGreenleaf,\u201d and \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d a Lousiania-set drama about the Bordelon siblings, all of whom are battling their own demons, one another and the neighboring Landrys, a white family that wants to buy the Bordelons\u2019 sugar mill.OWN\u2019s prime-time schedule is now 75 percent original scripted programming, and the ratings have followed. In the last five years, its prime-time audience has grown by 46 percent (to 455,000 from an average of 311,000), while African-American viewership has grown by 168 percent (to 298,000 from 111,000).\u201cWhen we started to gather the OWN tribe, and recognize who had come, the question in our meeting rooms was how do we now serve this audience \u2014 who is this woman?\u201d said Ms. Winfrey. \u201cShe is an intentional seeker, she\u2019s the kind of person who\u2019s watching \u2018Super Soul Sunday\u2019 as her church. Many of them are single moms who are working, but who have dreams for their lives, their children\u2019s lives, they\u2019re in relationships, they\u2019re getting married again. So we try to meet them where they are and serve them in an intentional way that reflects their lives back on themselves.\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s been historically many artists who have tended to center black women in their work; the question is the compatible distributor, the compatible broadcaster who is also centering them and delivering that work,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil OWN we didn\u2019t have anything specifically for women of color. Not like we are only for women of color, but we can say \u2018There\u2019s something special here for you.\u2019 The beautiful thing about cable is that we can say \u2018We are for this.\u2019\u201dAt BET, which was known for the R&B and hip-hop music video shows \u201cVideo Soul\u201d and later \u201c106 & Park\u201d since its debut in 1980, a similar transformation was underway.\u201cI knew our audience had been demanding a scripted product from us \u2014 they wanted us to look like any broadcast network, whether it\u2019s ABC or NBC, said Debra Lee, who became president and chief executive of BET Networks in 2005. \u201cThey were very proud of BET, because we were the only network targeting the African-American community, and yet they wanted to see authentic, realistic versions of themselves.\u201dThe first move came in 2011, when BET picked up Mara Brock Akil\u2019s dramedy \u201cThe Game,\u201d which had run on CW before it was dropped. It immediately set a network record, drawing 7.7 million viewers.\u201cThat one show proved the case that if we gave our audience high-quality programming, they will show up,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cThose numbers were just incredible, and no one mentioned the fact that BET was now producing it, not CBS. They didn\u2019t see any quality difference in the show.\u201dBut changing course is not easy. \u201cIt took a while to get into scripted, especially when you\u2019re coming from a music video background,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cThe investment is more, and we had to get different programming executives and development people. It really changes the business of the whole network, and now scripted programming is the cornerstone of what we do at BET.\u201dBut rather than rebrand entirely, BET uses its scripted programming to draw from its musical past \u2014 the BET Awards show remains the network\u2019s signature event. Dramas like \u201cThe New Edition Story,\u201d a mini-series that drew an average of 4.4 million total viewers, and Irv Lorenzo\u2019s hip-hop-themed \u201cTales,\u201d debuting on June 27, demonstrate that cultural continuity.\u201cI wanted to be able to save that show,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said, \u201cbut it did not make good business sense for me.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the expansion of television programming with African-American themes misstated the name of a BET series debuting on Tuesday, June 27. It is \u201cTales,\u201d not \u201cFlags.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But she is unafraid to take risks, and now she\u2019s learned some wrestling moves \u2014 and gained inner confidence \u2014 in the process.\u201cAll the women on the show, we really were cheering each other on,\u201d she said of the \u201cGLOW\u201d experience. \u201cWe\u2019re all walking much taller and holding ourselves differently in day-to-day life.\u201dMs. Brie talked about fighting for her role on \u201cGLOW\u201d and grappling with the demands of the 1980s. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Did you choose to do \u201cGLOW\u201d as a deliberate pivot away from the characters you\u2019d played on \u201cCommunity\u201d and \u201cMad Men\u201d? Annie and Trudy were the same side of the coin, in terms of being very polished and calculated, although Annie was a little more messy. I was really craving getting my hands dirty and doing something with a bit more edge. My agents called me and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a new show they\u2019re making for Netflix. Jenji Kohan\u2019s producing it; it\u2019s about women\u2019s wrestling in the \u201980s.\u201d And I was like, \u201cThis. Is. The. Show.\u201d And then, of course, they didn\u2019t want to cast me on this at all. [laughs]Why weren\u2019t they interested in you? I think, like a lot of people, they had a very specific idea of my skill set. And I was hellbent on proving them wrong. It actually really fired me up. I think I read four times for this show. At every stage, the stakes felt like they had never been higher. I felt so much like the character, Ruth.You and your castmates spent several weeks in wrestling training. What was that like? Was this the first time you\u2019d permed your hair? No way. I had perms in the late \u201980s, early \u201990s, because my aunt was a hairdresser and my mom was constantly changing her hair. One year my mom, my sister and me all got matching perms together. The perm smell was a very nostalgic smell for me. When the hair guy was about to do it, he was trying to warn me. I was like, \u201cOh, I know this smell.\u201dMy parents got divorced when I was 5, and they both raised me. My mom was working two jobs, she put herself through school and got her master\u2019s degree, and was trying to date when I was a small child. I remember, from the clothes alone, there was this aspect of women trying to emulate men \u2014 shoulder pads and all that stuff. What I like about this show is, women are infiltrating this place that was usually reserved for men \u2014 the wrestling ring \u2014 but they\u2019re not trying to be men. They are women, and they are proud to be women.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s what we woke up to with the sunrise. And Iraqis, especially young Iraqis, inevitably found ways to endure.

Going back and forth, growing up as the daughter of refugees who fled 20 years ago, what might she have accomplished in Australia or in Iraq?These kinds of questions are not often asked in public debates about terrorism or refugees, at least not when the victims are Muslim.All of which raises an important question: How does a democratic society learn to calibrate its concern, to distinguish the Zynabs of the world from their potential attackers?It\u2019s an enormous challenge, not just for government but for every citizen, and it will play out in the minds and interactions of all of us for years to come. This week, at least, I\u2019m seeking solace in one of the many things I learned in war: Even in the world\u2019s most violent places, there are always more victims than perpetrators; there are more people who want to just live rather than to kill or die.Now for some lighter fare.Here are a few of my favorite Times stories from the past week, plus a recommendation from one of our talented new young hires, Isabella Kwai.________________________It\u2019s an investigation into how the police handled the case of Jacob Wetterling, an 11-year-old who was abducted from a town in Minnesota in 1989.

{"Headline": "A Mother\u2019s Death, a Botched Inquiry and a Sheriff at War", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "The sheriff called it a suicide. When a state investigator raised questions, he became the investigated.Supported byST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. \u2014 Rusty Rodgers did not fit everyone\u2019s image of a law enforcement officer, particularly in deeply conservative northeast Florida. One police chief, well ensconced in the local power structure, expressed irritation over what he called the officer\u2019s \u201cJimmy Buffett look\u201d \u2014 long hair, beard, loafers and no socks.No one, however, questioned Agent Rodgers\u2019s tenacity as an investigator.Later, Agent Rodgers joined the state\u2019s elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where he quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors \u2014 and a meeting with the governor \u2014 for helping dismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East. For the governor, he made a concession: He cut his hair.Then, in January 2011, came the call that would upend his life.Go to St. Augustine, he was told, to reinvestigate the death of 24-year-old Michelle O\u2019Connell, shot while packing to leave her deputy sheriff boyfriend, Jeremy Banks. The fatal bullet came from his service weapon.Agent Rodgers had been summoned here twice before to answer questions about cases involving the St. Johns County sheriff, David B. Shoar \u2014 examining whether his officers had drawn their guns and used pepper spray to break up a peaceful graduation party in an African-American neighborhood (they had), and whether a political supporter of the sheriff had engaged in improper conduct with minors (he hadn\u2019t).This time, the stakes were higher. There was a dead body \u2014 a single mother of a 4-year-old girl \u2014 and the sheriff\u2019s office had chosen to investigate its own deputy, poorly as it turned out. Because detectives quickly concluded that Ms. O\u2019Connell had taken her own life, they had done little investigating.Now, with crucial evidence missing or unexamined, Agent Rodgers had to make sense of the mess. And that meant possibly antagonizing one of Florida\u2019s most powerful sheriffs. A mercurial leader, unctuous one moment, bitingly critical the next, Sheriff Shoar didn\u2019t countenance challenges to his authority. He had resisted the O\u2019Connell family\u2019s demands for an outside review of the case for nearly five months.When the sheriff finally agreed, his office had one requirement \u2014 that Agent Rodgers, and only Agent Rodgers, conduct the investigation, according to Steve Donaway, a former supervisor with the state investigative agency. (The sheriff disputes that.)It took the agent only two weeks to find evidence that fundamentally changed the complexion of the case. Two neighbors told him that they had heard cries for help on the night of the shooting, prompting the medical examiner to change his ruling from suicide to \u201cshot by another.\u201d As the investigation moved toward homicide, the local state attorney suddenly recused himself, prompting the governor to appoint a special prosecutor.But the medical examiner changed his mind yet again, and the special prosecutor, citing insufficient evidence, closed the case without bringing charges. And for a year, that\u2019s where the case stood \u2014 closed if not forgotten.My record request was routine, but Sheriff Shoar didn\u2019t view it that way. In his world, an out-of-town reporter \u201cpoking around\u201d a closed case \u201ckind of stunk,\u201d he said, and he alerted prosecutors so they wouldn\u2019t be caught off guard. But when the sheriff learned that I had already asked Agent Rodgers\u2019s supervisor for an interview, and that he had not been notified, the sheriff erupted, suspecting, incorrectly, that the agency was behind my visit.\u201cI realized I\u2019m dealing with a whole different set of facts, quite truthfully malice and wickedness,\u201d he told state officials. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 33 years. I know how to deal with bullies.\u201dHis answer was a scathingly personal yearslong attack on Agent Rodgers \u2014 a campaign that put the outsize powers of a small-town sheriff on full display and ultimately swept up nearly everyone in its path.The sheriff commissioned his own investigation of the investigator, accusing him of serious crimes that, he said, had nearly caused an innocent man \u2014 his officer \u2014 to be charged with murder. He embedded his accusations in the public consciousness through a cascade of press releases, phone calls, letters, interviews and online posts. He sent his findings to state law enforcement officials and the F.B.I. As a result, Agent Rodgers\u2019s own employer and later a special prosecutor began investigating him. He was placed on administrative leave, forced to surrender his badge and gun, barred by his agency from publicly defending himself.In April, I returned to St. Augustine to report on this second act of a drama that, over seven years now, has sown deep scars in this community by the sea. It has divided the law enforcement establishment, not to mention the family of Michelle O\u2019Connell. It has been reviewed by one state attorney, three special prosecutors and four medical examiners, and is debated still in the local press, on the beaches and in the bars. It has, in short, become the stuff of Florida noir, featured in a documentary on Netflix, in People magazine and on television shows like \u201cDr. Phil.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d said Dr. Frederick Hobin, who performed the original autopsy.On this trip, I approached several of the central players who had declined to be interviewed before. I had new questions, based on my review of thousands of documents not available when I first reported on the case.Sheriff Shoar had promised to spend the rest of his career holding Agent Rodgers accountable. But what I came to learn was that the sheriff had tried to destroy the investigator with accusations that were often nothing more than innuendo and unverified rumors. Even so, they went virtually unchallenged for years.In the end, the sheriff did not achieve his goal of seeing Agent Rodgers sent to prison, charged with a crime or even fired from his job. But he did accomplish something else: He diverted attention away from his office\u2019s own botched investigation, the spawning ground for so much of the anger and conflict that followed.It is an hour\u2019s drive down Interstate 95 from the Jacksonville airport to St. Augustine, which promotes itself as America\u2019s oldest city, where Ponce de Le\u00f3n mythically searched for the Fountain of Youth.St. Augustine forms the core of a very red county that in 2016 voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump and for Sheriff Shoar, re-electing him to a fourth term with 85 percent of the vote.The sheriff\u2019s persona plays well on this political stage. Speaking to a Christian prayer group in 2015, he railed against gun control, separation of church and state and especially Washington. America\u2019s problems began, he said, when the government \u201ctried to outlaw our faith.\u201d He blamed the media for \u201cburning down Ferguson\u201d and spreading the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that police officers are bad people who must be watched with body cameras. Along the way, he sprinkled in a little Shakespeare on the brevity of life.Sheriff Shoar, who declined to speak for this article, draws support from an important Florida constituency: law enforcement and the military. He is a former member of the Florida National Guard and a past president of the Florida Sheriffs Association, where he recently welcomed his newly elected brethren with an ethics lecture titled \u201cKeeping the Tarnish Off the Badge.\u201dThe state enforcement agency, known locally as F.D.L.E., \u201chas always bent over backwards for sheriffs,\u201d said Mr. Donaway, who supervised Agent Rodgers and his investigative colleagues in 13 counties. \u201cThe sheriffs association is politically very powerful.\u201dSheriff Shoar began his rise to power as a patrolman for the St. Augustine police, eventually becoming chief. His personnel file from that era includes extensive praise, but also a hint of problems.\u201cOne area he could improve is to slow down and get all the facts prior to making decisions,\u201d his supervisor wrote in October 1999. In an earlier personnel review, the supervisor had written that \u201ctoo many projects at once cause a loss of focus.\u201dThe sheriff does not suffer from a lack of self-regard. He once told law enforcement officers that they might want an \u201c8-by-10 photograph\u201d of him after reading his \u201cbeautiful\u201d letter to The New York Times \u2014 he copied 31 public figures and members of the media \u2014 saying the paper\u2019s reporting on the shooting lacked objectivity. The Times was still eight months away from publishing its first article on the case.His power is nourished by his gift for extemporaneous, often humorous, oratory, not to mention his position as one of the county\u2019s largest employers. He has the means to reward people he favors. One month after his agency\u2019s flawed investigation of the O\u2019Connell shooting, he surprised employees by handing out $1,000 bonuses. He later promoted the officers who investigated Agent Rodgers \u2014 \u201cmy brightest guys,\u201d he called them.And he hired as a deputy the 20-year-old son of the special prosecutor who had declined to charge Deputy Banks. The prosecutor, Brad King, listed the sheriff as his first character reference in an unsuccessful attempt last year to join the Florida Supreme Court. (Mr. King said that he did not know the sheriff during the O\u2019Connell case and that his son was highly qualified for the job.)\u201cHe really fancies himself as a kingmaker,\u201d said Michael Gold, the sheriff\u2019s first campaign manager, who broke with him years ago and publishes an online news report. After he criticized the handling of the O\u2019Connell case, Mr. Gold said, the sheriff refused to renew his press credentials. He was never given a reason.\u201cHe demands absolute authority and does not like to be questioned by anyone,\u201d Mr. Gold said.Nancy Shaver, a political neophyte who unseated a Shoar supporter as mayor of St. Augustine in 2014, wrote a letter to the local paper asking the United States attorney to review the O\u2019Connell case. When she ran for re-election two years later, Sheriff Shoar backed her opponent, the owner of a conservative radio station. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever,\u201d the sheriff proclaimed, \u201cto have elected leaders who stand with our police officers.\u201dMs. Shaver said it was the first time the sheriff had injected himself into the nonpartisan mayoral race. She won anyhow.At 11:20 on the night of Sept. 2, 2010, Deputy Banks called 911 to report that his girlfriend had shot herself: \u201cI\u2019m Deputy Banks with the St. Johns County Sheriff\u2019s Office. I work with y\u2019all. Get someone here now.\u201d The sheriff\u2019s officers found him holding Ms. O\u2019Connell as she lay on the floor with a gunshot to the mouth.According to the deputy, Ms. O\u2019Connell was packing to move out after breaking up with him when he heard a shot while he was sitting in the garage. He rushed to another part of the house, he said, smashed through a locked door and found her on the ground.Two inexperienced detectives hastily decided that Ms. O\u2019Connell had taken her own life, even though the crime scene offered a muddled picture. How could a woman unfamiliar with guns withdraw her boyfriend\u2019s weapon from a retention holster? Why was a second bullet buried in the carpet several inches from her body? Why did she have a bleeding cut above her eye?After months of questions and complaints from the O\u2019Connell family, Agent Rodgers was dispatched to re-examine the shooting.The investigator, now 60, has never shied from difficult assignments.\u201cThere are two types of people in law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Donaway, the former F.D.L.E. supervisor, said in an interview. \u201cFor one group, it\u2019s a job \u2014 good people \u2014 but it\u2019s their job. They feed their family and look at retirement.\u201d Agent Rodgers, he said, was in a different class \u2014 officers who, \u201cwhen they see evil, and the bad things that happen to people,\u201d are driven to do something about it. He had investigated cold-case killings, child pornography, police shootings and an officer suspected of serial rapes.What made this case especially delicate was that Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s brother and mother worked for the sheriff, while Agent Rodgers\u2019s immediate superior was married to a senior official in the sheriff\u2019s office.The agent\u2019s first task was easy \u2014 identify holes in the sheriff\u2019s investigation. He gave his findings to the sheriff\u2019s second-in-command, Joel Bolante, who considered him a friend from when they worked a vice case years before. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any problems with Rusty,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew he was pretty thorough with that kind of work.\u201dWith no witnesses or suicide note in hand, Sheriff Shoar\u2019s officers should have interviewed Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s family to assess her mental state, but did not. They also failed to canvass the neighborhood, send evidence to the lab, download cellphone data, collect all relevant clothing and properly interview the boyfriend. \u201cEvidence that could have been collected, to either prove or disprove what happened that night, had been lost forever because of their incompetence,\u201d Mr. Donaway said. Unfairly or not, suspicion fell on Deputy Banks. And the O\u2019Connell family lost the chance to achieve closure.Then, two weeks in, Agent Rodgers made his surprise discovery \u2014 the two neighbors who said they had heard screams for help before each gunshot. Still, many questions remained unresolved, and on the advice of the state attorney, the agent hired a respected crime scene reconstructionist, Jerry Findley. In April 2011, Mr. Findley rendered his conclusion: The evidence was more consistent with homicide than with suicide.If Mr. Findley\u2019s findings did not sway the medical examiner, Dr. Hobin, the neighbors\u2019 testimony did. In June, he changed his finding from suicide to \u201cshot by another.\u201dSoon after, another influential figure joined the discussion \u2014 a newly appointed medical examiner, Dr. Predrag Bulic. Although the O\u2019Connell case was not his, Dr. Bulic assumed control. He produced no report but concluded that Ms. O\u2019Connell had taken her own life. Eventually, Dr. Hobin came to agree.Both cited the lack of defensive wounds, though there was a new injury above Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s eye. Dr. Bulic theorized that she had turned the gun upside down and shot herself, causing the outer edge of the gun\u2019s tactical light to cut her skin as it was fired.Later, the special prosecutor would latch on to Dr. Bulic\u2019s theory, saying the light recoiled \u201cforward\u201d rather than backward, causing the injury. Forensic experts I interviewed dismissed that as ludicrous.Dr. Bulic had also incorrectly measured the gun \u2014 by a lot \u2014 rendering his explanation even more implausible.Using an unloaded gun, Dr. Bulic demonstrated his theory at a meeting called by the state attorney. Mr. Donaway, one of several F.D.L.E. agents in attendance, recalled that, before sitting down, Dr. Bulic said words to the effect that \u201cI had a number of meetings with Sheriff Shoar about this case, but I want you to know it did not influence my decision.\u201dThe agents were stunned. The meeting went downhill from there, F.D.L.E. records show. Mark Brutnell, Agent Rodgers\u2019s immediate supervisor, said that as law enforcement officials \u201ckept firing questions,\u201d Dr. Bulic repeatedly changed his account of how Ms. O\u2019Connell had held the gun.The medical examiner, who denies discussing the case with Sheriff Shoar, gave them another reason to worry. \u201cAfter he\u2019s fumbling and bumbling, he makes the statement, \u2018And I can rule undetermined if you want,\u2019\u201d said Dominick Pape, who ran the agency\u2019s Jacksonville office. At that meeting, he said, he became convinced that Dr. Bulic \u201cdid not have a clue how she could have committed suicide with that weapon.\u201dAt one point, prosecutors considered exhuming Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s body. But \u201cBulic did a cursory review of what Hobin did, and he said there is no need to pull the body out of the ground,\u201d Agent Brutnell recalled. \u201cThat is a game-changer. It stopped the investigation.\u201dThe state attorney, R. J. Larizza, suddenly recused himself, citing his friendship with the sheriff. He refused to elaborate when I asked why that had not been a concern from the outset.With the case now in the lap of the special prosecutor, Mr. King, yet another medical examiner was called in \u2014 Dr. Steven Cogswell. He endorsed the upside-down gun theory, though he produced no report and could not remember details when I interviewed him in 2013.Mr. King also discounted Mr. Findley\u2019s conclusion of homicide, saying the analyst admitted that he had not considered the upside-down gun theory.Mr. Findley disputes that claim. It was considered, he said, but quickly rejected as implausible.On March 12, 2012, Mr. King announced his decision, explaining in a memorandum that the evidence cited by F.D.L.E., pointing toward homicide, had \u201cequally innocent explanations.\u201dHis conclusion: \u201cThe facts as they currently exist do not support the prosecution of Jeremy Banks for any homicide offense.\u201dThat was where the case stood a year later when I made my first trip to St. Augustine, to report on the shooting and its impact on the community. Sheriff Shoar would later cite that visit as the reason he ordered his officers to re-examine a closed case.An F.D.L.E. supervisor, he said, told the sheriff\u2019s office that I had interviewed him about the shooting for 30 to 40 minutes. On hearing this, I immediately informed the sheriff that he was mistaken, that the supervisor had in fact refused to answer any of my questions. Even so, Sheriff Shoar repeated his statement in his report.For an interview that never happened, it had quite an impact.In a little more than a month, the sheriff responded with a blistering 152-page report that all but declared war on the state\u2019s investigative agency. The sheriff accused Agent Rodgers of manufacturing evidence, coaching witnesses and lying to obtain search warrants, among other misdeeds. He also harshly condemned Mr. Pape, the special agent in charge, or S.A.C., in Jacksonville, where Agent Rodgers worked.\u201cThough I and many others suspected that Agent Rodgers and SAC Pape were careless and reckless during their review/investigation of this case, it was not until we conducted this exhaustive review did we come to understand the gravity of their misconduct,\u201d Sheriff Shoar wrote.The officer who led the sheriff\u2019s investigation, Skip Cole, now a commander, confirmed that his team started reviewing Agent Rodgers\u2019s files after learning of my interest in the case. \u201cWe tried to get out in front of it,\u201d he said in court papers.Sheriff Shoar acknowledged alerting the medical examiner, Dr. Bulic, of possible trouble ahead. F.D.L.E.\u2019s supervisors, he told him, \u201care dirty dealing, and this guy from The New York Times ain\u2019t no good either.\u201dOne thing Sheriff Shoar\u2019s officers did not do was try to interview their target, Agent Rodgers. Later on, however, they would share information with the special prosecutor investigating him.All the while, F.D.L.E. prohibited the agent from responding, even as Sheriff Shoar continued to publicly roast his reputation. (Agent Rodgers was also barred from speaking for this article.)But the documents I recently located and reviewed \u2014 thousands of pages of investigative files, court records, letters, emails and audiotapes from the inquiries into Agent Rodgers and from a lawsuit filed by Deputy Banks \u2014 when taken together, offer a radical counterpoint to the sheriff\u2019s portrait of an ethically corrupt investigator.Agent Rodgers\u2019s work was not flawless. While certain facts remain in dispute, this much is clear: The most damaging accusations against him turned out to be demonstrably false, unsupported by existing evidence or contradicted by Sheriff Shoar\u2019s own sources. Lesser criticisms were either overblown or deemed mostly within the bounds of accepted investigative practices.What\u2019s more, records show that the sheriff and his officers made little or no effort to confirm their accusations, which were simply passed on to government agencies in hopes of provoking a criminal investigation.The misstatements begin in the opening of the report, where Sheriff Shoar erroneously contends that Mr. King, the special prosecutor, concluded that Ms. O\u2019Connell killed herself. He made no ruling about how she died.Some false statements are repeated. Sheriff Shoar twice accuses the agent of lying to obtain a search warrant by telling the court that Deputy Banks had failed to mention that a third person was present during the shooting.\u201cThis is a deliberate misrepresentation of the truth,\u201d the sheriff wrote, alleging that Agent Rodgers knew the person had not been present but made the statement \u201cin an attempt to portray his perception of Banks\u2019s guilt and to mislead the court.\u201d In fact, it was only after warrants were issued that Agent Rodgers learned that the third person had not been present after all, according to F.D.L.E.\u2019s internal affairs investigators.The report portrayed him as a rogue agent whose investigative style, and supposed early belief in Deputy Banks\u2019s guilt, troubled other investigators. Agent Rodgers\u2019s employer did not publicly challenge this, but privately his supervisors did.\u201cIf somebody came up and said your investigators are doing it wrong, that would be a huge red flag,\u201d Mr. Donaway said. But that never happened, he said.Agent Rodgers\u2019s supervisors said his work was closely monitored. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t trust Rusty,\u201d Mr. Donaway said. \u201cWe trusted him explicitly. But we wanted to make sure that we ran it through many minds and made collective decisions.\u201d Everyone, he said, knew it was \u201ca hot-potato case.\u201dOnly after The Times began examining the shooting, more than two years after Ms. O\u2019Connell died, did Sheriff Shoar list many, but not all, of his own agency\u2019s mistakes on just two pages buried in the middle of his 152-page attack.Perhaps the biggest challenge Sheriff Shoar faced in seeking to discredit Agent Rodgers was his discovery of the two neighbors who said they had heard a woman scream for help.Their statements appeared to undercut Deputy Banks\u2019s account that he and Ms. O\u2019Connell had not argued at the house the night she died. As one F.D.L.E. supervisor wryly observed, \u201cA lot of suicide people don\u2019t scream for help before they shoot themselves.\u201dStill, state investigators were initially skeptical. Investigators from the state attorney and the special prosecutor separately visited the neighbors \u2014 Heather Ladley and Stacey Boswell \u2014 and found them credible. Both passed polygraph exams.Sheriff Shoar\u2019s reaction to the new disclosure would become the template for his response to anyone who disagreed with his view of the case \u2014 he attacked.\u201cI know what happened,\u201d he told F.D.L.E. agents investigating Agent Rodgers. Without offering proof, or even interviewing the neighbors, he said the two women were \u201cbogus\u201d and knew nothing. \u201cRodgers, I think, interviewed them all at the same time, and I\u2019m sure he coached them.\u201dHe also accused Agent Rodgers of trying to hide how he had found them, yet the investigator explained that in his written report. Both women said under oath that they had been interviewed separately, and that the agent had not coached them.As for the polygraph exams, the sheriff had an answer for that, too: Although the polygraph examiner was \u201cpretty damn good,\u201d he said, Agent Rodgers \u201ceither strong-armed him or conned him into it because I\u2019ve had experts look at the polygraph and it\u2019s nonsense.\u201d The sheriff did not interview the examiner before making that accusation.Sheriff Shoar had one more line of attack. The women, he wrote, underlined and in boldface, admitted that they frequently smoked marijuana and couldn\u2019t remember if they had done so on the night of the shooting.But Sheriff Shoar\u2019s supposed source of that information, Robert Hardwick, then an investigator for the state attorney, has denied telling the sheriff that, and the women have denied telling him.In preparing my original article, I sent the sheriff written questions, among them why he hadn\u2019t publicly corrected the record about drug use. \u201cWhether it is true or not is immaterial,\u201d he replied, though he eventually removed the statement from his online post.Deputy Banks\u2019s lawyer, Robert L. McLeod, tried a different approach. He hired a former Jacksonville deputy sheriff to run a sound test with an actress imitating Ms. O\u2019Connell screaming for help. \u201cThe sound was inaudible at the distant recording location,\u201d he concluded.Apart from running a test that involved a different woman at a different time of day, the former deputy, Michael A. Knox, had been criticized last year by the Forensic Science Commission in Texas for concluding, based on a surveillance video, that an armed robber was much taller than witnesses had said. That finding prompted the Innocence Project of Texas to accuse him of using \u201cjunk science,\u201d court records show. Mr. Knox defended his work, but has revised his height estimate downward.Sheriff Shoar also attacked Mr. Findley, the crime scene reconstructionist who had disagreed with his conclusions about the O\u2019Connell case. \u201cBecause of Agent Rodgers\u2019s conduct, the Findley report is meaningless and wrong,\u201d the sheriff wrote. \u201cIt is apparent that Findley did not view all of the evidence.\u201dHow he reached that conclusion is unclear, because he never asked Mr. Findley what he had reviewed. Nor did his officers.Commander Cole, who led the sheriff\u2019s review of Agent Rodgers\u2019s work, would be asked about that later at a hearing by the agent\u2019s lawyer, Chelsea Winicki.\u201cSo if he wasn\u2019t provided all of the evidence, what was he not provided?\u201d she asked.\u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201dMs. Winicki pressed for an answer. \u201cAt no point did you contact Findley to clarify what evidence he was provided?\u201d\u201cI did not.\u201d\u201cDid anybody on your team?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dCommander Cole said logic dictated that if Mr. Findley had reviewed all the evidence, he would have agreed with the sheriff. \u201cSo that\u2019s my opinion, I guess.\u201dSoon, Sheriff Shoar would get what he wanted. Agent Rodgers\u2019s employer began investigating him, and the governor appointed a special prosecutor. Deputy Banks, who has denied harming his girlfriend, sued the agent, accusing him of violating his civil rights.The sheriff used his public office to promote his deputy\u2019s private lawsuit, posting on his agency website not only the legal complaint, but also Deputy Banks\u2019s notice of his intent to sue and other related court filings, which closely tracked the allegations in the sheriff\u2019s report. Agent Rodgers\u2019s legal responses are not displayed.A central plank in Sheriff Shoar\u2019s campaign was the allegation that the agent had lied to obtain search warrants.In late 2013 or early 2014, the county judge who had approved the warrants received an unusual request. It was the sheriff, asking to meet him \u2014 a potential witness in Deputy Banks\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 over the weekend at a Starbucks so he could hand-deliver some documents. The sheriff wanted the judge to read his accusation that the agent had lied.In court papers, the judge, Charles Tinlin, recounted that the sheriff, who had never before contacted him about a case, wanted \u201cto deliver a package to me.\u201d Asked if the meeting was \u201coff the books,\u201d Judge Tinlin replied: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him that. It wasn\u2019t on my books.\u201d Sheriff Shoar acknowledged that the judge was a potential witness, yet he followed up by sending an officer to deliver his full investigative binder.The sheriff told F.D.L.E. investigators that Judge Tinlin \u201cvividly\u201d remembered Agent Rodgers because he was so \u201canimated and forceful\u201d in seeking the warrants and in suggesting that the sheriff\u2019s office was involved in a \u201ccover-up\u201d involving Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s death.\u201cCan you imagine saying that to a sitting judge?\u201d the sheriff told investigators. \u201cCan you imagine the arrogance of that?\u201dBut Judge Tinlin disputes that account. \u201cI don\u2019t remember Agent Rodgers ever using the word \u2018cover-up,\u2019\u201d he said. In fact, the judge added, \u201cI\u2019m the one that asked him about a cover-up.\u201dThe judge said the agent \u201canswered the questions I was asking of him; he handled things in a professional manner in that sense.\u201dSheriff Shoar\u2019s propensity for talking to potential witnesses earned him a rebuke from F.D.L.E.\u201cIt would greatly assist us if you would refrain from conducting any further interviews of witnesses,\u201d the agency\u2019s internal affairs chief wrote to the sheriff in April 2013. \u201cSuch ad hoc interviews have the potential to negatively impact our ability to conduct a fair and impartial investigation.\u201dSheriff Shoar\u2019s own second in command, Mr. Bolante, concurred.\u201cThe main thing I disagreed with was not allowing F.D.L.E. to do their investigation without interference,\u201d said Mr. Bolante, who has since retired. \u201cBecause a witness\u2019s name would come up and the sheriff would send a couple guys out to interview that witness. I said, \u2018That\u2019s a witness for F.D.L.E. to interview, not us.\u2019\u201dAt the same time, the sheriff mounted a media blitz \u2014 with online posts of his report and personal opinions about the case, along with media interviews. Publicly criticizing the subject of an active criminal investigation is frowned upon in most legal circles. According to American Bar Association standards, adopted by the State of Florida, law enforcement officers should refrain from disclosing information about a criminal matter that is \u201cnot part of the public court record.\u201d\u201cHe is certainly not in the bounds of proper behavior,\u201d said Walter Mack, a former prosecutor who once served as New York City\u2019s deputy police commissioner for internal affairs.While publicly condemning Agent Rodgers, the sheriff nonetheless demanded silence from F.D.L.E., even threatening a young agent unconnected to the case who had expressed his opinion in casual conversation with another law enforcement official.\u201cIn the event that I become aware of any future similar conduct, in addition to filing a formal complaint against the offender, I will employ any other remedies available,\u201d the sheriff wrote to F.D.L.E.The sheriff became so consumed with taking down Agent Rodgers that Mr. Bolante said he often had to run the office himself. The special prosecutor\u2019s chief lawyer on the case, William Gladson, said that even after his boss decided not to prosecute, he had about 50 telephone conversations with Sheriff Shoar, mostly to discuss subsequent investigations and reporting by The Times. The sheriff initiated most of those calls, Mr. Gladson said.As police chief in St. Augustine, Sheriff Shoar acted quite differently after his own officers came under investigation for their treatment of a group of transients. In a 2001 memo, he criticized local residents who \u201chave waged a deliberate media campaign including use of the print media and voice media to broadcast their version of the events.\u201d Not only was it \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d to publicize their complaints before the conclusion of the inquiry, he said, it was \u201cpossibly a criminal violation.\u201dFor Agent Rodgers, his friends say, being told to turn in his badge and gun was devastating. That was just the beginning.The continuing assaults on his reputation, and his inability to speak out for himself, wore on him. His mother was gravely ill, and Vinny Cassidy, a friend and former F.D.L.E. agent, told how Agent Rodgers\u2019s mother died without knowing whether her son would be exonerated. Agent Rodgers battled cancer and spent tens of thousands of dollars on legal bills.\u201cMany other people would have folded,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said. \u201cI think a lot of people were counting on him to throw in the towel, on both sides of the street.\u201dBut Agent Rodgers did not. \u201cWhere do you go to get your reputation back if you don\u2019t hang in?\u201d Mr. Cassidy asked.Eventually, Mr. Donaway tired of watching Sheriff Shoar lambaste the agent, so he retired early last year, forfeiting, he said, a large sum of money. Over a recent lunch at a Jacksonville restaurant, he said, \u201cI was just so sick, so angry with my agency for not backing him up.\u201dF.D.L.E. still refuses to comment on the case or let Agent Rodgers speak on his own behalf. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to win an argument when only one side is talking,\u201d Mr. Donaway said.Agent Rodgers did get his job back last year after being cleared of any crimes. His agency counseled him, without discipline, for a handful of mistakes, including not typing his handwritten notes for one interview and incorrectly adding an extra word \u2014 \u201cnow\u201d \u2014 to Deputy Banks\u2019s 911 call, according to Mr. Donaway and F.D.L.E.\u2019s internal affairs report. The special prosecutor concluded in his report that most of Sheriff Shoar\u2019s accusations of serious misconduct were essentially baseless or overblown, though Agent Rodgers had misled some witnesses. (His lawyer disputes that.)\u201cNone of these actions, however, are clearly or provably criminal in nature,\u201d the special prosecutor\u2019s report states, adding, \u201cIndeed, courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have generally allowed enforcement officers to engage in even blatant deception towards witnesses and suspects in the pursuit of justice.\u201dA second special prosecutor, appointed to examine new allegations about the shooting, took no further action. Even so, his investigator took it upon himself to criticize Agent Rodgers, often echoing Sheriff Shoar\u2019s points of attack. The agent\u2019s lawyer, William J. Sheppard, said those criticisms contained \u201cnumerous false, unfounded and unsolicited opinions.\u201d The investigator, Mr. Sheppard added, never contacted Agent Rodgers.When the sheriff learned the agent was back on the job, he flogged him once more, telling the media that he would receive \u201cremedial training and increased supervision\u201d and could not work criminal cases in St. Johns County.During much of 2013, I tried to get an on-the-record interview with Sheriff Shoar. We talked by phone, email, in his office, over coffee at a local restaurant. I stopped by places he was known to frequent, like the Barnes & Noble on Route 1, hoping to catch him where he relaxed and read. We exchanged titles of our favorite history books.Over and over he promised to accommodate my request, only to change his mind, once just minutes before the interview was to begin.This spring, I tried another tack. I paid $65 to attend a county Republican fund-raiser where Sheriff Shoar was a featured speaker. I wanted to hear his views on all that had happened since we last discussed the O\u2019Connell case, and perhaps to glean some insight into what had driven him in his long pursuit of Rusty Rodgers.At the event, the sheriff, his badge dangling from his sport coat, spoke passionately about the county\u2019s heroin problem and the need for better mental health services. (He recently won an award for his advocacy on behalf of mentally ill people.)With the questions that followed, donors seemed more interested in the long reach of George Soros, whether there were Islamic terrorist training camps in Florida and the threat of Shariah law.I approached the sheriff as he was about to leave and asked if we could set a time to speak. He said he would need to think about it. We said our goodbyes, and I left.A couple of weeks earlier, Sheriff Shoar had shown that the O\u2019Connell case still rankled him. At the sheriff\u2019s annual awards dinner, a protester stood silently outside in the lobby of the public auditorium with a sign saying Ms. O\u2019Connell had been murdered.\u201cYou got to leave,\u201d the sheriff ordered him. \u201cYou are trespassing.\u201d The protester, Jeff Gray, said the building was public, owned and paid for by the citizens of St. Johns County and that he would not leave.\u201cWell, you are leaving one way or another,\u201d the sheriff replied, summoning uniformed officers, who escorted Mr. Gray out of the building under threat of arrest.Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s mother, Patty, says she has grown tired of waiting for the government to deliver justice. So last year, she authorized a private pathologist, a former medical examiner of Orange County, Fla., to exhume the body.The pathologist, Dr. William R. Anderson, discovered that Ms. O\u2019Connell had a cracked jaw. \u201cThe findings are most consistent of blunt force trauma causing incapacitation of Ms. O\u2019Connell, and subsequent gunshot wound inflicted by another,\u201d he wrote in his report. (Dr. Bulic, who had never mentioned the broken jaw, now says the gunshot caused it.)The exhumation enraged Sheriff Shoar. He called it \u201creprehensible\u201d and accused Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s mother of \u201cmolesting\u201d the body by removing it from its \u201cplace of rest.\u201d The examination, he said, was conducted by a \u201cpaid expert,\u201d not a state medical examiner, and offered nothing that hadn\u2019t been reviewed in the initial autopsy.Sheriff Shoar was wrong on both counts. According to the O\u2019Connell family, Dr. Anderson performed the examination pro bono. And records show that the cracked jaw was not described in the first pathologist\u2019s autopsy report, even though it was evident in a post-mortem X-ray.Asked about the sheriff\u2019s comments, Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s sister Jennifer Crites offered this terse reply: \u201cHe lies because he can.\u201dFor the O\u2019Connells, the grief has been compounded by the sheriff\u2019s embrace of one of their own \u2014 Michelle\u2019s brother Scott. Mr. O\u2019Connell was fired from the sheriff\u2019s office for losing his temper after learning there would be no charges in his sister\u2019s death. But Scott was rehired after he concluded that Agent Rodgers manipulated the family into believing that Ms. O\u2019Connell had been murdered.Patty O\u2019Connell, who now cares for Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s 10-year-old daughter, Alexis, wants nothing to do with her son Scott. \u201cThere cannot be forgiveness until he says he is sorry for lying about Michelle,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it must eat at his conscience.\u201dScott O\u2019Connell did not return a message seeking comment.The two local medical examiners who sided with Sheriff Shoar experienced their own setbacks in March, when the Florida Medical Examiners Commission accused them of violating state rules in their handling of the O\u2019Connell case.The panel recommended that Dr. Hobin be suspended for an undetermined period for keeping his amended opinion \u2014 that Ms. O\u2019Connell had been \u201cshot by another\u201d \u2014 at home, where it was not accessible to the public. Dr. Bulic, the panel said, should be reprimanded for letting people view autopsy photographs of Ms. O\u2019Connell without her family\u2019s permission.The commission also criticized Dr. Hobin for failing to note the broken jaw in his report. Both doctors can contest that ruling, but so far have not.Meanwhile, accusations of domestic violence involving the police \u2014 the reason I came to St. Augustine in the first place \u2014 continue to be an issue in the sheriff\u2019s office. In a single month last summer, three deputy sheriffs were accused of domestic violence; two resigned, and one was fired. A sheriff\u2019s spokesman said the number of episodes was highly unusual.\u201cI have a long history of holding subordinates accountable,\u201d the sheriff wrote in a letter.But records from one of the cases, obtained by The Times, suggest a different story.Two former wives of a deputy named Kevin D. Nickmeyer obtained protective orders after accusing him of domestic violence. He also had a long record of official misconduct, including suspensions, letters of reprimand and threats of termination.Even so, in 2015, Sheriff Shoar wrote to Mr. Nickmeyer, granting him a raise and thanking him for exemplifying the high professional standards of his office: \u201cTaking Care of People; Be the Best We Can Be in All That We Do; Integrity; and Treating People with Dignity and Respect.\u201dLess than a year later, Mr. Nickmeyer resigned after being accused of domestic violence by another ex-wife. Even so, several months afterward, the sheriff quietly rehired him for another position, but he resigned again about a week later, records show. He subsequently entered into a deferred-prosecution agreement and must wear a tracking device.Mr. Nickmeyer agreed to an interview for this article, only to back out.Here in St. Augustine, the community remains deeply divided over what happened to Michelle O\u2019Connell, even after seven years of verbal and legal combat. Three special prosecutors took no position on how she died. The family still believes she was murdered. The sheriff, Deputy Banks and the medical examiners still say it was suicide. The deputy\u2019s civil rights lawsuit against Agent Rodgers continues.Robert Hardwick, who worked on the case for the state attorney and is now police chief in St. Augustine Beach, is familiar with the investigation\u2019s complexities. \u201cOne day you are 60-40 on homicide; you come in the next day and you hear something else and you are 60-40 suicide,\u201d said the police chief, who considers Sheriff Shoar his mentor and friend.Chief Hardwick criticized parts of Agent Rodgers\u2019s inquiry, but in an interview with F.D.L.E. investigators, he called the sheriff\u2019s 152-page report \u201ca biased opinion.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tainted. Everybody\u2019s tainted. The media\u2019s tainted us. The conversations among cops that are local has tainted us.\u201dWhat happened, he said, is not fair to anybody. But, he added, \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201dSusan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.In the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.The declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.To the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500\u2019s return of more than 8 percent this year.The bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.UBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.While traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors \u2014 given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market \u2014 will stick with them.According to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today\u2019s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.Hedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer \u201cFaamg,\u201d substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)Compared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins \u2014 exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges \u2014 that is a very small figure.To a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.In the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.Credit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.In the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Primer on Power Dressing From \u2018House of Cards\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedThen it was the buttons on the majority of Claire\u2019s clothing throughout the series marching up her garments with an almost military precision. The pussy bow blouse. The long white inaugural gown. The epaulets on a burgundy trench coat. The pencil skirts. The belts. The sharp shoulders. The high necks. The stilettos.Halfway through my binge-watching, I was scratching my head and thinking: Does the current first lady of the United States take her dressing cues from the first lady of Netflix programming? It\u2019s not a giant leap of imagination to think the answer may be yes.Consider not only the clear similarity in their chosen silhouettes, but also the designer names: Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren, Dolce, Derek Lam. Consider that President Trump himself seems so much a product of his own television experience and obsession (though, sadly, Frank Underwood, whose Boss and Armani suits are always perfectly tailored, shirts custom-made and ties tied just so, does not seem to have had much impact).Indeed, the echoes are \u201cquite remarkable,\u201d said Johanna Argan, who has been the costume designer for \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d since Season 2. And it makes a certain sense. Someone looking for a crash course in protective power dressing could do worse than to look to the Underwoods.After all, Ms. Argan and Kemal Harris, the stylist/designer who became responsible for Claire\u2019s wardrobe in Season 3 (after working with the actress Robin Wright on her red carpet appearances), have made something of a study out of the art of political dress and the communications embedded therein. Not simply because they are helping to shape characters on TV, but because \u201cit\u2019s what politicians do in real life,\u201d Ms. Argan said.\u201cThey all have someone helping them who says this is what you should wear if you need to look more humble, or this is what you should wear if you need to look more authoritative,\u201d she continued, citing a close friend who had worked in the Clinton administration and on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign as proof. The point: Each piece the Underwoods wear is worn for a reason and has a subtext. It is not an accident, for example, that Claire wears the same style of Cartier watch Jackie Kennedy wore.This has never been more calculated than in Season 5. (Spoiler alert: Though I waited a whole week to write this, out of respect for those whose jobs may necessitate a few nights in a row of watching as opposed to one all-day binge, there may be some plot reveals in the next few paragraphs.) The Underwoods are fighting for their political lives against the Washington establishment, and Claire, in particular, is fighting for power. And dresses for it.Of the 60 or so looks worn by Claire each season, about a third come straight from the runway, a third are sourced from department stores such as Barneys and Bergdorf, and a third are designed from scratch by Ms. Harris and made by LaVonne Richards, a tailor in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where Ms. Harris lives.\u201cShe\u2019s my secret weapon,\u201d Ms. Harris said, adding that even when a piece is bought from a store or a designer, it is often customized. A gray tweed Michael Kors jacket, for example, had the buttons changed, the body slimmed and the sleeves shortened; a Burberry dress also had the buttons changed, a slit closed and the sleeves again shortened, the change in arm length meant to allude to the action of \u201crolling up your sleeves\u201d without sacrificing any tailoring rigor. Tailoring being the key sartorial signature of Frank and Claire Underwood.\u201cIt conveys power and control,\u201d said Ms. Argan, who also noted it is a style trick anyone can use. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have a garment made for you, but you can buy it and have it tailored for you.\u201d (Indeed, Ms. Harris has had a mannequin made of Ms. Wright, and all Claire\u2019s clothes are tailored precisely to her measurements.)\u201cThe thing about Claire,\u201d Ms. Harris said, \u201cis she has always used her wardrobe to manipulate everyone around her, to disarm them or seduce them.\u201d Or, in this case, arm herself and fight for her position. The military references and colors (olive green, burgundy, navy, black), so rife in her wardrobe, were chosen or added specifically to suggest going into battle. Whether you pick up on the association immediately, your subconscious may.As it may the fact that in Season 5, Claire has swapped her Ralph Lauren Tiffin bag (a soft top-handle bag with a padlock) for a more structured Burberry Alchester, a rounded doctor shape, the better to imply, Ms. Harris said, \u201cClaire saves the day.\u201d Or at least that\u2019s what said protagonist would like those around her to think.Notably, though Claire occasionally trades her pencil skirts for pants, she never wears a classic Hillary Clinton trouser suit, one in which the jacket and trousers match. When she reaches the pinnacle of power (make of that what you will), she wears a dress. Twice. \u201cIt\u2019s time, really,\u201d Ms. Harris said.At least on TV. Ms. Harris equivocated a bit when asked her opinion of the real-world parallels, at least in terms of wardrobe, between Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Underwood. \u201cThere can always be comparisons made,\u201d she said. But when it comes to the actual first lady, she added: \u201cI think it will take her a bit of time to find her stride and decide what makes her distinct. There are certain basic guidelines we all share: avoid prints, avoid fabrics that wrinkle. You can tell, she\u2019s learning from that handbook.\u201dIt\u2019s who wrote it that is the question.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley Billionaires Remaking America\u2019s Schools", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byEducation DisruptedIn San Francisco\u2019s public schools, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, is giving middle school principals $100,000 \u201cinnovation grants\u201d and encouraging them to behave more like start-up founders and less like bureaucrats.In Maryland, Texas, Virginia and other states, Netflix\u2019s chief, Reed Hastings, is championing a popular math-teaching program where Netflix-like algorithms determine which lessons students see.In the space of just a few years, technology giants have begun remaking the very nature of schooling on a vast scale, using some of the same techniques that have made their companies linchpins of the American economy. Through their philanthropy, they are influencing the subjects that schools teach, the classroom tools that teachers choose and fundamental approaches to learning.The involvement by some of the wealthiest and most influential titans of the 21st century amounts to a singular experiment in education, with millions of students serving as de facto beta testers for their ideas. Some tech leaders believe that applying an engineering mind-set can improve just about any system, and that their business acumen qualifies them to rethink American education.But the philanthropic efforts are taking hold so rapidly that there has been little public scrutiny.Tech companies and their founders have been rolling out programs in America\u2019s public schools with relatively few checks and balances, The New York Times found in interviews with more than 100 company executives, government officials, school administrators, researchers, teachers, parents and students.Furthermore, there is only limited research into whether the tech giants\u2019 programs have actually improved students\u2019 educational results.One of the broadest philanthropic initiatives directly benefits the tech industry.Mr. Hastings of Netflix and other tech executives rejected the idea that they wielded significant influence in education. The mere fact that classroom internet access has improved, Mr. Hastings said, has had a much greater impact in schools than anything tech philanthropists have done.\u201cIn our society as a democracy, I think it is healthy that there is a debate about what are the goals of public education,\u201d Mr. Hastings added.Captains of American industry have long used their private wealth to remake public education, with lasting and not always beneficial results.What is different today is that some technology giants have begun pitching their ideas directly to students, teachers and parents \u2014 using social media to rally people behind their ideas. Some companies also cultivate teachers to spread the word about their products.Such strategies help companies and philanthropists alike influence public schools far more quickly than in the past, by creating legions of supporters who can sway legislators and education officials.\u201cWe should be asking a lot more questions about who is behind the curtain,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Mr. Benioff, the billionaire behind Salesforce, had a blunt message for San Francisco\u2019s mayor and its schools superintendent.It was 2013, and the two city officials had approached Mr. Benioff hoping to persuade him to pony up a few million dollars to install Wi-Fi in schools and buy some classroom laptops. But the request seemed too penny-ante to the software mogul.\u201cThat\u2019s when I had to say, \u2018You guys need to think bigger!\u2019\u201d Mr. Benioff recalled in an interview in his San Francisco home. He urged the superintendent to imagine \u201cwhat nirvana would look like\u201d in his schools, if money were no object.With that conversation, Mr. Benioff set in motion a transformation of the relationship between philanthropist and public education. He has emerged as a kind of personal venture capitalist to the city\u2019s public schools \u2014 one intent on remaking a traditional school bureaucracy in Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurial image.Mr. Benioff ultimately pledged $100 million over a decade to the San Francisco Unified School District through his company\u2019s nonprofit arm, Salesforce.org. Unlike conventional benefactors, he is hands-on: School district administrators now submit an annual grant wish list to the Salesforce.org board for review. And Mr. Benioff dispenses not just money, but also management prescriptions.\u201cHe\u2019s almost a public-sector V.C.,\u201d said Richard A. Carranza, who was then the superintendent of San Francisco schools.Mr. Benioff rejected the notion that his approach to education philanthropy was venture-capitalist-like. \u201cWe are not giving them a new religion,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are trying to work with them in a smart way and augment what they are doing.\u201dThe partnership with the district kicked off in 2012 when San Francisco\u2019s mayor, Edwin M. Lee, asked Mr. Benioff to help the city\u2019s middle schools. The mayor wanted to give students a better chance at landing tech jobs. And he wanted Mr. Benioff to pay for it.\u201cI would like to give our kids the opportunity, when they graduate, to see themselves working at those tech companies,\u201d Mr. Lee recalled telling Mr. Benioff.But Mr. Benioff\u2019s \u201cthink bigger\u201d mandate also led to culture clashes. Chief among these: He established a Principal\u2019s Innovation Fund, which awards annual unrestricted grants of $100,000 to the principal at each of the district\u2019s 21 middle and K-8 schools.Administrators subsequently asked principals to select projects that fit with the district\u2019s priorities. Principals have used the grants to start robotics clubs, provide English-tutoring programs for immigrant students and redesign a school library with hangout zones where children can sit with their laptops.Mr. Benioff said he knew that his methods pushed some administrators beyond their comfort zones. \u201cYou\u2019d have the same issue at Salesforce if somebody from the outside came in and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to help you to blah-blah-blah,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBureaucrats would try to stop them.\u201dSo far, Salesforce.org has provided about $20 million to the schools. By hiring additional teachers, schools reduced the average class size across eighth-grade math to 24 students from 33 \u2014 enabling teachers to give more individualized instruction, district officials said.\u201cPeople think school districts are too bureaucratic, can\u2019t be nimble and can\u2019t innovate,\u201d Mr. Carranza said. \u201cWe are proving that this is just not true.\u201dThere are limits to Mr. Benioff\u2019s approach: Most school districts will not be able to secure their own billionaire benefactors. But Mr. Benioff said he intended to keep working with local schools for decades to come.\u201cThis is not just a sea gull strategy where we are dumping a bunch of money and leaving town,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are in the trenches.\u201dThey also share a guardian angel: Mr. Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive.In 2009, he heard about a start-up that used artificial intelligence to adapt math lessons to students. The math program worked a bit like the software Netflix used to customize its video recommendations.\u201cIt is probably fair to say I recognized the power of personalization maybe more than other people, because I had seen it in my own working life,\u201d Mr. Hastings said in an interview at Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles office.There was just one problem: DreamBox Learning was running low on cash. So Mr. Hastings stepped in, donating about $11 million to a nonprofit charter-school fund so it could buy the math platform.Today, more than two million students use the program for supplemental math instruction.DreamBox takes elements from animated video games, with some math lessons populated by aliens that whoosh about and animals that cluck. When students complete a math lesson successfully, they earn points that they can use to unlock virtual rewards.Administrators in some districts said that students so enjoyed the math program that some had begged their parents to let them play DreamBox even during trips to the supermarket. But four parents with children in public schools in Baltimore County, Md., said the program was so stimulating that they had curbed its use at home.\u201cIt really can suck a kid in,\u201d said Brenda Peiffer, a former school counselor, whose son, a third grader, was assigned DreamBox for homework. After noticing that he seemed more interested in spending points to customize his avatar than in actually doing math, she put the kibosh on DreamBox. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing it at home,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect solution for everyone,\u201d she said.And some experienced teachers said it was preposterous to think that algorithms could be better than skilled teachers at adapting to students\u2019 abilities. \u201cWhat you are seeing right now is a heavy push to disrupt and diminish the role of teachers as experts,\u201d said Arienne Adamcikova, a high school teacher in San Mateo, Calif.Mr. Hastings saw it differently.DreamBox Learning tracks a student\u2019s every click, correct answer, hesitation and error \u2014 collecting about 50,000 data points per student per hour \u2014 and uses those details to adjust the math lessons it shows. And it uses data to help teachers pinpoint which math concepts students may be struggling with.Mr. Hastings described DreamBox as a tool teachers could use to gain greater insights into their students, much the way that physicians use medical scans to treat individual patients. \u201cA doctor without an X-ray machine is not as good a doctor,\u201d Mr. Hastings said.Is DreamBox effective?DreamBox is among the minority of digital learning start-ups that have allowed independent academic researchers to examine and publicly report on their data. Still, the platform\u2019s effectiveness is difficult to gauge.Even so, Ms. Woolley-Wilson, DreamBox\u2019s chief executive, described the study as good news, saying it confirmed encouraging reports from teachers. She pointed out that, unlike DreamBox, many other education start-ups lacked research to prove even the most basic assumption: that their apps did not harm students\u2019 educational results.\u201cThat sounds like a low bar,\u201d Ms. Woolley-Wilson said. \u201cBut with the history of education technology, it is not.\u201dMr. Hastings (who is a company director but has no financial interest in the math company) said he was enthusiastic about DreamBox\u2019s potential and predicted wider classroom use for the technology as artificial intelligence improved.Still, he emphasized that he did not view technology generally as a panacea for education. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little cynical and jaundiced about technology,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe tech can help, but it is often oversold.\u201dIf Facebook\u2019s Mr. Zuckerberg has his way, children the world over will soon be teaching themselves \u2014 using software his company helped build.It\u2019s a conception that upends a longstanding teaching dynamic. Now educators are no longer classroom leaders, but helpmates.In public remarks and Facebook posts, Mr. Zuckerberg has described how it works. Students cluster together, working at laptops. They use software to select their own assignments, working at their own pace. And, should they struggle at teaching themselves, teachers are on hand to guide them.\u201cWhen you visit a school like this, it feels like the future \u2014 it feels like a start-up,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told an audience last fall in Peru. \u201cYou get the feeling this is how more of the education system should work.\u201dHe is well on his way to achieving this vision. In 2015, 19 American schools introduced the software that Facebook helped develop. This school year, more than 100 schools use it. Next fall, Mr. Zuckerberg said, he expects that \u201cmany hundreds of more schools will upgrade.\u201dThe effort began a few years ago with visits by Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician who is his wife, to Summit Denali, a middle school in Sunnyvale, Calif. There, classrooms lack walls, and students with laptops often zoom around on caster chairs.Mr. Zuckerberg, she said, admired the software that Summit had created for its schools. He offered Ms. Tavenner a team of Facebook engineers to further develop it and make it available free to schools nationwide.Summit developed its student-directed learning approach after administrators there discovered that their teachers had been so supportive of students, Ms. Tavenner said, that many of its graduates were struggling in college, unprepared to pace themselves or seek help.That is how Summit\u2019s platform came to show students every lesson they will need to complete for the year. They may tackle lessons in any order. At the end of each unit, they take a 10-question multiple-choice test.Not all educators agree. Four former Summit teachers said they found the system problematic. They asked that their names be withheld, saying they feared repercussions for their careers.At Summit, they said, they were required to teach students cognitive skills (like how to construct an argument) while making students responsible for teaching themselves underlying lesson material (like how diverse plants and animals coexist). But some students raced through lessons without actually understanding basic facts, the teachers said, making it difficult to help them structure arguments on specific topics, like climate change.Ms. Tavenner of Summit, however, said that was exactly the point: to make students discover for themselves that they cannot succeed on applied projects without learning the fundamentals.Students think to themselves, \u201c\u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to actually go back and deeply understand it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Tavenner said. \u201cThose are the habits of success that we are trying to instill in kids that simply don\u2019t get instilled in the normal system.\u201dIt can be a steep learning curve.\u201cKids were self-pacing to failure,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.Teachers remedied that by helping students set realistic goals. The school is now happy with the program, she said, and has expanded it to the seventh grade. Even so, Ms. Fisher said, \u201cWe definitely have a concern about the quality of the assessments in the curriculum and whether it actually promotes deeper learning.\u201d\u201cOur hope over the next decade is to help upgrade a majority of these schools to personalized learning and then start working globally as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told the audience. \u201cGiving a billion students a personalized education is a great thing to do.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "The 25 Best Films of the 21st Century So Far.", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "We are now approximately one-sixth of the way through the 21st century, and thousands of movies have already been released. Which means that it\u2019s high time for the sorting \u2013 and the fighting \u2013 to start. As the chief film critics of The Times, we decided to rank, with some help from cinema savants on Facebook, the top 25 movies that are destined to be the classics of the future. While we\u2019re sure almost everyone will agree with our choices, we\u2019re equally sure that those of you who don\u2019t will let us know.The film offers a profound and deeply unsettling vision of the country, but it\u2019s also a testament to one of this nation\u2019s sublime achievements: the movies. The story creeps alive in 1898 with Plainview digging in a hole like a primordial creature, a sequence that invokes the dawn-of-man opener in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d A brilliant two and a half hours later, \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d closes around 1927 by making good on its ominous title (it\u2019s a gusher!) and nodding at \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d a masterwork that ushered in a new American cinematic age.That opening sequence lasts almost 15 minutes before the first line of dialogue is uttered, and it sets the table (or stirs the milkshake) for the many bravura set pieces that follow, like the explosion of the drilling rig midway through. The grandeur of Mr. Anderson\u2019s vision is matched by the precision of his technique. At no moment do you doubt that anything happened exactly how he is showing it, even as he takes abundant liberty with the historical record and his literary source (Upton Sinclair\u2019s novel \u201cOil!\u201d). But you are also aware of his artistic self-confidence, and the way he has marshaled the talents of his cast and collaborators (notably the cinematographer Robert Elswit and the composer Jonny Greenwood) in the service of his ideas.I never tire of thinking about \u201cThere Will Be Blood.\u201d But every time I watch it, I find it outruns all my thoughts. Not many films do that.It\u2019s a creation story about love and labor \u2013 Plainview\u2019s and Mr. Anderson\u2019s \u2013 one tragic, the other glorious. Among everything else that \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d takes on is a question that rests, I think, at the heart of the United States: how could something as astonishing as the movies (or democracy) emerge amid so much horror?Many years later as a young adult I saw \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d and it moved me to tears. I mean, I basically couldn\u2019t stop crying at the beauty and the enormous feat of capturing the innocence of being a child. I immediately chased down everything he had done. The way they describe him as the Disney of the East I think is a tremendous misnomer: Miyazaki\u2019s all his own.In \u201cSpirited Away\u201d you have a girl right at the threshold of becoming a young woman and leaving her childhood behind, figuratively and literally. Chihiro starts the narrative as a child, the way she sits, the way we first meet her sitting on the seat of the car, legs up, it\u2019s completely childish. She evolves from her poise, dress, attitude, emotion and spirituality from being a child to being a young woman and coming into her own, and in that position she has to go through the loss of everything. She loses her parents, she loses her name, she\u2019s called nothing, she\u2019s called Sen, she\u2019s called zero. There\u2019s a beautiful, very melancholic meditation \u2013 the same melancholy that permeates all Miyazaki\u2019s films.Miyazaki has an approach to making monsters that is unique. They are completely new in design, but they feel rooted in ancient lore. They seem to represent primal forces and, in many cases, spirits that are rooted to the earth, to the wind, to the water. They are very elemental.He always looks for grace or power, and he can use power for good guys and bad guys equally, and he can use grace for destructive monsters or beneficial monsters. That\u2019s the beauty of him. He understands that one of the essential things is to not seek anything good because by definition something will then become bad. Do not seek anything beautiful because by definition something then becomes ugly.Of course I have a huge kinship with Miyazaki. The same sense of loss and melancholy and tragedy is what I tried to do in \u201cDevil\u2019s Backbone\u201d or \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth.\u201d There is a moment in which beauty moves you in a way that is impossible to describe. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s a fabrication, it\u2019s that it\u2019s an artistic act and you know nothing you will encounter in the natural world will be that pure. Miyazaki has that power.But Mr. Eastwood has always been most at home in the classic American film genres: the western, the crime flick, the combat picture. And, in this case, the boxing movie, perhaps the most susceptible to sentimentality and clich\u00e9. The glory of \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d is that rather than strain for novelty, it settles into the conventions of the genre with masterly confidence and ease, and discovers deep currents and grace notes of feeling that nobody had noticed before.Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank each won Oscars for their performances. Mr. Freeman plays a former fighter nicknamed Scrap who acts as the confidant and conscience of Mr. Eastwood\u2019s Frankie Dunn. Frankie is a trainer haunted by ghosts and regrets who takes a chance on an ambitious young fighter named Maggie Fitzgerald (Ms. Swank).If for some unfathomable reason you haven\u2019t yet seen \u201cMillion Dollar Baby,\u201d I won\u2019t spoil the plot by saying any more. But if you have seen it, you know that there\u2019s much more to this movie than its plot. The warm, sharp banter among the principal characters never gets old. The images, shot by Mr. Eastwood\u2019s longtime cinematographer, Tom Stern, glow with unexpressed, somber feeling. Fifty years from now, as the end credits scroll on whatever screen viewers are watching on, they will reach the same conclusion my editor did back in 2004. This is what a movie looks like.Zhao Tao, Mr. Jia\u2019s wife and frequent star, plays Xiao Yu, a young receptionist at a sauna. It\u2019s immediately clear that she\u2019s having a rough go of it. She\u2019s in an affair with a married man and his wife not only knows it, but one evening assaults Xiao Yu with the help of two thugs. Like all the sections, this one is largely a slice of brute naturalism spiked with beguilingly surrealistic moments, many involving animals. The overall mood is one of escalating, palpable unease.Xiao Yu\u2019s chapter culminates not long after she\u2019s been beaten and has knocked off work for the day. She carries some water to a small, dimly lit room lined with palm-frond wallpaper. The palm fronds evoke the natural world that keeps creeping and slithering throughout the movie, and also suggests a realm its characters are nearly cut off from. There, all alone, Xiao Yu begins washing blood from her shirt when a man abruptly opens the door, demanding that she give him a massage. She explains that she\u2019s not a masseuse and shuts the door. He returns \u2013 she shoos him off \u2013 and then he returns with a second man.We\u2019ve seen the second guy before; he\u2019s a local thug. He too demands a massage \u2013 \u201cwe can afford you,\u201d he says \u2013 and once again Xiao Yu declines. \u201cI\u2019m not a prostitute,\u201d she says. \u201cGo home to your wives.\u201d She shuts the door, but the second guy bursts in. \u201cI\u2019m having you!\u201d he exclaims, pushing her down hard. She stands; he pushes her down. She stands again; he pushes her down again. She\u2019s strong, stubborn and as unreadable as Clint Eastwood\u2019s Man With No Name. Then the thug hits her head with a stack of bills and keeps hitting her, once, twice, three times, four, 20, 30 \u2013 he keeps hitting her as her cheeks redden. She looks at him silently, and then turns away.A sudden cut to a raised arm with knife clutched in the hand changes the violence, the mood and the realism. Mr. Jia may have taken his inspiration from contemporary China, but here he also borrows from King Hu\u2019s \u201cA Touch of Zen,\u201d a 1971 martial arts classic. All at once, a scene of ugly, recognizably and disturbingly real violence turns into an interlude of stylized violence with sharp editing, exaggerated gestures and images \u2013 a close-up of the knife in a fist \u2013 bordering on the hieroglyphic. One minute, the only red is that coloring Xiao Yu\u2019s flushed cheeks; the next, a man has been sliced open and an ordinary woman has become the hero of her own story.And that\u2019s still true. Mr. Puiu\u2019s film was an early sign of the flowering of Romanian cinema that would bring international acclaim to young auteurs like Cristian Mungiu (\u201c4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\u201d) and Corneliu Porumboiu (\u201cPolice, Adjective\u201d). Like his colleagues (and sometime rivals), Mr. Puiu uses long takes and minimal camera movement to create a sense of lived reality that is absorbing almost to the point of claustrophobia. He zeroes in remorselessly on the petty absurdities and large iniquities that define life in Romania more than a decade after the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu\u2019s Communist dictatorship.But though this is an intensely local experience, it opens up and reverberates far beyond the streets, tenements and emergency rooms of Bucharest. The title might remind you of Willy Loman, which is no accident. Poor Mr. Lazarescu is his own kind of Everyman, caught not in the shiny wheels of midcentury American capitalism but in the rusty gears of Eastern European bureaucracy and the detritus of his own bad decisions. He is imperiled by the arrogance and indifference of the powerful \u2013 the doctors and hospital bureaucrats so entranced by their own authority that they are blind to his suffering.An ambulance driver, played by the great Romanian stage actress Luminita Gheorghiu, becomes Lazarescu\u2019s advocate and ally, the one person able to insist, heroically and in vain, that attention must be paid to this man. This movie is a harrowing and darkly humorous metaphysical fable disguised as a slice-of-life tragedy.The action circulates through the high-rises and busy streets of Taipei, interrupted by a trip to Tokyo. To invoke the clich\u00e9 that the cities themselves are characters in the films would be to understate their significance. The character of modern cities \u2013 spaces of loneliness and intimacy, where the shiny global future rests on a buried bedrock of local tradition \u2013 is among Mr. Yang\u2019s main themes. And few artists in any medium have matched his ability to examine contemporary urban life from all sides. The title of this movie is translated as \u201ca one and a two.\u201d It keeps on going to infinity.Some people responded with top fives or Solomonic hairsplitting (\u201cWall-E\u201d is the best, but \u201cCars\u201d is the most fun.\u201d) Others equivocated and changed their minds. Nearly all of the 14 features released under the Pixar label since 2000 garnered passionate defenses. We found ourselves agreeing with many of them, and zeroing in on exquisite moments from at least a half-dozen films: the wordless story of Carl and Ellie\u2019s marriage in \u201cUp\u201d; the first meeting of Wall-E and Eve; Andy\u2019s farewell at the end of \u201cToy Story 3\u201d; Anton Ego\u2019s review of the titular vermin-prepared dish in in \u201cRatatouille.\u201d And what about \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d? \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d? \u201cMonsters, Inc.\u201d? How could we pick just one?Manohla Dargis asked Mr. Linklater about making the film. Here are edited excerpts from his comments:People would just tout the connection they had to it. \u201cOh, my daughter just went off to college or my son went off to college\u201d or \u201cI just went off to college. I saw your movie and I called my mom and told her that I now realize what she was going through.\u201d We all go through the world trapped in our story, our own point of view. But a film can really enforce those other points of view \u2013 that\u2019s storytelling power.One of the sons (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier) is a businessman living in China with his family. His sister (a wonderfully abrasive Juliette Binoche) is an artist in New York. They and their nostalgic brother (Charles Berling) are saying goodbye not only to the old country house, but also to the idea of France they have cherished and taken for granted. Mr. Assayas, acutely aware of his status as part of the post-1968 generation, brings a sense of history to all of his movies. This one, though, may be his most prescient. Also: mom had excellent taste in stuff.That this violence is also self-annihilating is an anguished truth in \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d which is set in and around Baghdad during the war in Iraq the year after the American invasion. The story tracks three members of an army explosive ordnance disposal squad that disarms roadside bombs. The story\u2019s axis point is the squad\u2019s volatile team leader, Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), whose expertise has morphed into a ghastly mania. He doesn\u2019t just take avoidable risks \u2013 sweat cascading off him, an exasperated James removes his protective bomb suit while trying to disarm an explosive \u2013 he rushes right at them.War has given James a job to do, and he\u2019s very, very good at it. War gives him rank, status, camaraderie (at times begrudging) and, ostensibly, a purpose. War has also destroyed James, though not literally and certainly not in the way most movies teach us when they show the catastrophe of war, with their perfected heroic gestures and narratives of noble sacrifice. James\u2019s death isn\u2019t remotely spectacular or inspiring; it doesn\u2019t arrive with a bullet. It is instead the slowest of living deaths, one that eats away at him with everyday horror that is as unvarying and familiar as the ticking of all those bombs.The French director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut once said, \u201cEvery film about war ends up being pro-war.\u201d I wish he had lived long enough to see \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d a movie that is antiwar not because it offers an easy critique of war but because it reminds us of how human beings need war, how they live for war as intensely as die for it. Ms. Bigelow, who directed from a script by Mark Boal, told me by email that they faced the challenges of making it with as much honesty as they could. \u201cThe Iraq war,\u201d she added, \u201cwas painfully underreported at the time \u2013 I looked at the film as a form of journalism, felt that more information was needed for this highly contested military engagement.\u201dThe academy favored \u201cNo Country,\u201d of course \u2013 the only one of the Coens\u2019 films to nab a best picture statuette \u2013 but much as we admire the dexterity they brought to adapting Cormac McCarthy\u2019s novel, we were more moved and intrigued by the metaphysics of \u201cA Serious Man\u201d and the melancholy of \u201cInside Llewyn Davis.\u201d We vacillated between the two. We asked the Coens themselves to pick a favorite (to no avail). We looked for messages carved into our teeth and encoded in the lyrics of old folk songs.One memorable woman walks through the streets, head uncovered, a long piece of fabric trailing her like a queenly train. She seems regally impervious to the jihadists, who, even as they casually break Shariah law, try to police the locals. Music is forbidden, as are cigarettes and soccer. One young man who defies the ban on the game is sentenced to 20 lashes. But the human imagination isn\u2019t as easy to imprison and in a lyrical scene, boys joyfully play soccer with a make-believe ball as two jihadists on a motorcycle circle the dusty field, momentarily defeated.In time, the story settles on Kidane, a Muslim who lives near Timbuktu with his wife, Satima, and their daughter in a small, peaceful kingdom on the dunes. Many of the family\u2019s neighbors have fled after the jihadist invasion, but the violence seems to have passed over Kidane until one day it comes down on him with a vengeance. During a dispute with a fisherman Kidane fires a gun. He\u2019s brought to trial before a jihadist jury, which mercilessly sets about enacting Shariah law.\u201cTimbuktu\u201d is a tragic movie but not a nihilistic one. Mr. Sissako doesn\u2019t shy away from showing violence, but he never sensationalizes any of the horrors. Instead, he answers those atrocities with visual beauty and moments of everyday joy and pleasure that, as the story unfolds, register as acts of artistic resistance. He also insists on humanizing the jihadists, as when an older man vainly directs a younger one on how to deliver a speech for a propaganda video. (\u201cYour speech is not convincing.\u201d) It\u2019s an extraordinary scene, at once absurd and believable, and a reminder of the truth that it is people, not faceless monsters, who commit these horrors.How did you discover Claire Denis\u2019s films? What specifically draws you to her work? Watching the performances in her movies, you can just feel the freedom she gives her actors. She creates an entire world for them to behave in. And I think having such wide parameters to capture things from means her movies can be built from an enormous amount of incremental details rather than a narrow narrative thrust. Her movies feel like waves building and breaking.What does Isabelle Huppert bring to the character of Maria Vial?She plays a character that seems to live steadfastly in her faith and imagination and yet still feels so human, accessible and raw.Is Huppert our greatest living actress?It\u2019s difficult to think of someone who\u2019s better.And that only multiplied the ambiguity. While nobody was eager to go to bat for \u201cIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\u201d or \u201cThe BFG,\u201d there were fans who embraced the buoyancy of \u201cCatch Me if You Can,\u201d the kineticism of \u201cThe Adventures of Tintin,\u201d the dystopian terror of \u201cMinority Report\u201d and the evil-E.T. action of \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201dMr. Hou\u2019s influence extends far and wide. Among his admirers is Barry Jenkins, whose \u201cMoonlight\u201d won the Academy Award for best picture this year and was partly inspired by \u201cThree Times.\u201d He shared his thoughts with A.O. Scott via email. Here are excerpts:On seeing the film:On Hou Hsiao-hsien\u2019s place in cinema:I\u2019m here at Cannes at the moment, and a phrase I keep hearing is \u201cbeyond cinema.\u201d Hou Hsiao-hsien is beyond cinema. I mean that not in the sense that his formalism is antiquated or de rigueur, but more to accentuate the synesthetic quality of his work. His craft is as evocative as any of the more brawny stylists we revere as auteurs, but the effect it arrives at is much more delicate, elusive by nature.How \u201cThree Times\u201d influenced \u201cMoonlight\u201d:The structure of \u201cThree Times\u201d is the sole impetus for the structure of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d The source material the film originated from was not in triptych form. Beyond that, this idea of a delicate treatment of roiling emotions, of interiority translated through external imagery (and SOUND) rather than interior monologue, these things I kept in heart and head as \u201cMoonlight\u201d evolved into the film that it is.The director Agn\u00e8s Varda \u2013 the \u201cI\u201d of the film\u2019s English title \u2013 counts herself as part of this informal tribe. A genial, inquisitive on-screen presence, she collects images and anecdotes that would otherwise be too easily neglected. The result is a documentary that is difficult to characterize and impossible to forget. Though it can feel charmingly miscellaneous \u2013 a free-associative tour of its maker\u2019s mind and sensibility \u2013 it has an unmistakable coherence and rigor, like a museum exhibit or an art installation.Ms. Varda, the only woman permitted entry into the boys\u2019 club of the French new wave, has migrated to the center of a trans-disciplinary, international artistic tendency \u2013 a counter-tradition of critical and creative thinkers that includes her friend and sometime collaborator Chris Marker, the novelist and art critic John Berger, Patti Smith and other artists who defy the usual categories. \u201cThey call me Granny Punk,\u201d Ms. Varda once told me, and she embodies the defiant, anarchic, do-it-yourself ethos of punk rock, past and present.In true punk spirit, \u201cThe Gleaners and I\u201d doubles as a programmatic aesthetic statement and a protest against the way things are. Collecting, interpreting and juxtaposing heterogeneous objects \u2013 paintings, potatoes, seashells, books \u2013 is the approach to art-making closest to the pulse of life. There is no higher purpose than to appreciate the peculiarity and uniqueness of people, places and moments, and the things we gather around us are symbols of that appreciation. But the tide of commerce renders our experience as disposable as the junk we toss away, leaving us at once glutted with stuff and starved for meaning.That\u2019s certainly true of movies. There are so many of them, and they come and go so quickly that it\u2019s easy to lose sight of how and why they matter. \u201cThe Gleaners and I\u201d is precious because it\u2019s a perfect example of its own argument \u2013 a small thing of nearly incalculable value.Tough questions! And while film scholars may differ, our standards are fairly inclusive. There needs to be a lot of chasing, and a lot of stuff has to blow up. That can happen in outer space, in Gotham, at Hogwarts, on the freeways of Los Angeles or in whatever global capital poor Jason Bourne happens to be running through when his enemies catch sight of him.Do you need to ask why? O.K. fine. Because George Miller is an old-school choreographer of chaos, favoring practical effects over their digital counterparts. Also because the movie drags the snarling, anti-authoritarian, punk-rock wit of the first \u201cMad Max\u201d movies into a new era, updating and conserving in a single gesture. And finally because in Imperator Furiosa, Charlize Theron\u2019s one-handed, buzz-cut, kohl-eyed avenger, the movies that famously didn\u2019t need another hero found the one we all needed.How did you first come to work with Kelly Reichardt?Was there a challenge for you in getting into that character?Kelly is very clear about what she wants. She is a really easy collaborator because she is so precise, so things happen very quickly. You understand the place and the person very quickly because she\u2019s very specific about what she wants. She\u2019s still open. I would shoot her ideas and she would say, \u201cCome back in a week when you\u2019ve honed that thing down from your garish, stupid, big idea to something that I might actually like, Michelle.\u201dI find Kelly\u2019s characters get to maintain a lot of dignity and self-respect because they aren\u2019t always giving themselves away. And I find that kind of tricky. It\u2019s an incredibly fine line to walk. Is anybody going to know me? Is anybody going to understand who I am as this person? Are they going to care? Is there going to be a there, there?And for Kelly\u2019s language, for her sensibility, there is. These characters don\u2019t feel compelled to explain themselves. You have to sort of train your ear and your eye and get to know them slowly. It\u2019s like not sleeping with someone on the first date when you watch her movies. You\u2019re like, let me take a little time to get to know you and absorb you.\u201cWendy and Lucy\u201d came out at the end of 2008, right in the middle of the election campaign and the economic collapse. There\u2019s a powerful sense that while the movie is very much about this one young woman and her situation, it\u2019s also about a lot more than that.All of Kelly\u2019s movies are political, but you would have to maybe have been told that to be aware of it. She\u2019s able to slip it into everything she does, but it\u2019s never didactic or heavy-handed. It\u2019s an essential part of who Kelly is. She\u2019s interested in a lot of genres, but the backbone of it is, how do people get along? How do people get by?Where have you been, my blue-eyed son? Where have you been, my darling young one?I was riding on the Mayflower, when I thought I spied some land. I yelled to Captain A-Rab, I\u2019ll have you understand. Who came running to the deck and said, \u201cBoys, forget the whale. We\u2019re going over yonder! Cut the engine! Raise the sail!\u201dOnce upon a time, you dressed so fine, you threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn\u2019t you?Someone\u2019s got it in for me. They\u2019re spreading stories in the press. Whoever it is I wish they\u2019d cut it out quick. But when they will, I can only guess.With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace, and your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace, and your basement clothes and your hollow face \u2013 Who among them can think he could outguess you?I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes. And for that one moment I could be you. Yeah \u2013 I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes. You\u2019d know what a drag it is to see you.How many roads must a man walk down, before you call him a man?I\u2019m out here a thousand miles from my home. Walking a road other men have gone down. I\u2019m seeing a world of people and things. Of paupers and peasants and princes and kings.Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute. No, I wasn\u2019t very cute to him, was I?You might like to eat caviar. You might like to eat bread. You might be sleeping on a floor. You might be sleeping in a feather bed. But you\u2019re going to have to serve somebody.You know something is happening here but you don\u2019t know what it is. Do you, Mr. Jones?There\u2019s too much confusion. I can\u2019t get no relief.Oh, I\u2019m sailing away my own true love. I\u2019m sailing away in the morning. Is there something I can send you from across the sea, from the place that I\u2019ll be landing?I\u2019ve got to get back into my hotel room. I\u2019ve got me a date with Botticelli\u2019s niece. She promised she\u2019d be there with me, when I paint my masterpiece.It opens with an astonishing sequence that inaugurates a new day, a dawning that \u2013 as blackness filled with whirring and cawing gives way to light \u2013 suggests opening theater curtains. The constant presence of the natural world gives the movie a vaguely documentary feel as does the unforced sincerity of the nonprofessional performers, who primarily speak in Plautdietsch, a German dialect the Mennonites brought with them. At the same time, the dialect, the family\u2019s modest clothes, austerity and piety give them a near-otherworldly quality.Over the course of the movie, Johan and Esther\u2019s marriage badly frays, yet even as it does Mr. Reygadas underscores their intimacy with each other and their children, a sense of togetherness that gradually includes us. Much of what Mr. Reygadas does \u2013 both narratively and visually \u2013 seems intended to draw you close to his characters, to look intently into the faces framed inside his lingering close-ups. Their relative isolation means that we\u2019re often alone with Johan, Esther and their children, which further deepens our connection to them.Looking is critical here. Mr. Reygadas doesn\u2019t provide the usual cinematic signposts: no score to cue tears or speeches. Characters instead act and speak much as people do in life. This palpable realism is deepened by scenes of the family\u2019s ordinary habits. In one ravishing sequence, the family bathes semi-clothed in an outdoor pool surrounded by green foliage, a paradisal interlude that\u2019s disturbed when Esther begins crying. After Johan suggests they swim, Mr. Reygadas narrows in on a blurred image that steadily comes into focus, revealing a wild orchid.Mr. Reygadas wants us to see this orchid and see it deeply, so that we grasp its fragile beauty and, importantly, its impermanence. This reminder of life\u2019s transience connects to two moments that bookend the story: the first, at the start, when someone stops a ticking clock, and the second, near the end, when someone else winds it up again. With the stopped clock, Mr. Reygadas reminds us that there are other rhythms to live by, including the rising and setting sun. He is also suggesting, I think, that there\u2019s something timeless \u2013 eternal \u2013 about the love that fills this movie and leads to its startling, last-minute resurrection.With a few notable exceptions \u2013 the first \u201cBridget Jones\u201d movie; \u201cCrazy, Stupid, Love\u201d and (heaven help us) \u201cLove Actually\u201d \u2013 readers gravitated more to melodrama than rom-com, and favored stories of loss and longing rather than happily ever after. It\u2019s striking how many of the great love stories of our era are really breakup stories, meditations on love\u2019s mutability rather than its permanence. Even the most recent romantic conversation piece, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d is about a relationship that can\u2019t survive the pull of professional ambition and the play of chance (though in that case, the problem may also be the state of heterosexual romance). \u201c(500) Days of Summer,\u201d which several readers mentioned, is also about a romance that doesn\u2019t quite work out. The same is true of \u201cHer\u201d and the French lesbian coming-of-age story, \u201cBlue Is the Warmest Color.\u201dDisappointment is more satisfying than fulfillment. We like movies about great love affairs that never quite happen as well as those that flare up and flame out. \u201cOnce\u201d and \u201cLost in Translation\u201d made strong showings. And it might be that lustrous images of unrequited longing are better than sex.And the winner of our survey \u2013 by critical fiat as well as popular acclaim \u2013 is a movie that combines laughter and melancholy, nostalgia and hope. It\u2019s a movie about how you never forget your first love, unless you have a mad scientist with a fluky homemade gadget to help you out. It\u2019s also about how desire and loss are inseparable, and about how the yearning to clean the slate and start over is just another case of eternal recurrence.Antoine Fuqua, Sofia Coppola, Paul Feig, Denis Villeneuve, Brett Ratner and Alex Gibney share their highly personal lists.Produced by Alicia DeSantis, Stephanie Goodman, Mekado Murphy, Matt Ruby and Rumsey TaylorAn earlier version of this article misidentified a cast member of \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\u201d He is Elijah Wood, not Orlando Bloom.An\u00a0article\u00a0last Sunday about Times film critics\u2019 picks for the 25 best films of the 21st century so far included a quotation from the director Guillermo del Toro that described incorrectly a scene in \u201cPuss in Boots.\u201d The scene was animated by the Japanese anime master Hayao Miyazaki and Otsuka Yasuo, not by Isao Takahata.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Think, Just Drink", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byWine SchoolDeliciousness and simplicity can be prized things in a wine. On some occasions, they are all you need and exactly what you want.This may seem like a confusing sentiment for Wine School, which has long taken a stand against the \u201call that matters is what\u2019s in the glass\u201d way of thinking. But the key words here are \u201csome occasions.\u201d It\u2019s our firm belief that every good wine has a time and a place to be the ideal choice.They are the lawn-mower beers of wine, ready to stimulate, energize and invigorate. They provoke physical reactions, and do not leave much room for contemplation.Is that sacrilegious? Only if it\u2019s assumed that wine must be deep, complex and thought-provoking to be praiseworthy. But that\u2019s a narrow view of a wine\u2019s power, or maybe a cramped view of the various roles it can play.Each good wine, regardless of place of origin, style or age, has a moment when it can be the perfect bottle. Part of every wine lover\u2019s education is learning how to identify the occasion and recognize what sort of wine it demands.Of course not. He meant that at certain times, perhaps almost always, the simpler, more easily available bottle is preferable to the rare and precious wine.I mention all this as an act of self-criticism. I should have talked about it earlier, when introducing these thirst-quenching wines, which the English call quaffers and the French, vins de soif. It seemed from many of the comments on this month\u2019s subject that the idea of these wines was not satisfying.I would like to suggest that the problem was not the wines themselves, but the occasion. Drinking them for Wine School created exactly the wrong sort of atmosphere for enjoying these wines.Our way of doing business, in which we drink wines with food in a social setting while paying close attention to the wines and our reactions, did not do these quaffers justice. Why? Because these are the sorts of wines that paradoxically reward inattention.That\u2019s anything but a deficiency.As odd as it may seem, it is difficult to make wine delicious enough to give pleasure but simple enough not to require contemplation. Bottles like these turn wine-drinking into an unconscious activity, which in many ways is an antidote to the self-consciousness that so often governs the American approach to wine.Though we learn about wine by paying attention to it, some moments call for not paying attention to it, just as you can enjoy a meal without analyzing the bread or the meat. I realize now that the questions I asked in introducing these wines created an impossible situation. I essentially told you to examine the wines to determine the qualities that allow you to enjoy them without paying attention to them.I know. It hurts my brain, too.Simplicity itself is not necessarily a virtue. Just as with lawn-mower beers, straightforward wines can run the gamut from insipid to exhilarating. Allow me to extend the beer analogy. When the craft beer movement first gathered momentum, very few brewers wanted to make plain styles like pilsner. That was Budweiser, the enemy. Instead, they turned to the deliciously complex styles that the mass-market brewers had ignored for so long.Eventually, the craft brewers came back to pilsners, learning not only that simple beers were hard to master but also that they could be beautiful in their simplicity.But back to the thirst quenchers. I love drinking these sorts of wines, and adored each of the three wines I recommended: Matthiasson California Tendu 2015, Lapierre Vin de France Raisins Gaulois 2015 and \u00c9ric Texier C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Chat Fou 2014.The grapes were harvested early to maintain freshness, aged in neutral barrels for five months, and bottled without filtering and with no added sulfur dioxide. I found the wine juicy and fruity but not overbearingly so, dry, refreshing and simply delicious.It was a delightful combination, and I didn\u2019t miss a thing.Exactly. They do not have to be the center of attention, though I should say that no wine should ever make you feel guilty.I think that\u2019s an accurate description of these wines. They are just right for those occasions when you don\u2019t feel like paying attention to the depth of the aftertaste.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Happy Birthday, America. One Small Suggestion ...", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byOpinionLet us embark together on an Independence Day thought experiment. It is tendered in a spirit of amity, respect and good will by an Englishman who loves America. It may be dismissed as the ravings of a deranged colonial sentimentalist, but I am confident you will at least be polite enough to hear me out.It is not hard to understand why America threw off the yoke of British oppression in 1776. The colony had been taxed by a government far, far away without deriving any benefit of representation in its Parliament. At the end of the little unpleasantness that ensued, General Cornwallis surrendered to General Washington and Americans were free of our pettifogging rapacity and incompetent interference, and able to turn toward the construction of a new polity, founded upon a new Constitution. A damned fine stab they made of it, too. For the most part.During the heat of the Revolutionary War, Americans looked \u2014 as nations at war always will \u2014 for a name and a face to represent the hated foe. The prime minister, Lord North, would have made a colorless and feeble icon of enmity, and so, perhaps naturally, they settled on the person and character of King George. With the word \u201ctyrant\u201d attached permanently to him, America had its slogan, its hate figure.But in fact, George III was far from a tyrant. He was a constitutional monarch with almost no real political power at all. In nearly 60 years, a reign only recently surpassed in longevity by that of the current Elizabeth, he earned the love and respect of his people for his simplicity, kindness, frugality and diligence. The \u201cfarmer king\u201d liked nothing better than to wander among his fields, talking happily to peasants, pigs and princes alike, not a tyrannical thought in his amiable, befuddled old mind.But in the New World the wartime propaganda had done its work and the founding fathers had it in their heads that kingship was akin to tyranny and that their new country should be a republic, with an elected president instead of a monarch. The president was to be the highest citizen in the land, executive head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces. That, I submit, was the mistake.If you watched the excellent Netflix series \u201cThe Crown,\u201d you will remember those scenes in the first few episodes in which the newly acceded Elizabeth received her prime minister, Winston Churchill. During these weekly audiences, the great political lion had to stand before her, explain the conduct of his administration, outline governmental plans and problems and keep her informed as to the state of the nation before bowing himself backward from the room. Constitutional constraints decreed that she could do no more than \u201cadvise and consent.\u201d A powerless monarch, but endued with all the symbolic authority of her nation and its long history. The aura this bestowed apparently caused even Churchill to be nervous and discomfited in her presence.Every week, the elected president has to call at Uncle Sam\u2019s mansion, stand before him and explain himself and his administration. Uncle Sam can question him, tell him a story about how another president 20 years back had faced a similar quandary, wonder whether things could be better organized, tut, click and sigh, but Uncle Sam cannot command or forbid.Do you not agree that it would be a very healthy thing for presidents to make such a humble, supplicatory journey every week and be reminded that they serve a bigger idea than power, a nobler entity than a political party or a trending ideology? Perhaps mistakenly we think of theatrical rites and ceremonies like this as primitive throwbacks we can congratulate ourselves on having shaken off. But ritual and pageant, costume and custom are to public life what metaphors are to language; they bring it to life and move it from the abstract to the real.America has an elected executive, but Britain has an elected executive and something else, too: a head of state who stands above the fray, personifying and representing our nation and its history.I am far from claiming that Britain is anything other than a ridiculous country, nor am I denying that there are plenty of Britons who don\u2019t buy into the drama of kingship. Rationally, a monarchy is an absurdity. Of course it is. But we British are not rationalists. We are empiricists and seem always to have been. Looking at 10 Downing Street and the American White House now, I wonder which nation is constitutionally most in danger of allowing a tyrant to arise.My modest proposal on this, America\u2019s great national holiday weekend, is that you choose an Uncle Sam or Aunt Samantha by lottery (which is all the birth of a monarch is) and give this person the powers of a constitutional sovereign, with precedence of state over the elected president. To save face, this person needn\u2019t be called a monarch \u2014 \u201cfirst American\u201d or \u201csovereign citizen\u201d will do. A reality TV competition can be held to finalize all the details. Americans are awfully good at that sort of thing.Above all, put in your mind the picture of the current president being forced to bow himself backward out of Uncle Sam\u2019s presence. Wouldn\u2019t that just beat the band? And the fireworks, too.Happy Fourth of July.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: How California Helps the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, a reporter based in the Bay Area.On Friday, the United States recorded its 80th consecutive month of job growth, which is the longest streak on record and has pushed the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent from 10 percent in the depths of the recession. After a long and painful recovery, the nation is nearing full employment \u2014 and California has played an outsize role.Over the last five years, California has outperformed the nation in just about every important economic metric. Yes, the state is big, accounting for about 12 percent of the nation\u2019s population. But its share of economic growth has been even bigger.California accounted for 17 percent of job growth in the United States from 2012 to 2016, and a quarter of the growth in gross domestic product.\u201cWhat these numbers say is that California is crucial to U.S. growth, far beyond what we could expect from our population alone,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.California was hit hard by the housing bust and recession, so it makes sense that the state would have a stronger rebound. But it also shows how the recovery has been guided by what Mr. Levy calls \u201cthe three Ts,\u201d which are technology, trade and tourism.San Francisco and the Silicon Valley have had a yearslong boom, while the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have been at the center of a rebound in container traffic and international trade. Hollywood has done well, too: As cable channels and companies like Netflix and Amazon have ramped up their original programming, Southern California has seen a surge in production jobs.The downside to all this success is that the state now has quite a lot to lose. With a large immigrant population and a huge port complex, California is at a much greater risk of being hurt by President Trump\u2019s muscular immigration policies and desire to curb imports and tear up trade agreements.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The American distance runner Jeffrey Eggleston won the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Marathon in San Diego on Sunday, beating more than 30,000 entrants with a time of 2 hours, 21 minutes and 18 seconds.But he had to the share the spotlight with a petite, 94-year-old grandmother.Harriette Thompson became the oldest woman to officially complete a half marathon, or 13.1 miles.Ms. Thompson, a former concert pianist from North Carolina, crossed the finish line after a run \u2014 more accurately a brisk walk \u2014 of 3 hours, 42 minutes and 56 seconds.She already held the distinction of oldest woman to complete a full marathon, which she did in 2015 at age 92, also at the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Marathon in San Diego.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that people are making such a deal out of this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at how many young people say, \u2018I\u2019m running just because of you.\u2019 And I think, \u2018Oh, good.

{"Headline": "Aziz Ansari Is Still Searching", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byMr. Ansari was joking, to underscore how hesitant he felt about doing another run considering how good he felt about the first. Success has brought new concerns.And as Mr. Allen did with \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d and \u201cManhattan,\u201d Mr. Ansari has also raised expectations of the work he puts out into the world.\u201cWhen you think of the star of a movie or TV show, you don\u2019t think of someone that looks like me or someone that looks like Woody Allen or someone that looks like Seth Rogen,\u201d Mr. Ansari said one afternoon in May at the Bowery Hotel. \u201cBut look, the point of the Woody Allen movies and the point of \u2018Master of None\u2019 is that it\u2019s all driven by point of view. As long as someone\u2019s point of view is interesting and they have something to say, it doesn\u2019t matter what they look like.\u201d\u201cThe truth is that any trip with Aziz, even one that is organized around research and requires thousands of miles of flight, quickly becomes about the food,\u201d Mr. Klinenberg said. \u201cI think the only really low point in traveling with him is I really didn\u2019t want to wait that many hours in line for ramen.\u201d\u201cIf I did a book like \u2018Bossypants\u2019 or Mindy\u2019s book, to me it would be material that I would use for stand-up,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought that would be something interesting and unexpected and different.\u201d\u201cMaster of None,\u201d created with Alan Yang, a writer on \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d \u2014 and done absent the time-slot constraints of network or even cable television \u2014 has given Mr. Ansari the chance to move the goal posts rather than be hemmed in by them.\u201cNo matter what creative field you are in,\u201d he said, \u201ca writer or comedian or whatever, people have no imagination for what your talent is beyond what they see from you. And if I just did just Indian jokes in the beginning of my career or where I played an Indian dude in the call center or whatever, that is what people would see me as. And that is all they would want me to do.\u201cBut even pushing that aside,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhen I did \u2018Parks and Rec,\u2019 people were like: \u2018Well, that is what this guy does? Let\u2019s just have him do that.\u2019 And then I had to make \u2018Master of None\u2019 to be like, \u2018No, I can do this, this and this.\u2019\u201dDespite his fears, the second season, released May 12, was pored over by a binge-watching nation. In New York, people were overheard talking about the show in subways and bars, and at dinner parties. They spoke about the \u201cReligion\u201d episode, which featured Mr. Ansari\u2019s parents, who also starred in the first season. They talked about the first episode, filmed in black and white, and conducted almost exclusively in Italian.And everyone had an opinion on the fantastical romance between Mr. Ansari\u2019s character, Dev, and the dreamy, engaged Francesca. Regardless of one\u2019s opinion of what went on, Dev\u2019s heartache and longing were palpable. He was able to communicate, even in his silent moments, that desperate wish to be happy with her, even if that happiness exists in a fantasy \u2014 something most of us have tried at one point in our lives.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he wants that first year,\u201d Mr. Yang said of the evolution of Mr. Ansari\u2019s character. \u201cThis year, he knows what he wants but can\u2019t have it. We watched a lot of these Italian neorealist movies, and there is a lot of extreme passion and emotion and sort of lyricism, and some of that might have seeped through.\u201dMr. Ansari\u2019s own passions extend well beyond his personal life. He was booked to host \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d the day after the presidential inauguration: a Muslim-born American from South Carolina on center stage just one day after a man who had called for a ban on Muslims entering the country had officially become the leader of the free world. There are very few moments when so much is expected of a comedic performance.Mr. Ansari tried out the material on 111 different occasions, including sets on Christmas Day at the Comedy Cellar in New York, just after having dinner in the West Village with David Cho, a media consultant and the former publisher of the defunct sports and pop culture website Grantland.\u201cI didn\u2019t work on Christmas,\u201d Mr. Cho said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the seriousness which he takes with everything and the work that goes into it, which I don\u2019t think can be overstated enough.\u201d\u201cIt was all coming from a real place,\u201d Mr. Ansari said. \u201cIf I\u2019m talking about Islamophobia or something, I\u2019m talking about my parents. It\u2019s coming from a real place. I would rather have that burden than feel like I didn\u2019t have anything to say.\u201dAnd yet he still has the searching quality of one not quite young, but not yet dashed on the shoals of middle age.\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to figure stuff out,\u201d said David Chang, the founder of the Momofuku restaurant group and a friend of Mr. Ansari\u2019s. \u201cI think that is what makes him so compelling to everyone.\u201dMr. Ansari has told him he would be a terrible father. \u201cI disagree wholeheartedly,\u201d Mr. Chang said. \u201cHe is such a good son.\u201dMr. Ansari\u2019s younger brother, Aniz, is a writer on the show. They \u201chave a great relationship and they completely admire what their parents have done, and that\u2019s a genuine thing,\u201d Mr. Chang said.Mr. Ansari said: \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll figure all that stuff out when I have a partner that I am ready to figure that out with. It\u2019s not something that I am thinking about at the moment. I just feel like it\u2019s a conversation that I will have further down the road when I\u2019m in a different place.\u201dJust where that place will be is now entirely up to him.\u201cHe has done a decent amount of hiding, which is a not-unhealthy reaction,\u201d said James Murphy, the frontman for LCD Soundsystem and also a friend. \u201cI think there are three options: Either embrace celebrity and just hang out with famous people. Hide. Or create a middle path \u2014 which is a lot more work, a lot harder.\u201dWork is not something Mr. Ansari avoids \u2014 but work on what? He wants to write and direct. Whether that is writing and directing a third season of \u201cMaster of None\u201d is another issue entirely.\u201cYou\u2019re not able to breathe before you have people say, \u2018What are you doing now?\u2019\u201d Mr. Ansari said. \u201cBut I just put the season out!

Not too long ago, for much of San Francisco and its environs, the Dubs were a long-forgotten team based in Oakland; you would have seen more Lakers merch around the city than anyone bearing the blue-and-gold.It was only a couple of years ago, after the Warriors began winning, that the larger Bay Area began to recognize that it might have a place in the N.B.A. This year, with the talk of inevitability, Warriors fever became a Bay-wide epidemic. That Dubs logo was everywhere these last few weeks \u2014 on San Francisco office towers, on Teslas and Toyotas. It was nearly as ubiquitous as our other example of homegrown iconography: Apple billboards.But you know what? The Bay Area needed a good bandwagon. This place has always been a fragmented, far-flung metropolis, stretched across bridges, bay and ocean, where sensibilities shift in the blink of a neighborhood \u2014 Palo Alto could be in another country from The Castro, which in turn feels otherworldly in Piedmont, Fruitvale or Telegraph Avenue. Tech-fueled economic success has only exacerbated a larger sense of nowhereness. So many people here are now from somewhere else that the whole place can often feel a bit mercenary, a company town lacking any common bond.This year, the Dubs became that bond. It\u2019s not hard to see why: Their story touches the many parts of the Bay. The Warriors have deep roots and a loyal fan base in Oakland. That\u2019s been layered with newer Silicon Valley money, and an unusual, even countercultural way of playing that feels at home in this mecca for the outr\u00e9 and weird. Then, in the last year, as the Dubs went from underdogs to big dogs, there was another reason for local solidarity: It was us against a world rooting for our defeat.Maybe this is what New York feels like? It\u2019s not a bad feeling.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Hamilton Cline has lived in the Bay Area for seven years.

The professional tablet, which comes in two screen sizes \u2014 10.5 or 12.9 diagonal inches \u2014 is incrementally improved from previous models. It is faster, with a brighter display and a higher refresh rate that makes motion look buttery smooth. In addition, the screen on the smaller iPad Pro has been enlarged slightly from 9.7 inches.But after about a week of testing the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, I concluded that Apple\u2019s professional tablet still suffers from some of the same problems when compared with a laptop. Most important, keyboard typing is not comfortable, and some tasks are better done with a mouse than with a touch screen. In the end, I would still recommend a traditional laptop for most professionals.What Has ImprovedThe most significant improvement to the iPad Pro is speed. The new tablet is notably faster: In speed tests run with the app Geekbench, the new iPad Pro was roughly 50 percent faster than its predecessor.That means if you upgrade from an iPad older than last year\u2019s model, you will get a tremendous speed increase. The speed boost makes the new iPad Pro better at intense tasks like juggling multiple apps, editing high-resolution photos and playing graphics-heavy games.The new iPad Pros also include a higher screen refresh rate. That makes motion look smoother, which is noticeable when opening or closing apps and scrolling through documents or websites. It is also supposed to make some games look better, but as of this writing, game developers had yet to update their apps to support the higher refresh rate.The other notable change is the increased screen size of the smaller iPad Pro. Apple slimmed down the bezel \u2014 or the border surrounding the screen \u2014 to make more room for the display; the tablet\u2019s body is also slightly larger and heavier. Over all, this is a better size for the smaller iPad Pro, partly because the increased size also gave room for Apple to make a slightly larger version of its physical keyboard, called Smart Keyboard.What Falls ShortEnlarging the smaller iPad Pro was an effort to address the tablet\u2019s greatest weakness: typing. The Smart Keyboard is essentially a protective cover for the screen with a keyboard and magnet built into it. When you open it, the tablet rests on top of the keyboard, held in place by the magnet.Here\u2019s the problem: The Smart Keyboard is thin and the keys do not click well or feel as satisfying to type on as the keyboards on a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air; after a long period of typing, the Smart Keyboard felt flimsy. The keyboard for the 10.5-inch model is still small and cramped compared with a MacBook keyboard.The other issue is ergonomics. Using the touch screen in combination with the Apple keyboard can be a pain on the wrist.Say, for example, you are using the keyboard to scroll through an email or website: If you want to open a link, you have to lift your hand away from the keyboard and tap the link. Or say you want to adjust the screen brightness or hit pause on a music track while typing: Both actions require reaching up and touching the screen. These keyboard-to-touch-screen reps get tiring.In my experience, using a keyboard and trackpad on a laptop feels like a more comfortable combination for crunching through a busy day of emails, messages, documents, spreadsheets and calendar entries.The other issues with the iPad are related to software and may be resolved this year. For example, you can have two apps open side by side with the iPad Pro. You can use each app independently, but the two apps cannot interact with each other easily: You cannot drag and drop a photo or file from one app to the other, for example. Fortunately, Apple is set to release a drag-and-drop feature this fall in iOS 11, its next mobile operating system. The operating system will also add the ability to display up to three apps at the same time and introduce a file system, which could make juggling tasks between applications easier.Who should buy one?In its current state, the iPad Pro is in an awkward position among Apple\u2019s product lineup. A small set of professionals who do not do much typing \u2014 like artists and illustrators \u2014 could probably get away with using an iPad Pro with a stylus as a stand-alone computer. But most professionals would probably benefit from using a personal computer combined with a smartphone and tablet.As for me, I must confess: I used the iPad Pro in research and outlining for this review. But when it came to writing it while reviewing notes simultaneously, I switched back to my MacBook Air, largely because the keyboard felt better to type on and it was easier to multitask with several apps.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What You Get (and What You Don\u2019t) From a $50 Amazon Fire", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhat can $50 buy? An inexpensive pair of sneakers, maybe dinner for two in San Francisco or a couple of tickets to the ballgame. But few ever imagined that it could also buy a tablet computer capable of running apps and streaming Netflix.Amazon\u2019s tablet success stands out because sales of the devices as a whole have been shrinking. Slowing tablet sales have compelled Apple to refresh its iPads more frequently than many of its other products. In fact, Apple on Monday introduced yet another new iPad with a 10.5-inch screen and a starting price of $649.After testing Amazon\u2019s Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 for a week, here\u2019s my verdict: These cheap tablets are ideal for families with children who treat gadgets like toys that can be slammed on a table or thrown against the ground. But if you\u2019re an adult who needs to get the slightest amount of work done on a tablet, you should probably spend the extra money on a big-screen smartphone or an iPad.Here\u2019s what you need to know about what you get \u2014 and what you don\u2019t \u2014 from a $50 Amazon tablet.The best thing about the new tablets is how they feel to hold. Weighing about 10 ounces and 13 ounces, the seven-inch and eight-inch devices were designed to be easily carried in one hand. After spending hours holding the Fire with one hand to read e-books and to watch Netflix videos, my wrist did not feel strained. The compact size also makes these tablets great for children with small hands.The Fire 7 also had surprisingly long battery life for a device this inexpensive. Amazon says it gets about eight hours of juice while juggling various tasks, like browsing the web and running apps. I watched about four and a half hours of video before its battery drained. That\u2019s modest, but enough for playing a feature-length movie before tucking a child into bed. Amazon says the eight-incher has a battery life of 12 hours.While the Fires have mediocre displays with dull colors and noticeable pixelation even when reading e-books, the lower quality is acceptable at this price. I wouldn\u2019t use a Fire for reading digital comics, which usually have a wide range of colors and sharp illustrations, but the tablet is sufficient for flipping through e-books, which are just black text on white pages.For internet speeds, the Fires were reasonably fast at downloads. In my tests on a Wi-Fi network, Apple\u2019s $329 iPad had download speeds of 92 megabits a second, compared with the Fire 7, at 48 megabits a second. While the Fires were only about half as fast as the pricier iPad, 48 megabits a second was more than enough to smoothly stream video and quickly download apps and e-books.The worst part of the Fires is the overall computing power. The tablets are so slow at loading apps and processing tasks that even typing memos is painful; whenever you make a mistake, there is a lag as you backspace to type the correct letter.The sluggishness also makes the Fires terrible for scrolling through web articles. Don\u2019t buy an Amazon tablet if you plan to use it for email, web browsing or playing games with heavy graphics.Another major component lacking from Amazon\u2019s tablets is access to Google\u2019s official app store, the largest mobile software shop with more than 2.5 million apps. The tablets run a modified version of Google\u2019s Android that instead showcases Amazon\u2019s App store. While there are hundreds of thousands of apps inside Amazon\u2019s app store, I found that some of my favorite apps were missing \u2014 namely 1Password, an app for managing passwords.Perhaps the biggest design oversight of the Fire 7 is the placement of the speaker on the back of the tablet. Most other tablets feature the speakers on the bottom or sides so that blockage isn\u2019t a problem.But if you place the tablet bottom-side down on a flat surface to listen to music from the speaker, the sound will be muffled. Instead, you have to lay it screen-side down. The same problem occurs if you hold it with a protective cover on: The back flap covers the speaker. (The Fire 8 does not have this problem, because the speakers are on the side.)Lastly, if you pay the bare minimum of $50 for the seven-incher or $80 for the eight-incher, you are getting a tablet that shows ads, or what Amazon calls \u201cspecial offers.\u201d What that means is the lock screen, which is what you see when you wake up the device, will shuffle through different ads, like e-book or app promotions. You can pay an extra $15 to buy versions of the tablets without sponsored screens.With all that said, would you pay $50 for an adequate e-book reader and TV show and movie player that was easy to carry around everywhere? My guess would be yes.But perhaps the most compelling value proposition is a hidden one: keeping your child\u2019s hands off your fancy iPad.An earlier version of this article used an outdated brand reference to the Amazon Fire tablet. The tables are now simply called Fire, no longer Kindle Fire.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Setback for Murdoch in $15 Billion Sky Takeover", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byFor years, Rupert Murdoch has tried to cement his legacy by adding Sky, the European satellite giant, to his global media empire. That quest was delayed once again Thursday as the British authorities asked regulators to further examine whether the $15 billion deal would give the Murdoch family too much control over the country\u2019s media.The announcement was part of a split decision on the bid by Mr. Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to take over the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own. While Mr. Murdoch and his family are likely to face increased pressure with a lengthy and potentially intrusive review by Britain\u2019s competition authority, they also dodged a regulatory bullet.\u201cIt\u2019s both good and bad news for 21st Century Fox,\u201d said Martin Moore, director of the Center for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King\u2019s College London.Mr. Moore added that the company would be more comfortable arguing its case to British regulators over questions of its control over parts of the media industry than on whether it should pass the \u201cfit and proper\u201d test.In a statement, 21st Century Fox welcomed the \u201cfit and proper\u201d decision, but said it was disappointed the British government still had reservations about its potential influence over the local media industry. It said that its takeover of Sky may now happen by June 2018.The company has until July 14 to respond before the government formally refers the deal to Britain\u2019s competition authority.Two politically independent regulators in Britain \u2014 the Office of Communications, or Ofcom; and the Competition and Markets Authority \u2014 began reviewing the proposed takeover, and attention quickly focused on whether the deal would limit consumer choice and whether 21st Century Fox executives met British broadcasting standards.Karen Bradley, the culture minister, said Thursday that the investigation into the proposed deal had raised questions about whether the takeover would give members of the Murdoch family too much influence.\u201cIt seems clear that there were significant failings of the corporate culture at Fox News,\u201d Ofcom said in the report. \u201cFox\u2019s response to the claims has been mixed. Some allegations were handled swiftly. But Fox was slower to deal with Bill O\u2019Reilly, its star anchor.\u201dOfcom also chastised the company for the language it used to describe employee misconduct, saying that it \u201ctended to downplay the harm caused\u201d and was \u201cunnecessarily pejorative.\u201d In one example, Ofcom pointed to a May meeting with Fox, in which it \u201cdescribed the continuum as going from \u2018appalling sexual harassment\u2019 to \u2018regular dirty old man talk.\u2019\u201d (Fox later told Ofcom that the phrase was not intended to diminish the allegations.)Mr. Ailes, who died last month, and Mr. O\u2019Reilly repeatedly denied the allegations against them.But despite scolding 21st Century Fox, Ofcom determined that the company was a \u201cfit and proper\u201d holder of British broadcasting rights. The regulator said it had found no evidence that the issues at Fox News had extended through 21st Century Fox, nor that any of the company\u2019s executives were aware of the misconduct before they were informed of it in July 2016, when Mr. Ailes was ousted.Ofcom said it would review its position if new information became available.One lawyer for some of the employees making sexual and racial harassment allegations rejected Ofcom\u2019s findings, saying that 21st Century Fox executives had known about the harassment before that date.The extended review into 21st Century Fox\u2019s offer comes at a difficult time for the British government, which must eventually decide whether to approve or reject the takeover.Prime Minister Theresa May was unable to win a majority in parliamentary elections this month, and politicians in Britain are focused on the beginning of negotiations to leave the European Union, leaving little time to consider the proposed takeover. Opposition lawmakers, and some inside Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party, have balked at the deal.21st Century Fox\u2019s attempt to buy Sky is part of the company\u2019s efforts to keep pace with digital rivals like Netflix and Amazon, which have used their streaming services to win over consumers increasingly accustomed to watching movies and television shows on mobile devices.The acquisition of Sky, experts say, would give 21st Century Fox not only a pan-European satellite network and rights to content including English Premier League broadcasts, but also control of Now TV, Sky\u2019s online streaming service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Easy Money Is Drying Up, and Markets Tremble", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byIt could be time for markets to come down from their sugar highs.After years of injecting trillions of dollars into their economies in an effort to encourage growth, central bankers have become more forthright in signaling an end to easy-money policies.What started as tremors in European government bonds after a speech on Tuesday by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, had spread to global stocks by Thursday.Mr. Draghi called for prudence in policy, and investors seemed to interpret that as a step back from the bank\u2019s commitment to buying European government bonds. Central bank officials were quick to point out that Mr. Draghi did not say that he would tighten policy immediately. But investors apparently ignored that.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, also indicated on Tuesday that an increase in rates might be in order.Those signals have prompted speculation that central bankers may be coordinating efforts to warn investors who benefited from the liquidity boom.Indeed, officials from the Federal Reserve have been saying for several weeks that financial markets were overheated.Investors are also keeping a close eye on the \u201cFaang\u201d stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which dropped briefly in early June. Those stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of market gains, and they are getting more expensive. A sustained fall could also lead to a bear market.Those jumps promised some notable benefits:\u2022 Investors get a bump in their dividends;\u2022 Executives could see their pay packages swell;\u2022 The big institutions might have more flexibility to lend, which could promote more long-term growth.Critics worry, however, that less regulatory pressure could set the stage for a return to the bad old days of enormous leverage and freewheeling.Instead, Rite Aid will sell 2,186 of its 4,600 stores to Walgreens, along with three distribution centers, for $5.18 billion. The announcement sent Rite Aid shares tumbling.The resistance was not unexpected \u2014 the companies\u2019 original $9.3 billion deal would have created a group with more outlets than CVS Health, the biggest drugstore chain by market capitalization in the United States.In spite of hopes that antitrust regulation would ease under President Trump, several deals, including in the health care sector, have been derailed this year.The British authorities have asked regulators to further examine a $15 billion bid by 21st Century Fox to take over the 61 percent of Sky, the European satellite giant, that it does not already own.Rupert Murdoch and his family will now face a review by Britain\u2019s competition authority, but they have dodged a regulatory bullet. The authorities ruled that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, even as they concluded that the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had pointed to \u201csignificant corporate failures.\u201dThe British Office of Communications, or Ofcom, did not hold back in its criticism of the scandal at Fox News, noting that 21st Century Fox was aware of multiple cases against Bill O\u2019Reilly that had led to settlements when it renewed its contract with the former host.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Famous Argentine Chef on Food and Romance", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported bySummer Entertaining\u201cI sort of fell in love with the scope and the romance of the place. It\u2019s like a beautiful, deep dream that marries the wonderful worlds of food, wine and art,\u201d he said earlier this month about the new home for his signature wood-fire cooking. \u201cI like the idea of distance, that people travel not for the food but for the life experience.\u201dHis new namesake restaurant is adjacent to the property\u2019s art center. In the courtyard, behind a rainbow-hued rendition of a pergola by the artist Daniel Buren, chef Mallmann\u2019s hulking wire dome easily passes for an art installation itself \u2014 but will soon be used for hanging and slow-cooking whole fish, rib-eyes and chicken on the bone.In his own artistic way, Mallmann sets the scene at each of his restaurants, for guests to escape from their everyday lives. \u201cIt\u2019s joy, it\u2019s about celebration,\u201d he offers. \u201cI try to touch people in a different way, in a more complete way. Food and wine were hopefully delicious but I like to think that guests have been touched by a lifestyle experience.\u201d Fire and romance, attendant themes according to the chef, resurface time and again in any conversation with Mallmann. \u201cI try to live life romantically. Sometimes romance is more related to relationships of love but life is romantic, too. The way we wake up, step out of bed, make our plans for the day.\u201dHere, the chef unpacks the key elements to serving a romantic meal: loved ones, food and wine (almost any kind will do) \u2014 and, of course, an open flame.\u201cI really think that the only reason to have food and wine is to have better conversation \u2014 with your wife, your lover, your peers, your children, whoever is sitting with you. It doesn\u2019t have to be luxurious, you can be having lunch under a tree with simple glasses and dishes. There can be care and attention at the most simple or extravagant and eccentric tables.\u201cFire plays into the romance, of course, especially when it\u2019s outside. Like when I cook in gardens or with the dome at Ch\u00e2teau La Coste, fire is a primal thing, it\u2019s inside all of us. I think it\u2019s something that makes people dream, whether it\u2019s a king or a peasant, it produces the same feeling. I love that hug that fire gives no matter what, no matter what language is spoken, no matter the culture. Sitting around the fire, you go beyond language to speak something everyone can understand: what fire is and what it brings. That is a romantic ideal.\u201dThis interview has been edited and condensed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "TV Executives Survey Relationships and Ratings and Snub Netflix", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Scorning Netflix. Playing down the importance of ratings. And wondering if there is a danger to all the praise for limited series.These were some of the popular topics of conversation here this past weekend as television executives, actors, writers and fans came to town for the sixth annual ATX Television Festival.Through a series of panel discussions on a variety of subjects, industry insiders tried to make sense of a landscape that features more than 450 scripted shows, more than ever before. Through all of the talk, however, one topic was returned to again and again: a certain streaming service with money to spend.Another TV conference, another opportunity for executives to complain about Netflix, the streaming service that continues to pour billions into original programming.\u201cThey\u2019re playing a different game; it\u2019s cool, whatever,\u201d Kathleen McCaffrey, HBO\u2019s vice president for programming, said brusquely at one panel discussion.When asked how she looked at Netflix\u2019s free-spending ways, Karey Burke, the executive vice president for programming and development at Freeform, was more succinct.\u201cWith disdain,\u201d she said.TV executives all tell a version of the same story: They fell in love with a script for a TV show only to lose out to Netflix, which is on a spending spree in almost every genre, from dramas to children\u2019s programming.When executives were asked if there was a rule they could enact in the industry, FX\u2019s president for original programming, Nick Grad, said, \u201cMake sure everyone has to be profitable.\u201d The comment was a not-very-subtle jab at Netflix, which has delivered modest profits for several quarters and has promised to deliver material profit this year.\u201cThey\u2019re going after similar shows,\u201d Ms. Burke said. \u201c\u201813 Reasons Why\u2019 was a script we had, and I loved it. I had, like, a day, and the agents said, \u2018Sorry, it\u2019s going to Netflix.\u2019\u201dThe agents told her Netflix had given it a full-series commitment, a bold move that profit-bound networks are more hesitant to make.Netflix also recently canceled two expensive shows within the space of a week \u2014 a rare move for the streaming service.\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re canceling shows,\u201d Mr. Grad said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their ratings are, but they obviously have to start making decisions. They can\u2019t have 10,000 shows on.\u201dTV executives would, once again, like to emphasize a point they have worked hard to underscore in recent years: They pay attention to more than ratings.\u201cI don\u2019t wake up anymore with a pit in my stomach at 4:45 to look and see if a show I love is dead or alive on arrival,\u201d said Jennifer Salke, NBC\u2019s entertainment president.Instead of scanning ratings numbers in the early morning, they may be reading entertainment websites like Vulture or The Ringer.\u201cI like a show that generates think pieces,\u201d Casey Bloys, HBO\u2019s programming president, said as the audience started to laugh. \u201cHonestly.\u201dShows that elicit such a response, he continued, are shows \u201cthat people are thinking about, analyzing, debating, and that\u2019s important.\u201dMr. Grad, of FX, repeated a point that his boss, John Landgraf, had made this year: The audience gets a vote, the critics get a vote, and executives get a vote \u2014 if two of the three approve, the show is likely to stay on the air.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much how many people are watching,\u201d said Craig Erwich, Hulu\u2019s head of content. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s their intensity of a relationship to the show. You might have the show that might not have the biggest audience, but if it\u2019s a bunch of those people\u2019s favorite show and if the economics bear out, it\u2019s a show that can stick out.\u201dLimited series are all the rage in TV these days for obvious reasons. Big stars, big events and a small ask of an audience: stay with us for seven hours, not seven years.But with the success of shows like \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d and \u201cThe People vs. O. J. Simpson,\u201d one executive wondered if the slew of new limited series would hurt the networks\u2019 chances of attracting big-name actors for recurring series, which are ultimately more profitable.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of success in luring great actors to television to do ongoing many, many years series,\u201d said Gary Levine, Showtime\u2019s programming president. \u201cIf those actors can play in the TV sandbox and only commit to eight hours one season, that\u2019s tempting, and with very generous fees to boot.\u201dHe added: \u201cIn some ways we may be hurting ourselves because the brass ring still is the long ongoing series, where network invests in a show, audience invests in those characters, and the love flows in all directions for many, many years. Limited series are great, a lovely complement to that, but by no means a substitute for it.\u201dMr. Bloys, the HBO executive, countered that shows like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cThe Americans\u201d each had something in common.\u201cNo movie stars,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not necessary to launch a show. It\u2019s nice to have great actors, but I don\u2019t think it should be a requirement.\u201dMs. Salke, the NBC executive, pointed to \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d which has a big cast with no \u201chuge stars\u201d but became the biggest network TV hit in two years.\u201cThere were some real discoveries that have broken out in an incredible way,\u201d she said, pointing to the actress Chrissy Metz.Mr. Erwich, of Hulu, said, \u201cOne of the things that TV does really well is that audiences love discovering people.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Netflix\u2019s earnings. Netflix has had modest profits for several quarters; it is not the case that it is not yet profitable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Carl Reiner and His Fellow Nonagenarians, Death Can Wait", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byThe title of Carl Reiner\u2019s most recent book is \u201cToo Busy to Die,\u201d and this 95-year-old comedy legend can thank his vivid dreams for inspiring many of the (sometimes wacky) ideas that keep him going.\u201cMy mind keeps popping,\u201d Mr. Reiner, who created \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show\u201d and directed the movies \u201cOh, God!,\u201d \u201cThe Jerk\u201d and \u201cDead Men Don\u2019t Wear Plaid,\u201d said in a phone interview from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cSo I\u2019ll keep going as long as it lets me.\u201dIt\u2019s stereotype-shattering nonagenarians like Mr. Reiner who inspired the documentary \u201cIf You\u2019re Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast,\u201d which debuts Monday, June 5, on HBO. The film, directed by Danny Gold, takes its name from Mr. Reiner\u2019s daily activity of checking the death notices to make sure it\u2019s safe to go about his business.A look into those leading vital lives well into their 90s, the documentary is also a toast to Mr. Reiner\u2019s career and to those of his famous peers. He serves as narrator and plays something of a host throughout: There he is interviewing Kirk Douglas and Dick Van Dyke and enjoying freewheeling, reflective conversations with the longtime friends and colleagues Mel Brooks and Norman Lear.Mr. Brooks said the thought of him slowing down in older age is heresy. \u201cThere is living and dying; there\u2019s no retirement,\u201d Mr. Brooks said in an interview.\u201cIf we die, then we can\u2019t do much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as long as we\u2019re alive, we can still tap dance, we can still crack a joke, we can still sing a song, we can still tell a story.\u201dFor Mr. Lear, 94, participating in the film is a continuation of a mission to buck the stereotype of the elderly as \u201cdecrepit and weak and foolish.\u201dMr. Lear, the creator of \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d \u201cThe Jeffersons\u201d and \u201cSanford and Son,\u201d has been having a bit of resurgence lately. A remake of his 1970s and \u201980s sitcom \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d will be returning for a second season on Netflix, and he reviews scripts and attends nearly every casting session and show taping. He also hosts a weekly podcast, \u201cAll of the Above,\u201d talking comedy with guests like Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Amy Poehler.\u201cThe culture has an impression of aging that is not realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get the laughs, it paints a picture of older people as infirm, as whiny, and as incapacitated and foolish. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s who we are.\u201dGeorge Shapiro, the film\u2019s producer (with Aimee Hyatt) and Mr. Reiner\u2019s nephew, agreed. He\u2019s been thinking about such a documentary since 2010, when he started a paper file marked \u201cVitality After 90.\u201d Last year, with Mr. Reiner\u2019s blessing, he went ahead and self-financed the documentary, tapping Mr. Gold to direct after Ms. Hyatt showed him the filmmaker\u2019s recent documentary \u201c100 Voices: A Journey Home,\u201d which tells the history of Jewish culture in Poland. (Mr. Shapiro, a longtime talent manager whose clients include Mr. Seinfeld, declined to disclose the budget.)Mr. Reiner wanted the documentary to land at HBO, and it found a receptive audience there. Sheila Nevins, the president of HBO Documentary Films, said she\u2019s overseen \u201ca lot of sorrow onscreen\u201d in her career, particularly as it relates to older people. Most documentaries featuring older subjects \u201care about elder abuse or diseases,\u201d she noted. \u201cTo suddenly be able to laugh is a very rare thing in a documentary.\u201dEarly in the film, Mr. Reiner asks a rhetorical question: \u201cHow come we got the extra years? Was it luck, good genes, modern medicine? Or are we doing something right?\u201dThe film then sets out to answer that question and attempts to serve as something of a how-to guide, proposing the maintenance of close friendships and passions for hobbies as paramount.Mr. Seinfeld, who appears in the film to offer a perspective on aging and reveals he often wakes up depressed every morning thinking about yet another day of tasks, first met Mr. Reiner as an 8-year-old seeking an autograph at the Westbury Music Fair. Mr. Seinfeld said he\u2019s a firm believer in remaining dynamic in one\u2019s later years. \u201cThat song \u2018Young at Heart,\u2019 I don\u2019t believe in that,\u201d he said with a laugh, referring to the Frank Sinatra hit. \u201cYou gotta do something! You may start with a philosophy, but you got to actually act on it. It doesn\u2019t happen just because you have a sunny disposition. You actually have to do some work.\u201dMr. Shapiro said he\u2019s already booked the 63-year-old Mr. Seinfeld for a 100th-birthday comedy show at Caesars Palace, in Las Vegas, in 2054. \u201cWe even have a hold-the-date certificate,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said with a laugh. \u201cHe will be there. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be there.\u201dMr. Reiner admits to still being surprised on occasion by his contemporaries. During his research for the book about films from his youth he learned that Olivia de Havilland, who, in 1938, starred alongside Errol Flynn in \u201cThe Adventures of Robin Hood,\u201d was still alive and living in France at 100.\u201cIt makes me so happy,\u201d Mr. Reiner said. \u201cTo know you can go on like that and still have your wits about you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jenji Kohan on the Prison Riot Driving \u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byWhen Season 4 of Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d ended, no one \u2014 save, perhaps, Jenji Kohan, the show\u2019s creator, and her writers \u2014 could be certain where the series was headed. But wherever it was, it didn\u2019t look good. Poussey Washington, the soulful wisp of an inmate played by Samira Wiley, had died an episode earlier \u2014 agonizingly, in a scene echoing the 2014 death of Eric Garner \u2014 when a corrections officer pinned her to the floor with his knee. Then another corrections officer lost control of his gun, which a furious Daya (Dascha Polanco) picked up and pointed at his head.Season 5, beginning Friday, June 9, steps off with Daya and that gun and then segues into what Ms. Kohan called \u201ca natural progression\u201d: a riot in which the inmates seek justice for Poussey\u2019s killing by taking hostages and demanding what the privatization of their facility took from them, including G.E.D. classes, adequate health care and even tampons. The action, covering three days, unfurls across 13 episodes.\u201cWe wanted to slow down to really get into the riot, and also to slow down in general and get into some of the detail work that\u2019s hard to do if you\u2019re skipping through time,\u201d Ms. Kohan said. In a phone interview from Los Angeles, she spoke about the loss of Poussey; the real-life prison system; and her latest Netflix project, \u201cGlow,\u201d starring Alison Brie, about women\u2019s professional wrestling. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.So just how fast are we skipping? In real life, Piper Kerman, whose story inspired the series, spent 13 months at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn.Our Piper was sentenced to 18. I think we\u2019re at about 10 months.There\u2019s a point where the riot evolves from chaos to a near utopia \u2014 baristas serving cold brew, bloggers offering beautification seminars \u2014 before devolving. What\u2019s the message? I think it reflects humanity. We can be beautiful, and we can be incredibly destructive. And sometimes we\u2019re our own worst enemy, and be careful what you wish for, and all those clich\u00e9s. We wanted to follow what we thought would be a natural progression of the riot, and we had done research into other ones. They were mostly men\u2019s riots. But we were going to take the information and see how it would be different in our environment and how it would be the same.What did you come up with?It\u2019s less violent \u2014 that\u2019s the biggest thing. The men just seemed to be a lot bloodier, and there was also an opportunity for a lot of people to settle old scores when no one was looking. Not to say that women can\u2019t be violent, because they certainly can. And there are moments, I think, where it gets a little domestic when they\u2019re in charge, which I don\u2019t think is as common in men\u2019s. There\u2019s a different tone to it, and I think it was surprising for the other characters, from the guards to the administration. Women aren\u2019t supposed to riot.You\u2019ve expounded on privatization and overcrowding in prisons. What\u2019s your take on the system five seasons in?I think it\u2019s really broken. I think it\u2019s increasingly corrupt. I fear more privatization. I think it\u2019s much more punitive than rehabilitative, and it\u2019s a huge waste of money in a lot of areas. It\u2019s a very flawed system.Do you worry about increased incarceration under President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions?Absolutely. And we\u2019re trying to figure that out because theoretically we\u2019re operating in the past. But we want to address current events and feelings, so we may abandon the timeline. Piper will still have served the same amount of time, but we will be in the present day.Even in her absence, Poussey is at the heart of this season. A lot of \u201cOrange\u201d fans miss her.We love her, too, and that\u2019s part of why she was a sacrificial lamb. We felt her death would be the most affecting for the audience, and it was really hard for us because she\u2019s terrific to work with, she\u2019s a terrific actress, and we like her personally. But we built this character who had hope and promise, and extinguishing that light would be the most devastating.You\u2019ve been guaranteed seven seasons. Is Season 7 the end?I haven\u2019t made a final decision yet, but I\u2019m leaning toward ending it after seven \u2014 although the nature of the show is one that can go on and on because you can bring in new people. Do you have an ending in mind that you can share?I think I do. And I will not share it.Has writing within a prison setting been limiting?For the crew and the actors, we spend our days in jail. We spend our days on a set that looks like a prison. We eat a lot better, we can go outside, but there is something oppressive about the environment of a prison that we\u2019ve written ourselves into. It makes you really grateful that you\u2019re not [in a real one]. But there are bars and dirt, even though the set department put the dirt there, and you get a sense of what you\u2019re writing about when you\u2019re in that world. And that can take its toll. That\u2019s why we rely on humor, that\u2019s why we do the flashbacks \u2014 to take a break from all that.Netflix doesn\u2019t give viewer numbers to producers. What\u2019s it like functioning in a vacuum?You just do it because you do it. It makes it certainly a little harder to negotiate when that time comes because you can\u2019t say, \u201cLook how many people are watching.\u201d It\u2019s nice to be buffeted by numbers. On the other hand, I never really thought about numbers before, so it\u2019s not a new experience for me. It\u2019s a little frustrating \u2014 how about that? And now you\u2019re an executive producer on Netflix\u2019s \u201cGlow,\u201d about women\u2019s wrestling in the 1980s.Carly [Mensch, one of the show\u2019s creators, writers and executive producers] had started on \u201cWeeds,\u201d she wrote on \u201cOrange,\u201d and then she went away and did a year on \u201cNurse Jackie.\u201d I\u2019m a fan, and she said, \u201cLook, I have this friend who\u2019s a writer on \u2018Nurse Jackie,\u2019 and we just watched this documentary about this women\u2019s wrestling league, and we\u2019re totally obsessed.\u201d And I think my role with them is mostly like godmother because [Carly and Liz Flahive, the show\u2019s co-creator] are both really talented and capable. But it\u2019s also their first time out, so I guess I\u2019m the bodyguard and adviser. I read scripts and give notes and go to set sometimes, but they know what they\u2019re doing. We didn\u2019t always agree but I think part of my job as protector is maybe even to protect them from me.People started out viewing the broad diversity on \u201cOrange\u201d as unconventional, which you have said made you sad. How do you see this array of women?I see them as gorgeous and sexy and interesting and normative in a way that the milieu doesn\u2019t always present.Advertisement"}

As for Mr. Almod\u00f3var\u2019s throwdown, it had some unpleasant implications. Would the jury leader effectively blackball the two Netflix movies in competition, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s \u201cOkja\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)\u201d?The fun continued into the festival last month, where some members of the news media reportedly booed the Netflix logo at the beginning of \u201cOkja,\u201d then booed some more when the first 10 minutes of the movie were projected in the wrong aspect ratio, a glitch that inspired some Infowars-style conspiracy theories on Twitter. Once the movie was shown correctly, it earned an ovation and attendant critical praise on social media.While Netflix garnered controversy without actively seeking it, Amazon quietly took Todd Haynes\u2019s new movie, \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d to the competition. As of this writing, there was no news of either company\u2019s having made major acquisitions at the festival.Efe Cakarel, the founder and chief executive of the streaming service Mubi, which rides hard for cinephile art house fare, told me I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised by this.\u201cThe first few years I came to Cannes, all I did was explain to film producers what streaming video on demand even was,\u201d he told me in a phone interview just after this year\u2019s festival (his 10th). \u201cAnd if you even broached the idea of acquiring rights to first-run movies for streaming, they looked at you like you were crazy. Remember, Cannes 2007 was right before the introduction of the iPhone. Three years before the iPad. Yes, YouTube was around, but that sort of thing wasn\u2019t even close to what YouTube was about then. Although you could tell, by looking at the way people used their laptops, there was a readiness to engage with long-form material.\u201d\u201cThere were 18 films in competition with 13 already bought,\u201d Mr. Cakarel said. \u201cEvery year it\u2019s getting more and more intense, and that\u2019s in part because companies such as Netflix and Amazon are part of the Cannes machine, so to speak. They\u2019re financing, producing, distributing films, often with an eye to getting them to Cannes. So now we are in the business of negotiating prebuys, too.\u201dSo, Mr. Cakarel concluded, \u201cIf you want to work with Paolo Sorrentino, you have to have the conversation with him today, before he\u2019s even embarked on whatever he is going to do next.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But were it not for Netflix, he continued during an interview in Manhattan a few weeks ago, \u201cOkja\u201d as he conceived it could not have been made.With \u201cOkja,\u201d Mr. Bong said, with the help of a translator, the studios the story was pitched to had seemed more or less onboard \u2014 at least until it came to that last bit.\u201cFor the studios, the recurring questions was, \u2018Are you going to keep the slaughterhouse scene?\u2019\u201d Mr. Bong said. \u201cThey saw a girl and beautiful animals. They wanted something like Disney. But Netflix, they gave me 100 percent freedom to do whatever I wanted.\u201d (Brad Pitt\u2019s production company, Plan B, is also a producing partner.)Floppy haired and youthful at 47, Mr. Bong met to chat with The New York Times with his translator and Mr. Ronson in a 38th-floor corner room at the Mandarin Oriental by Central Park, with Midtown\u2019s mash-up of stately old buildings and heaven-scraping new towers looming outside. The news conference and junket \u2014 which entails having reporters hop from one hotel room to the next to interview the movie\u2019s principals for scant minutes as publicists count down the time \u2014 were to be held the next day.The idea for \u201cOkja\u201d started, he said, when the image of a large, ungainly animal with a sad face popped into his head. He began wondering why this animal was melancholy and about who might harm it, and then about humanity\u2019s \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice\u201d-esque predilection for deeming some animals edible and other animals pets.Okja is technically a pig but also shares her lineage with hippos, elephants and manatees, the gentle sea cows that largely inspired her not-very-porcine face. While there are abattoir scenes, and no shortage of heartache, much of the film is madcap and light, and shot through with Mr. Bong\u2019s wry humor. The Animal Liberation Front, a Three Stooges-like crew led by Mr. Dano, includes an attenuated young man so anguished about humanity\u2019s carbon footprint that he refuses to eat. Ms. Swinton\u2019s chief executive spends a good chunk of the film speaking through a mouthful of braces. Mr. Gyllenhaal\u2019s bug-eyed zoologist is a certifiable nut.Yet Mr. Bong said his intention with \u201cOkja\u201d was not to make a polemic about animal rights: \u201cThe main purpose of this film is to be beautiful.\u201dStill, he acknowledged being \u201cvery concerned and nervous all the time.\u201d He worries that the air he breathes is dirty, he said, and that the water he drinks is polluted, and says all that anxiety might be rooted in childhood kidney problems and chronic throat infections that left him afraid of water and air. \u201cI\u2019m quite fine now,\u201d he said.\u201cThere are times where I wanted to inflict certain psychological pain,\u201d he said, about the film, \u201cbecause in reality, that\u2019s what the animals go through.\u201dStill, the film stopped short of making its cast and key players outright vegetarians. Mr. Ronson remains a pescatarian, or, as he put it, \u201ca fish and chipocrit.\u201d An Seo Hyun, who plays Mija, said shooting the slaughterhouse scenes put her off meat, but she has since picked it back up, albeit with greater awareness about where it comes from. Mr. Dano, who first met Mr. Bong years ago, when Mr. Dano was playing in a band and spotted \u201ca large Korean man\u201d dancing around in the audience, said he probably won\u2019t stop eating meat but will want to know more about its origins. Ms. Swinton said she\u2019s an infrequent carnivore, limiting her intake to wild game caught near her home in the Scottish Highlands. \u201cA very luxury position to be in,\u201d she said.Ms. Swinton, who previously worked with Mr. Bong on \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d said with \u201cOkja,\u201d Mr. Bong succeeded at making a highly entertaining film about something that, along with climate change and the like, people would rather not think about.\u201cThe sort of collective amnesia that we\u2019re all encouraged to sort of hold hands on, which is not being awake about what we\u2019re putting in our bodies, the way we\u2019re treating each other, the way we\u2019re treating the planet, that\u2019s the thing, really,\u201d Ms. Swinton said. \u201cThe whole idea of sleepwalking into sort of mindless consumerism.\u201dAs for Mr. Bong, the trip to the Colorado slaughterhouse made him a vegan for all of two months.\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cSouth Korea is barbecue paradise.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Letter: It\u2019s July 1. Let\u2019s Party. Wait, Why Today?", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byOn Saturday, Canada celebrates the 150th anniversary of \u2014 something. Just exactly what and why is open to interpretation. It\u2019s not exactly a birthday, no one knows why it\u2019s July 1 and a good many people in Canada don\u2019t have much to celebrate.All that being said, it is Canada Day, and for most Canadians that means a party, wearing red T-shirts and painting maple leaves on their faces.But not for many of the country\u2019s indigenous people, even those who also identify as Canadians. Their ancestors weren\u2019t invited to the talks that led to the country\u2019s formation on July 1, 1867. After that, it was a long period of losing land and identity.A reminder of those injustices came on Thursday night when a group of young indigenous people clashed with the police in Ottawa while attempting to set up a tepee on Parliament Hill, the epicenter of this weekend\u2019s celebration.It took some time for Canada Day to become a holiday, let alone a moment of national flag waving.Often Canada Day is described as Canada\u2019s birthday, although it doesn\u2019t really mark the start of a fully independent nation. On July 1, 1867, a law from the United Kingdom, the British North America Act, set up the federal government and joined three of its colonial provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Canada (which was divided into Ontario and Quebec that day) into the Dominion of Canada. A federal government was placed atop of them to create a confederation. But Britain still retained some legislative and legal controls, ran foreign affairs and kept Canadians as its subjects.Why did confederation take place on July 1, 1867? Queen Victoria signed the British North America act on March 29, 1867, and the law gave everyone over in Canada six months to prepare before it came into effect. On May 22, it was officially proclaimed that July 1 would be the big day.I asked several historians, including Professor Cupido, why that day was chosen. They didn\u2019t know. The Department of Canadian Heritage, which is in charge of the Canada 150 celebrations, drew a blank. And the research branch at the Library of Parliament, which is currently displaying one of the original copies of the B.N.A. Act, replied that \u201cthere doesn\u2019t appear to be a clear reason for the choice of date.\u201dPerhaps it was simply because the arrangements were all in place by July 1. Or maybe it was because the fiscal year of the former province of Canada ended on June 30. Ah, the workings of bureaucracy.And for those of you who will be marking at least part of the holiday weekend in front a screen, the people at Watching, The Times\u2019s guide to television and film, produced their monthly advice on Netflix in Canada. As always, remember that Netflix sometimes changes its programming plan without notice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ryan O\u2019Callaghan and Finding Life Beyond the Closet", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn an interview with Outsports.com, Mr. O\u2019Callaghan, who hails from a small conservative community in California, talked about realizing he was gay when he was a junior in high school but deciding at a young age he would never be able to \u201clive as a gay man.\u201d He discussed his feelings of isolation and said he rarely saw depictions of gay men like himself in the media. The 6-foot-7-inch, 330-pound athlete even admitted that whenever he heard his friends or family using gay slurs it felt like a stab to the gut.Using football as a disguise, he hid his sexuality. He planned his death for the end of his athletic career until people in the Kansas City Chiefs organization helped him come out of the closet, bringing new life to a fully realized, fully queer, fully valid version of him.But coming out of the closest is just the first step. There is still nearly 15 years of emotional trauma that Mr. O\u2019Callaghan, and many other L.G.B.T. folks, must spend time coming to terms with. Processing the self-loathing and hatred shaped by a fear of not having your family, community or the world accept you is a daunting task that must be addressed to live a healthy lifestyle. Dropping the guise of who you think you are and conquering your inner enemy in order to love yourself is a journey we all must walk alone, no matter what our identity is.Until recently I wasn\u2019t sure what \u201cinternalized homophobia\u201d meant. But I had been living with it my whole life.In my head I felt like I was always hiding in plain sight, living under the constant fear and paranoia that someone would think that I was different or, worse, gay.When I came out as bisexual to my friends and family in my junior year of college, the love and support I received was unconditional. Some people even told me that they had always known. But here\u2019s the thing: I didn\u2019t always know.I didn\u2019t want to believe I was bisexual. When I came out, I was afraid of accepting myself and my place in the L.G.B.T. community. I still have trouble processing the 22 years of guilt and shame I have felt and the denial of who I am.And so will Ryan O\u2019Callaghan. Coming out of the closet is crucial and necessary to accepting who you are, but coming to terms with what has been hiding inside the closet is an even bigger step to take. Wrestling with suicidal thoughts is a huge personal struggle. Add that to rejecting your identity for over a decade and you have a recipe for self-sabotage.For myself, the fight didn\u2019t end at coming out as bisexual because I will to have to come out to people for the rest of my life. I am going to constantly wonder whether or not I will find a man or woman to accept and love me for who I am and even if they did, will I ever have children or grandchildren? Will I have to live in a community that doesn\u2019t accept queer people?One major source of comfort has been seeing people like Laverne Cox in Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d the fierce and inspiring queens of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d or the courageous and poised lesbian and gay athletes like the tennis legend Billie Jean King and Ryan O\u2019Callaghan.Every day I\u2019m able to find a silver lining. A sliver of hope and new way to find representation of the L.G.B.T. community that makes me feel like my identity is valid and like there is more than enough room for me in this world. It has taken me over a decade and it may take me the rest of my life but for right now I\u2019m just happy to be moving forward.Robert Rigo is a recent graduate from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Gypsy\u2019 and the Problem of Well-Made Bad TV", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byTV is suffering from competence. With the medium\u2019s cachet rising, money is pouring into productions, movie talent is lined up to jump ship and the product looks luminous on our giant wide-screen sets. Rarely does a bad show announce itself anymore with klutzy performances and cheap production.Instead, mediocre and even awful TV is often technically very good. This leaves you staring at a series like \u201cGypsy,\u201d the 10-episode psychosexual thriller that arrives on Netflix Friday, like a what\u2019s-wrong-with-this-picture puzzle. Something\u2019s missing, but the flaw doesn\u2019t leap out at you. The series is elegant, sensitively acted and directed \u2014 and an utter snooze.Boredom is the subject of \u201cGypsy\u201d as well as its substance. Jean (Naomi Watts), a Manhattan therapist, has the kind of lovely life it\u2019s almost mandatory for characters to rebel against: an easygoing lawyer husband, Michael (Billy Crudup); a spunky daughter, Dolly (Maren Heary); and a gorgeous house in Connecticut.She scratches her itch one morning by strolling to a cafe, ordering a chardonnay and flirting with the barista, Sidney (Sophie Cookson), whom Jean gives a false name: Diane. (It\u2019s the ultimate white-collar escape fantasy: Every time Starbucks puts the wrong name on your drink order, it could be a portal to a new identity.)Sidney, it turns out, is the ex-girlfriend of one of Jean\u2019s patients, Sam (Karl Glusman), whose sessions she uses to get information on her new love interest. Therein lies what plot interest \u201cGypsy\u201d has \u2014 whether Jean will slip up and be found out. This seems increasingly likely, as she drops inadvertent hints and practices some sloppy iPhone tradecraft.But none of this is especially novel as it plays out, nor as dangerous as the series seems to feel it is. Jean\u2019s walk on the wild side as Diane is like a married couple\u2019s spicy date night where they role play as strangers \u2014 something Jean and Michael do in one episode to break out of their rut.Ms. Watts \u2014 pulling double duty now on Showtime\u2019s \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d revival \u2014 does well with what she\u2019s given. Her delicacy of expression is perfect for the kind of psychological portrait \u201cGypsy\u201d ideally could be. When she gets an illicit jolt from seeing a text from \u201cS.\u201d pop up on her phone at the supermarket, you might feel it run up your own spine.But the scripts and hazy characterizations undermine her. We\u2019re told Sidney has an obsessive effect on her lovers, but her mystery is generic (has British accent, sings in band). The episodes are a slide show of sleek interiors and tastefully shadowed bars, the pacing logy without being suspenseful. Binge-watching it is like binge-drinking cough syrup.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canada Today: Seeking Friends on Climate and Our First Contest", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byAs I wrote this week, Canada is far from giving up on the United States when it comes to climate change despite President Trump\u2019s decision to pull the country out of the Paris accord.That is because many American states are on the same page as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He has been dispatching his cabinet ministers south, including Catherine McKenna, the environment minister, to try to make deals with American states on climate issues, effectively trying an end run around Mr. Trump.History suggests that making friends with states is a sound plan. Some of you may recall that during the 1970s, the major environmental problem facing some parts of Canada was acid rain. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, mainly from coal-fired electrical plants in the United States, were acidifying lakes and streams and killing fish.In a speech this week laying out Canada\u2019s foreign policy priorities, Chrystia Freeland, the foreign minister, complimented Washington for its global leadership over the last 70 years and wistfully suggested that that time has come to an end. But the government\u2019s effort to work with the states shows that Canada still has friends in the United States. They just aren\u2019t in Washington.Most recently, the regional transportation authority in Toronto gave up hope that Bombardier will deliver trains in time for the opening of a new crosstown light rail system and placed an order with one of its competitors. That dispute has been a bit of a bonanza for litigation lawyers, of course.The Tony Awards, Broadway\u2019s most sought after distinction, will be awarded on Sunday. After surveying some voters, Michael Paulson, The Times\u2019s theater reporter, concluded that \u201cCome From Away\u201d is in a very tight contest to be named best new musical. The Canadian show is about how Gander, Newfoundland, embraced stranded travelers after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Many Canadian cooks have longed for Trader Joe\u2019s to bring its Organic Jalape\u00f1o Limeade, Sriracha Baked Tofu and other house-brand groceries to Canada. Pirate \u2014 or as it later became, Irate \u2014 Joe\u2019s filled that void in Vancouver, British Columbia. But no longer.My colleague Dan Levin recently spoke with Mr. Brown about the book:Why did you write this book?The mission of the book is to take down the erroneous global image of Canada as the world\u2019s nice guys, largely because it\u2019s doing us a disservice. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to mature as a country without an honest conversation about indigenous genocide or that we had slavery and have anti-black racism. We\u2019re selling arms to Saudi Arabia that are killing people in Yemen, and we are still plunderers of our natural resources. All those truths we need to contend with are out of reach because we\u2019re so committed to this P.R. campaign, taught in schools as gospel truth, that we\u2019re peacekeepers.Why was the book, which contains a lot of rude and vulgar political content, \u201cpublished in America,\u201d as it states on the front cover?You couldn\u2019t really publish this book in Canada. There are a lot of funny people in Canada, but there\u2019s never really been a biting satirical book in this country. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s for lack of trying. Between libel and copyright laws and a fear of stirring the pot, we tend to do political humor that\u2019s very chummy.Canadians often say that Americans are ignorant about Canada and need to learn more about their northern neighbor. Is that a valid complaint?Why should Americans know any more than they do about Canada? It\u2019s projection. Canadians only want positive attention. We want Americans to regard us as what to aspire to, as America without guns or the vicious discourse. But we don\u2019t have enough of a vicious discourse, we have a very polite country and as a result, business, political and media elite are very interconnected. If we want Americans to care about us, the stuff that makes us interesting is the stuff that we don\u2019t want them to know about.And a little bit on the late side, here is the June edition of Watching, our film and television recommendation service, tailored for Netflix viewers in Canada.

{"Headline": "Five Big Tech Stocks Build Market Euphoria, and Jitters", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byFacebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google.In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes \u2014 Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain \u2014 as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies.But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded.\u201cThere is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. \u201cNo one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.\u201dDespite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks.Other markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election.The stock market, however, remains the main attraction.Late in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end.According to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion \u2014 a consequence of investors\u2019 buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value.As is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment.The push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership.Through these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks \u2014 an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented.It is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market.\u201cIn terms of magnitude, we have not seen this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist.In Mr. Paulsen\u2019s view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period.So when Facebook\u2019s net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon\u2019s sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice.\u201cYou have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cSo yes, you can see how valuations would get extended.\u201dStock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today\u2019s technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era.Still, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce?For example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year \u2014 with more than half that amount from Apple, the world\u2019s richest company.Of course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business.Amazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard.Still, it is not today\u2019s earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow\u2019s, the argument goes.Surprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it.Bill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Mr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google\u2019s cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered.\u201cI have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cYet that is how the market is pricing it.\u201dAnother well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position.While skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division.\u201cAmazon is more fully valued than when we bought it,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages.\u201dAs these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns.That is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures. For a manager not to match the share of an Apple or an Amazon in a benchmark would result in an actively managed fund trailing its index and its peers.And as investors pour billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds \u2014 a record $314 billion in the last year \u2014 no active manager can afford to lag the competition for too long.So be it a mutual fund, hedge fund, sovereign wealth fund or family office, the strategy has been consistent \u2014 put aside any fears, and stay invested.\u201cIt\u2019s like you are riding a missile that you know could explode at any moment beneath you,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo. He has warned in his reports that some of these stocks have entered a stage of mania. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have no choice but to be sucked into the trade.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Blame for Your Stomach Bug? Not Always the Last Thing You Ate", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byIt happens like a bolt out of the blue. One minute you\u2019re fine, and the next you begin to sweat as crippling cramps move wavelike through your belly. You vomit or have diarrhea, or both, fearing you won\u2019t live to see another day.And then it goes away. You\u2019re back to your old self, maybe after a day or two of binge-watching Netflix and chasing dry crackers with ginger ale.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates this scenario, known as an \u201cacute gastrointestinal event,\u201d happens to all of us at least once a year. The bouts, while extremely unpleasant, usually don\u2019t occasion a trip to the doctor or require any medication.But such events tend to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. While it\u2019s hard to know for sure, there are clues that might help you determine the source and reduce your risk in the future.\u201cPeople tend to blame the last thing they ate, but it\u2019s probably the thing before the last thing they ate,\u201d said Dr. Deborah Fisher, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine.Gross, perhaps, but with that baseline, the next time you get sick, you\u2019ll be better able to estimate when you might have eaten the offending meal. For example, if you throw up something and don\u2019t have diarrhea or roiling further down, it could be that what made you ill was something you ate within the last four to six hours. If you wake up in the middle of the night with cramps and diarrhea, it\u2019s more likely something you consumed a good 18 to 48 hours earlier, depending on the results of your corn test.Restaurant food tends to be riskier in general not only because more hands are involved in the preparation but also because the ingredients are ordered in bulk. \u201cA fast-food hamburger could have meat from a hundred different cows,\u201d said Dr. Fisher, and it takes only one with a pathogen to make you sick. \u201cThe eggs in your two-egg omelet were poured out of a carton so it could have come from 50 different chickens,\u201d she said.Similarly suspect are freshly made juices and smoothies which are extracted from pounds and pounds of produce. Just one speck of contaminated dirt in your detox drink could upend your gut. And think of all the hands that necessarily touched the produce from the time it was picked in the field to when it was chopped and crammed into the Vitamix.Let\u2019s not forget about germs on your own hands if you\u2019re not diligent about washing them with soap and water (hand sanitizers don\u2019t kill some of the bugs that make your stomach sick). Did you eat or otherwise put your fingers in your mouth after gripping the pole on the subway or after throwing a slobbery ball for your dog? Did you put your mobile phone down on the table at a coffee shop \u2014 or on top of the toilet-paper dispenser in a public restroom \u2014 and then put it up to your mouth to take a call? Germs that make it into your digestive tract don\u2019t always come from food.\u201cPeople are trying to eat so healthy these days, but a lot of those things are high in Fodmaps,\u201d said Dr. Scott Gabbard, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cYou could always eat a lot of salad, but on that certain day, that certain combination of fruits and vegetables in your salad was just high enough in Fodmaps that it overrode your system\u2019s capability to absorb those carbohydrates and you ended up with something almost like a purging.\u201d\u201cA side effect of the drug is that it causes swelling in the intestines so he would get these temporary, partial obstructions,\u201d Dr. Fisher said. \u201cHe would vomit and skip a meal and then the swelling would go down. It went on and on until we took him off that drug and now he\u2019s fine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He invited his neighbors to a barbecue.\u201cHowever, there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritized accordingly,\u201d the police said in a statement. \u201cThe other named man, Rachid Redouane, was not known.\u201dEven so, Prime Minister Theresa May found herself on the defensive on Monday, as rivals challenged her record on security after the third terrorist episode in three months.Mrs. May, who is leading her Conservative Party into a national election on Thursday, held the portfolio in charge of security for six years before replacing David Cameron as prime minister in July, and she oversaw a reduction in police forces, including armed officers, during that time.The Metropolitan Police released photographs on Monday of Mr. Butt, 27, and Mr. Redouane, 30.Mr. Redouane had claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, the police said, and also sometimes used a pseudonym, Rachid Elkhdar. The authorities are still trying to confirm the identity of the third attacker.In Barking, residents of the Elizabeth Fry Apartments on Kings Road said Mr. Butt had lived in the building with his wife and young children, including a newborn.\u201cHis wife just gave birth, the baby was 2 weeks old,\u201d said Nasser Ali, who lives in the building facing Mr. Butt\u2019s apartment.Another neighbor said he would see Mr. Butt coming and going from the apartment complex. \u201cI just saw him going in and out,\u201d said the neighbor, Shehzad Khurram. \u201cI saw him walking his kids.\u201dIt was the van that struck a chord with Ken Chigbo, one of Mr. Butt\u2019s neighbors in Barking.\u201cHe approached me about a week ago, making conversation, and found out I\u2019m moving home,\u201d Mr. Chigbo recalled in a phone interview on Sunday, before the police had officially identified Mr. Butt as one of the attackers. \u201cHe was just being polite. Then he said, \u2018Look, Ken, where did you get your van from? How much did you pay? Do they do it in automatic?\u2019 \u201dMr. Chigbo knew Mr. Butt only as Abs, the nickname everyone seemed to call him. He had recalled how \u201che would always be in a religious gown to his shins, with tracksuit bottoms and trainers underneath.\u201d But on Monday Mr. Chigbo identified Mr. Butt in a photograph released by police as the same man.The two men met barely a week after Mr. Chigbo moved into the complex three years ago. \u201cHe invited me and everyone to a barbecue in the block\u2019s shared garden green area a week ago,\u201d Mr. Chigbo said. \u201cHe\u2019s a neighbor. I trusted him, we got on.\u201dSarah Sekyejwe, who lives with her husband and children in the newly built row of houses next to the Elizabeth Fry Apartments, said Mr. Butt had moved to the street in 2014 and befriended the local children. \u201cMy daughter says he\u2019s the one who on Halloween would open the door and give them lots of sweets,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd in the summer he put out a table-tennis table and taught the kids how to play.\u201dMr. Chigbo said small groups of three or four \u201cMuslim guys\u201d used to regularly visit Mr. Butt\u2019s apartment. \u201cI found them quite intimidating, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were always in religious robes and wearing red and white checkered scarves wrapped around their heads.\u201dTwelve people were arrested in the investigation into the terror attack, and homes in East London were raided. But on Monday night, the police said that all those in custody had been \u201creleased without charge.\u201dAlthough there has been widespread praise for the professionalism and courage of the armed officers who shot and killed the assailants within eight minutes of being called Saturday night, the country\u2019s broader antiterrorism strategy was questioned.Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, when asked by a reporter if he would support calls for Mrs. May\u2019s resignation over the falling number of police officers, replied, \u201cIndeed, I would.\u201dStung by the criticism just days before a national election that will decide her political future, Mrs. May responded at a news conference. \u201cWe have protected counterterrorism policing budgets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also provided funding for an increase in the number of armed police officers.\u201dA focus on security would normally be expected to help the prospects of Mrs. May\u2019s Tories in the approaching election. But as the investigation builds, so does speculation of potential security lapses that could have been prevented, possibly along with Saturday night\u2019s attack.Late on Sunday, Mr. Corbyn criticized the decrease in the number of police officers since 2010. \u201cYou cannot protect the public on the cheap,\u201d he said.The total number of officers in England and Wales fell more than 19,500 from September 2010 to September 2016, according to the Home Office. Authorized firearms officers declined to 5,639 in March 2016 from 6,976 in March 2010.The government says, however, that the number of armed officers is to increase by more than 1,000 in the next two years, that additional specialist teams are being set up outside London and that there will be 41 additional armed response vehicles.Mr. Corbyn also accused the government of failing to publish a report, undertaken in early 2016, on foreign financing of extremist groups, for fear of upsetting foreign governments, although he himself is vulnerable on security issues.Also on Monday, Mrs. May came to the defense of Mayor Sadiq Khan of London, who has been accused of being soft on terrorism by President Trump. Mrs. May said that she was working closely with the mayor and that he was doing \u201ca good job,\u201d adding, in answer to persistent questioning by reporters, that it was \u201cwrong to say anything else.\u201dOn Monday night, Mr. Khan led a brief vigil for the victims at Potters Fields Park, near the River Thames.\u201cI want to send a clear message to the sick and evil extremists who commit these hideous crimes. We will defeat you,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cas a proud and patriotic Muslim I say this: You do not commit these acts in my name.\u201dRukmini Callimachi, David D.

{"Headline": "The Trump Administration Shakes \u2018House of Cards\u2019 Hard", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookIs the Trump administration a drama or a sitcom?Eventually, this will be for history to judge. But first, let\u2019s give television its shot.But the show\u2019s big picture feels like something from an alternative universe, and not just because the power partnership of Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), is like a conspiracy-fever version of the Clintons\u2019.\u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d based on a British series, is at heart a fantasy of competence and omnipotence. Frank pulls the levers of power as easily as he pushed poor Zoe Barnes in front of a subway train. He plays four-dimensional chess while his current analogue often seems to play Whac-a-Mole. He\u2019s cold and deliberative, not hotheaded and impetuous. He confides his plans in Shakespearean asides while President Trump spills to 31 million Twitter followers.Frank works hard to hide his acts of violence. In our world, a Montana politician body-slammed a reporter and was elected to Congress the next day. When a congressman from Frank\u2019s own party (Democratic, in this case) plans to go against him and place \u201ccountry over party,\u201d it may be the season\u2019s biggest laugh line.Beyond this, the idea that adults are still in charge, that the presidency is still beholden to a pretense of decorum, has been disrupted by the election of a TV star whose following depends partly on his going off script. \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d isn\u2019t less crazy than reality. But it assumes a greater baseline of normalcy in its larger world.But for now, you need to go back to earlier TV eras \u2014 and away from Washington story lines \u2014 to find the shows that most recall today\u2019s White House.This is not to say that the Trump White House is like the mob, so much as that \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d feels timely for how it portrays leadership in a dysfunctional, privately held family business.This is the management style of George Bluth Sr., who encourages jealousies and insecurities among his adult children, the better to manipulate them into a who-does-Daddy-love-best contest. (Sean, Kellyanne: This show gets you.)\u201cArrested Development\u201d began in 2003 as TV\u2019s best satire of an earlier presidency \u2014 it was, in part, a sly commentary on the Iraq War. In the fake-house episode, Gob Bluth (Will Arnett) unveils a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner, \u00e0 la George W. Bush, on the facade, just before it falls apart.All of which suggests that the definitive television show of the Trump years, whenever it arrives, might not be about politics. And it might be a comedy, even if we experience the real-life version very much as a drama.History repeats, they say. In this case, both times as farce.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Your Consideration: An Increasingly Lavish Emmy Campaign Season", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byOn a recent Sunday in the heart of Beverly Hills, Calif., the hordes were ready.About 300 people began circling waiters armed with tubes of Pringles and mini-croissants. Trays of finger sandwiches (peanut butter, honey and banana) were in ready supply. Attendees stood about 15 deep in lines as seven bartenders frantically handed out free booze.And it wasn\u2019t even noon.\u201cCan you believe this?\u201d said Nicole Leanne Nelson, an actress, holding a glass of red wine.The lavish spread was courtesy of Netflix, which was promoting its rookie drama \u201cStranger Things\u201d to a pool of invite-only guests it hoped \u2014 but did not know for sure \u2014 included Emmy voters.It was just one of about two dozen events that the company had thrown in a rented event space over five weeks, each trying to inspire potential voters to nominate Netflix\u2019s original content for the Emmy Awards.As the streaming services \u2014 Amazon held similar parties \u2014 battle with traditional cable and broadcast networks, Hollywood is witnessing Emmy campaigning on a scale that industry executives say they have never seen before. The once-staid season now finds studios approving generous budgets for billboards, mail promotions, parties and dinners with the express purpose of getting shows, actors and writers in front of would-be voters.\u201cI\u2019ll put a number on it \u2014 it\u2019s 10 times crazier,\u201d FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dAt a time when there is more television than ever \u2014 there will be more than 450 scripted shows broadcast this year \u2014 award jockeying, apparently, is the next logical step. Voting for nominations began last week. Nominees for the September ceremony will be announced next month.The Oscars may have some restrictions on what studios can do to influence would-be voters, but the Emmys hunt has turned into a Wild West of no-holds barred campaigning.\u201cFor Your Consideration\u201d advertisements have blanketed Los Angeles, appearing on billboards, bus shelters and posters. In a seven-block stretch of Melrose Avenue, there were outdoor ads for \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d (Netflix), \u201cSarah Silverman: A Speck of Dust\u201d (Netflix), \u201cTransparent\u201d (Amazon), \u201cThe Night Of\u201d (HBO), \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d (CBS) and \u201cSuperstore\u201d (NBC).\u201cI live in Studio City and drive all the way across town to our office, and I pass at least three \u2018Legion\u2019 billboards,\u201d said John Cameron, an executive producer for FX\u2019s \u201cLegion\u201d and \u201cFargo.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not even on the air anymore and they\u2019re up for that very reason: for Emmy voter memory reasons.\u201dMr. Cameron was an executive producer of the critical hit \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d and reflected on what it was like in the old days \u2014 that is, about six years ago.\u201cThey never used to bother to advertise television like that,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s completely analogous to an Oscars campaign.\u201dEach day for the past couple of months, thousands of Emmy voters have received mailed packages filled with elaborately designed boxes that contain DVDs for award contenders. The packages are a considerable expense \u2014 the more ostentatious, the more likely to stand out \u2014 and are mailed to a large number of potential voters. Executives estimate that the packages cost some networks more than $1 million, and for a select few, over $2 million.\u201cIt is overwhelming the amount of content that comes to me every single day,\u201d said Warren Littlefield, the head of NBC\u2019s entertainment division in the 1990s, and an executive producer for several Emmy contenders, including \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d\u201cI have a kitchen table that no one can sit at and no one can have a meal at it,\u201d Mr. Littlefield said. \u201cIt\u2019s that filled with DVDs.\u201dIndustry executives concede that the majority of those discs will most likely not be watched, and that there is something anachronistic about sending DVDs in the streaming era. But if one network sends out big packages, others feel compelled to join in.Emmy campaigning has escalated this year in part because of the swelling number of TV shows and the large group of voters that executives are trying to reach. The Television Academy voting pool has more than 22,000 people, dwarfing the roughly 7,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that vote for the Oscars.\u201cThere are more voting members of the TV academy than voted for mayor of Los Angeles,\u201d joked Tony Angellotti, a longtime Oscars awards strategist who is working with the cable network Starz this year.There are beneficiaries of all this campaigning, of course.Emmy-related advertising is up about 20 percent at The Hollywood Reporter this year, said Lynne Segall, the trade publication\u2019s executive vice president and publisher. She also noted that television\u2019s awards season was inherently frenetic because it lasts only from April to June, which is shorter than the period for movie awards.\u201cYou have a very short window to really make a mark,\u201d she said.But there was no greater symbol of Emmy campaign excess than Netflix\u2019s event space, a source of some bitterness among the streaming service\u2019s competitors.For years, the Television Academy has facilitated \u201cFor Your Consideration\u201d events between April and June. A typical event includes a panel discussion with actors and writers discussing the past season of a contending TV show. That\u2019s usually followed by a party with an open bar and dinner. (Several executives noted that they were certain many Academy members were showing up for little more than a free meal.)The issue has long been one of scarcity: the academy organizes a calendar that allows one network a day to stage an event in Los Angeles, and occasionally another event in New York on the same night. Over that two-month stretch, a studio is unlikely to get more than three or four slots in which to showcase its candidates.Netflix had a few slots on the sanctioned calendar but elected to rent out a 24,000-square-foot multilevel space in Beverly Hills to stage competing events, cheekily calling them FYSee. Rivals grumbled that the events, which ended once voting started last week, violated a tacit agreement among networks to mostly stick with the official calendar. For instance, when FX convened its sanctioned event for \u201cThe Americans\u201d in Hollywood on June 1, Netflix staged an unofficial event across town for \u201cMaster of None.\u201d\u201cWe consider Netflix a home for the industry\u2019s most compelling storytellers and are responsible for finding equally innovative ways to present their stories,\u201d said Cindy Holland, Netflix\u2019s vice president of original content.In addition to a stage and seating area for panels, the Netflix space featured lavish exhibits dedicated to its shows.The \u201cStranger Things\u201d area was accessible through a wall of mist, where the show\u2019s logo was projected. A room for \u201cThe Crown\u201d had formal dinnerware (crystal goblets, china) hanging from the ceiling. Even the canceled series \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d which was set in the 1970s, had a display involving 50 disco balls and a dozen boomboxes.Netflix was missing just one thing: the definitive list of Emmy voters, controlled solely by the Television Academy. The company sent out invites by stringing together various lists from several guilds, hoping that there would be enough overlap.Ms. Nelson, the actress roaming the space, said that while she was a member of the Screen Actors Guild she was not, in fact, an Emmys voter.The question in the industry is whether the Netflix event space \u2014 and Amazon\u2019s smaller events \u2014 would spur copycats.\u201cI kind of doubt that there\u2019s an Emmy voter who is going to vote for a show because you bought them a cheeseburger,\u201d said Mr. Landgraf, the FX executive. \u201cI have more faith in the electorate than that. I think they\u2019ll vote for the shows that they think are the best.\u201dThis year, at least, the industry is not leaving that to chance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For a City Family, a Lakeside Second Home Beckons", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byThe HuntFive years ago, when their first child was a baby, Daniel and Megan Parker rented a two-bedroom on the Upper West Side. Now they have three children.The Parkers, who love the outdoors, were drawn to the idea of a second home in the country, which would offset the strictly urban upbringing of Lucas, now 6; Annie, 4; and Clara, almost 2.A trip to the Berkshires two summers ago was the catalyst. Having exhausted family activities over a long weekend, they drove back early to the city.Their map showed a large body of water in western Connecticut called Candlewood Lake. It was the first they had heard of it, so they decided to take a look.They checked Zillow and picked a house for sale so they could navigate there. \u201cWe just wanted an address that looked like it was close to the lake,\u201d said Ms. Parker, 34. They drove by. The house, in New Milford, looked beautiful and new.Their first thought was to rent a house for the following summer. So they contacted agents in the area, including Denise Kavovit, a saleswoman at Advanced Waterfront in Newtown, Conn.\u201cThe properties around the lake are unique,\u201d Ms. Kavovit said. \u201cEvery property is so different from every other.\u201dBut the Parkers did not find a house they liked enough. Besides, if they rented, \u201cat the end of the summer, all we would have are memories,\u201d said Mr. Parker, 37, who works in commercial real estate. \u201cI would rather own something if we are going to part with that much money.\u201dThe idea of buying near Candlewood Lake grew on them. The drive from Manhattan, 70 to 90 minutes, had little traffic, except occasionally on Friday evenings.They thought ahead to their children\u2019s teenage years, when they would want to spend weekends with city friends rather than at a remote house. A nearby lake, with water activities, would take care of that.The Parkers researched Candlewood Lake, which is surrounded by five towns that include more than 50 individual communities. Their aim was a house from $500,000 to $700,000 in a community with activities for the kids. The layout had to allow for extended-family gatherings \u2014 a tough task in their Manhattan apartment.The first house they saw, listed for $675,000, was on Great Plain Road in Danbury, with a steep grade to the lake that felt more like \u201cmountain goat living\u201d than lakefront living, Mr. Parker said.\u201cWith small children you kind of tense up when they run down to the lake on steep stairs,\u201d he said. And this one was not part of a homeowners\u2019 association with amenities. It ended up selling for $610,000.Safety was also an issue at a house on Candlewood Lake Road South in New Milford, for $700,000. The lake was across the road, which had a 40 mile-an-hour speed limit. The Parkers passed it by. That one sold for $662,500.Both houses had three bedrooms and seemed too small for family gatherings.Though some houses flew off the market, others seemed to be priced high. The Parkers watched prices drop over many months. \u201cGenerally, they didn\u2019t seem to be in a rush to sell,\u201d Mr. Parker said.They had never visited the very first house, the one they had used for navigation purposes. It was originally listed for $799,000, but had since dropped to $699,000. Annual taxes were around $9,000.The Parkers loved the layout, with four bedrooms and four bathrooms, plus a large basement. It was new, which they believed would mean few maintenance issues. It was not directly on the water, and its homeowners\u2019 association had plenty of family-friendly activities.The Parkers bought the house last fall for $653,000. \u201cWe arrive in about the same time it takes us to binge on two episodes of a Netflix show,\u201d Mr. Parker said.And their city children will have outside-the-city experiences, Ms. Parker said \u2014 including learning to drive.On a rainy, windy night a few weeks after the family\u2019s arrival, a tree fell on the house. Branches shattered the children\u2019s bedroom window. \u201cIt was pretty traumatic,\u201d Mr. Parker said. Nobody was injured and the house was repaired.Meanwhile, homeownership \u2014 a first for the Parkers \u2014 feels like \u201can endless supply of small projects that cost $250 to $750 at a time,\u201d he said.The Parkers spend most weekends at the house. Even now, though, there are school activities in the city on some weekends.\u201cOver time, there will be a few growing pains,\u201d said Ms. Parker, referring to the family\u2019s whereabouts on days off. \u201cRight now it\u2019s our shiny new toy and we want to be there as much as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix Lets Viewers Pick the Plot", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byAttention, kids: Netflix just put you in charge.Netflix on Tuesday released a new episode on its streaming service of the animated show \u201cThe Adventures of Puss in Boots\u201d with an interactive twist. About a half-dozen times during the episode, viewers \u2014 most likely children \u2014 will be prompted to choose which plot point the show should follow. Each decision will send the story in a different direction.At one point, for example, viewers must decide whether Puss will confront nice bears or angry bears. On a touch screen, a press of the finger will do the work; on a television, a remote control will be required.The first interactive episode, called \u201cPuss in Book,\u201d will last 18 to 39 minutes (depending on which path viewers go down), with viewers being asked to make a decision every two to four minutes.\u201cThey are used to pressing play on the remote, setting it down and then just leaning back on the couch and letting Netflix roll,\u201d Carla Engelbrecht Fisher, the director of product innovation at Netflix, said of viewers. \u201cIn this case, we actually need them to hold on to the remote. We don\u2019t want it lost in the couch cushions. We need you to lean forward a little bit to engage with the choices.\u201dThe introduction of such a feature \u2014 which Netflix will roll out for another children\u2019s series next month, and a third next year \u2014 is, at this point, an experiment. But if it\u2019s a hit with subscribers, and if Netflix executives are impressed with the results, the implications for the TV industry could be significant.Although the streaming service has not made plans to feature this kind of interactive viewing in, say, a future season of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the potential is there for it to eventually expand beyond children\u2019s programming.The interactive initiative comes as Netflix is locked in a battle with the rival streaming services Amazon and Hulu over creating and acquiring as much children\u2019s programming as possible.Last year, Nielsen released a study that said that children 2 to 11 were watching two fewer hours of live television a day but that the amount of content they watched on digital platforms had spiked.Netflix said its interactive project was more than two years in the making. As the creative team behind \u201cPuss in Boots\u201d developed plot points, Netflix needed time to improve its technology. Netflix will release another interactive episode next month involving its \u201cBuddy Thunderstruck\u201d series. Next year will bring an interactive episode of \u201cStretch Armstrong.\u201dIt is an open question whether other streaming services will follow with similar interactive programming.Hulu has a virtual reality project in development tailored for adults for its VR app. The series, called \u201cDoor No. 1\u201d is a choose-your-own-adventure show that revolves around a 10-year high school class reunion, though it has not been picked up to series yet. There are no interactive children\u2019s programs in the works.Amazon declined to comment on any plans.Ms. Fisher said Netflix did not consult with educational experts before kicking off this experiment.Nevertheless, some experts applauded the effort on Tuesday. \u201cThey guessed right,\u201d said John Black, the director of the cognitive science program at the Teachers College at Columbia University.\u201cHaving kids think about different ways in how stories could play out will lead some to think more deeply about the stories and to comprehend them more deeply,\u201d he said.There are others, however, who have concerns about the sheer volume of children\u2019s programming developed by streaming services.\u201cA lot of this is unexplored territory,\u201d said Melissa Henson, program director for the Parents Television Council. \u201cThe potential pitfall is video streaming services aren\u2019t subject to the educational video requirements put on traditional broadcasters.\u201dWhether or not this kind of interactivity could be used with expensive dramas remains to be seen. TV\u2019s top dramatic shows can cost $7 million to $10 million an episode to produce. Adding shooting time, and various plot lines that only a percentage of viewers may see, would make costs rise further.At this point, Netflix is in wait-and-see mode.\u201cAs you can imagine, with two years of development, I\u2019m really excited to see how our members engage with this,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. \u201cFrom there, we\u2019ve built this tool set for our creators, and it\u2019s ultimately about finding creators who want to tell complex stories in this way. We\u2019ll see where things go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech, Fed, Trump: So Many Reasons to Worry About the Market", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseInvestors have seemingly been oblivious to claims of Russian interference in the election, the firing of a director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the appointment of a special prosecutor. As the second quarter ends this week, 2017 has so far been a banner year, with major indexes hitting records.But as the bull market rolls on, some see storm clouds on the horizon. \u201cValuations are high and it\u2019s one of the longest and largest bull markets in history,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cBull markets don\u2019t last forever. So the question is, when will the music stop?\u201dInvestors \u201care on a knife\u2019s edge,\u201d said Michael J. Kelly, global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments. With many still scarred by the financial crisis, \u201cthey see a potential disaster around every corner.\u201dThis month the so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which have led the market\u2019s rally \u2014 faced a sudden downdraft, which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times to come. Those jitters were on display Thursday, as tech shares led a sell-off that put a dent in the major indexes.And then there\u2019s Mr. Trump himself, whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential to rattle markets.So I asked some prominent investors and market analysts whether they were pulling back from stocks, and how they viewed these latest developments.There\u2019s no question that these market darlings, which together have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the market\u2019s gains, are expensive, and getting more so. Price-to-earnings ratios range from 38 (Facebook) to 184 (Amazon). Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes. They show up not only in so-called growth funds, but also in value and low-volatility funds. Should they embark on a sustained plunge, a bear market could quickly follow.The tremor in June was \u201ca warning shot across the bow,\u201d said Bill Smead, the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. The Faang stocks \u201care showing all the classic signs of being overcooked,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat magazine hasn\u2019t had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover? There\u2019s no question this can end very badly. But the market can stay irrational for a very long time. My sense is that there\u2019s one big blowout rally left in these stocks.\u201dMr. Stack noted that the Faang stocks had brief sell-offs last June and October, only to rebound. Still, he said, \u201cthe Faang stocks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due to the amount of money that flowed into them and the high expectations that have driven them higher.\u201dBut like Mr. Smead, he doesn\u2019t expect that to be imminent. \u201cWe\u2019re not buying them, but we\u2019re not necessarily saying sell,\u201d Mr. Stack said. He urged investors to rebalance portfolios that have become too heavily weighted in these stocks.Everyone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market, but that may still be years away.\u201cHistorically it\u2019s difficult to find a bear market that wasn\u2019t triggered to some extent by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as they\u2019re going to will have a significant impact. What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced to raise rates faster than everyone anticipates. The Fed has prepared investors for one more rate hike this year. That\u2019s where the potential surprise could come. If we see two or three by year\u2019s end, we\u2019re going to see definite headwinds and maybe a market top of some significance.\u201dMr. Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room to maneuver before stocks start to be affected. \u201cWe just had a once-in-70-year crisis that left very long scars. Businesses basically didn\u2019t invest for eight years. In tightening, the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate. But we\u2019re just getting to the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and we\u2019re seeing more normal economic activity.\u201dMr. Kelly said bull markets typically last another three to four years after such a point in the economic cycle, and can even go another eight or nine. \u201cBull markets die from excess, not old age,\u201d he said.Mr. Smead agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re getting closer to normal rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be difficult for the stock market when it happens. People will be less willing to be adventurous. But that\u2019s still years away.\u201dOver at InvesTech Research, \u201cwe\u2019re still quite bullish,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe\u2019re not increasing cash reserves. We are rebalancing towards more defensive and out-of-favor sectors, like consumer staples and health care.\u201d\u201cThe risks don\u2019t lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cFor political mayhem to upset the economic apple cart, it has to irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level. So far we don\u2019t see that happening. Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16-year highs, and C.E.O. confidence in April was the highest since 2004.\u201dNor have investors given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver business-friendly corporate tax reform and a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code, despite the president\u2019s troubles.At the same time, \u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t be looking to the market for vindication,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a Trump rally. He\u2019s basically riding on the Obama years. \u201cHis bottom line: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to politics, and that\u2019s been a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Goes All In on Drama", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byAt the outset of the prison hostage situation that occupies Season 5 of Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d Gloria Mendoza (Selenis Leyva) implores her fellow inmates to stand down. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody\u2019s dead. We can still pull back.\u201dThis feels, in a way, like the series talking to itself. If you commit to this story, it\u2019s saying, if you see this situation through to its logical conclusion, things will be done that can\u2019t be undone, and this will be a different show than it began as. Do you really want to do this?Yes, this audacious if sometimes out-of-control season answers. \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d really wants to do this.The uprising was set in motion at the end of Season 4, when a guard killed Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) during a riot at Litchfield, a women\u2019s prison in upstate New York. In the chaos afterward, Thomas Humphrey (Michael Torpey), a sadistic prison guard, loses control of a gun that he sneaked into the prison. Dayanara Diaz (Dascha Polanco) finds herself pointing it at him.Season 5, which arrives on Friday, picks up there. The situation becomes a hostage siege in the way that many crimes happen: an opportunity, a heated decision in the moment. Just as Dayanara, a soft-spoken amateur cartoonist, has suddenly become an armed rebel, \u201cOrange,\u201d an acerbic comedy-drama, is instantly pushed hard to the drama end of the spectrum.The siege at Litchfield takes up the whole season, spanning only a few days, and it has a concentrating effect on the show, for good and bad. It immediately focuses the plot of this sprawling series, which often needs half a season to build momentum.But the brutality this time makes the tonal issues more pronounced. \u201cOrange\u201d has always juxtaposed comedy and darkness, but the moral lines \u2014 what you expect to be horrified by or to laugh at \u2014 are tougher to read now. There\u2019s abuse of captive guards and other inmates, even mutilation. One prisoner is bought and sold as a slave; in one late stretch, the series essentially becomes a horror movie. The mash-up of tones \u2014 satire, heartbreak, terror, whimsy \u2014 is daring, but it doesn\u2019t always work.The premise is bracing, though: What would these characters do with freedom, however brief? Some turn vicious; others build a peaceful barter economy based on Snickers and Cheetos. As Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like a party, except terrifying!\u201dThe biggest change comes to Poussey\u2019s best friend, Taystee Jefferson (Danielle Brooks), who becomes the inmates\u2019 negotiator. It\u2019s a standout turn for Ms. Brooks, as her character wills herself to rise to the job.\u201cOrange\u201d has always been a show about society building in a confined space. It\u2019s a Russian novel of a story, with dozens of characters \u2014 I suggest watching with IMDB.com open. Players come and go; formerly major figures, like Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), recede. With its fiefs and racial and ethnic subcultures, Litchfield has an expansive geography as much as Westeros in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dThis season, to extend that analogy, finds those kingdoms uniting \u2014 sort of, not entirely \u2014 against their own White Walkers, the perpetrators of the dysfunctional Litchfield system. There\u2019s no magic here, though; whether they say so or not, everyone seems aware that prison sieges don\u2019t end well.That knowledge invests the season with purpose.

You might say Ms. Fader struck a nerve. \u201cIf you\u2019re a human being living in 2017 and you\u2019re not anxious,\u201d she said on the telephone, \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong with you.\u201dWhile to epidemiologists both disorders are medical conditions, anxiety is starting to seem like a sociological condition, too: a shared cultural experience that feeds on alarmist CNN graphics and metastasizes through social media. As depression was to the 1990s \u2014 summoned forth by Kurt Cobain, \u201cListening to Prozac,\u201d Seattle fog and Temple of the Dog dirges on MTV, viewed from under a flannel blanket \u2014 so it seems we have entered a new Age of Anxiety. Monitoring our heart rates. Swiping ceaselessly at our iPhones. Filling meditation studios in an effort to calm our racing thoughts.But the Cube was fundamentally a cerebral, calm pursuit, perfect for the latchkey children of the 1980s to while away their lonely, Xbox-free hours. The fidget spinner is nothing but nervous energy rendered in plastic and steel, a perfect metaphor for the overscheduled, overstimulated children of today as they search for a way to unplug between jujitsu lessons, clarinet practice and Advanced Placement tutoring.For \u201cOn Edge,\u201d Ms. Petersen, a longtime reporter for The Wall Street Journal, traveled back to her alma mater, the University of Michigan, to talk to students about stress. One student, who has A.D.H.D., anxiety and depression, said the pressure began building in middle school when she realized she had to be at the top of her class to get into high school honors classes, which she needed to get into Advanced Placement classes, which she needed to get into college.\u201cIn sixth grade,\u201d she said, \u201ckids were freaking out.\u201dThis was not the stereotypical experience of Generation X.Sexual hedonism no longer offers escape; it\u2019s now filtered through the stress of Tinder. \u201cIf someone rejects you, there\u2019s no, \u2018Well, maybe there just wasn\u2019t chemistry \u2026,\u2019\u201d Jacob Geers, a 22-year-old in New York who works in digital sales, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re afraid that through the app you\u2019ll finally look into the mirror and realize that you\u2019re butt ugly,\u201d he added.If anxiety is the melody of the moment, President Trump is a fitting maestro. Unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, a low-key ironist from the mellow shores of Oahu, the incumbent is a fast-talking agitator from New York, a city of 8.5 million people and, seemingly, three million shrinks.\u201cIn addition to the normal chaos of being a human being, there is what almost feels like weaponized uncertainty thrown at us on a daily basis,\u201d said Kat Kinsman, the \u201cHi, Anxiety\u201d author. \u201cIt\u2019s coming so quickly and messily, some of it straight from the president\u2019s own fingers.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Trump is the first politician in world history whose preferred mode of communication is the 3 a.m. tweet \u2014 evidence of a sleepless body, a restless mind, a worrier.Some have suggested Twitter is a sort of crowdsourced poetry, but how many millions of miles is it from Auden: a cacophony of voices, endlessly shouting over each other, splintering what\u2019s left of a \u201cnational discussion\u201d into millions of tiny shards.The political mess has been \u201ca topic of conversation and a source of anxiety in nearly every clinical case that I have worked with since the presidential election,\u201d said Robert Duff, a psychologist in California. He wrote a 2014 book, \u201cHardcore Self-Help,\u201d whose subtitle proposes to conquer anxiety in the coarse language that has also defined a generation.And television was, as Marshall McLuhan famously wrote, a cool medium. Our devices are literally hot, warming our laps and our palms.\u201cIn our always-on culture, checking your phone is the last thing you do before you go to sleep, and the first thing you do if you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cJust today, I got an alert on my phone about the collapsing Arctic ice shelf. That\u2019s scary as hell.\u201dAnd let\u2019s remember that we survived previous heydays of anxiety without a 24-hour digital support system. Weren\u2019t the Woody Allen \u201970s the height of neurosis, with their five-days-a-week analysis sessions and encounter groups? What about the 1950s, with their duck-and-cover songs and backyard bomb shelters?That era \u201cwas the high-water mark of Freudian psychoanalysis, and any symptom or personality trait was attributed to an anxiety neurosis,\u201d said Peter D. Kramer, the Brown University psychiatrist who wrote the landmark 1990s best-seller, \u201cListening to Prozac.\u201d \u201cAnd then there were substantial social spurs to anxiety: the World Wars, the atom bomb. If you weren\u2019t anxious, you were scarcely normal.\u201dScott Stossel, editor of The Atlantic, whose \u201cMy Age of Anxiety\u201d helped kick off the anxiety memoir boom three years ago, urged people to pause, not for deep cleansing breaths, but for historical perspective.\u201cEvery generation, going back to Periclean Greece, to second century Rome, to the Enlightenment, to the Georgians and to the Victorians, believes itself to be the most anxious age ever,\u201d Mr. Stossel said.That said, the Americans of 2017 can make a pretty strong case that they are gold medalists in the Anxiety Olympics.\u201cThere is widespread inequality of wealth and status, general confusion over gender roles and identities, and of course the fear, dormant for several decades, that ICBMs will rain nuclear fire on American cities,\u201d Mr. Stossel said. \u201cThe silver lining for those with nervous disorders is that we can welcome our previously non-neurotic fellow citizens into the anxious fold.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Is a Debut Novel Like Lizzy Bennet?", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byAuthor\u2019s NoteAfter I completed my first novel (inspired by Austen), found an agent and sold it to a publisher, I enjoyed a brief moment of euphoria before realizing the hardest part still lay ahead. Writing a novel is all very well \u2014 to succeed, though, it must attract readers. But how?The debut novelist\u2019s struggle resembles nothing so much as a Regency-era husband hunt. Even \u201cdebut,\u201d with its mothball-y whiff of elitism, of white gloves and corsages, points to how novelists exist in a sphere at once privileged and perilous, like an Austen heroine.\u201cWife and mother\u201d was the only acceptable job for a woman of that class at that time, yet as Austen observed, there were not so many men of large fortune as there were pretty women to deserve them. The custom of primogeniture meant everything went to the oldest son, while it could take years for a younger son to establish himself in a profession to support a wife. The long war with France removed many suitable candidates, meaning a large pool of women competed for an even smaller group of eligible men.Doesn\u2019t this sound like publishing? Thousands of first novels come out every year, jockeying for media attention, bookshop space and public notice. They compete not only with each other, but also with everything else: from the \u201cOdyssey\u201d to last year\u2019s National Book Award winner \u2014 not to mention Netflix, social media, reality television and life itself.Every debut novelist is like Catherine Morland of \u201cNorthanger Abbey\u201d in her first outing to the Upper Rooms: crushed in a crowd, effectively invisible. Striving desperately for notice, affecting not to try at all, enduring the sting of humiliation at the public\u2019s indifference. In-house publicity help is a huge advantage, but ultimately like Catherine\u2019s having Mrs. Allen as her chaperone in Bath: essential to the success of the project, yet no guarantee of it.So how do some books rise above the fray? The assets a young lady of 1815 might deploy are strikingly like those of a debut novelist: beauty, money, connections and wit. And bringing up the rear as always, the tricky question of merit.Beauty is currency in every market, marriage or otherwise. It ought not to matter for novelists \u2014 it\u2019s their words we\u2019re interested in \u2014 but the existence of the author photo proves otherwise. The good-looking writer will always be welcome on television and popular at parties; her story will seem more piquant, her emotional depths deeper.There is money. A well-off family in Austen could provide a daughter with some capital, attracting the notice of a potential husband just the way a seven-figure advance assures its recipient of media attention. Newspapers and literary blogs will cover her; stores will feature her book on a front table, where the curious might pick it up, wondering what the fuss is about.Not everyone is endowed with beauty; few get huge advances. But connections also mean a lot \u2014 arguably even more. In Austen\u2019s time, it was crucial to be from a good family; one could not just come from nowhere, knowing no one (it\u2019s the aspect of her world that I think might be hardest for American readers to grasp). Yet it informs every one of her stories \u2014 just as it does for debut novelists. Someone with an M.F.A. from the University of Iowa or a job in the New York publishing field knows people who might invite her to be on a panel or write a piece for a publication, conferring crucial visibility and gravitas. More important, she can call on them for a blurb \u2014 a process I had never fully understood, vaguely supposing writers composed them as they lounged in some writers\u2019 Arcadia: herding sheep, strumming lyres, spontaneously praising one another\u2019s work. That was before I had to solicit my own. I called in favors, twisted arms, wrote fan letters and was greeted mostly with silence, sometimes with a polite rejection.Then there is wit. One of the charms of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d is that Darcy is drawn to Elizabeth\u2019s quicksilver mind as much as to her fine eyes. Wit is a specialized form of verbal intelligence that all novelists possess to some degree. But a select few can translate it to Twitter or to writing droll personal essays or charming useful and powerful people. Their wit lures in potential readers.But could it be that some debut novels are just really good \u2014 and will rise to the top on their own? I can\u2019t deny that this happens, but there\u2019s a reason I mention it last. Fanny Price is a good woman but she spends much of \u201cMansfield Park\u201d quivering in a corner, bullied or ignored by the book\u2019s more self-confident characters. Merit is not always obvious and generally requires some measure of beauty, money, connections or wit to bring it to light.The logic of the marriage plot usually assures a happy ending for the heroine, whatever difficulties she faces along the way. But \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d is a fairy tale; that\u2019s one reason we love it so. In the world of debut novelists, there are few Elizabeth Bennets.Kathleen A.

Directed by Michael Greif, \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d is also wholly original \u2014 not based on a film, a book or a song catalog \u2014 and is one of the first shows on Broadway to integrate social media into its depiction of communication and community.45 PhotosThe musical, with Stacey Mindich as its lead producer, was also budgeted tightly \u2014 it cost just $9.5 million to bring to Broadway, which is significantly less than most, and should speed its path to profitability.Rachel Bay Jones, who plays the title character\u2019s worried single mother, took the Tony as best featured actress in a musical. Gavin Creel of \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d won best featured actor.A whip-smart and unexpectedly riveting drama illuminating the largely unknown back story behind the 1993 Middle East peace accords won the Tony Award for best new play in a very competitive year.\u201cOslo\u201d defeated an aggressive competitor, \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d which campaigned vigorously for the attention of Tony voters, as well as two plays by Pulitzer Prize winners, \u201cSweat,\u201d by Lynn Nottage (the play won her a second Pulitzer), and \u201cIndecent,\u201d by Paula Vogel.All four contenders were by American writers, and marked Broadway debuts for the authors, delighting champions of American playwriting.In one of the evening\u2019s big surprises, Rebecca Taichman, who helped conceive of \u201cIndecent\u201d while she was a graduate student, won the Tony for best direction of a play. And, surprising no one, Laurie Metcalf, best known for her role in \u201cRoseanne,\u201d won her first Tony Award for her portrayal of a fiercely independent woman who had walked out on her family years earlier in \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2.\u201dBut setting aside his dramatic persona to demonstrate his showbiz chops, he affectionately mocked the most-admired new musicals on Broadway as he opened the awards.He adapted lyrics and set pieces from each of the four shows nominated as best musical. He wore a cast on his arm, much like the title character in \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d only to turn it into a knee brace, recognizing the injured lead actor in \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d He cradled an accordion, as did Josh Groban in \u201cThe Great Comet,\u201d and summoned a bizarre chorus line featuring the Rockettes and the cast of \u201cCome From Away.\u201dNone of the shows were particularly razzle-dazzle \u2014 in fact, he joked about the serious themes they explored \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop Mr. Spacey, who concluded with a tap dance number.He peppered the second half of the broadcast with impressions of Johnny Carson and Bill Clinton, aiming one of the few political barbs of the night at that former president\u2019s wife, Hillary Clinton.The most political moment of the evening, however, belonged to Stephen Colbert, who mocked President Trump as he introduced the award for best musical revival.\u201cIt\u2019s been a great year for revivals in general, especially that one they revived down in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Mr. Colbert said. He added: \u201cHuge production values, a couple problems: The main character is totally unbelievable, and the hair and makeup \u2014 yeesh. No, no. This D.C. production is supposed to have a four-year run, but reviews have not been kind. Could close early. We don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to thank all the Tony voters, many of whom I\u2019ve actually dated,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But over the past five years, publishers \u2014 especially those of the big console games that dominate E3 \u2014 have used the internet to keep their games fresh with new content, finding new ways of keeping players engaged with the games and spending money on them through sales of virtual goods. Old games seem less old because they are regularly being updated with new things to do and see, giving them a shot of digital Botox.This reflects an important change in the game business toward providing a service that is constantly being enhanced, rather than selling discs wrapped in cellophane that mostly do not change after a customer purchases them.\u201cThe games industry has followed the same example investors have seen with Netflix,\u201d said Joost van Dreunen, chief executive at SuperData Research, a game research firm. \u201cEntertainment in general is undergoing this tremendous shift.\u201dFor an example, look no further than Grand Theft Auto V, the gritty action-adventure game from Rockstar Games, which first came out in September 2013, almost four years ago. Grand Theft Auto V was published so long ago that it was initially released on the last generation of console hardware from Sony and Microsoft, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (Versions followed for newer hardware in November 2014 and for PCs after that.)And yet, there was Grand Theft Auto on the best-selling games list as recently as April, when it ranked sixth in the United States by dollar sales, right up there with games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, according to NPD Group, the market research firm. More than 80 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V have been sold since it was released, according to Take-Two Interactive Software, the publisher that owns Rockstar Games.The constant refurbishing has kept the community of Grand Theft Auto players, who typically have to wait four to five years between totally new versions of the game, paying attention. \u201cIt allows us to stay in touch with consumers between huge, tent-pole releases,\u201d said Strauss Zelnick, the chief executive of Take-Two, in a phone interview.In a significant milestone, Take-Two reported that for its last fiscal year, which ended March 31, slightly more than half of its revenue of $1.78 billion came from digital online sources.Of that digital revenue, a little over half came from people buying full, downloadable versions of games rather than physical copies, while the rest came from purchases of virtual currency and add-on digital content. Grand Theft Auto V has generated digital revenue of $1.6 billion over its life, Mr. van Dreunen of SuperData Research estimated.The funnel of digital revenue between major releases of games means the feast-or-famine cycle that used to characterize Take-Two\u2019s financial results \u2014 huge spikes in revenue after big Grand Theft Auto releases, followed by deep troughs \u2014 is no longer as severe.\u201cWe don\u2019t see as much of that now because every two or three months you\u2019re seeing new content being added to keep users engaged in the franchise universe,\u201d said Yoshio Osaki, president of IDG Consulting, a market research and consulting firm focused on the game industry.Digital revenue also carries higher profit margins than sales of physical game discs, because no manufacturing is involved and distribution costs are lower.Still, most copies of Take-Two\u2019s games, including Grand Theft Auto, are sold on discs in stores. To make a lot of digital revenue on games, Take-Two needs to sell as many physical copies as possible. That means building buzz at events like E3 with new products.\u201cPhysical distribution partners are terribly important for us,\u201d Mr. Zelnick said, \u201cand we expect that to continue for some time to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The men, considered among the brightest of a rising generation of studio executives, are currently the leaders of Sony Pictures Television, the company behind high-quality cable dramas like \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d major Netflix series like \u201cThe Crown\u201d and broadcast network comedies like \u201cThe Goldbergs.\u201dIn a blow to Sony, Mr. Erlicht, 48, and Mr. Van Amburg, 46, will start at Apple by the end of summer.

By hiring Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg, however, Apple has sent a clear message to Hollywood: We are finally serious about building an original video business. In a statement, Mr. Erlicht said that Apple wanted programming of \u201cunparalleled quality.\u201d Agents, writers, producers, stars \u2014 and competitors like HBO \u2014 will interpret those words as meaning that Apple is ready to spend.Working with their boss at the time, Steve Mosko, the two men were able to make inroads against more entrenched rivals by spotting the cable industry\u2019s move toward prestige dramas.

{"Headline": "U.K. to Decide on 21st Century Fox Deal for Sky by June 29", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cI will consider these reports in detail before coming to an initial view on whether or not I am minded to refer the merger\u201d for further investigation, she said.It is also likely to renew criticism that Rupert Murdoch holds too much sway over the British media, which he has denied.James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox and the chairman of Sky, said last month that he was confident the proposed transaction would be completed by the end of the year.Here\u2019s what you need to know about the British review, and how it may affect the Murdochs and plans for 21st Century Fox.In a separate but connected review, the regulator also determined if 21st Century Fox\u2019s management, particularly James Murdoch, were \u201cfit and proper\u201d to retain Sky\u2019s broadcasting licenses. Ofcom will publish details of its ruling by June 29.Now, 21st Century Fox is grappling with the aftermath of a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News. Regulators at Ofcom have met with lawyers who represented several of the accusers as well as one woman who made sexual harassment allegations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly. These meetings have raised questions about whether Ofcom would take into account the allegations, and the company\u2019s handling of them, in its judgment on whether the company passes the \u201cfit and proper\u201d test.21st Century Fox has said in a statement about the scandal that it had taken \u201cprompt and decisive action\u201d and had overhauled the leadership and management at Fox News.Analysts say there are four possible outcomes.Ofcom may give its unconditional backing to the takeover, or recommend that the government block the deal, both of which are considered unlikely. It could recommend that 21st Century Fox make concessions, such as guaranteeing the independence of Sky News, the British news organization owned by Sky. Or the authorities may call for a more in-depth review by Britain\u2019s competition authority, extending the outcome until the autumn.Rupert Murdoch has long coveted total ownership of Sky, whose assets include broadband services, a Pan-European satellite television network and popular original broadcasting with rights to sporting events like the English Premier League.He founded Sky in the early 1990s, helping to jump-start a satellite television revolution in Britain that quickly spread across Europe. The company is now one of the region\u2019s largest private broadcasters.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s previous plans to buy the stake in Sky that he did not already own were scuttled because of the hacking scandal, leading to a widespread reorganization that included splitting his media empire into a publishing business and an entertainment business.The possible takeover of Sky would cement Mr. Murdoch\u2019s position in the fast-changing media sphere, where Netflix and Amazon are offering consumers new forms of programming. Sky owns NowTV, a European rival to these streaming services, which could help 21st Century Fox to compete.When 21st Century Fox proposed in December to take over Sky, many opposition lawmakers \u2014 and even some from the governing Conservative Party \u2014 were vocally opposed to the deal.Opposition politicians have argued that the deal would limit the country\u2019s media offerings and that the Fox News scandal is evidence that the company does not pass Britain\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d test. 21st Century Fox denies both allegations.A decision \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 that 21st Century Fox executives are unfit to hold Sky\u2019s broadcasting license would be a major reputational blow for Mr. Murdoch and his sons.The proposed takeover is also central to 21st Century Fox\u2019s global ambition to become a crucial player in determining how people watch programming online. Consumers now watch videos and shows on their mobile devices, an area where Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company is lagging some of its rivals.Analysts say that Sky \u2014 which is highly profitable and has 22 million customers across Europe \u2014 can offer 21st Century Fox direct experience with consumers, both as a provider of television and broadband services and through NowTV, its streaming unit.And while 21st Century Fox is primarily interested in Sky\u2019s programming and internet assets, potential concessions required by the British officials to guarantee the independence of Sky News may also weaken Mr. Murdoch\u2019s hold over much of the British media.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018House of Cards\u2019 Season 5: Watched It All? Let\u2019s Discuss", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported byHouse of CardsThe republic is in crisis, the good guys are dead or disempowered, and the bad guys just keep winning. Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d has always distinguished itself among political thrillers by a worldview so cynical it\u2019s practically cartoonish, but the show\u2019s fifth season was perhaps its darkest yet. Now that we\u2019ve watched all 13 episodes, it\u2019s time to assess the damage.Season 4 ended just three weeks before an election that pitted Frank Underwood against a young, charming Republican upstart, Will Conway. At the time, it seemed likely that the contest would be resolved in just a few more episodes, but when considering that real American presidential campaigns stretch across two years and rarely feel settled, even after a winner is determined, it\u2019s hard to begrudge \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d for devoting nearly two seasons to a single election. After three episodes of Frank\u2019s manipulations and Will\u2019s publicity stunts, culminating in a 24-hour Skype chat that gives the Underwood camp an opportunity to cast aspersions on Conway\u2019s war-hero reputation, America finally votes in Episode 4.Voter turnout hits record lows and Will\u2019s victory seems inevitable. Frank even goes so far as to call his opponent and concede \u2014 but, of course, he isn\u2019t actually surrendering. He simply fabricates a terror plot targeting voting centers, strong arms a few swing-state governors into shutting down the polls and watches as the entire election grinds to a halt. Nine weeks later, Ohio and Pennsylvania still haven\u2019t certified their results and neither candidate has enough electoral votes to win.In one of the season\u2019s most convincing twists, Will unravels as he watches the presidency slip out of reach. He turns out to be a fragile character, and it\u2019s that weakness more than Frank\u2019s scheming that undoes him. When Frank invites himself to an all-male billionaires\u2019 retreat in a vague effort to influence the nation\u2019s kingmakers, he lucks into a recording of Will, who\u2019s having a temper tantrum on an airplane because the pilots won\u2019t let him fly it. It\u2019s no \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, but it\u2019s enough to get Frank a second term.The Underwoods aren\u2019t out of trouble yet, though. Tom Hammerschmidt and his team at the Herald are getting closer and closer to connecting Frank with the murder of Zoe Barnes, way back in Season 2, and Rachel Posner\u2019s old flame Lisa Williams resurfaces and urges them to look into whether Doug Stamper killed her.But the biggest threat to Frank and Claire\u2019s reign is Congressman Alex Romero, a young fellow Democrat who gets sick of their manipulations and reopens an investigation that is bound to end with impeachment. This story line dominates the final third of the season, and resolves with a left turn that feels absurd even for \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Instead of fighting to stay in the Oval Office, Frank suddenly resigns. Vice President Claire, somehow unsullied by her husband\u2019s many scandals, is promoted to Leader of the Free World. Frank explains that he\u2019s been planning since the billionaires\u2019 camp-out to \u201cgive\u201d her the presidency while he tackles the private sector, where the real power lies. Plenty of things that happen between the retreat and the finale \u2014 like that time Frank pushes Cathy Durant down the stairs to keep her from testifying against him \u2014 suggest that he didn\u2019t plan as far in advance as he\u2019d like his wife to believe. Still, when she barks \u201cMy turn\u201d at the camera in the season\u2019s closing shot, it feels like yet another Underwood victory.\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d still delivers an addictive binge-viewing fix, but five seasons in, its weaknesses have never been more apparent. Because the Underwoods and practically everyone else in their world have no core beliefs or values, topical story lines about Russian interference in American democracy, about Syria and about the ISIS-like terrorist organization \u201cICO\u201d have no emotional impact. A show that was once shocking in its depiction of a federal government that wasn\u2019t just corrupt, but was bloodthirsty, has to keep upping the body count to maintain our attention because its bleak view of American politics no longer feels fresh.What makes the show worth watching now is the constantly evolving relationship between Frank and Claire. The contrast between Kevin Spacey\u2019s broad performance and Robin Wright\u2019s not-quite-naturalistic but controlled one mirrors the marriage. For all his misanthropy, Frank loves Claire. When an old lover dies, he shrugs it off because he\u2019s only ever had feelings for Claire. They both have affairs, but he insists on keeping his fling with a personal trainer purely sexual. And, although he initially sanctioned it, Claire\u2019s relationship with Tom Yates visibly grates on him.A Few More Thoughts on Season 5:\u2022 How did you feel about the way \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d resolved the election? Personally, I was hoping to see Congress give Will the White House and Claire the vice presidency. It would have forced Frank to start scheming as an outsider again, after two seasons on top.\u2022 We need to talk about Doug. Oh, how I wish he\u2019d been killed off in the finale instead of LeAnn. He\u2019s become an entirely predictable character. He does the Underwoods\u2019 bidding, takes enormous falls for Frank and has some immensely creepy relationships on the side. Could he resurface to haunt Claire? Sure, but I can\u2019t imagine the ensuing drama will be worth sitting through the sheer misery of this character\u2019s existence.\u2022 Who was your favorite new character this season? Sean Jeffries, the Herald reporter who quickly talks his way into a White House position, felt a bit underdeveloped. Alex Romero was more a plot device than a character. Thanks heavens for Jane Davis, a mysterious power player who\u2019s intelligent enough to disturb the Underwoods\u2019 domestic bliss. It certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that she\u2019s played by a poker-faced Patricia Clarkson.\u2022 This season, it struck me that \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2014 Netflix\u2019s first blockbuster original series \u2014 feels much more like a traditional TV drama than most newer shows released on streaming platforms. From \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d to \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMaster of None,\u201d the best streaming series tend to switch up their formats every once in a while, with stand-alone or flashback or bottle episodes that prevent binge-viewing fatigue. Part of the reason \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d can feel exhausting is that every episode has a similar structure.\u2022 Assuming it happens, will you stick around for \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d Season 6? If so, what do you hope to see now that there\u2019s a new President Underwood in town?Please share your thoughts in the comments.Advertisement"}

Now, five years into our marriage, I\u2019ve started doing this to him. But it feels wrong to me. Any advice?ANONYMOUSWhen we adopted our dog, we hired a trainer to come over to give us some pointers. She adamantly opposed the pup\u2019s frisking down the hall to excitedly greet us at the door. We knew we had the wrong trainer. Who wants a dog that ignores you? The same applies to your husband. Good partners are reasonably and dependably available on issues that count. Why else marry them?Scads of mail will flow in telling me that you have waited too long to change ingrained behavior. Nevertheless, I persist. On matters of great and trifling import to you, start with: \u201cHoney, I\u2019d love your opinion on this.\u201d And speak with him about your expectations. When you accidentally tell a story about Liza Minnelli, ask him to say: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to make of that.\u201d Even if he isn\u2019t, there\u2019s no call for ignoring you. That\u2019s just rude. (And I couldn\u2019t care less that his parents do it. You aren\u2019t married to them.)I just hung up the phone with my BFF, who told me (in response to my complaint that she blows off plans with me every time a guy asks her to hang out) that she thinks I resent her because she\u2019s better looking than I am. Honestly, this had never occurred to me, and I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s true. What would you do?LISAI am about to return to work after a six-month medical leave that included two hospitalizations and a long recovery. I have worked at the same company for decades. I knew isolation would be a problem for me. So before leaving, I asked several friends from work if we could get together for coffee as soon as I was up to it. They said yes, but none of them followed through. I can\u2019t help feeling bitter. They will all be happy to see me back at work, but I don\u2019t know how to relate to them anymore. Advice?LIZMany of us have made friends at work. And many more of us have convinced ourselves that we are great pals with colleagues because \u2026 well, we sit next to them for eight hours a day. (Actually, we are paid to. So, it\u2019s hard to know whether we are really friends until one of us leaves the office.)But I\u2019m not sure that explanation applies here. It sounds as if you never made an overture to your friends once you were sufficiently recovered for coffee dates. Rather than growing quietly furious at their neglect, it would have been more productive to simply make a call. How were they to know you were well enough? Yes, it is lovely when people dote. But these people have lives, too. And you were the one who wanted company, correct?I hosted a baby shower for my stepdaughter. Many guests traveled long distances to attend and brought elaborate gifts. That was three months ago. But still, not a single thank-you note has been mailed.

And like the many religious traditions it makes reference to, the show finds its way to the spiritual through music.The theme has changed every week since, waxing sacred or tongue-in-cheek or both. One week, it was Richard Cheese\u2019s lounge-lizard cover of Depeche Mode\u2019s \u201cPersonal Jesus\u201d; another, a Hebrew prayer; another, \u201c1-800 Suicide\u201d by Gravediggaz.The device is attention-getting, but it\u2019s more than a stunt. A good television soundtrack captures the voice of a series, and the voice of \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d is brainy, irreverent but sincerely spiritually questing. The showrunner, Damon Lindelof, and the music supervisor, Liza Richardson, give the sense of trying to answer unsolvable cosmic riddles by coming at them from every possible angle.\u201cMiami Vice\u201d was an early example of the prime-time series as jukebox \u2014 its soundtrack topped the Billboard chart in late 1985 and early 1986, and it helped build the show\u2019s cachet and mood of sexy menace.But a good soundtrack creates a world, with its own aesthetic and rules, as much as plot and cinematography do. \u201cMad Men,\u201d for instance, was notable for its astute period song choices. When the aging adman Don Draper puzzled over the Beatles\u2019 \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d \u2014 as if the sound of the new youth culture was like an alien transmission to him \u2014 it wasn\u2019t just scene-setting, it was character-defining.On the other hand, when the Season 2 episode \u201cMaidenform\u201d began with a montage of Betty, Joan and Peggy dressing to the Decemberists\u2019 2005 song \u201cThe Infanta,\u201d the music was fitting \u2014 its thundering drums and intimations of regal, powerful femininity \u2014 the anachronism (not the series\u2019s only one, but rare) was jarring.In the original \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d dreamy pop music captured the show\u2019s hallucinatory-sweet sensibility: absinthe bubble gum. David Lynch, with his composer, Angelo Badalamenti, wrote songs for the singer Julee Cruise. Mr. Lynch has been closing installments of the revival with ethereal performances from the likes of the Chromatics and Au Revoir Simone, as if to usher us from the show\u2019s underworld to our surface reality.This year\u2019s Emmys will be the first with an award for best music supervision. You could easily fill a mixtape of worthy nominees. \u201cAtlanta,\u201d the FX hip-hop comedy, has an appropriately sharp ear, but so does \u201cScandal,\u201d whose classic-soul playlist announces its love-roller-coaster sensibility, and \u201cThe Americans,\u201d the Cold War spy drama, which uses deep cuts from the \u201980s to give a different shading to a familiar era.\u201cBig Little Lies\u201d characterized its upper-class families partly through their children\u2019s precocious musical tastes; \u201cLegion\u201d created an unstuck-in-time mod soundscape; \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d drops incongruous pop anthems into its dystopia like pirate broadcasts from free territory.It will be hard for any few minutes of television to compete, though, with Episode 2 of this \u201cLeftovers\u201d season, in which Nora (Carrie Coon) and Erika (Regina King), mourning the loss of their children, take a cathartic jump on Erika\u2019s backyard trampoline. The scene is scored to \u201cProtect Ya Neck (The Jump Off)\u201d by the hip-hop luminaries Wu-Tang Clan. The two women tentatively step on the netting as the beat and the swaggering lyrics kick in. As they bounce in the twilight, the camera rotating around them in slow motion, they seem to break through some invisible barrier as Raekwon\u2019s verse starts: \u201cWaves is spinning, blades is spinning/Slay \u2019em in the eighth inning.\u201dIt\u2019s the opposite sort of choice you would expect to score this scene, and that dissonance makes it ideal. The scene turns grieving into Shaolin shadowboxing, a struggle in which you drop down to rise higher. In its fierce beauty, you can hear the voice of \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d: This series may not know if there\u2019s a lord above, but it is determined to make a joyful noise.A picture caption last Sunday with an article about television soundtracks misstated the surname an actor shown in a scene from \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d As the article correctly noted, she is Regina King, not Hall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: \u2018The End of Advertising\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "Supported byQ. and A.Andrew Essex believes that \u201cthe end of advertising as we know it\u201d is \u201csomewhere between five minutes and five years\u201d away. That\u2019s what this former chief executive of the influential creative agency Droga5 writes in \u201cThe End of Advertising: Why It Had to Die, and the Creative Resurrection to Come\u201d (Spiegel & Grau).\u201cLife is better without bad ads,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s simply irrefutable.\u201d Consumers have increasingly effective ways to avoid ads, and an entire generation has been raised with a different expectation of how \u2014 and how often \u2014 it will have its viewing, reading or listening interrupted. Yet brands still spend vast amounts of money in diverse ways to promote their products, and entire industries (like journalism) are struggling with how to replace traditional ad revenue. (In fact, in the past Essex has done consulting work for The New York Times Company.) These sea changes are the subject of Essex\u2019s highly opinionated treatise. Below, he talks about how this era of television has inspired him, the origin stories of aspirin and heroin, and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?I got the idea after spending a summer making compost. I had left my previous job after 10 years to recharge my batteries: driving kids to camp, making compost and trying to write a book. It just seemed that it was time to reflect on the state of advertising. It was around the time \u201cMad Men\u201d went off the air and ad blocking started to enter into the public discourse.What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?That history repeats itself. We had invented the \u201ccorrect way\u201d to advertise, then took a 50-year detour pursuing a model that, in retrospect, seems kind of insane. For the past 50 years, we\u2019ve essentially pursued a model called \u201ccommand and control,\u201d which is to interrupt people in the rudest possible way with something they didn\u2019t ask to see, which is most exemplified by interrupting a TV program at a moment of great interest to show you a 30-second toilet-paper spot.But that model of adjacency is irrelevant and increasingly superfluous in a world in which there is so much content. Years ago, brands were making the thing. Not the thing that interrupts the thing. The old model was General Electric Theater; the new model is \u201cThe Lego Movie,\u201d and that\u2019s the same thing \u2014 making things people want to see, and adding value to their lives, as opposed to making something they actively don\u2019t want to see.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I wanted to write a book about the untold story of the dual origin story of aspirin and heroin. The company Bayer is famous for inventing aspirin in 1898, which is arguably one of the world\u2019s most beloved brands, and for good reason. But I was surprised to learn that just two weeks earlier, the same three guys who gave the world aspirin also created Bayer\u2019s other big brand, heroin, which was marketed for about eight years as the world\u2019s best cough medicine. This is a true story, and that seemed to me a perfect metaphor for advertising\u2019s ongoing tension between authenticity and artifice. But all the protagonists are dead, and Bayer won\u2019t talk about it.It was originally a book about unintended consequences and origin stories. So that theme never really changed. But the news kept staying ahead of the book, which had the unintended consequence of making it even more relevant than I intended. Fake news came along, and that seemed relevant to this rapidly shifting role of advertising in the culture. Google and Safari added ad-blocking software. Advertisers found out that YouTube videos with racist and terrorist content were adjacent to prominent A-list advertisers, in a context that the advertisers didn\u2019t want.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read the book in less than 50 words.It\u2019s the only place where you can learn about the origins of heroin and Ivory soap and the future of the internet in one tight little 200-page package. And also, hardcover is the new black.This interview has been condensed and edited.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Grown-Up Muggles Should Read \u2018Harry Potter\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorI started reading the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series, which turns 20 today, in a dormitory in Hod HaSharon, Israel, alongside about two dozen other teenage muggles who had flown (by plane) from the United States. I\u2019d completely succumbed to Potter hysteria at a friend\u2019s urging even before I\u2019d read the books, so the night before I left, I hadn\u2019t hesitated to make room for the first four of them, all in hardback, by tossing out an extra pair of pants. Who needed pants? I wanted a good story.Time on that trip had the magical quality of a \u201cHarry Potter\u201d camping tent: It was bigger on the inside than the outside. The two months flew by, but each day seemed endless, with hours enough to form close friendships and fall in love for the first time. After each packed day, while my best friend performed late-night mitzvahs for the girl I pined for, I consoled myself with my own affair, throwing myself at each of the first four \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books in turn. Alone in the common room with Harry and Ron and Hermione, I was as happy as I\u2019ve ever been.This feeling of consuming a book while simultaneously being consumed was not itself new. I grew up as an under-the-covers, flashlight-holding binge-reader. What was new was the intensity of my obsession, and the feeling of pining for a book that hadn\u2019t been written yet. That trip was in 2001, when I was a junior in high school. I had to wait two long years for the next in J.K. Rowling\u2019s series. I began in the Barnes & Noble where I purchased it, continued as I was walking home, and finished about 8 hours later in my apartment.Being a \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan in the early- to mid-2000s mostly consisted of fantasizing about each new installment of the fantasy. I never stood in a midnight line for the books like many fellow fans because I knew a spell for time-traveling into the next day: going to sleep. In 2003, 2005 and 2007 \u2014 in Chicago, in Alaska and in Otisfield, Maine \u2014 I picked up my copy of the book the morning after it was released, then spent the entire day reading it in a couple long gulps.These memories might have something to do with why I \u2014 an arguably well-adjusted adult \u2014 recently cried as I reread the last book in the series, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\u201d The scene that got me came near the end, before the climax. Harry had just returned to the Room of Requirement to find an army of his peers \u2014 all the people we\u2019d gotten to know in the course of seven books and 20 years \u2014 prepared to risk their lives and help him. I had the feeling that I too was reuniting with old friends, yet there was more to my reaction than nostalgia. The reappearance of so many minor characters made me appreciate the scope of Ms. Rowling\u2019s achievement, the chiseled and fastidiously arranged stones which form the series\u2019s vast arc.But having matured as I waited for each installment of the book \u2014 I was 17 when I started the series in 2001, 23 when I finished it in 2007 \u2014 I saw how the books matured too. Not only did the series become darker, it became more interesting. Yes, \u201cHarry Potter\u201d is about the life of a young wizard and his friends. But it\u2019s also about the wish to be special \u2014 and the fear of being ordinary.Voldemort, the villain of the series, fears death (his minions are called \u201cDeath Eaters\u201d) because death is the great leveler, eating eminent wizards and poor muggles alike. (In the words of Hamlet, \u201cYour fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service \u2014 two dishes, but to one table.\u201d) By the end of the series, it\u2019s not just Harry who has to grow up and accept hard truths, but his nemesis.Like many readers, I was drawn to the books because they tapped into my fantasy of being special, but they teach us about the inescapability of the ordinary. Ultimately, though, I don\u2019t read J.K. Rowling \u2014 or M.T. Anderson, or Ursula K. Leguin \u2014 because of what their books have to tell me about life. I read them because these writers have mastered the ancient magic of storytelling, and because they remind me of what it\u2019s like to be young, living in a world that seems both simple and incomprehensible. Childhood taught us that wonder is our only true defense against the ordinary. We forget that at our peril.David Busis lives in Brooklyn. He is at work on his first young adult novel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lice Ladies of Brooklyn Go Corporate", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byAmong the leafy blocks of what is known as brownstone Brooklyn, two bright, cheery salons recently opened on quiet side streets. A curious passer-by might notice plaintive children in styling chairs, sucking on lollipops, while young women comb their hair. But the salons have no signage, and the parents watch the proceedings with brows furrowed. That\u2019s because their children are not getting haircuts. They are being deloused.Lice, as any parent knows, are common and a pain to treat. Parents must take time off from work to remove the children from school. Plans for summer camp can be upended, with some children sent home on the first day. For the six million to 12 million children who are infested with lice each year, the American Association of Pediatrics recommends over-the-counter shampoos that contain pediculicides (lice killers), followed by a careful comb-out, but do-it-yourself treatments don\u2019t always work.For over three decades, Orthodox Jewish women in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Borough Park, Midwood and Kensington have used a decidedly low-tech approach involving a fine-toothed metal comb, drugstore hair conditioner and plenty of paper towels, onto which they smear the nauseating results of their labors.Nit-picking has become a branded enterprise. In addition to the two newish salons serving Park Slope and environs, there are no less than eight delousing boutiques throughout New York City, in addition to dozens of mobile treatment companies. What was once a homey \u2014 if disgusting \u2014 therapeutic rite of passage is a multimillion-dollar industry, right alongside parent-baby music classes and tutoring centers.The godmother of nit pickers is probably Dalya Harel, 56, an Israeli-born mother of eight who became an expert after one of her daughters caught lice in 1985 after entering school. Ms. Harel combed it out with margarine (conditioner came later), and the word spread. \u201cI did it as a favor to friends,\u201d she said in the Park Slope branch of Lice Busters, \u201cand then the principal hired me to do their class, and the rest is history.\u201dBut running a home business was complicated. Anxious families would show up in the middle of the Passover Seder, after dialing her number and getting no answer. \u201cWe don\u2019t pick up the phone,\u201d she said, \u201cso they come because they know the location. So we invite them to sit at the table.\u201dThe business was so successful that she left her accounting job at Bank Leumi and in 2003 opened a combing salon beneath her home in Midwood, calling it Lice Busters. Last January she opened the outpost in Park Slope with her son Yoni Harel, 27, who brings to mind a Calvin Klein model by way of Tel Aviv. \u201cMost of the customers who come to me are from Park Slope,\u201d Ms. Harel said. \u201cSo it was like, \u2018I\u2019m coming to you.\u2019\u201dLice Busters employs about 20 technicians in Midwood and Park Slope. The cost for removal is $150 to $250, depending on the severity. It takes about an hour, with a free recheck one week later. Families are instructed to launder sheets and blankets and to bag unwashable stuffed animals. But children can return to school immediately, which means parents can go back to work.Before they found their Sterling Place storefront, the Harels considered a former restaurant on Seventh Avenue, opposite Public School 321 in Park Slope. But business owners complained to the landlord. A commercial space adjacent to a Gymboree in Gowanus also caused trouble. \u201cEveryone started screaming that we were going to bring lice to the gym,\u201d Ms. Harel said.The North Slope storefront, previously a Pilates studio, was a shidduch \u2014 a match. It is the only business on the block, except for administrative offices of a private school.With hardwood floors, baby blue walls and flat screens playing Netflix, the mood is like a day spa. Customers can buy brushes, liquid garlic (a preventive), and nit combs at the counter. The Harel family operates 11 salons in New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida and Israel; a 12th opens on the Upper West Side of Manhattan this summer. They have annual revenues of over $1 million from the Brooklyn salons, house calls and school checks. But last September alone, the Park Slope branch brought in six figures.\u201cAny time after a holiday we are booming,\u201d Ms. Harel said. \u201cLice come from love, from loving and hugging and only to the nicest, cleanest people.\u201d Camps also make for more traffic. \u201cSleepaway camps,\u201d her son said, \u201care the best for the business.\u201dAbout 20 blocks from Lice Busters is a competitor named Licenders, whose president and founder is Adie Horowitz. On a weekday evening, two adolescent sisters sat in styling chairs and told their technicians they caught it on vacation.If Lice Busters is the Old Navy of delousing, Licenders is the J. Crew. In a corner, preschool-size chairs were arranged around a table. On it sat a Licenders-branded coloring book with \u201cLeslie the Louse\u201d as the villain and \u201cAdie the Lice Diva\u201d as the heroine. A shelf up front displays an $84.95 \u201cessentials\u201d lice kit containing shampoo, oil repellent, combing solution and a comb, all branded with the Licenders logo, a green-feathered wing. (For the record, lice have no wings and cannot fly.)Ms. Horowitz, 59, now lives in New Jersey, but she knew Ms. Harel in the 1990s when both lived in Kensington. Ms. Harel said she treated Ms. Horowitz\u2019s children, instructing as she worked, and then Ms. Horowitz began offering lice treatment herself. Ms. Horowitz said she learned the comb-out method from a book at the Brooklyn Public Library\u2019s Central Branch.Whatever the origin story, Ms. Horowitz began combing from her home in 1997. In 2004, she acquired a competitor on the Upper East Side called Licenders, adopting its name. \u201cThe women I knew ended up doing it in their homes and doing it in their basement,\u201d Ms. Horowitz said. \u201cI wanted to get away from that and start a business.\u201dWhy the Orthodox have a niche business in lice removal is a matter of speculation: large families, an openness to home remedies, deep expertise on the 10 plagues. Abigail Rosenfeld, a Kensington lice remover, said the bugs are a chatzitzah, or barrier, to a woman\u2019s immersion in the mikvah, or ritual bath. \u201cIf an Orthodox woman has lice, it\u2019s like an ink mark on the hand,\u201d she said, \u201csomething that shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201dMs. Horowitz\u2019s Gowanus location opened in November, adding to Licenders salons in Manhattan; Port Washington, N.Y.; and Stamford, Conn. There are two pricing options: the \u201cone-hour treatment\u201d ($249), after which home maintenance is recommended, or the \u201cmaintenance-free plan\u201d ($145 for the first half-hour, and $70 for each additional half-hour). Adults and children over 4 are treated with a machine cleared by the Food and Drug Administration called the AirAll\u00e9, which resembles a vacuum cleaner and which Ms. Horowitz says dehydrates lice and nits.Because of increased referrals from doctors, Licenders and Lice Busters offer invoices with diagnosis and procedure codes (the AirAll\u00e9 is classified as a medical device), allowing some customers to get insurance reimbursement.Combing salons are popping up all over the country. Katie Shepherd, a lice expert in West Palm Beach, Fla., runs a nonprofit institute that offers lice-removal certification to people seeking to open salons. She said there were about 1,000 combing businesses in the United States last year, up from about 40 in 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s an unregulated business,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there is a movement to regulate them. People hang shingles who aren\u2019t trained and don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201dAround midafternoon on a recent weekday, Julia Sturm, a nonprofit arts and media professional in her 40s, strode cheerfully into Lice Busters. Her 9-year-old son had recently been treated for nits, which were discovered during a periodic check at school. She tried combing out at home but wanted to be sure it worked. It didn\u2019t. At a visit to Lice Busters, she learned that she and her son had nits, too. All were treated, and she was in for her recheck.As she reclined in a styling chair, Ms. Sturm was philosophical. \u201cI did a cost-benefit analysis,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you ever heard the expression, \u2018Throw money at a problem\u2019?\u2019 My husband and I are both working full time. It\u2019s all we can do to get through the whole day. So if I was going to add a lice treatment every night or every other night, I wouldn\u2019t have the bandwidth.\u201dThe only people unhappy with the combing salons may be the home-based lice ladies who now see a drop in calls. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a decline in the past year,\u201d Ms. Rosenfeld said. \u201cBut I made a wedding, I\u2019m making a bar mitzvah, I had grandchildren. I haven\u2019t been concentrating on the lice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The ruling came 10 years after Mr. Dassey was convicted of sexually assaulting and killing a 25-year-old photographer.In a 2-to-1 decision, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit said that it agreed with the ruling last August by William E. Duffin, a federal judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The judge had found that Mr. Dassey was coerced into a confession in which he admitted that he assisted his uncle, Steven Avery, in sexually assaulting and killing the photographer, Teresa Halbach. Mr. Dassey later recanted the confession.\u201cIn addition to failing to apply a totality of the circumstances analysis to the facts of this case, as required by the Supreme Court, the state court acted unreasonably when it determined that, given the totality of the circumstances, Dassey\u2019s confession was voluntary,\u201d Judge Ilana Rovner wrote for the majority in a 104-page opinion.But the real-life drama continues for Mr. Dassey, 27.

He was originally sentenced to life in prison.\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely thrilled,\u201d said Laura H. Nirider, a member of Mr. Dassey\u2019s legal team, in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re over the moon for Brendan. We\u2019re over the moon for his family. This was a victory for justice and the truth today.\u201dIn addition to providing evidence that Mr. Dassey was coerced into a confession, \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d a 10-part series by Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos released in December 2015, suggested that Mr. Dassey was improperly questioned by police investigators in 2006, when he was 16, and that he was mentally unfit.Last August, Judge Duffin overturned his guilty verdict, which Brad Schimel, the attorney general in Wisconsin, appealed the next month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sure, He\u2019s Good at Basketball, but How Are His Twitter Skills?", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byThe tweets of Pau Gasol, an N.B.A. center, used to ricochet between the email inboxes of Alan Yang, a co-creator of the Netflix show \u201cMaster of None,\u201d and Chelsea Peretti, a comedian and cast regular of Fox\u2019s \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine.\u201dYang and Peretti knew what made good entertainment, and they saw it in the N.B.A.\u201cI work in television, and TV is a character-based medium,\u201d said Yang, who in the 2000s wrote pseudonymously for a baseball site called Fire Joe Morgan. \u201cPeople care about these characters, and root for and against them.\u201dPeople generally and, perhaps more important, that coveted demographic known as millennials.The N.F.L. has experienced stagnant ratings, and Major League Baseball has increasingly become a group of powerful but geographically limited fiefs. The most commonly blamed culprit is the generation of digitally savvy but distracted millennials \u2014 whoever they are and however one defines them.\u201cIf something isn\u2019t interesting, whether it\u2019s a show at 8 o\u2019clock or an N.F.L. game or an N.B.A. game, the choices to cure boredom are greater than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research.The N.B.A. seems to have hit upon a solution to a problem that is vexing sports officials everywhere: how to get young people to pay attention. It has done this by becoming no longer merely a league of winning and losing, but a place for latching on to players and teams, often for reasons having nothing to do with their on-court play \u2014 like, tweets that develop a public-facing personality.Drawing on not only the games themselves but also social media, off-court news, advertising and even politics, the league combines the melodrama of soap operas, the intimate access (whether real or contrived) of reality television and the personalized whimsy of fan fiction.Carter crystallized how the N.B.A. stood apart from the other major American leagues. \u201cThe N.F.L. markets the shield,\u201d he said, referring to the N.F.L. logo, which is intended to project a buttoned-up toughness and excellence, \u201cM.L.B. markets the franchises, and the N.B.A. markets the players.\u201cThe N.B.A. has been far more personality-centric than the other sports leagues,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have been able to take advantage of the way millennials consume sports.\u201dGreenfield said the N.B.A. and its commissioner, Adam Silver, had been forward-thinking in catering to young fans. For example, the N.B.A. permitted game video on YouTube at a time when other leagues reflexively guarded their copyrighted content.Basketball can more easily market itself this way because it has fewer players, and they don\u2019t wear helmets or ball caps to obscure their faces.\u201cYou have a smaller field of play,\u201d said Courtney Cox, a former ESPN producer who is now writing about the W.N.B.A. for her doctoral dissertation at U.S.C. \u201cWe get so many react shots \u2014 we get the bench. Just watching the game, it\u2019s sold to us in a different way.\u201dA brief history of how the N.B.A. got to this evolved fandom should begin at the turn of the century.In the early 2000s, the league was unmoored. There was no single replacement for Jordan. The national team lost a game, and then failed to win gold in the 2004 Olympics. Point guard Allen Iverson polarized fans, with traditionalists made anxious by his score-first play and tattoos, while a younger cohort embraced his hip-hop style. (As is frequently the case in basketball, the question of race was barely subtext.) Iverson was a walking debate and a continually unfolding story.Digital media technology enabled fans to self-publish, prompting a flourishing of sportswriting untethered to the traditional narratives favored by journalists who thought in column inches. The N.B.A. was comparatively a competitive vacuum, and they filled it with their own projected stories.\u201cThough fan considerations of sports and their narrative ramifications for personal identity long predated the web, the internet both amplified them and fostered their critical potential,\u201d Noah Cohan, a lecturer in American cultural studies at Washington University in St. Louis, wrote in his doctoral dissertation focused on evolving sports fandom.Cohan cited Bill Simmons, now the chief executive of the sports and culture website The Ringer, as having honed a fan-perspective style that greatly influenced sportswriting. But for him, the defining site was FreeDarko.\u201cWe had this funny habit of, I don\u2019t want to say ascribing qualities that weren\u2019t there, but reading tea leaves in a way where they were only faintly present,\u201d said Nathaniel Friedman, a co-founder.The site closed in 2011, but its diaspora can be found throughout digital sports media. Its ethos \u2014 seeing players as consistent characters unfolding in a serialized drama \u2014 is now dominant.More traditional forms of entertainment have made crossover stars of N.B.A. players whose personas already exist. James\u2019s small role as himself in the 2015 comedy \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d for instance, played on his specific tendencies (\u201cDid you know Cleveland\u2019s great for the whole family?\u201d James earnestly asked Bill Hader\u2019s character) in a way that even \u201cSpace Jam\u201d failed to do with Jordan, the star of that 1996 movie.When the producers of \u201cBroad City,\u201d the television comedy about two millennial women in New York City, learned that the Los Angeles Clippers star Blake Griffin was a fan, they cast him in an episode. (They had him do some things for the show that are unprintable here.)Jen Statsky, a \u201cBroad City\u201d writer and consulting producer (and, it should be disclosed, a Clippers fan), said she did not believe it was accidental that it was an N.B.A. player, rather than one from another major sports league, who ended up on the show.\u201cTheir personalities shine through in a way that it doesn\u2019t in other professional sports,\u201d she said of N.B.A. players. \u201cThey engage with fans more. There\u2019s a playfulness to the narrative of \u2018Will LeBron troll the Warriors?\u2019 There are story lines.\u201dIt could almost be a sitcom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In Netflix\u2019s \u2018GLOW,\u2019 Empowerment Comes Through Power Slams", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byLike many workplace comedies, \u201cGLOW\u201d is about people who had hoped to end up somewhere else. Ruth (Alison Brie) is a serious-minded actress stuck in a rut of reading for, and failing to get, milquetoast secretary roles. (Ruth, a casting director tells her, is the kind of unglamorous artist directors have in mind when they vow to cast \u201csomeone who\u2019s real\u201d \u2014 then change their minds once they see her.)She answers a call for \u201cunconventional women\u201d put out by Sam (Marc Maron), a B-movie sci-fi director \u2014 his credits include \u201cBlood Disco\u201d \u2014 who\u2019s been hired by a rich young dilettante to cast and create the league.Ruth struggles to understand the gig; to her, wrestling isn\u2019t acting but \u201ca sport with costumes.\u201d Her breakthrough comes when her estranged best friend, Debbie (Betty Gilpin), a soap actress, turns up at rehearsal and attacks Ruth in the ring. It hits Sam in a flash: He recruits Debbie to be his heroine, or face, and Ruth will be the villain, or heel.Sam initially writes his wrestling show an elaborate, postapocalyptic mythology. His patron, Bash (Chris Lowell), tells him to cut the complicated blah-blah and just give the women outrageous characters and outfits. \u201cWrestling is not about back story,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s about type.\u201d (Barthes would have agreed: wrestlers, he wrote, \u201cdisplay in advance, in their costumes and attitudes, the future contents of their parts.\u201d)So each woman ends up cast as a broad stereotype. Arthie (Sunita Mani), an Indian-American medical student, plays Beirut, a terrorist. Tamee (Kia Stevens) becomes Welfare Queen, a personification of Reagan-era race-baiting. Rhonda (Kate Nash) becomes Britannica, the \u201csmartest woman in the world,\u201d identifiable as such because she\u2019s British and smites her opponents with a book.The characters are smart enough to know how reductive these personas are; \u201cGLOW\u201d is smart enough to show how fiercely owning these roles \u2014 which, at least, give women power-bombing agency \u2014 can be liberating, even subversive.At the same time, \u201cGLOW\u201d becomes an insightful story about making art from trash, as an oddball alliance forms between Ruth and Sam. The effervescent Ms. Brie finds the fighter underneath Ruth\u2019s artiste \u2014 her co-stars nickname her \u201cStrindberg\u201d \u2014 as she throws herself into building a Russian-villain character. Mr. Maron, coming off playing a version of himself on \u201cMaron,\u201d perfectly inhabits his last-chancer character, who\u2019s sucking on the cigarette-butt end of his career.The creators of \u201cGLOW,\u201d Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, were producers on Showtime\u2019s \u201cNurse Jackie,\u201d in which Ms. Gilpin was a regular. (She\u2019s a delight in \u201cGLOW,\u201d with a gift for physical comedy and a deft handle on Debbie\u2019s pathos.) This series\u2019s tart tone is a lot like that of \u201cJackie,\u201d while the big, diverse cast recalls \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d whose creator, Jenji Kohan, is an executive producer here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cellphone Roaming Charges End in Europe. Many Respond With a Yawn.", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "Supported byAfter a decade of debate, Europe will finally abolish cellphone roaming charges this week, allowing people from Britain to Bulgaria to call, send text messages and surf the web without incurring eye-watering charges when traveling across the 28-nation bloc.Albena Krastanova, though, will not be among them.Ms. Krastanova, 37, prefers to vacation in her native Bulgaria when she is not selling newspapers in Sofia, the country\u2019s capital. Ms. Krastanova says she is too busy \u2014 and many of her compatriots too poor \u2014 to travel elsewhere in Europe.\u201cPaying the bills and providing for my 4-year-old daughter is our main priority. There is little left to splurge on trips abroad,\u201d Ms. Krastanova said as she cross-stitched an elaborate pattern and sat in her newspaper kiosk, a cup of coffee and a pack of cigarettes resting next to her embroidery. \u201cI don\u2019t use roaming.\u201dEurope\u2019s decade-long struggle to end cellphone roaming charges began before the original iPhone was released. But it involved often bitter lobbying between the region\u2019s cellular operators and consumer groups over how much people should pay to use their phones internationally. The changes will affect only people with European cellphone contracts, meaning Americans and others traveling in the region will still face costly charges.Critics point to data showing that a minority of Europeans regularly travel beyond their national borders to charge that the changes may offer limited benefit to most Europeans\u2019 daily online activities.\u201cThere\u2019s just a small percentage of consumers who will benefit from the scrapping of roaming charges,\u201d said Luca Schiavoni, a telecom regulation analyst at Ovum, a technology research group, in London. \u201cIt\u2019s for the few, not the many.\u201dDefenders of Europe\u2019s digital policies reject such criticism, saying that removing cellphone roaming charges took time because it represented the bedrock for the rest of the region\u2019s digital plans. It is hard to watch Netflix or shop on Amazon while traveling, they say, if you cannot first connect to the internet.For Viviane Reding, a former European commissioner who shepherded the roaming overhaul through Brussels\u2019s complex legislative process, the reduction in people\u2019s cellphone bills is a marked improvement. Even if Europeans travel abroad only a couple of times a year, they now can avoid extortionately high prices for even the briefest of calls or internet browsing.And while the roaming rules took longer than many had first expected, Europe\u2019s other digital proposals, she said, were still on track.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest change Europe has ever made digitally,\u201d said Ms. Reding, now a member of the European Parliament. \u201cThe new rules will apply to every company operating in the whole European market.\u201dMatt Chapam is one European who is eager for roaming to end.A British software engineer who moved to Amsterdam last year, Mr. Chapman, 28, had routinely paid hefty charges when traveling back to Britain to see his family.When the new rules come into force, his Dutch cellphone contract of 25 euros, or $28, a month will give him almost unlimited internet browsing and phone calls wherever he is in Europe. That compares to almost weekly top-ups of \u20ac20 that Mr. Chapman previously made when using his cellphone abroad.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to never have to worry about that again,\u201d he said.Yet, like most changes to European digital policy, the scrapping of roaming charges is by no means the end of the debate. Consumer groups and European officials are already voicing concerns that people may still see costly fees on their cellphone bills.While there will be strict caps on how much telecom operators can charge when individuals are outside their home countries, cellphone carriers can increase other fees, including phone calls and text messages to other European countries when people are not traveling, to recoup potential lost income.Lise Fuhr, director general of ETNO, a telecom industry group, said companies were offering competitive prices across Europe. But, she added, operators needed investment-friendly policies \u2014 not further regulation \u2014 if Europe wanted to build much-needed high-speed broadband networks and other digital infrastructure.European officials, though, have warned companies against price increases on services not linked to the end of cellphone roaming, saying that regulators may step in if they see potential unfair practices.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a Europe without digital borders,\u201d said Roberto Viola, director general of the European Commission\u2019s digital policy unit.That message will be music to the ears of Ondine Ripka, a French national living in Belgium who recently signed up for a new cellphone contract with Orange, a European carrier.While her overall monthly bill has fallen more than 50 percent, to \u20ac40, compared with what she paid to her previous operator, Ms. Ripka said certain charges, including sending text messages from Belgium to other European countries, were now significantly more expensive.In response, Orange said it was fully compliant with European rules, but that it had made changes to some of its products to better represent how consumers used its services.Boryana Dzhambazova contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Internet Is Where We Share \u2014 and Steal \u2014 the Best Ideas", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyBut a few weeks later, Entertainment Weekly reported that the social-media fantasy was actually coming to life: Netflix beat out several bidders at Cannes to buy the concept, which could go into production as early as next year. Viewed one way, this is a tale about how the web has collapsed the distance between audience and creator. But it also raises questions about ownership in the digital age.A governing ethos of the internet has been that whatever flows through it \u2014 information, ideas \u2014 is up for grabs. In his 2009 manifesto, \u201cFree,\u201d on the new digital economy, Chris Anderson wrote that \u201cit is a unique quality of the digital age that once something becomes software, it inevitably becomes free \u2014 in cost, certainly, and often in price.\u201d Anderson and his cohort envisioned a new type of cultural economy that didn\u2019t degrade the effort or labor of production. \u201cLast century\u2019s free was a powerful marketing method,\u201d Anderson noted; \u201cthis century\u2019s free is an entirely new economic model.\u201d But that model assumes that everyone within its ecosystem has equal access to resources and capital.Over the last two decades, the web has pushed every creative medium \u2014 print, film, music, even art \u2014 into brand-new territory. Creators can now take nontraditional paths to traditional success, and mainstream industries have stretched to accommodate these new digital economic models. A musician like Chance the Rapper no longer needs a record label to win a Grammy, and a comedian like Quinta Brunson can use Instagram and YouTube to land a job producing and starring in videos for BuzzFeed Motion Pictures. And the internet has also allowed for the creation of new types of cultural products, even as we struggle to recognize them as such.Was she right? The types of ideas protected by intellectual-property law typically don\u2019t include a clever catchphrase on a Vine or a film idea in a tweet. But it\u2019s difficult to dismiss Newman entirely; the \u201cfreemium economy\u201d that Anderson heralded works only if the old hierarchies of access have been dismantled. And for the most part, they are still intact.Whether or not you agree with that analysis, the incident does point to the growing schism between those driving cultural conversations online and those profiting from them. There\u2019s a rich history of excluding certain types of creators from compensation for their contributions to culture. In her 2006 article \u201cFair Use and the Fairer Sex,\u201d Ann Bartow, now the director of the Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property at the University of New Hampshire School of Law, pointed out that \u201ccopyright laws are written and enforced to help certain groups of people, largely male, assert and retain control over the resources generated by creative productivity.\u201d Historically, she noted, that infrastructure played a key role in sustaining \u201cthe material and economic inequality between women and men.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that technology isn\u2019t keeping pace with innovation,\u201d says Amanda Levendowski, a teaching fellow at the New York University School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s that we aren\u2019t keeping pace with how to serve new types of creators who have never been valued by intellectual-property regimes.\u201d Often, those people most responsible for cultural touchstones are unable to profit from them because they don\u2019t have access to capital and resources (a digital ad agency, say, or a Hollywood pitch room). The internet has become the go-to place to toss out ideas, in the hope that they could lead to a job, but it has also become the place where people go to find the best ideas, creating a lopsided dynamic that tends to benefit people in power.This dynamic is further complicated by the way social media psychologically encourages and socially rewards us for our contributions to online culture. The founders of Instagram studied psychology and computer science at Stanford University. Before Facebook acquired the app for $1 billion, Kevin Systrom, one of its creators, spoke about designing a \u201cnatural cycle\u201d of participation that would keep engagement up on his service. \u201cThe more people love seeing content on the platform, the more they use it, the more they post,\u201d he told Business of Fashion in 2014. Likes and retweets on Twitter and Tumblr perform a similar function. Researchers like Nir Eyal and BJ Fogg have written about how apps \u201chook\u201d users and cultivate addiction. Online, there is an irresistible social currency to being a user who has thousands of followers, who starts memes, who comes up with an idea that is turned into a movie. But I wonder how comfortable we should be with this arrangement.Not long ago, I watched \u201cThe Founder,\u201d the movie about the businessman Ray Kroc, who mutated McDonald\u2019s from a family-owned restaurant into the global multinational corporation it is today. There\u2019s a scene in which Kroc, played by Michael Keaton, explains his plans to Dick and Mac McDonald. Kroc, who is in the process of swindling them out of a significant fortune, tells them how he justifies his behavior, by adding value to their original idea: \u201cDo you know what I came up with, Mac? A concept. I came up with the concept of winning.\u201dIn the movie, it\u2019s easy to identify Kroc as an amoral exploiter, sponging off the labors of Dick and Mac. Which brings me back to the Rihanna-Nyong\u2019o film project. Ownership on social media is far from clear. Even the genesis of the project is disputed, with some pointing to a meme on Tumblr as the original source. For now, representatives for Issa Rae have told Vanity Fair that the Twitter users who came up with the concept will be credited in some way, and judging by their tweets, they seem to be satisfied with that recognition as adequate payment. Meanwhile, we can expect everyone else associated with the film to actually be paid.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
