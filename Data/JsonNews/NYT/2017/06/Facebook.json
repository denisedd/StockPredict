{"Headline": "Phil Jackson\u2019s Beloved Triangle: A Symbol of Hubris", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byOn Pro BasketballWhat would Red Holzman, who was Phil Jackson\u2019s first coaching mentor in professional basketball, have said about Jackson\u2019s ultimately self-sabotaging devotion to an offensive system, the triangle, that his players in New York didn\u2019t want to play and his coaches didn\u2019t want to coach?Nothing, publicly, for Holzman preferred a root canal without anesthesia to sharing on-the-record criticism of anyone, on his team or another. Ah, but in the shelter of a relaxed moment offstage, Holzman would have flashed a crooked half-smile and begun with a frog-throated \u201cheh heh\u201d before explaining that a so-called system was an excellent deal for the coach in maintaining job security, or a reputation as a genius.If the team won, the system was brilliant. If it didn\u2019t, the players didn\u2019t fit the system. A modest but confident man, Holzman despised the posturing of the look-at-me coach, and that included Red Auerbach with his obnoxious victory cigars.Holzman\u2019s most essential tenet was not to program his players to the point of paralysis. Let them play, as long as they made the extra pass \u2014 and played defense.True, Holzman\u2019s squads, still the only champions in the history of the Knicks, consisted of men blessed with exceptional basketball I.Q.s and the ability to improvise within the team concept. What they largely lacked, across the lineup that included Jackson as a long-limbed defensive nuisance, was the enhanced athleticism of the 21st-century player, and the freedom to operate in the ever-expanding shot-launching areas of the court.Before returning to the Knicks in 2014 as team president and the latest in a long line of well-compensated, would-be saviors, Jackson had record-shattering coaching success \u2014 11 rings\u2019 worth, you may have heard \u2014 with the triangle offense in Chicago and Los Angeles. In his hour of reputational disrepair, it would be egregiously revisionist to argue that his fame and fortune were all about Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen in Chicago and Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal in Los Angeles.Which N.B.A. coaches with multiple rings \u2014 Auerbach, Pat Riley, Gregg Popovich \u2014 haven\u2019t had the luxury of all-time greats? The triangle was an effective system through all of Jackson\u2019s postseason runs, but never better than during the 1993-94 season, which proceeded without Jordan, who took a sabbatical while the Pippen-led Bulls amassed a stunning 55 wins.Jackson learned the triangle from Tex Winter, a Bulls assistant, not long after he was rescued from the Continental Basketball Association, which he liked to call the Cockroach League. Apprenticing for the Albany Patroons, Jackson drove the team van, pleaded with the front office for incremental raises in meal money and lobbied unsuccessfully to have Charley Rosen, his friend and assistant, accompany him on the road.His belief in the triangle offense went from what he would call, in more immodest moments, \u201cjust a system of basketball\u201d to a full-blown religious experience, the essence of purity in a sport he decided was devolving in the predictability of high-screen-and-roll.Four years ago, while promoting his latest best-selling tome (surprise, \u201cEleven Rings\u201d), he sat in the back room of a bookstore in Ridgewood, N.J., and explained to me why he would consider returning to the N.B.A., despite all he had achieved.\u201cI think some of it is just the influence from my close friends \u2014 Jeanie Buss, Kurt Rambis, Jim Cleamons \u2014 that you should not stay away from the game because your influence is needed and brings another element to the game of basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in watching the game evolve, there\u2019s quite a difference philosophically in the way it\u2019s played now and the way I coached.\u201dJackson apparently mistook the advice of a small circle of friends for widespread public demand. He convinced himself that the triangle would save the sport in general and Carmelo Anthony in particular.Oh, and the $60 million over five years from James L. Dolan, the Knicks\u2019 owner, would make up for those sparsely compensated years in Albany and even in Chicago.Jackson is a competitor. It wasn\u2019t just about the money. That argument is as silly as the often-cited one that Dolan, who has spent enough on the Knicks to rescue a good-size country in economic despair, doesn\u2019t want to win. Almost two decades of mostly failure have been about the process, the execution.To that extent, Jackson, long renowned for thinking out of the box, became trapped in a three-sided prison. He forsook psychology for philosophy. He put Derek Fisher and Jeff Hornacek, his handpicked coaches, in untenable working positions by insisting they teach as he would, costing them the respect and attention of their players.For perspective\u2019s sake, imagine Jackson running the Golden State Warriors. Would he insist on positioning Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant within the same limited scoring range?Hard to believe, but Anthony\u2019s no-trade clause \u2014 especially if Rosen\u2019s rationale is true \u2014 was a crippling example of Jackson\u2019s ego overriding executive pragmatism. It ultimately led to Jackson\u2019s lowbrow attempts to persuade Anthony to waive the clause and alienated Kristaps Porzingis to the point where Jackson considered trading the team\u2019s most precious asset as well. Add that to how the triangle and organizational dysfunction had made the Knicks toxic to stars around the league, and you understand why Dolan finally had to move.A more clearheaded Jackson might have backtracked on Anthony when he realized that Anthony, because of Jackson\u2019s own malpractice, had all the leverage, and that the residual effects of the impasse were putting the franchise on the brink of implosion.But, yes, it was apparently still about the triangle, the sword he fell on.On Facebook, Rosen, at least, seemed not to have learned anything from the debacle. He wrote: \u201cIf you had a thorough understanding of the triangle, you would understand some of his moves \u2014 but obviously you don\u2019t \u2014 and don\u2019t give me that M.J., Pip, Kobe, Shaq stuff. Remember how well the Bulls did when M. J. was playing baseball.\u201dAs mentioned earlier, we remember. Who could forget? But these last three years? Simply obtuse.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the league the Albany Patroons were in when Phil Jackson coached the team. It is the Continental Basketball Association, not the Continental Basketball League.Advertisement"}

Mr. Xi said the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model, under which the city maintains autonomy in local governance and its legal system, economic and financial system, is confronting \u201cnew situations\u201d and \u201cnew problems.\u201d He pledged the central government\u2019s continuing support to Hong Kong.The ceremony, in a large convention center along Victoria Harbor, came hours before thousands of demonstrators planned to gather for an annual march to protest the lack of full democracy in Hong Kong.\u2014 Austin RamzyMr. Xi visited a People\u2019s Liberation Army base on Friday in the New Territories of Hong Kong, reviewing troops as he rode in the back of a military jeep, highlighting the most potent symbol of Chinese sovereignty in the territory. It was the largest such military display by Chinese soldiers in Hong Kong since they arrived 20 years ago.When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China on July 1, 1997, 4,000 People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers crossed the border in boats, aircraft and armored personnel carriers to establish control. It was just eight years after soldiers killed hundreds of protesters in Beijing during the crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protest movement. While some Hong Kong residents welcomed the military with garlands and waving flags, others said they were worried.In the two decades since, China\u2019s military has maintained a largely symbolic presence in Hong Kong. Troops are seldom seen in uniform off base, and visiting sailors from the United States and other navies are far more conspicuous on the streets of Hong Kong during port calls.\u201cThe garrison will always declare sovereignty as its first and fundamental task,\u201d they wrote in Qiu Shi, or Seeking Truth. But it must change \u201cfrom being a good model to a force that has the ability to win battles.\u201dA powerful display of the military\u2019s presence will come in just over one week, when China\u2019s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, will visit Hong Kong as part of events to mark the 20th anniversary of the handover.\u2014 Austin RamzyAs chief secretary, Mrs. Lam was second in command under the current chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, who is widely unpopular. Mrs. Lam led the effort to make Beijing-approved changes to Hong Kong\u2019s election laws, which became the subject of monthslong protests in 2014 and were never carried out.Though Mrs. Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s first female chief executive, had promised to bring in fresh faces to run Hong Kong, her cabinet members are almost all veteran officials or holdovers from the previous administration, including the top three secretaries.\u2014 Jennifer Jett Mr. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, arrived in Hong Kong shortly after noon on Thursday, disembarking from an Air China jet. They strolled down a red carpet, where they were greeted by the city\u2019s departing chief executive, Mr. Leung; the incoming one, Mrs. Lam; and the city\u2019s first one, Tung Chee-hwa, who was bestowed with the title after the resumption of Chinese rule in 1997.As attendees waved the red flags of Hong Kong and China, Mr. Xi spoke briefly about the importance of the city to China.\u201cHong Kong has always affected my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cIn two days, it will be the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s return to the motherland. This is a major event, a happy event, for the nation and for Hong Kong.\u201dLater in the afternoon, Mr. Xi met with Mr. Leung and praised his work over the past five years, particularly in \u201cdefending national sovereignty and security.\u201dMr. Leung was the target of fierce criticism during the Umbrella Movement protests in 2014, and many demonstrators called for his resignation. Mr. Leung refused and said at the time that the protests were aided by \u201cexternal forces,\u201d but he did not offer evidence.\u2014 Austin RamzyCantonese is the common tongue in Hong Kong. During the British era, English was the second language. But since the handover the use of Mandarin, the official language of China, has grown steadily. A decade ago, it was rare to hear Mandarin on the streets of Hong Kong. Now, with the influx of mainland tourists, it is common.Mandarin is increasingly important for people who work in sales, financial services and tourism. It is also important for officials, particularly the chief executive, Hong Kong\u2019s top official. The chief executive answers to Beijing and must be able to communicate with central government leaders. That has been on display during Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, as Mrs. Lam and the departing chief executive, Mr. Leung, have spoken with the Chinese president in Mandarin throughout his visit.While the two tongues sound different, in formal writing they are very similar. But Cantonese has some characters that do not exist in standard Mandarin.Mainland China uses simplified forms of Chinese characters, while Hong Kong and Taiwan use traditional characters. The traditional characters involve more strokes, and China\u2019s ruling Communist Party pushed the use of simplified characters to increase literacy.\u2014 Austin RamzyMr. Xi is encountering something he rarely confronts in China: open protests. Because of its status as a semiautonomous region, Hong Kong has long allowed demonstrations, which are not tolerated in mainland China. To that end, the police have taken pains to keep protesters away from Mr. Xi\u2019s scheduled public appearances. Roads will be closed on Saturday in the busy Wan Chai and Admiralty areas as he presides over the swearing-in of Hong Kong\u2019s new chief executive.In a video posted this week, the Hong Kong police sought to justify the extraordinary lengths to which they have gone to shield Chinese and local officials from planned protests.The police said the security measures reflected their concerns over terrorist attacks.\u201cRecently, the world has been shocked by terrorist attacks of cars plowing into crowds,\u201d an officer said in the video. \u201cThese \u2018water barriers\u2019 can ensure the safety of the public and the important officials.\u201dBut the barriers are more likely meant to shield the leaders from expected protests. \u201cDoes that mean that all the people of Hong Kong are terrorists?\u201d one Facebook user commented.\u2014 Gerry MullanyThe Liberty Times, a newspaper in Taiwan, this week cited a survey taken late last year by the Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies in which nearly 40 percent of respondents from Hong Kong said they wanted to emigrate. Taiwan topped the respondents\u2019 wish list as a destination, with 16 percent saying they would like to move there, followed by Australia and Canada, with 15 and 14 percent, respectively.\u201cPolitical climate is one of the important factors for Hong Kongers immigrating to Taiwan, especially for young people hoping for stability of free speech,\u201d the Liberty Times said. Cultural similarities between Hong Kong and Taiwan and physical proximity were also important draws.Chen Tuen Yee, a Hong Kong native, moved to Taiwan in 2015 after the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement demonstrations failed to bring change.After the movement ended, Ms. Chen said, \u201cI started to pay more attention to politics, and it was absolutely frustrating.\u201d\u2014 Chris HortonMr. Wong, perhaps the best-known leader of the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, and more than two dozen other activists were arrested Wednesday night and remained in police custody until Friday.They were arrested after climbing the Golden Bauhinia Statue commemorating Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese rule. The statue is in the square where the Chinese president will attend a flag-raising ceremony on Saturday.The protesters called for the immediate release of Mr. Liu.\u201cGenuine universal suffrage! Free Liu Xiaobo unconditionally!\u201d they chanted as hundreds of mostly mainland Chinese tourists looked on.Shocked by the display of defiance \u2014 such free expression is severely restricted in mainland China \u2014 many tourists immediately took out their phones to take photographs and videos, even though many had never heard of Mr. Liu.\u201cWho is Liu Xiaobo?\u201d a woman from Anhui Province, in east-central China, asked when I approached her. \u201cThis is so scary.\u201d\u2014 Alan Wong\u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d was played by a band of Scots Guards in tall, bearskin hats, and the Union Jack was brought down.After a five-second pause, time for British cymbals to stop vibrating, the Chinese national anthem was played and the Chinese flag raised alongside the new flag of Hong Kong.Hong Kong had returned to Chinese rule.Still, not everyone thinks that Hong Kong will have much impact on China\u2019s political system, in part because the Chinese leadership is so adamant about stopping the buds of political pluralism before they even sprout.\u201cHong Kong will change China,\u201d said Robin Munro, the head of the Hong Kong office of Human Rights Watch. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see more venality and appetite for moneymaking. But I doubt that this means more democracy and liberalism. My biggest anxiety is that I believe that China will probably change some of the assumptions of political science in the West.\u201d\u2014 Jennifer JettThe Basic Law, an agreement signed 20 years ago by Britain and China, says that Hong Kong will retain a high degree of autonomy, and its capitalist financial system and independent legal structure, for 50 years.Critics say that in recent years Beijing has been undermining the spirit if not the letter of the Basic Law by cracking down on press freedoms in Hong Kong and meddling in the selection of the territory\u2019s leaders.\u2014 Gerry MullanyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Battling Brands Online Has Gained Urgency, and Impact", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtUntil last week, Travis Kalanick, a founder of Uber and its chief executive, ruled his company absolutely. That was the Silicon Valley way; ever since Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple in the 1980s, tech founders have demanded, and been awarded, enormous deference by investors and corporate boards. So even as successive waves of scandal have hit Uber, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s position looked safe.It is the swiftness of the fall that\u2019s interesting here. In another time, Mr. Kalanick might have been able to hang on. But we live in an era dominated by the unyielding influence of social feeds. Every new Uber revelation ignited a massive campaign against the company on Twitter and Facebook. A swirl of negative branding took on a life of its own \u2014 and ultimately could not be ignored.But the effects of these campaigns go beyond business. In a nation where politics have grown pitched and sclerotic, fighting brands online suddenly feels like the most effective political action many of us can take. Posting a hashtag \u2014 #deleteUber, for instance, or #grabyourwallet \u2014 and threatening to back it up by withholding dollars can bring about a much quicker, more visible change in the world than, say, calling your representative.Yet the mechanics of social media suggest it will be the cultural and political left, more than the right, that might win the upper hand with this tactic \u2014 especially when harnessing the power of brands to fight larger battles for racial and gender equality, as in the Uber and Fox News cases.To see why, we must first understand why brands are suddenly more vulnerable to consumer sentiment than they once were. It all comes down to one thing: Social media is the new TV.In the era when television shaped mainstream consumer sentiment, companies enjoyed enormous power to alter their image through advertising. Then came the internet, which didn\u2019t kill advertising, but did dilute its power. Brands now have little say over how their messages get chewed up through our social feeds.Yes, they can run ads on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and everyplace else. But social media elevates consumers over corporate marketing; suddenly what matters isn\u2019t what an ad says about a company, but what your friends think about that company.It\u2019s this loss of power that explains why brands have become so jumpy and reactive. Take the production of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d that opened last week in Central Park as part of Shakespeare in the Park. In the play, a Caesar who is styled to look like Mr. Trump is graphically assassinated on stage, which many on the right took as disparaging the president.But none of that matters in 2017, when Twitter shapes the news. On social media, there\u2019s no room for nuanced portrayals of complex artistic treatments. There are only quick snatches of graphic imagery in your scrolling feed \u2014 and the sight of a Trump-styled Caesar getting assassinated proved too much for powerless brands to stomach.\u201cI think it\u2019s ultimately healthy and positive even when I don\u2019t agree with it \u2014 it\u2019s healthy and positive that consumers are making themselves heard,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s only in the last 15 years that women became aware of their own consumer power,\u201d Ms. Coulter said. \u201cAnd now, online, they can show that they\u2019re willing to flex it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But to get the groceries, he shopped in bulk at Trader Joe\u2019s stores almost three hours away in Seattle.Trader Joe\u2019s, a private company with more than 450 stores across the United States, is known for its loyal following, customer service and clever product names, like Speculoos Cookie Butter Cheesecake Bites and Chocolate Dilemma Cheesecake.A Federal District Court in Washington ruled that the violations had occurred in Canada, where Trader Joe\u2019s has no stores, and that Trader Joe\u2019s had failed to prove that Pirate Joe\u2019s affected its business in the United States. In August 2016, a federal appeals court sent the case back to the lower court for a trial, which was scheduled to take place in November.On Wednesday, the two sides reached a settlement.\u201cThey definitely didn\u2019t want me to be a business,\u201d said Mr. Hallatt, who had agreed to close the store.Mr. Hallatt had been banned by Trader Joe\u2019s from setting foot in its stores, but he had devised ways to shop undetected and keep his enterprise afloat.He would fill a cart with the items he needed and then have companions pay at the cashier \u2014 the most sensitive part of the expedition because it was where he most risked being spotted.

Rules broken, slyly circumvented or simply bent beyond their intent.The document, known as the Garcia report in tribute to the American who compiled it, but kept secret by FIFA\u2019s ethics committee for more than two years, was surprisingly published on Tuesday by FIFA itself. For the first time, the release confirmed, and in some cases revealed, long-sought details of an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. FIFA, the sport\u2019s global governing body, released the report, it said, \u201cfor the sake of transparency\u201d \u2014 though it notably did so only after a German newspaper revealed on Monday that it had obtained a copy and planned to gradually reveal its unsavory details.The report was submitted in 2014 by Michael J. Garcia, a former United States attorney who had served as FIFA\u2019s chief ethics investigator, and contained the findings of a monthslong examination he had conducted into the vote in December 2010 \u2014 widely reported to have been tainted by corruption \u2014 that awarded the 2018 tournament to Russia and the 2022 event to Qatar.What the Garcia report did not have, in the end, was any hard evidence that the committees for Russia and Qatar had used bribes to secure the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, any smoking gun that might have compelled FIFA to consider moving either of the events, or reopening the bidding for them.Still, the dossier provided a troubling view of a deeply flawed voting process; confirmed various news media reports from around the world in the years since the vote was taken about inappropriate and unethical behavior by people close to the bids and voters they sought to influence; and painted a broad portrait conveying a general \u201cappearance of impropriety,\u201d to borrow an oft-used phrase from Mr. Garcia, its author.Among his findings:\u25a0 While there was no direct evidence of the buying of votes directed by Qatar\u2019s official bid committee, Mr. Garcia documented in dozens and dozens of pages his concerns about the troubling closeness of Qatar\u2019s government and the country\u2019s bid committee, and of improper conduct by consultants hoping to advance the bid.\u25a0 Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, who was then the country\u2019s prime minister, met with a half-dozen FIFA voters in the months before the 2010 vote. But Russia\u2019s bid committee was cleared of any wrongdoing, with the report finding no evidence of collusion with other bids, no violations of rules on gifts, and no signs that the Russians had tried to exert influence on any voters.\u25a0 Mr. Garcia recounted in detail the ways in which executive committee members and other people of interest ignored, or lashed out at, his questions, professed ignorance on simple matters, or otherwise failed to cooperate with his investigation. His general frustrations revealed the limits of his powers in the investigation, in which he did not have subpoena power, even though it did reveal direct or indirect favors done for votes: a soccer field constructed in a voter\u2019s country, trans-Atlantic flights on private jets, and \u2014 in one memorable example \u2014 a $2 million payment deposited into the account of a FIFA voter\u2019s 10-year-old daughter.The investigation also revealed, through minutes of FIFA meetings, that the governing body\u2019s executive committee had not even discussed the issue of the searing summer heat in Qatar before awarding the country a tournament traditionally played in June and July \u2014 even though FIFA\u2019s own inspectors had flagged the issue as a major concern. And through those same minutes, Mr. Garcia found that when it later became clear that moving the World Cup to the comparatively milder Persian Gulf winter was the only option, FIFA secretly extricated itself from a potential legal fight by awarding Fox Sports the television rights to the 2026 cycle at what was clear, even then, to be an enormously discounted fee that most likely cost FIFA hundreds of millions of dollars.The report on the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, compiled by Michael J. Garcia, a former United States attorney who had served as FIFA\u2019s chief ethics investigator.The Garcia report had achieved something of a mythical status in the years it remained hidden from public eye.Mr. Garcia submitted his report in 2014, stating afterward that his team had uncovered \u201cserious and wide-ranging issues\u201d in the selection process. Despite appeals for transparency from Mr. Garcia and several members of FIFA\u2019s ruling executive committee, including at least one who has since pleaded guilty in a separate, ongoing FIFA corruption investigation, the report was never released.Instead, Hans-Joachim Eckert of Germany, at the time serving as the chief judge of FIFA\u2019s ethics committee, published a 42-page summary of Mr. Garcia\u2019s report that asserted, in apparent contrast to Mr. Garcia\u2019s conclusions, that the voting process had not been corrupted.Mr. Eckert also rejected the idea that any violations should lead to a reopening of the bidding process for the tournaments, and FIFA\u2019s leadership, then led by Sepp Blatter, quickly declared the matter closed.A month later, after losing an appeal related to the case, Mr. Garcia resigned from his position in protest, charging at the time that Mr. Eckert\u2019s abridged report included \u201cnumerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions.\u201dThe matter re-emerged this week when Bild, a widely read German tabloid, announced that it had procured a copy of the report. Peter Rossberg, the Bild reporter who obtained it, wrote on his Facebook page late Monday that the dossier did not provide \u201cdefinitive proof\u201d that the 2018 and 2022 World Cups had been bought. He said, however, that it nevertheless provided important details that would contribute to a larger picture of what he called a \u201ccompletely corrupt system.\u201dBefore Bild could publish its exclusive, FIFA scooped the newspaper by releasing the report on its website Tuesday morning. In a news release, FIFA said that \u201cthe new chairpersons of the independent Ethics Committee, Mar\u00eda Claudia Rojas of the investigatory chamber and Vassilios Skouris of the adjudicatory chamber, have decided to publish the report,\u201d and contended that FIFA\u2019s current president, Gianni Infantino, had \u201con numerous occasions\u201d called for the report\u2019s release.\u201cDespite these regular requests,\u201d FIFA said in the statement, \u201cit is worth noting that the former chairpersons of the Ethics Committee, Cornel Borb\u00e9ly and Hans-Joachim Eckert, had always refused to publish it.\u201dLater Tuesday, in their own statement, Mr. Eckert and Mr. Borb\u00e9ly, who had replaced Mr. Garcia as FIFA\u2019s top investigator, denied such a premise.\u201cTo this day,\u201d they said, \u201cMr. Infantino has never contacted us and asked for a publication.\u201dMr. Eckert, who had said privacy concerns made publication of the report \u201cimpossible,\u201d and Mr. Borb\u00e9ly were removed from their posts this year. At the time, they implied that their ongoing ethics investigations into several top figures at FIFA had been thwarted by their ouster. Critics of their removal complained that the open cases had been set back months by the change in leadership of the ethics posts.Yet, on Tuesday, FIFA claimed the high ground.\u201cFor the sake of transparency,\u201d it said, \u201cFIFA welcomes the news that this report has now been finally published.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uncle Sam Wants Your Deep Neural Networks", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is turning to data scientists to improve screening techniques at airports.Although data scientists can apply any technique in building these algorithms, the contest is a way of capitalizing on the progress in a technology called deep neural networks, said the Kaggle founder and chief executive, Anthony Goldbloom. Neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn specific tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Feed millions of cat photographs into a neural network, for instance, and it can learn to recognize a cat.Companies like Google and Facebook use the technology to do things like identify faces in online images, recognize commands spoken into smartphones and translate one language into another. But the possibilities extend well beyond smartphone apps and other online services.Earlier this year, Kaggle ran a $1 million contest to build algorithms capable of identifying signs of lung cancer in CT scans, helping to fuel a larger effort to apply neural networks to health care. Now, the hope is that neural networks can also help automated systems read body scans with greater accuracy, so checkpoint workers can spend less time pulling passengers aside and patting them down.\u201cWe started by trying to figure out what was a dog and what was a cat,\u201d said Goldbloom, referring to the growing community of companies, academics and other researchers working with neural networks. \u201cNow, we\u2019re moving into more serious territory.\u201dJohn W. Halinski, a former deputy administrator at the Transportation Security Administration who now works as a security consultant, welcomed the \u201ccrowdsourcing\u201d idea because it could draw on the skills of any data scientist. This is increasingly important, he said, as airport security consolidates around just a few large corporations.\u201cThere are a lot of people out there that are good at solving difficult problems,\u201d said John Fortune, a program manager in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s science and technology arm.Homeland Security and other organizations are working on ways to improve the technologies used at airport checkpoints, with the T.S.A. set to roll out new CT systems that can automatically identify items hidden in passenger baggage, and at least one company, Smiths Detection, exploring the use of neural networks at security checkpoints.To help data scientists and machine-learning researchers train their algorithms, Homeland Security is supplying more than 1,000 three-dimensional body scans.The department is not sharing scans of the more than two million people screened each day at the nation\u2019s airports. Instead, T.S.A. workers volunteered to help create the data for the contest from scratch, repeatedly walking through a set of test scanners at a laboratory in New Jersey. In some cases, the workers carried concealed items through the scanners, and these images are carefully labeled.By analyzing this data, neural networks and other algorithms can learn to pinpoint concealed items on their own. Jeremy Achin, a founder and the chief executive of the data analysis company DataRobot, said that neural networks were well suited to such a task.But he also warned that the technology could make mistakes and that in some cases it could be vulnerable to bad actors. Research has shown that after analyzing the performance of an image-recognition system driven by a neural network, miscreants could mark or otherwise alter items in ways that fool the system into seeing things that are not there \u2014 or failing to see things that are.For those reasons, the immediate aim is not to build technology that replaces human screeners but to find a way of removing some of the burden from those screeners, Mr. Goldbloom said.But the hope is that this technology and others, over time, will significantly improve this security-checkpoint task and others, including passenger baggage scans, cargo scans and face recognition.\u201cWhen identifying risk items in a piece of luggage or through a body scan, today\u2019s algorithms aren\u2019t bad,\u201d said Anthony Roman, a former commercial pilot who runs the risk-management firm Roman & Associates. \u201cBut false positives will be driven way down. We may in the next 10 to 15 years reach a point where all this is automatic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Needs to Reinvent Itself. It Just Might Be Doing So.", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 One of Apple\u2019s greatest strengths is timing. The company that\u2019s hailed for innovation does not often invent things first \u2014 it didn\u2019t create the first personal computer, the first digital music player or the first smartphone. Instead, Apple reinvents, slipping in and producing something more original than what we used to use.Apple\u2019s version ticks all the Apple-y boxes: It\u2019s very pretty; it\u2019s about twice the price of the Echo; and it has much better sound, including the ability to create a kind of surround sound customized to your room.Yet the reinvention that matters here isn\u2019t about a single device \u2014 it\u2019s larger: The success of HomePod will really depend on whether Apple can reinvent itself.HomePod will be a test of how Apple responds to these difficulties. That\u2019s because for Apple to outdo Amazon in the home assistant game, it will need to prioritize skills that have long been on its back burner \u2014 cloud services and A.I., for instance.But here\u2019s the surprising thing: Apple seems to be up for such reinvention. If you read between the lines at its keynote address on Monday, you would have noticed something. Again and again, like shamans calling on some new and powerful magic, Apple executives invoked the buzzwords of modern computing: \u201cmachine learning,\u201d \u201cdeep learning\u201d and \u201ccomputer vision.\u201dSubtly but unmistakably, they were suggesting a shift. Apple seems to be transforming itself into a new kind of company, one that prioritizes the nerdy technical stuff that will become the foundation of tomorrow\u2019s intelligent machines \u2014 whereas in the past, the company tended to hide this stuff, even if it recognized its importance.In broad strokes, the device seems to do much of what its rivals can. Say, \u201cHey Siri, play me some Carly Rae Jepsen,\u201d and it will belt out perfect Canadian pop. It will also answer questions about the music it\u2019s playing, and, just like the Echo, it can perform a wide variety of other functions \u2014 setting timers, telling you the weather and controlling your smart lights and other home devices.Yet many of these are omissions that you\u2019d expect in a new device, and Apple will most likely add improvements in updates. What will matter most, at first, is how reliably HomePod can perform the basics.If you\u2019re a longtime Siri user, your skepticism is warranted. The best thing about Amazon\u2019s speaker is its reliability: Say something from far away, even in a noisy room, and most of the time it will at least recognize what you asked it. Once you get an idea of the kinds of requests it can handle, Alexa begins to seem like a completely natural interface to computers. It responds so quickly that it starts to seem like a helpful member of the family rather than a computer in a can.Can Siri in HomePod do that? I can\u2019t tell you yet for certain. I got a chance to listen to HomePod \u2014 but not use any of its voice-activated features \u2014 after Apple\u2019s keynote. As the company promised, it does sound much deeper and richer than a Sonos Play 3 or an Amazon Echo, closer to what you might hear in a high-end home stereo system. But the true test for such a device is how it works in real-world conditions, handling the multiplicity of requests that you might think up during a day \u2014 and for now, we have no idea how that might work.Yet I am cautiously optimistic, mainly on the basis of the many other computationally difficult features that Apple showed off on Monday. Many of them are versions of features that rivals like Google have spent years perfecting.For example, Siri will now translate languages for you. Like a true assistant, Siri is also now more predictive \u2014 it aims to spot common computing problems and offer to help. (If it notices that you\u2019ve been chatting about a coming appointment, for instance, it will offer to add it to your calendar.)Best of all, Siri is finally a single unified personality that sits across all of your devices. In the past, Siri on your iPad was different from Siri on your Mac \u2014 one would learn that you\u2019re traveling to Iceland, and the other might never know. Now, similar to other assistants, Siri knows you and can anticipate your interests on whatever device you use.There was more, too. Apple is letting developers create apps that can perform machine learning tasks on its devices. It\u2019s also diving heavily into computer vision. Developers can now create augmented reality features, meaning they can add virtual objects overlaid on images from the real world.If you follow the tech industry you know these are all hot topics that other companies are investing in heavily. Apple is still a laggard, and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to beat Google in an A.I. contest anytime soon.But it doesn\u2019t need to. All Apple has to do is stay competitive \u2014 it\u2019s got to invest just enough in the A.I.-driven future to keep its devices compelling. There\u2019s no mistake, now, that it\u2019s doing so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Virginia Shooting Suspect Was Distraught Over Trump\u2019s Election, Brother Says", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 He lived out of his van in the Northern Virginia suburbs and took showers at the Y.M.C.A. On Facebook, he posted furious criticism of President Trump and pledged allegiance to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Back home in Illinois, neighbors complained to the police of his practicing his shooting near their home.Shortly after 7 a.m. on Wednesday, the police say, James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., opened fire on a baseball field in Alexandria, Va., just steps from the Y.M.C.A., spraying bullets at members of the Republican congressional team practicing there.Four people were shot in the assault, including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the majority whip and third-ranking Republican in the House. An ensuing firefight with the police took Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s life.The suspect\u2019s brother said Mr. Hodgkinson was a critic of Mr. Trump, upset over last fall\u2019s election and intent on bringing his protest to Washington. But his more immediate motive for the attack remained unclear late Wednesday, even as investigators surrounded Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s home on the outskirts of Belleville, a town of 40,000 across the Mississippi River from St. Louis.Five people were shot at a morning practice about five miles from the Capitol, the police said.\u201cI know he wasn\u2019t happy with the way things were going, the election results and stuff,\u201d his brother, Michael Hodgkinson, said in a phone interview after he received the news on Wednesday.\u201cTotally out of the blue,\u201d he added, saying that his brother was engaged in politics but otherwise led a normal life.Conversations on Wednesday with friends and family, a review of police records and an examination of Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s voluminous writing on Facebook offered some clues. He was deeply invested in liberal politics and had volunteered for Mr. Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign. He also had run-ins with law enforcement over the years.In 1996, tragedy struck when his 17-year-old foster daughter committed suicide by dousing herself with gasoline and setting herself on fire in a car, according to The Belleville News-Democrat.The newspaper reported that the daughter had been living with the Hodgkinson family for months and had tried to kill herself before.\u201cHe seemed like a loner,\u201d said William D. Euille, Alexandria\u2019s mayor from 2003 to 2016, who came to know Mr. Hodgkinson during regular morning stops at the Y.M.C.A. \u201cBut very nice.\u201dFor much of his adult life, Mr. Hodgkinson lived about 100 yards off a rural road in a two-story home on the outskirts of Belleville. He was a high school wrestler, worked for years in construction and then shifted to the home inspection business, starting his own company, JTH Inspections.Charlene Brennan, a real estate agent in Belleville, said Mr. Hodgkinson had conducted inspections for housing sales she worked on over the years.8 Photos\u201cHe did not come off as a radical,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cHe did not come off as an unstable individual. He wasn\u2019t belligerent. He was just kind of a normal guy.\u201dOn Tuesday morning, he posted a cartoon: \u201cHow does a bill work?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s an easy one, Billy,\u201d the cartoon reads. \u201cCorporations write the bill and then bribe congress until it becomes law.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Exactly How It Works. ...\u201d Mr. Hodgkinson wrote.The page was filled with references to Mr. Sanders, who has called on Democrats to endorse more progressive politics since losing the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton last year.In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders condemned violence of any type. \u201cI am sickened by this despicable act,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLet me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.\u201dMr. Hodgkinson\u2019s behavior got the attention of local authorities several times over the years, records from the St. Clair County Sheriff\u2019s Department show.In April 2006, Mr. Hodgkinson, according to the sheriff\u2019s department, forced his way into a neighbor\u2019s home to find his daughter, grabbed her by the hair and in an ensuing exchange punched his daughter\u2019s friend in the face.Later, when the boyfriend of the daughter\u2019s friend confronted Mr. Hodgkinson at home, the boyfriend told the sheriff\u2019s department that Mr. Hodgkinson had answered the door with a shotgun aimed at his face and struck him with it.Mr. Hodgkinson was charged with domestic battery, aggravated discharge of a firearm and criminal damage to a motor vehicle. The charges were later dismissed.Friends and acquaintances said they were stunned by Wednesday\u2019s shooting. Dale Walsh, who identified himself as a friend who knew him as Tommy, said Mr. Hodgkinson had been a vibrant presence when he was younger.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t evil,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess he was tired of the politics.\u201dIn Alexandria, Mr. Hodgkinson could be found most mornings at the Y.M.C.A., Mr. Euille said. The two men made small talk about politics and old movies, Mr. Euille said, and Mr. Hodgkinson asked about finding work in town and good places to eat. Most days, Mr. Euille said, Mr. Hodgkinson would sit \u2014 often for hours \u2014 in a small reception area on his laptop.That was the case Tuesday morning as well, Mr. Euille said. At some point, Michael Hodgkinson said, his brother called home to tell his wife that he missed her and their dogs and would be coming home.Twenty-four hours later, Mr. Hodgkinson unleashed his attack just a few paces from the gym\u2019s front door, on the well-groomed baseball diamond where the congressmen were practicing.Bill Bryan contributed reporting from Belleville, Ill., Alan Blinder from Atlanta, and Adam Goldman from Washington.

Before the 1960s, it did. You can thank R. Raleigh D\u2019Adamo for the map being color coded by route.Until 1940, when the subway system was taken over by the city\u2019s Board of Transportation, a predecessor of the current Metropolitan Transportation Authority, three companies operated subway trains. The map used three colors to show which company ran each route.In 1964, recognizing that the tricolor maps needed an update, the city\u2019s transit authority held a public contest for a redesign. Mr. D\u2019Adamo, a lawyer and self-described transit aficionado, entered with a map that gave each route a different color.\u201cI wrote that the maps were trying to do too much work with too few colors,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Adamo said recently about the report he submitted with his design, which had seven colors.Mr. D\u2019Adamo\u2019s original map never became official, partly because the contest rules had demanded a geographically accurate layout of the city, but the transit authority later decided to go with a design where the geography was more loosely depicted, Mr. D\u2019Adamo said.His original map was lost, he said.In the years between the contest and the map\u2019s rediscovery, Mr. D\u2019Adamo found his calling \u2014 in transportation.

Fine by End of August", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byEuropean antitrust officials are preparing to hit Google with a potentially record fine by the end of August over some of the Silicon Valley giant\u2019s search services, according to two people with direct knowledge of the case.As well as the fine, European officials could also force Google to alter how it operates in the region, and potentially elsewhere, to give rivals a greater ability to compete.European officials claim that the company favored many of its own digital services, including search and online maps, over those of rivals. Google has denied any wrongdoing.A spokeswoman for the European Union\u2019s executive arm, the European Commission, declined to comment. Representatives for Google were not immediately available for comment.Here\u2019s what you need to know about Google\u2019s lengthy standoff with European competition authorities:Google\u2019s rivals have long complained that it has used its dominant position in online search to favor its other services, including restaurant recommendations and online maps.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The same year, European officials opened a separate investigation into whether Google\u2019s Android software hampered digital competition. That led to official charges against the company last year.The European Union\u2019s third investigation of Google \u2014 into whether some of the company\u2019s advertising products had restricted consumer choice \u2014 resulted in another charge sheet in July 2016.While the investigations are limited to Google\u2019s activities in Europe, the consequences for the company \u2014 whose digital search and advertising businesses dominate in much of the world \u2014 could be far-reaching.Along with a hefty fine, the company, whose online search services have a roughly 90 percent market share in Europe, may also face \u201cremedies,\u201d or changes dictated by the European Union\u2019s competition authority on how it operates across the bloc.That could include tweaking its search algorithms and other technology to give rivals greater prominence in search queries, as well as greater regulatory oversight of its vast online businesses.European competition authorities are expected to hit Google with a combination of large fines and demands that the company changes how it operates across the 28-member bloc.They can fine Google up to about $7.6 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, but the financial penalty is likely to be significantly less than that. While the company can handle the fine, it is likely to appeal to the bloc\u2019s highest court, the European Court of Justice, to contest any efforts to change how it operates.The judges of the European Court of Justice have never overruled the region\u2019s competition authority, though that is still a possibility. Litigation could drag on for years.Google has vocally rebutted Europe\u2019s charges, saying that competition for its search, advertising and other products is only a click away on the internet.The search giant also says that its services have helped consumers, advertisers and even some competitors find digital information.The company adds that the strength of other American technology companies in Europe, including Amazon and Facebook, shows that Google has not restricted Europe\u2019s digital market.In the short term, it will not affect them very much.Legal action is likely to continue for several years.But if European competition officials get their way, experts say that Google may have to tweak its digital services to comply with regulators\u2019 demands.That could either be limited to changes for European users, or it could extend beyond the region, depending on Google\u2019s ability to limit the region\u2019s antitrust actions to the bloc\u2019s borders.Advertisement"}

One attacker was shot and killed, but the second went around to the kitchen area of the mosque, where he detonated his explosives, killing Mr. Hussainzada and three others.One of the dead and four of the eight wounded were Afghan police officers, said Najib Danish, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.A member of Mr. Hussainzada\u2019s family, Ali Sadaat, who was at the mosque during the attack, said his relative \u201cwas a good businessman, a great man and an important figure among the Hazaras.\u201d Mr. Sadaat said Mr. Hussainzada had been known for helping street vendors and day laborers, and for giving money to parents to send their children to school rather than putting them to work.The protesters have accused senior officials of conspiring with terrorists, and some of Mr. Hussainzada\u2019s supporters expressed that view as well.\u201cISIS claimed responsibility, but we are not sure,\u201d Mr. Sadaat said. \u201cIt may be Taliban terrorists, it may be a fifth column in the government. There are too many questions unanswered, like how did these terrorists know about last night\u2019s program?\u201dAhmad Ramazanzada, Mr. Hussainzada\u2019s son, said it was clear to him that his father had been assassinated. Mr. Ramazanzada was reached by telephone at his home, where family members were waiting for all of Mr. Hussainzada\u2019s sons to return from abroad before burying him.\u201cMy father was the target,\u201d Mr. Ramazanzada said. \u201cWhen the suiciders attacked the mosque, there weren\u2019t many people there, and the attacker knew all the alternative routes of the mosque, and he knew where my father was standing.\u201dIn Afghanistan, he said, \u201cwhen too many people love you, and you are getting your place in the heart of everyone, then you are a target for some people.\u201dRod Nordland and Fahim Abed reported from Kabul, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}

Another said she was there because in her years as a comic book geek, she had only ever watched superhero movies surrounded by guys. Yet another came because she didn\u2019t want to overhear fanboys cracking wise about Gal Gadot\u2019s physique, or, for that matter, that of any other woman onscreen.The next day on Twitter, the theater announced a second show. That one, too, sold out in no time flat.It also meant that women at Sunday\u2019s screening in Brooklyn found themselves sharing the Alamo\u2019s waiting area, in the sleek City Point shopping complex, with no fewer than five reporters and a television camera operator. There was no trace of anyone from the anti-all-female screening crowd.To a one, the women seemed pretty amped to see the movie, especially with an all-female audience. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have that, even for just two hours,\u201d said Andrea Lam, 28, a book publicist who lives in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Her friend Mo Lathrop, 33, a translator who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, was glad she didn\u2019t have to be concerned \u201cabout 17-year-olds yelling about Gal Gadot\u2019s bosoms.\u201dThe online fuss roundly prompted eye rolls.\u201cWhen you exclude men from one space, they all say it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Ms. Udden continued. \u201cAnd when women point out the structural problems of patriarchy and the lack of opportunities for women, they say, \u2018Grow a thicker skin.\u2019\u201dSitting beside her on the waiting room\u2019s black leather banquette, Tanya Matos, 54, who works in human resources and came from Staten Island, chalked the backlash up to internet trolls. \u201cCrybabies,\u201d she said.Another moviegoer, Christina Ku, 30, a copywriter, said she didn\u2019t understand the outcry because women had long been denied various rights, like voting. Her friend Samantha Howard, 29, said people becoming angry about something so innocuous made it all the more thrilling.Stephanie Billman, who is in her 40s and is chief of staff for a nonprofit organization, said the criticism felt like the \u201cstatus quo pushing back\u201d but that she didn\u2019t intend to give it much thought. \u201cIt feels entirely ridiculous, and I want to enjoy this more than I want to get upset,\u201d she said.There were murmurings over at the box office. Frank Icano, 26, a painter from Park Slope, came to see the movie with a group of friends and was aghast to learn that not only was it sold out but it had also been restricted to women. Reporters circled him as he vented.\u201cThere are plenty of other female movies that come out, and I\u2019m not able to see this because I have a penis,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Should I Help an Unjustly Fired Co-Worker?", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byThe EthicistA work colleague, a level below me, has managed to succeed despite a pattern of bad performance. She doesn\u2019t seek feedback early or take it well, so her projects consistently become last-minute scrambles that others must fix. She has also been dishonest about timelines and obtaining input from the right people. The pattern continues because she reports to a powerful executive who has not held her accountable for this behavior despite complaints from many co-workers, including me.Recently, she fired a competent, young, lower-level employee in her group who tried to improve these processes. To fire this employee, my colleague went through proper human-resources channels. In some ways the firing is merciful, as she was, at times, verbally abusive to the employee even as the employee was helping to fix her messes. Understandably, other co-workers who witnessed these incidents were upset by them and felt as if the employee was treated and terminated unfairly. The junior employee retained a lawyer to show that her firing was retaliatory.I believe this young employee was caught in the impossible situation of trying to make sure work was done well even as her boss wanted it done a different way, one that was clearly not optimal. Now I am being asked by the fired employee\u2019s lawyer to tell what I know of the situation, and my company will ask me not to speak on the subject.What is my ethical obligation? If I am silent, I am complicit in what I think is an unfair judgment of this young employee, which will certainly have real implications for her and her career. But I cannot openly speak against the company and the way it allowed this situation to develop without damaging my own relationship with the company, which is otherwise good.Down the road, if you\u2019re required to testify under oath, you will, of course, have to tell the truth, whatever your bosses want. But for the moment, you face a choice: You can help someone who was unjustly fired, by voluntarily cooperating with her lawyer and agreeing to give evidence against your company, or you can protect your own position.Which way to go depends on at least two considerations. First, does the fired employee have sufficient evidence to get justice without your intervention? (You say that she didn\u2019t do things as her boss preferred; that she followed her own better judgment. That\u2019s not always O.K.) Second, how much damage would helping her do to your relationship with your own supervisors? Basically, if you can help her a lot by sacrificing a little, you ought to do it.The philosopher Richard W. Miller once imagined a situation in which you see an adult plunging out of a 10th-story window, and you know you can save his life if you cushion his fall \u2014 but at the cost to you of assorted broken bones and months of painful, imperfect healing. Doing your moral duty, Miller argued, didn\u2019t oblige you to take the hit. Nor are you required to derail your career in order to assist the young woman\u2019s legal case. But what if the trade-off isn\u2019t so clear: What if you would be helping her somewhat and hurting yourself somewhat?You appear to believe that your supervisors will continue to tolerate the managerial incompetence of the powerful executive and the abusive subordinate in order to protect the company in the face of a possible lawsuit. That\u2019s a plausible assumption. But if the cost to your work life wouldn\u2019t be dire, you should go to your supervisor, describe your view of the situation, observe that you and others will have to tell the truth if the case gets to the point at which you are giving testimony under oath and point out that it\u2019s in the company\u2019s interest to stop this from happening again.My family has gone through a lot these past couple of years. My mother died of cancer after a yearlong battle, during which my father had a midlife crisis and an affair. The family business went under, and though we\u2019re not exactly in poverty, we did lose our comfortable upper-middle-class lifestyle. Thankfully, my younger brother, and I (we are in our mid-20s) both have stable white-collar jobs that pay well enough. I do earn more than my brother and at times, I have helped him and my father financially. (I am happy to do so.)Last Christmas, I visited my maternal grandmother, who has had some financial quandaries of her own. She lives with my 40-year-old uncle, who has neither a career nor, it\u2019s safe to say, much money; my parents had been their financial safety net until things started going downhill for my father\u2019s business. During my visit, she asked me for a loan to invest in her small business. I would have given her the money as a gift \u2014 except that she\u2019s asking for roughly two-thirds of my monthly salary, way more than what my brother or my father have ever asked for, and the amount is also something that I would feel.OkCupid\u2019s contract says that a profile should be for \u201cbona fide relationship-\u200bseeking purposes\u201d and urges all members to report \u201cfraudulent registration or profiles.\u201d They don\u2019t explicitly mention pretending to be unmarried, but you might think that that was mala fide (i.e., the opposite of bona fide). So you could try telling OkCupid. And there\u2019s a small chance you might be able to do something for other women in your situation by contacting this Lothario through the site and suggesting that, rather than pretending to be single, he should admit he\u2019s after a little discreet adultery.

{"Headline": "Small Businesses Cheer \u2018New Sheriff in Town\u2019 After Climate Pact Exit", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byAs news that President Trump was pulling out of the Paris climate accord hit at a luncheon for small-business owners in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday, an already happy crowd suddenly turned euphoric.\u201cIt was like a major win at a football game,\u201d said Rick Longenecker, a management consultant who had been among the 50 or so attendees who gathered to trade thoughts amid a rapidly improving local economy.While multinational corporations such as Disney, Goldman Sachs and IBM have opposed the president\u2019s decision to walk away from the international climate agreement, many small companies around the country were cheering him on, embracing the choice as a tough-minded business move that made good on Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to put America\u2019s commercial interests first.This full-throated support from the small-business community comes even as the Trump administration struggles to advance health care legislation and tax reform plans through Congress \u2014 and despite the swelling controversy over Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.In Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and beyond, many small businesses are reporting improved sales and bigger work forces \u2014 regardless of what is going on in Washington.\u201cThere is a new sheriff in town,\u201d said Louis M. Soltis, the owner of a company in Toledo that manufactures control panels for large factories. \u201cBut the biggest frustration that I have is that there is so much resistance that is keeping him from moving forward.\u201dIn the months following Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, as stock markets hit historical highs and companies kept adding jobs, the business community as a whole seemed willing to give the president a chance to follow through on his bold promises to revitalize the economy by cutting taxes and rolling back regulations.Many small-business leaders in the Midwest, on the other hand, were largely unfazed.For those more concerned with their local economies than global greenhouse gas emissions, walking away from the Paris agreement was just another example of a bottom-line business decision made by a president who knows a good deal from a bad one.\u201cThis just heightens the divide between big business and small business,\u201d said Jeffrey Korzenik, an investment strategist for Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati who spends much of his time talking to small businesses in the Midwest. \u201cThey really have different worldviews.\u201dAt the root of this disconnect is a sense that companies that employ up to a few hundred workers \u2014 such companies make up 99 percent of businesses in the United States and account for half of its private sector employment \u2014 are held to a more onerous standard than their larger peers when it comes to complying with regulations.At the Toledo luncheon, for example, much of the discussion centered on the fact that the climate treaty is nonbinding. To businessmen who have spent the past 10 years complaining of ceaseless rules and regulations, the very idea that the climate pact lacked teeth was galling.\u201cWhen companies here do business with a Ford or a G.M., they sign a contract that is not only binding \u2014 in many cases it is pretty harsh,\u201d Mr. Longenecker said. \u201cNow we have this deal to prevent a global catastrophe, and it\u2019s nonbinding? That is ridiculous. And it makes us think that there is a hidden agenda, that we are just transferring trillions of dollars to China.\u201dTo some small business executives, seeing the president talk tough to the Europeans and the Chinese was a reminder of why they voted for him in the first place.\u201cI think that we\u2019re making a very big deal over a molehill,\u201d said Dave Griggs, owner of Dave Griggs Flooring America in Columbia, Mo. which employs 16 people. \u201cI think the president is exactly right, we need to certainly renegotiate.\u201dBut local business leaders are not without their worries.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a Republican Congress, a Republican president; hopefully we can get some initiatives passed,\u201d Mr. Griggs said. \u201cI am highly optimistic.\u201dBut by and large, local business leaders said they remained supportive of the president and believed the attention on his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia was overblown.John Bagge, 64, who runs a catering company in Kirkland, Wash., with his wife and two daughters, said his business was booming \u2014 so much so that this was the first summer he has had to turn away customers in 40 years.The chief executives of big American companies were less sanguine, and many distanced themselves from Mr. Trump.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, both resigned from the president\u2019s economic advisory council on Thursday.\u201cClimate change is real,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter. \u201cLeaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\u201dOther big company executives \u2014 including the chief executives Douglas McMillon of Walmart and Virginia M. Rometty of IBM \u2014 voiced their opposition to the president\u2019s decision but said they would remain on the council.\u201cDisappointed in today\u2019s news about the Paris Agreement,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cWe think it\u2019s important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201dDespite remaining broadly supportive of the president, some businessmen said that the whirlwind of controversies was beginning to raise questions about just how effective this administration could be.Jim Stouffer, Jr. the president of Catawba Island Club, a local resort in Port Clinton, Ohio, said he supported the decision to leave the Paris agreement, but added that he was growing more uncertain of what the future holds.\u201cI don\u2019t know what his endgame is,\u201d he said.Rachel Abrams contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The company, based in San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, has already raised about $500 million over the past three years and was valued by investors last year at about $4 billion.In the past few years, Slack has also stirred acquisition interest from potential buyers, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, according to three people with knowledge of the acquisition offers. Most recently, Amazon expressed interest in acquiring Slack, these people said.Slack\u2019s messaging product, introduced in 2014, was initially a cult hit that grew mostly by word of mouth, a rare feat for a company that caters to businesses rather than consumers.Tools made by Slack are now used daily by five million people, up from four million in October. For about 1.5 million of those, Slack is paid $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search, but most customers use a free version. The company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable.Stewart Butterfield, Slack\u2019s chief executive, has said publicly that he wants to build a giant company and that he has therefore been opportunistic about amassing a war chest of capital.Slack is trying to sign on more large companies as customers.

{"Headline": "\u2018Goodbye, Weapons!\u2019 FARC Disarmament in Colombia Signals New Era", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byMESETAS, Colombia \u2014 As United Nations inspectors slammed shut a shipping container filled with rifles, fighters from Colombia\u2019s largest rebel group cheered on Tuesday morning when their leader declared that they had laid down their arms after 52 years of guerrilla war.It may yet be some time before every weapon the rebels fired in Colombia is accounted for. But the ceremony signaled to the country that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish initials as the FARC, would no longer threaten Colombians as it had for generations.\u201cGoodbye, weapons! Goodbye, war!\u201d Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, the FARC leader known as Timochenko, shouted to the fighters.The rebels have abandoned their battle camps for demobilization camps like the one in a lush stretch of countryside near Mesetas \u2014 temporary settlements of tents and drywall buildings where the rebels have been slowly handing over their weapons, 7,132 at last count.Some rifles will remain at the camps for security purposes until Aug. 1, the United Nations inspectors said, and rebel weapons caches were still being examined. But for the most part, the inspectors said, the disarmament is essentially complete.The weapons have been packed for shipment out of the country, to be melted down and used to build monuments. Rank-and-file rebels will soon be free to trade their fatigues for civilian clothes and begin new lives. And the FARC is laying plans to become a political party, much like the parties that emerged from guerrilla groups in post-conflict El Salvador and Guatemala.The Colombian government must now tackle a host of challenges under the complicated peace agreement with the FARC, which took years to negotiate. Special tribunals are to be established to settle war-crimes cases, and farmers are to be given incentives to stop growing coca leaf. (The rebels largely controlled the cocaine trade in Colombia.)\u201cThe goal of ending the war has essentially been met,\u201d said Cynthia J. Arnson, the director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cIt\u2019s implementing the 300-plus-page document, with 100 different programs and strategies, that\u2019s going to be difficult.\u201dAfter the referendum, Mr. Santos got the Colombian Congress to approve a revised deal with FARC without submitting it to another referendum. But with his term scheduled to end next year, he has been under constant attack from conservatives, including critics who say that the FARC will not reveal all the weapons and cash it has hidden in the jungle, something analysts say is possible.The ceremony on Tuesday offered Mr. Santos a chance to remind his country that peace with the FARC had been awaited by generations of Colombians.\u201cThis is the best news for Colombia in 50 years \u2014 this is great news of peace,\u201d he said, adding that the country could now finally unify as a democracy. \u201cToday we see the end of this absurd war.\u201dAt the FARC camp, in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia, about 460 fighters now spend their days contemplating the unarmed life ahead of them. They were glued to mobile phones this weekend, talking to families on Facebook and WhatsApp, which were unknown to most of the fighters before this year.Shipping containers holding the decommissioned weapons sat on the camp\u2019s perimeter, watched and sealed by United Nations observers in baseball caps. Though Colombian Army Black Hawk helicopters occasionally flew overhead, the peace agreement forbids soldiers to enter the camp.Many rebels complained about months of delay in getting building materials to the camp, leaving it looking like a construction site, and many fighters still slept outdoors in hammocks, as they had in the jungle during the war. If the camp-building process was so halting, they asked, how could they expect the rest of the peace deal to be carried out smoothly?Disarming has proved difficult, too.Naida L\u00f3pez, 32, spent nearly two decades with the rebels, after the military killed her parents and she ran away. She said it was hard for her, as an orphan, to give up the protection of her weapon and her comrades.\u201cFor every guerrilla fighter, their weapon has always been their most loyal friend, which has always accompanied them,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people have names for their rifle.\u201dLike many of the rebels, Ms. L\u00f3pez is afraid of what might happen now that the former guerrillas must depend on the state for protection. She mentioned the last time the FARC experimented with political participation, running candidates for office under the Patriotic Union party banner, only to face massacres by right-wing paramilitary groups that the government failed to stop. Those groups still exist.\u201cThey could kill us one by one,\u201d Ms. L\u00f3pez said.The rebels have found consolation and warmth in visits to the camp by loved ones they have not seen in years. Omaira Solarte, 32, saw her parents at the end of May, 18 years after she joined the FARC.\u201cBefore, it was difficult to talk to your family,\u201d she said. \u201cYou would give away your position to the enemy.\u201dMs. Solarte intends to join the FARC\u2019s planned political party in a few months and work as an activist in the countryside, perhaps promoting rural health care. But in the meantime, she is worried about conditions at the camp, where she says the government has not provided adequate medical treatment.\u201cIf we get ill, we are left alone,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s how things are now, how will it be when we don\u2019t have our guns?\u201dGaitan Duke, 33, said he was looking forward to getting to know his country without a weapon slung over his shoulder, perhaps to visit relatives or some of the country\u2019s indigenous communities in the interior.He repeated a mantra heard widely in the camp \u2014 that far from surrendering, the rebels were transforming themselves for a new, democratic fight.\u201cWe are not demobilizing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are laying down our weapons to become an open and legal political movement.\u201dNicholas Casey reported from Mesetas, and Joe Parkin Daniels from Puerto As\u00eds, Colombia.Advertisement"}

He toils at a standing desk, listening to classic rock as he pores over budget documents, plots out the administration\u2019s agenda for overhauling the tax code and health care system and plans for a fight over the debt ceiling.The biggest fight in Congress this summer will most likely be about raising the debt ceiling. The Trump administration recently warned that the limit on federal borrowing needs to be increased before members of Congress go home for August recess.While Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has called for a \u201cclean\u201d debt-ceiling increase, with nothing attached to the bill, Mr. Mulvaney would like to see it coupled with other reforms or spending cuts. He said the White House had not decided yet whether the bill must be clean, but he was certain that he would get the ceiling raised.\u201cIf the debt ceiling is not raised, you have some difficulties. There\u2019s no question,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said cautiously. \u201cThere is absolutely no way that the U.S. will ever default on its debt. We are not going to do that.\u201dThe Congressional Budget Office has offered some dire forecasts of the Republican health care plan, and in the interview Mr. Mulvaney accused the nonpartisan scorekeeper of being politically biased.\u201cThey\u2019re people and they bring their own personal perspectives on things,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said, arguing that people who evaluate the effects of legislation have too much influence in the legislative process.Mr. Mulvaney said the C.B.O.\u2019s methodology was \u201cmiserable\u201d when making forecasts for the Affordable Care Act. While he would not say the C.B.O. should be abolished, he did call for changes to the 1974 law that created the office.The bottom line on nearly every policy decision in the Trump administration is getting sustained 3 percent economic growth. According to Mr. Mulvaney, that is what exiting the Paris accord was all about.\u201cIf we were going to live up to the promises that the Obama administration put in those documents, and if we were going to allow other countries to live up to their lack of commitments in those documents, it would have hindered our ability to get back to a healthy American economy,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said.The White House has been accused of using overly optimistic economic growth projections in justifying a tax cut that will not increase the budget deficit. Mr. Mulvaney rejects the idea that demographic and technological shifts have made 3-percent growth a thing of the past. He argues that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, eliminating regulations and cutting taxes will unleash pent-up economic activity.Preaching fiscal restraint is not necessarily the best way to win a popularity contest in Washington. Where does it come from? Mr. Mulvaney, 49, attributes his concerns over wasteful spending to his upbringing. His grandparents lived through the Great Depression and his father was a small-business man who never took money for granted.\u201cWhen you grew up in a household where mom would keep the extra ketchup packets from McDonald\u2019s and keep them in a drawer just in case there came a day when you couldn\u2019t afford to buy ketchup anymore, that gets ingrained in you,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said.Cost-consciousness is not just a policy preference for Mr. Mulvaney, but also a personal trait. On Friday his spartan lunch consisted of a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, eaten quickly before his next meeting.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Peter Pan?\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said of his choice of sandwich spread.Advertisement"}

Epidemic", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "FeatureWhy do America\u2019s black gay and bisexual men have a higher H.I.V. rate than any country in the world?Supported byNegotiating a maze of unpaved roads in Jackson in the company car, a 13-year-old Ford Expedition with cracked seats and chipped paint, he stopped to drop off H.I.V. medication at a couple\u2019s home. One of the men was H.I.V.-positive, the other negative; they lived in the neighborhood locals call the Bottom, where every fifth or sixth home is abandoned, with broken windows, doors hanging off hinges, downed limbs and dry leaves blanketing front yards. Sturdevant banged on the door of a small house, its yard overgrown with weeds; he knew not to leave the package on the doorstep, where it could be stolen. After a while a young man emerged, shirtless, shrugging off sleep. He had just gotten out of jail. Sturdevant handed him the package, shook his hand and told him to \u201cstay out of trouble.\u201dSturdevant drove on another 15 minutes to pick up Marq (a shortened version of his name to protect his privacy), a teenager who was still reeling from the H.I.V. diagnosis he received the previous spring. As they headed to and from a doctor\u2019s appointment and a meeting with a counselor, Sturdevant, slow-talking and patient, with eyes that disappear into his cheekbones when he smiles and a snowy beard, gently grilled him, reminding him to stay on his meds. The teenager slumped in the back seat, half listening, half checking his texts. He looked up briefly when Sturdevant told him, \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d But Marq barely said goodbye as he jumped out of the car in front of a convenience store on an avenue scattered with a pawnshop, a liquor store and several Baptist churches, and he all but admitted he was planning to spend the afternoon smoking weed and looking at Instagram. \u201cKnucklehead,\u201d Sturdevant whispered, as the teenager slammed the door. Pulling off his favorite Dallas Cowboys baseball cap and running a hand over his bald head, Sturdevant added softly, \u201cBreaks my heart.\u201dThese patients of Sturdevant\u2019s are the faces of one of America\u2019s most troubling public-health crises. Thanks to the success of lifesaving antiretroviral medication pioneered 20 years ago and years of research and education, most H.I.V.-positive people today can lead long, healthy lives. In cities like New York and San Francisco, once ground zero for the AIDS epidemic, the virus is no longer a death sentence, and rates of infection have plummeted. In fact, over the past several years, public-health officials have championed the idea that an AIDS-free generation could be within reach \u2014 even without a vaccine. But in certain pockets of the country, unknown to most Americans, H.I.V. is still ravaging communities at staggering rates.The South also has the highest numbers of people living with H.I.V. who don\u2019t know they have been infected, which means they are not engaged in lifesaving treatment and care \u2014 and are at risk of infecting others. An unconscionable number of them are dying: In 2014, according to a new analysis from Duke University, 2,952 people in the Deep South (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas) died with H.I.V. as an underlying cause, with the highest death rates in Mississippi and Louisiana. Among black men in this region, the H.I.V.-related death rate was seven times as high as that of the United States population at large.Sturdevant, born and raised in Metcalfe, a tiny Mississippi Delta town of about 1,000, understands all too well the fear, stigma and isolation that can come with being a black gay man in the South. \u201cGrowing up, I was taught that God was not fixing to forgive a person who was homosexual,\u201d Sturdevant said. \u201cThe Bible supposedly said you\u2019re going straight to hell, automatically, there\u2019s no forgiveness. There were several times I thought about suicide. There were several times I wanted to get sick and die. Finally, my thought was, I just want to get out of here.\u201d He moved to Dallas, and then to Memphis.When he learned he had H.I.V. in 2005, Sturdevant knew little about the virus and was too depressed and ashamed to tell anyone at first. When his partner died the following year, he let the disease consume him. \u201cI was weak, had a fever of 103, couldn\u2019t even keep down water,\u201d he recalled. Sturdevant has shared his story too many times to count, to let young men know that he has been there, too, and to help them understand that they can survive this plague. He also knows that many black gay and bisexual men have been rejected and discarded, and has wrapped his arms around as many as he can grab hold of, treating them like family. Sturdevant has two daughters from an early marriage and three grandchildren, but he says he feels just as strongly about his 16 or so unrelated \u201cchildren,\u201d most of them living with H.I.V. He feeds them, sometimes houses them, but mostly listens to them. \u201cYoung black men feel abandoned and need someone they can believe in and who believes in them,\u201d Sturdevant said as he drove past fields of fluffy cotton, his hands resting lightly on the steering wheel. \u201cI told God I want to be able to help guys like me, that didn\u2019t grow up with their father, and they started coming to me, wanting to talk. After a while, they would bring other people to me and say, \u2018Dad, can you help him, too?\u2019\u2009\u201dSturdevant moved his seat back, preparing for a long drive, and adjusted the radio to 107.5, the local R.&B. oldies station. Toni Braxton\u2019s wail \u2014 \u201cI wish you\u2019d hold me in your arms like that Spanish guitar\u201d \u2014 filled the car. He was headed to a small town 90 miles east of the city to visit Jordon, an H.I.V.-positive 24-year-old. When Sturdevant himself was at his lowest point, he said, \u201cI looked something like this boy we\u2019re going to see.\u201dHe took a call from De\u2019Bronski, one of the \u201csons\u201d he has cared for and bonded with. Sturdevant met the young man in 2009 and took him in; he later helped him deal with his H.I.V. diagnosis. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d Sturdevant told him. Then he turned down a dead-end street and pulled up in front of the one-story brick home where Jordon lived. \u201cI\u2019m real worried about him,\u201d Sturdevant said, lowering his voice as he walked up the driveway\u2019s cracked pavement toward the front door. Jordon had recently posted a photo of his skeletal frame on Facebook, asking friends to \u201cpray for me.\u201dIn February 2016, Jordon suddenly found himself too weak and tired to attend the community-college classes he had enrolled in; he could hardly lift his head from his mother\u2019s couch. He wasn\u2019t accustomed to being sick and had tested negative for H.I.V. just five months before, so thinking he had a bad cold, he waited weeks before his family forced him to go to the emergency room at a hospital in his small town, where he was tested again. \u201cThe doctor said to me, \u2018Your H.I.V. is so bad \u2014 how could you not know?\u2019\u2009\u201d Jordon recounted through tears. He ended up in intensive care for three weeks. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d He paused and then added quietly, \u201cIt was the worst day of my life.\u201dWith effort, Jordon sat up slightly, untangling himself from a jumble of sheets. Sturdevant asked how he was doing, and he cataloged a laundry list of what he called his \u201cold man\u201d ailments. \u201cI\u2019ve had everything \u2014 diarrhea, hemorrhoids, now this neuropathy,\u201d he said. \u201cMy body hates me.\u201d Once a month, his mother or grandmother drove him to medical appointments in Jackson, to receive care from providers experienced in treating people living with H.I.V. and to avoid the small-town gaze at the local facilities; there is no Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis for him to visit in his small town, as there would be if he lived in New York. \u201cEverybody knows everybody here,\u201d Jordon said. \u201cAt the hospital, they know my mom and my brother and my grandmother. I would rather be around people who don\u2019t know me.\u201d Too ashamed to admit that he had the virus, Jordon had told few friends about his diagnosis.\u201cAre you taking your medicine?\u201d Sturdevant asked. For many young men, the H.I.V. diagnosis and the illness are so overwhelming that maintaining a new and unfamiliar regimen of medication can be difficult. Jordon looked down. \u201cNot as often as I should.\u201d When he saw Sturdevant\u2019s glare, he continued, sounding like a little boy. \u201cI hate taking medicine; I hate it. I have to take six pills, now seven, eight, plus a shot \u2014\u201dSturdevant cut him off. \u201cWe all have to do this, Jordon. Don\u2019t you want to get better?\u201dJordon let his head fall back on the pillow. \u201cI know I can get better, Mr. Ced,\u201d he said, massaging his feet. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how everything got so bad.\u201dGiven the advances in research, information and treatment, it seems inconceivable that someone living with the virus today, like Jordon, could look as if he had stepped out of the early years of the epidemic. And yet a series of fateful decisions and omissions, dating back to the discovery of the disease, have led to a present that looks like the past \u2014 but only for some.Dr. Michael Gottlieb, the lead author of the report and a renowned physician specializing in H.I.V./AIDS, treated Rock Hudson before he died of AIDS complications in 1985 and still practices in Los Angeles. Gottlieb said he is often asked why he didn\u2019t include in that first report the documented case of the gay African-American man, who had both PCP and cytomegalovirus, a virus that attacks the organs of patients with compromised immune systems. He explains that he discovered the case after the report was finalized. \u201cUntil recently, I wouldn\u2019t have thought it mattered,\u201d said Gottlieb, who said that he and others on the front line were grappling with an unprecedented and frightening medical mystery and largely working in the dark. \u201cBut in retrospect, I think it might\u2019ve made a difference among gay black men.\u201dIncluding gay black men in the literature and understanding of the origins of the disease and its treatment could have meant earlier outreach, more of a voice and a standing in H.I.V./AIDS advocacy organizations, and access to the cultural and financial power of the L.G.B.T. community that would rise up to demand government action. But 35 years of neglect, compounded by poverty and inadequate local health care infrastructure, have left too many black gay and bisexual men falling through a series of safety nets.In 2011, HPTN 052, a study of 1,763 couples in 13 cities on four continents funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, found that people infected with H.I.V. are far less likely to infect their sexual partners when put on treatment immediately instead of waiting until their immune systems begin to fall apart. This \u201ctest and treat\u201d strategy also significantly reduces the risk of illness and death. The data was so persuasive that the federal government began pushing new H.I.V./AIDS treatment guidelines to health care providers the following year. And in 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved the preventive use of Truvada, in the form of a daily pill to be taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (commonly called PrEP). It has been found to be up to 99 percent effective in preventing people who have not been infected with H.I.V. from contracting the virus, based on the results of two large clinical trials; an estimated 80,000 patients have filled prescriptions over the past four years.But these measures have not extended to most black gay and bisexual men. A C.D.C. report in February noted that only 48 percent of black gay and bisexual men effectively suppress the virus with consistent medication, and the numbers are even lower for these men in their late teens and 20s. In 2014, nearly one in five black gay men who had received a diagnosis of H.I.V. had progressed to AIDS by the time they learned of their infection \u2014 which meant that they were generally very ill by the time they began treatment. Only a small percentage of black people use PrEP to prevent contracting the virus, accounting for only 10 percent of prescriptions; the vast majority of users are white. Many black gay and bisexual men either can\u2019t afford PrEP or don\u2019t know about it \u2014 they may not see a doctor regularly at all, and many medical providers haven\u2019t even heard of PrEP.Turning things around would mean expanding testing and providing affordable treatment for those who are positive \u2014 to stop sickness and dying and also to block transmission of the virus. It would also require getting information and medication, including PrEP, to those most at risk. Even more challenging would be reducing the stigma, discrimination and shame that drive gay and bisexual men to hide their sexuality and avoid the health care system \u2014 and making sure providers have adequate resources and understand how to care for H.I.V. patients.\u201cIt\u2019s deeply troubling when 50 percent of African-American gay men are expected to get H.I.V. during their lifetime, but it\u2019s also been a clarion call for all of us to improve on what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, the director of the C.D.C.\u2019s National Center for H.I.V./AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, S.T.D. and TB Prevention. \u201cWhat we have been trying to do is ensure that we\u2019re having the greatest effect with the resources we\u2019re provided.\u201dJune Gipson, president and chief executive of My Brother\u2019s Keeper, the Jackson nonprofit Cedric Sturdevant works for, believes that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act wouldn\u2019t have an immediate catastrophic effect in her state \u2014 but only because things are already so dire. Like most of the South, Mississippi refused Medicaid expansion, and nearly half of its citizens who are living with H.I.V. rely on the Ryan White H.I.V./AIDS Program to stay alive. Named for an Indiana teenager who contracted H.I.V. through a blood transfusion in the \u201980s, this federal program provides funding for H.I.V. treatment and care for those who have no other way to finance their medication. If the A.C.A. is repealed, Gipson said, \u201cit just means that the entire country becomes Mississippi.\u201dBlack America, however, never got a Pepfar. Though the raw numbers were much lower than in Africa, parts of our country looked like the continent the program was created to save. Yet while buckets of money went overseas, domestic funding for H.I.V./AIDS remained flat, and efforts to fight the disease here were reduced to a poorly coordinated patchwork affair. \u201cWhen we saw that the epidemic was out of proportion in the black community, we started calling for a domestic Pepfar that would bring new resources to the effort, create clear and ambitious objectives and rebuild health care infrastructure around the country,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut we just couldn\u2019t get the administration to focus on a domestic plan.\u201dGreg Millett, a senior scientist for the C.D.C. for 14 years and a senior policy adviser for the Obama administration\u2019s White House Office of National AIDS Policy, put it more candidly. \u201cDuring the Bush years, the administration dropped all pretense that they cared about AIDS in this country,\u201d said Millett, who is now the vice president and director of public policy at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research. \u201cThe White House said H.I.V. is only a problem in sub-Saharan Africa, and that message filtered down to the public. Though the Bush administration did wonderful work in combating H.I.V. globally, the havoc that it wreaked on the domestic epidemic has been long-lasting.\u201dBeginning in the late \u201990s, the United States government funneled billions of federal dollars into abstinence-until-marriage programs here and abroad. In place of effective sex education, these programs often discouraged condom use while teaching abstinence as the only way to prevent the spread of AIDS \u2014 even as well-regarded research established that this kind of sex education does not lower the risk of contracting H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases.During this time, many scientists, researchers and government administrators were afraid to speak openly about condoms, needle exchange and L.G.B.T. issues for fear of reprisal and loss of funding. Community organizations became targets of anti-gay crusades, subjected to intense scrutiny, including exhaustive audits, by federal agencies. \u201cIt is no coincidence that new rates of H.I.V. infection among gay men, especially gay black men, began to spike sharply from 2000 on, because of an anti-science campaign that allowed for little or nothing to be done for a maligned community simply due to ideology and bigotry,\u201d Millett said. \u201cThe hostile environment made funding effective H.I.V.-prevention programs, messages or research impossible for U.S. communities most impacted by H.I.V.\u201dAs the center of the epidemic has moved from New York and San Francisco to the smaller cities in the South, and from gay white men of means to poorer people of color, L.G.B.T. advocacy and fund-raising has shifted to marriage equality. In 2013, H.I.V. activists persuaded 35 L.G.B.T. leaders to sign a statement and create a video imploring the greater gay community to recommit to the AIDS struggle. The message: \u201cWe need you to come back.\u201d But of $168 million in H.I.V./AIDS philanthropic dollars spent in the United States in 2015, $31 million was disbursed to the South, just 19 percent of total H.I.V. philanthropy in the United States; only $26 million directly targeted African-Americans, and just $16 million went directly to gay and bisexual men, according to the organization Funders Concerned About AIDS.In a too brightly lit wood-paneled back room, Sturdevant and the younger men set up a table, displaying brochures, condoms, lube and a few lollipops. Stevenson and Watson, both open, friendly and handsome, attracted a few guys to the table, but mainly ones who had already heard the protect-yourself-against-H.I.V. spiel. Stevenson pointed out that the crowd was sparse \u2014 maybe 50 men and a few transgender women \u2014 because so many Jackson residents were attending the annual state fair. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s always hard to make contact in the club,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer one on one. That way it\u2019s not, \u2018I\u2019m trying to educate you\u2019; we\u2019re just talking and having fun. I tell them what I do, and they feel comfortable asking questions.\u201dStevenson took out his phone and opened Jack\u2019d, a hookup app popular with men of color. He pulled up his \u201cprofessional\u201d profile \u2014 on which he\u2019s smiling, clean-cut and buttoned-up amid a sea of bare chests and crotch shots. At the bottom he had put a link to a website with information about PrEP; next to it he\u2019d written: \u201cInbox me if you want to know more.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a bunch of messages asking about side effects, how much it costs and does it work,\u201d Stevenson said. He and Watson said they take the medication \u201cjust in case.\u201dAfter an hour they folded up the table and stuffed the condoms and brochures back into a gym bag, dropped it next to Sturdevant, who was sipping a syrupy cocktail from a can, and headed out to the dance floor. A remix of Rihanna\u2019s \u201cWhere Have You Been\u201d came on, so loud the walls shook. Like everyone else, Stevenson and Watson, who are dance coaches and choreographers, had perfected their moves from watching YouTube videos of the Prancing J-Settes. Stevenson bent and thrust, at once explosive, angular and precise. Watson\u2019s face was still as a stone; as he snapped his neck to the side, his waist-length dreadlocks whipped around his head. After a few songs, the music ended as the club prepared for a 1 a.m. drag show. Stevenson, sweaty and breathless, melted into a conversation with other dancers.Everybody knows everybody else in Jackson\u2019s small, tight-knit black gay community, and most men will find their sexual partners in this network. Most scientists now believe that risk of contracting H.I.V. boils down to a numbers game rather than a blame game: If the virus is not present in your sexual network, you can have unprotected sex and not get infected. But if you are in a community, like Jackson, where a high percentage of gay and bisexual men are infected with H.I.V. \u2014 and many don\u2019t know it and go untreated \u2014 any unprotected sexual encounter becomes a potential time bomb. This explanation of \u201cviral load\u201d helps dispel the stubbornly held notion that gay and bisexual black men have more sex than other men, a false perception embedded in the American sexual imagination and fueled by stereotypes of black men as hypersexual Mandingos dating back to slavery.An elevated viral load in a smaller sexual network (because most people still tend to have sex with people of the same race), amplified by the structural issues that Moore pointed to, also explains why H.I.V. rates have always been disproportionately high in the black community over all. But in the first decades of the epidemic, these ideas and explanations had not been widely accepted to explain the growing body of data pointing to fast-rising numbers of H.I.V. cases among black heterosexuals \u2014 in rates unmatched by those of white Americans. In fact, the African-American community was largely in denial about the fact that H.I.V./AIDS was a black issue. Worse, most believed the disease was a conspiracy on the part of the federal government to kill off the race, God\u2019s punishment for homosexuality or simply not a subject for polite conversation, because the disease was thought to be connected to promiscuity and crack and heroin use.The community\u2019s awakening came in 1991, when Magic Johnson tearfully announced, \u201cBecause of the H.I.V. virus I have obtained, I will have to retire from the Lakers today,\u201d and warned, \u201cIt can happen to anyone.\u201d By 1994, AIDS had become the No. 1 killer of all African-Americans ages 25 to 44. The virus was 16 times as common in black women as in their white counterparts \u2014 and the gap would widen over the next few years. I was an editor at Essence in 1994 when the magazine\u2019s editor in chief, Susan L. Taylor, insisted that we shine a light on the disturbing increase of H.I.V. among African-American women by putting Rae Lewis Thornton, a Chicago woman who described herself as \u201cyoung, educated, drug-free and dying of AIDS,\u201d on the cover.I had been writing about AIDS in the black community since the mid-\u201980s but had never seen anything like the coordinated efforts that started in the late \u201990s, when civil rights groups, politicians, clergy, fraternities and sororities and celebrities stepped up to encourage testing and distribute prevention information. All the major black publications collaborated in a highly visible campaign to spotlight the disease as a major health crisis. Black churches created AIDS ministries and offered H.I.V. testing \u2014 and the number of congregations participating in the Black Church Week of Prayer for the Healing of AIDS ballooned to more than 10,000.Most of the lock-step mobilization efforts focused on preventing the disease in black women, who, for the most part, were contracting the virus through sex with male partners. Though the C.D.C. and other agencies offered plenty of alarming statistics confirming the high and growing numbers of H.I.V. cases and deaths among black women, there was a lack of empirical evidence to clearly explain why the rates were so high. Experts in academia and government researchers tried to unravel a knotted tangle of factors: Women were contracting the virus from bisexual men; higher rates of sexually transmitted infections among black women facilitated the spread of H.I.V.; socioeconomic issues drove up the rates of all disease. The lack of research to create a coherent explanation was further confounded by a reluctance on the part of some scientists and activists to perpetuate the dangerous myth of black women as sexually promiscuous \u2014 another holdover from slavery.Given the confusion, it was simplest to latch onto the most provocative idea: that black gay men, who we knew were also contracting H.I.V. in high numbers, provided a \u201cbridge to infection\u201d to black heterosexual women, a phrase I first heard from researchers at a medical conference. As the theory went, closeted black gay men were using women as unsuspecting \u201ccover girls\u201d to hide their sexuality and then infecting them with H.I.V. In my reporting for both The Times and Essence, I found no shortage of anecdotal accounts of H.I.V.-positive women who were infected by male partners who had been having sex with other men in secret. As a black lesbian myself, I understood the stigma, shame and fear that could drive black gay men to create seemingly straight lives while sleeping with men \u2014 and end up unwittingly infecting their female partners with H.I.V. This idea made a certain amount of sense in the frustrating absence of scientific data.In retrospect, the high rate of H.I.V. infection among African-American women was a result of a complicated combination of all these factors, as well as the reality that after decades of denial and neglect, the viral load piled up in black communities, making any unprotected sexual encounter with anyone a potential \u201cbridge to infection.\u201d But two decades ago, in the midst of a very scary, fast-growing epidemic, the down-low brother became the AIDS boogeyman. I first heard about the \u201cD.L.\u201d from J.L. King, an author and self-proclaimed sex educator whom I interviewed in 2001. He had just warned a rapt audience of health care providers and H.I.V. educators at an AIDS conference in Washington: \u201cI sleep with men, but I am not bisexual, and I am certainly not gay. I am not going to your clinics, I am not going to read your brochures, I am not going to get tested. I assure you that none of the brothers on the down low like me are paying the least bit of attention to anything you have to say.\u201dKeith Boykin, a former Clinton White House aide, became so incensed by the down-low hysteria that he wrote a 2005 best-selling book, \u201cBeyond the Down Low: Sex, Lies and Denial in Black America.\u201d \u201cBecause the whole down-low story was doing a disservice to the black gay community and creating a racially troubling narrative that black men who have sex with men were villains, I felt I had to step in and correct the record,\u201d said Boykin, a CNN commentator who teaches at Columbia University\u2019s Institute for Research in African-American Studies. \u201cI think the near-decade-long obsession with the down low diverted our attention into what was really a side issue.\u201dIn the end, the organized H.I.V. outreach and education that proved successful to black women never translated to black gay men \u2014 and the excessive focus on the down low sucked away critical time, energy and resources. Between 2005 and 2014, new H.I.V. diagnoses among African-American women plummeted 42 percent, though the number of new infections remains unconscionably high \u2014 16 times as high as that of white women. During the same time period, the number of new H.I.V. cases among young African-American gay and bisexual men surged by 87 percent.As the men settled into their seats, Sturdevant asked them to go around and \u201ccheck in.\u201d Jermerious Buckley, watchful behind black rectangular glasses, with no sign of the makeup and colorful pumps he wore on weekends at Metro, told the group, \u201cI\u2019m doing a whole lot better.\u201d Last year, he said, \u201cDaddy,\u201d as he called Sturdevant, had pulled him back from the dead, after he had shrunk to 85 pounds, his arms covered with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma lesions, his kidneys failing. He felt like a \u201czombie,\u201d he said, too weak and hopeless to bother with his meds. Now Buckley thought he was finally strong enough to get back onto the pageant circuit where he competed. From his phone, he pulled up a picture of himself as \u201cAkeelah,\u201d unrecognizable in a shimmery white body-hugging gown and towering wig. \u201cNovember in New Orleans \u2014 y\u2019all wish me luck,\u201d he said.The group turned toward Benjamin Jennings, who wore a serious expression, with a shock of long hair in dreadlocks flipped to the side. When he said it was his first time there, everyone clapped. \u201cI was diagnosed July 8 of this year, and my goal is to learn everything that I can about this thing,\u201d said Jennings, 21, talking in a tumble of words as he pulled at his cropped T-shirt. \u201cThe first person I told was my mom. Thank God \u2014 I am so lucky to have her in my life.\u201d He paused, looking into the faces of the men around the table and speaking more slowly. \u201cI used to keep my feelings bottled up, but then I started opening my mouth on it,\u201d he said. \u201cI did everything to prevent this disease, but because of one slip-up I have it. Now I want to help anyone I can in any type of way. My goal is to not to let anyone judge me or let this disease own me.\u201dMany say rejection feels most acute and painful from the institution that should offer sanctuary and support: the black church. Individual congregations, religious organizations and clerics have made strides in openness and acceptance, but in general the black church remains largely absent from and often hostile toward the L.G.B.T. community. An African-American pastor in Jackson, the Rev. Edward James of Bertha Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, became a cringe-worthy symbol of homophobia in December 2014 for his protest against same-sex marriage equality. News outlets and social-media accounts shared a photo of him in his clerical robe, holding a sign that read: \u201cMarriage is one man and one woman. Anything else is a perversion,\u201d next to a horse clad in a white wedding dress. \u201cThe church is someplace to go for release and spiritual comfort, but the church is actually fearful for me,\u201d said Buckley, who, growing up, attended Baptist services with his grandmother in the delta. \u201cNow I stay at home on Sunday. It\u2019s too hard.\u201dUntil recently, Justin Huff, a former Jackson State student, shared a room on the second floor of Grace House\u2019s main facility. He was infected with H.I.V. a year and a half ago, when a man he met on Jack\u2019d sexually assaulted him. He received his diagnosis just after his 21st-birthday celebration. \u201cI was throwing up and couldn\u2019t eat anything for a few days; I thought it was from the drinking,\u201d Huff said. \u201cWhen I went to the doctor, he was like, if I hadn\u2019t made it in the next two days, I would\u2019ve been dead.\u201dFrightened and overwhelmed, he eventually landed on the doorstep of Grace House. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I was living in a shelter,\u201d said Huff, who is now couch-surfing, applying for jobs at fast-food outlets and retail shops and attending Sturdevant\u2019s support group, determined to stay healthy. \u201cI felt like I had no one. Off and on, I got tired of living, because all I was doing was basically dying trying to stay alive.\u201dBehind Grace House is a small, quiet makeshift graveyard that holds the cremated remains of 35 or so residents whose families did not pick up their bodies after they died. Ceramic angels, pieces of glasswork and other mementos left by friends in memory of the deceased dot the patch of earth at the base of a pecan tree. Stacey Howard, 47, the director of programs, remembers one of the last people buried there, a young man who was H.I.V.-positive and addicted to crack, who had lived off and on at Grace House before he was found dead on the street in the spring of 2016.\u201cThey had him at the local funeral home and were getting ready to turn his body over to the state, because no one would claim his remains,\u201d Howard explained as she leaned against the tree. \u201cWe got in touch with his family, who didn\u2019t want anything to do with him but at least signed the paperwork. I think it\u2019s part of our responsibility that when someone in our community passes away, we give them the dignity of a place to rest.\u201dDespite the persistent anti-L.G.B.T. stigma and entrenched social and economic issues that cling to the South, Sturdevant feels a complicated, bone-deep tie to the people and the place. When he encourages his \u201csons\u201d and \u201cdaughters\u201d to take care of themselves and others, he is echoing the love and acceptance he received from his own large family. After years of hiding, when he came out to his mother in his 20s, she told him, \u201cI love you regardless.\u201d When his family eventually found out that he was sick, his mother and sister drove up to where he was living in Memphis, along with six carloads of aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins. They tried to serve him plates laden with down-home food that he was too ill to eat and did their best to love him back to health. In the hospital, he finally admitted to his mother he had AIDS. \u201cShe told me, \u2018Boy, you gonna be all right; God got you,\u2019\u2009\u201d he recalls, tearing up. In the end, they took him home. He moved back to his mother\u2019s house in Metcalfe, with somebody from the sprawling network of nearly 100 family members always close by, until he recovered. \u201cThey saved my life, and I\u2019ll never forget that,\u201d he said.But even Sturdevant knows he can\u2019t save everyone. A shadow passes over his face and his voice grows low when he talks about the one young man he couldn\u2019t save. He remains haunted by him. A few years ago, a co-worker, Dot, suggested Sturdevant talk to a quiet fair-skinned man who was struggling with his H.I.V. diagnosis. \u201cI told him my story and let him know, \u2018You can do this, too,\u2019\u2009\u201d Sturdevant recalled. \u201cHe was in denial and very secretive, but still, he got into treatment and was doing good.\u201dBut when Sturdevant saw him again in January 2016, he had stopped taking his meds and had taken a bad turn. \u201cHe was nothing but skin and bones,\u201d Sturdevant said, looking down at his hands. \u201cHis eyes were bloodshot red. It almost looked like they were bleeding. We took him to the clinic, but the doctor said, \u2018Get him to the hospital immediately.\u2019\u2009\u201dFor the next two months, Sturdevant and Dot kept a close eye on the young man, scolding, nagging and pleading with him to stay in treatment and to tell his family the truth so he would have someone to support him. On a Friday in March 2016, Sturdevant arranged to visit him and take medication to his house. But when he arrived, there was no answer. \u201cI banged on the door, and then constantly called him all weekend,\u201d Sturdevant said. \u201cOn Monday, they told me he had passed away.\u201dSturdevant was devastated. Sometimes when he closes his eyes, he said, he still sees the smiling, fit and slender 27-year-old. \u201cI felt like I had failed,\u201d he said, choking up. \u201cI kept thinking, He was going to get better, so how could this happen?\u201d He took a breath, looking uncharacteristically tired, his eyes focused on a point off in the distance. \u201cListen, I know I can\u2019t be there night and day for everyone. But at this point now, I feel like I can\u2019t lose another young man to this disease.\u201dLinda Villarosa is the director of the journalism program at the City College of New York in Harlem and an assistant professor of media and communication arts.

They did so on a solid foundation of agreed-upon facts and a sense of right and wrong that was shared if not always followed.The Trump-Russia scandal is breaking during a time of informational chaos, when rival versions of reality are fighting for narrative supremacy.Mainstream journalism, a shiny and ascendant conveyor of truth during Watergate, is in a battered state after decades of economic erosion, its own mistakes and the efforts of partisan wrecking crews to discredit its work, the most recent one led by the president himself.All of it gives the Trump White House something Nixon never had: a loyal media armada ready to attack inconvenient truths and the credibility of potentially damning witnesses and news reports while trumpeting the presidential counternarrative, at times with counterfactual versions of events.Review papers from the Nixon White House and you can see just how much Nixon and his team pined for a media environment resembling the one today.\u201cNixon was always complaining that he had no defenders,\u201d John Dean, the former Nixon White House counsel, and current CNN contributor, told me Friday.With no counterinformational media cocoons on Nixon\u2019s side, his die-hard partisans had to watch as The Washington Post, followed by The New York Times and, eventually, television and the rest of the news media, pounded away at all the Watergate developments. \u201cIt does affect public opinion, which affects Congress, which affects impeachment proceedings,\u201d Mr. Dean told me.Mr. Bernstein wasn\u2019t so sure when we spoke on Friday. \u201cThe big difference between then and now is that there was an open-mindedness among citizens in the country to the best obtainable version of the truth,\u201d he said.Now, \u201dmore and more people,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201care looking for information in the media and elsewhere that will reinforce what they already believe.\u201dHe put the onus for that on \u201ca media culture and a political culture \u2014 and a larger culture \u2014 that is a caldron of outrage.\u201dYet what will matter most is whether the special counsel investigating the ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, Robert S.

{"Headline": "These Drinks Have a Secret", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byFor those who don\u2019t drink, who aren\u2019t drinking right now or who maybe drank too much the night before, a nonalcoholic beverage made with well-balanced, interesting flavors and thirst-quenching properties can be hard to come by. Consuming trendy sparkling waters by the case may be enough for some, but it can be nice to have something more, a drink just this side of extra.Enter the nonalcoholic cocktail, otherwise known as the mocktail.The drink fills a void for those who yearn for the crisp, complex notes of wine or a cocktail but don\u2019t necessarily want the alcohol content \u2014 or the heaviness that makes some drinks a challenge on a hot day.Advice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll be drinking a glass of wine and just absolutely crush it because it\u2019s so good, balanced and refreshing, then think, \u2018I wish there wasn\u2019t alcohol in this,\u2019\u201d said Ashley Santoro, the wine director of the Standard East Village, who enjoys the occasional nonalcoholic cocktail.But no matter how innocuous it may be, the mocktail can\u2019t seem to shake its reputation for being overly complicated, too sweet \u2014 and a little showy.John deBary, the bar director at Momofuku, thinks perhaps all it needs is a little rebrand. \u201cFor starters, we need to come up with a better name,\u201d he said. \u201cThe word mocktail makes me die a little inside every time I hear it.\u201dMr. deBary isn\u2019t alone in that perception. Atlanta magazine\u2019s food editor, Julia Bainbridge, eats and drinks out almost nightly, but, for her, taking periodic breaks from cocktail consumption is also part of the job.\u201cIn my profession, my idea about what\u2019s a healthy level of intake can get skewed,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to step back every once in a while.\u201d The word mocktail, however, is still a hard sell.To her, it sounds \u201csomething like the Flirtini from an old \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 episode, but without the booze \u2014 juice, basically, with a cocktail price tag.\u201dBut nonalcoholic beverages are undergoing a makeover at some restaurants, getting just as much attention as a cocktail or wine list. At Momofuku Ko in the East Village, Mr. deBary designed the bar menu so that several of the offerings could be easily made with or without alcohol.\u201cThe goal with this is to let people who want to order these drinks feel like they are participating in the same experience as everyone else,\u201d he said.Ms. Bainbridge said Agern, a Nordic restaurant at Grand Central Terminal that is temporarily closed after a flood in March, had also been churning out superlative alcohol-free beverages, incorporating savory, unexpected ingredients. \u201cThere, I\u2019ve found some of the most sophisticated set of mocktails I\u2019ve seen yet,\u201d she said, like \u201ca fennel shrub, a drink made with grapefruit juice and verjus, and another made with whey.\u201dFor Mr. deBary, mixing alcohol-free drinks interesting enough to compete with a classic cocktail means building beverages with ingredients that mimic the heat and nuance of the harder stuff. \u201cGinger is a steady go-to, tonic water, teas and concentrated cold brews as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key is to avoid making anything overly sweet and finding a way to incorporate bitterness and spice.\u201dAnother pivotal ingredient, yielding a similarly unique tang, is vinegar. \u201cEven if I order a green juice, I still crave the elements of what make wine or spirits so delicious, especially acidity and salinity,\u201d Ms. Santoro said. \u201cAt home, I make a lot of shrubs and drinking vinegars with added salt because there\u2019s only so much acidity that lemon or citrus will give you.\u201dWhen building a mocktail of your own, take a page from our experts. Start with assertive and complex flavors: Think whole, tart lemon muddled with a pinch of salt, or floral hibiscus tea perked up with funky, fermented apple cider vinegar. Then, top with something bubbly and refreshing, whether spicy ginger beer, botanical tonic water or fizzy soda water.There is no alcohol to be found, but, if it\u2019s done right, you\u2019ll be too pleased to notice.A recipe for cucumber and tonic last Wednesday with an article about nonalcoholic cocktails mistakenly included bitters among its ingredients. While bitters are used sparingly, they do contain alcohol. Also, the article included kombucha in a list of ingredients without alcohol. While most brands of kombucha sold in the United States are not legally considered alcoholic, they do contain trace amounts of alcohol (up to 0.5 percent).cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

At times, it can put them closer than usual to the traditional boundaries between brands and those creating content.While many lauded Ms. Lemkau\u2019s message, some found the decision unusual. Stephen A. Greyser, a marketing professor at Harvard Business School, said he thought it showed the company getting \u201ctoo close to the editorial content of one program,\u201d while Ms. Alaimo said the bank appeared to be \u201cinterfering in news content.\u201dNBC did not comment on JPMorgan\u2019s decision, though Ms. Kelly said in a statement that while she found the claims by Mr. Jones involving the Sandy Hook shooting \u201cpersonally revolting,\u201d he was a newsworthy interview subject.Jane Rosenthal, a founder and the executive chairwoman of Tribeca Enterprises, which oversees the Tribeca Film Festival, said she worried about \u201ca chilling effect on our democracy.\u201d\u201cCertain sponsors we\u2019ve had have said they want something that is for families, they don\u2019t want violence or sex scenes, but we have never and would never say that someone can determine what we\u2019re going to screen,\u201d she said.Generally, advertisers balk at any appearance of editorial involvement. That stance helped the Fox News host Sean Hannity last month, after critics targeted his advertisers based on his unapologetic promotion of a conspiracy theory surrounding the killing of a Democratic National Committee staff member. Advertisers like Mercedes-Benz said that they did not involve themselves with editorial content, while the Sleeping Giants account stayed out of it.Mr. Hannity, who was outraged at what he viewed as an attempt to censor him, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday to the producer of Stephen Colbert\u2019s show, after the two apparently met on Monday. Some on the right had called for an advertising boycott of Mr. Colbert after profane comments he recently made about Mr. Trump.\u201cGlad you noticed I did not support boycott or firing of Colbert,\u201d Mr. Hannity posted. \u201cI still hate the show. #FreeSpeech\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Made in America: The Bad News and the Good Bad News", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byA couple of weeks ago, I was honored to be invited to present my thoughts on the state of manufacturing in America to the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, headed by Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.The thrust of my message was that, regrettably, we should be leery of proclamations of a renaissance of \u201cMade in America.\u201d Job growth in the industrial sector continues to be anemic and at least equally important, wage improvements have been marginal.Below are nine charts that I presented to illustrate the situation. I closed with a list of suggestions \u2014 no magic bullets \u2014 for how to maximize the performance of our manufacturing sector. For the charts whose takeaway is not self-evident, I\u2019ve provided some brief commentary.In my opinion, the crux of the problem is that we are competing in large part against countries \u2014 notably Mexico and China \u2014 that have gotten better at making things at a much lower labor cost. Even highly technical products \u2014 like airplanes \u2014 are beginning to be assembled in these countries.Automation (or robots) certainly played a role in the loss of manufacturing jobs before the financial crisis and may play a similar role in the future. But at the moment, robots are simply not the problem, as indicated by the low productivity numbers. If robots were the problem, our worker productivity would be growing faster, not slower, than it has in the past.The job loss \u2014 particularly in areas most susceptible to competition from countries with low-cost labor \u2014 has been remarkable.Here\u2019s a ray of hope and an example of what\u2019s needed. Since 2012, the number of job openings in manufacturing has exceeded the number of people hired. That indicates that companies are trying to hire (good news) but are having trouble finding workers with adequate skills (bad news \u2014 but an opportunity). Better training and education are among our best hopes.See what education can do for an individual\u2019s income \u2014 and what happens to those without college degrees. That said, I understand that four years of college is not for everyone. That\u2019s where better technical training (and yes, apprenticeships) can play an important, positive role.While I appreciate the importance of humanities and other nontechnical disciplines, we are in tough shape relative to other countries when it comes to math and science.As the chart below shows, the call for more spending on infrastructure has sound basis in the numbers. As a share of gross domestic product, investment in infrastructure is at its lowest since before World War II. What doesn\u2019t get as much attention \u2014 but should \u2014 is that spending on basic research, an important function of government, has also dropped to an historically low level. President Trump\u2019s budget proposes to cut this further.As I said at the outset, I have yet to sight a magic solution to our manufacturing challenges. Inevitably, manufacturing will continue to decline as a share of our economy, as it is doing in almost every other developed country. However, there are a number of specific policy actions that would make us more competitive and also ameliorate the harsh impact of the new competitive realities on our workers:\u25a0 Better education (particularly in science and math) and training.\u25a0 Tax reform, including sensible corporate tax policy and more progressive taxation.\u25a0 Fair (but free) trade.\u25a0 Higher federal investment spending on infrastructure and research and development.\u25a0 Regulatory reform to facilitate business without sacrificing labor, environmental and other standards.\u25a0 Increasing mobility to encourage workers to move to where the jobs are.\u25a0 A better social safety net for those left behind.Advertisement"}

The contrast between the extravagance of their attire and the hardships of their lives has the effect of highlighting the dignity of their code.

She met singers, barbers, shop owners, pastors and more. Here are some of their stories.Ms. Harris had been told that church services in Congo were not to be missed, and she was not disappointed. \u201cThe people totally turned out in their Sunday finest, and the music was super on point,\u201d she said.

A lot of the problems stem from this abundance of resources \u2014 gold and oil and other things \u2014 so I thought that was an interesting comment.\u201dThis barbershop called Partners is run by two men, Prince and John, who are considered two of the best hair-weavers in Goma. \u201cOne woman I met there actually crossed the border from Rwanda to come to this particular salon to get her hair done for a family event,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cSo you know people take their looks seriously.\u201d She noted that there are salons on every other block, packed on Fridays as men and women prepare for the weekend.\u201cThese guys walked by, and we actually had to stop them on the street because they looked unlike anybody else I had seen in Goma,\u201d Ms. Harris said of D.J.

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Health Plan Is Really a Rollback of Medicaid", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byPUBLIC HEALTHLimiting the amount that the federal government would pay for each person would leave states with difficult choices, and would be a fundamental shift of financial risk.Tucked inside the Republican bill to replace Obamacare is a plan to impose a radical diet on a 52-year-old program that insures nearly one in five Americans.\u201cThis is the most consequential change in 50 years for low-income people\u2019s health care,\u201d said Joan Alker, the executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. \u201cThis is a massive change that has hardly been discussed.\u201dThe results, according to independent analyses, would be major reductions in federal spending on Medicaid over time. States would be left deciding whether to raise more money to make up the difference, or to cut back on medical coverage for people using the program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the changes would lead to a reduction in spending on Medicaid of more than $800 billion over a decade. (That figure also includes additional cuts to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.)Medicaid is the country\u2019s largest government health care program, covering more Americans than its better-known sibling, Medicare. Its reach is broad: About half of all births in the country are covered by Medicaid, and nearly 40 percent of children are covered through the program. Medicaid covers the long-term care costs of two-thirds of Americans living in nursing homes, many of them middle-class Americans who spent all of their savings on care before becoming eligible.It covers children and adults with disabilities who require services that most commercial health insurance doesn\u2019t include. It covers poor women who are pregnant or raising young children. Those populations were all included in the program before Obamacare became law.It also provides insurance for poor adult Americans, and recent evidence shows that its expansion under Obamacare has given more poor people access to health care services and reduced their exposure to financial shocks.\u201cCould you imagine tomorrow if finally we had a Zika virus vaccine, and that vaccine costs $50K a dose?\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. \u201cWould you not want every woman of childbearing age to be immunized?\u201dAdvocates for the structural change point to inefficiencies and waste in the current program. There is some evidence that Medicaid programs enroll some people who are not eligible and sometimes cover some services that are not medically necessary. James Capretta, a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that the current system, where the federal government matches all state spending, discourages efficiency.Most researchers who study the program closely say that it is already quite lean. Major savings, they say, will be hard to achieve without reducing medical benefits or cutting higher-cost patients from the program.Trump administration officials and Republican members of Congress have argued that the Medicaid changes won\u2019t cause anyone to lose insurance coverage directly. That statement is true in only the narrowest sense. Because the funding cuts would fall to states, it is state officials who would decide whether to save money by raising taxes, reducing payments to nursing homes or eliminating benefits like home-based care for disabled beneficiaries, a few available options under the law. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment in Medicaid would decline substantially over a decade, as states pursued a variety of strategies to save money, some of which would push people out of the program.Still, the Medicaid caps have not drawn the same public outcry as other provisions of the law that would cut back on coverage more directly. Several Republican senators have expressed concerns about changes to Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which broadened the program to include more low-income adults in 31 states. _______________Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reality Winner, N.S.A. Contractor Accused of Leak, Was Undone by Trail of Clues", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the months after President Trump was elected, Reality Leigh Winner frequently expressed outraged political views about him on social media, in between photos of her cats and favorite quotations. But on the afternoon of May 9, she posted an unusually anodyne message on Facebook, noting that she would be teaching two yoga classes that evening.She was harboring a secret, prosecutors say. Hours earlier, Ms. Winner, a 25-year-old former Air Force linguist who in February took a contractor job at a National Security Agency eavesdropping center in Georgia, printed out a top-secret intelligence report detailing Russian meddling in the American election and ferreted it out of the secure complex.Her case was a reminder of the vast universe of people who have access to government secrets, largely because of the expansion of security agencies in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks. About four million people, both government employees and contractors, hold security clearances, including 1.3 million with top secret clearances like Ms. Winner\u2019s.Among them, she was an unlikely suspect. A broader portrait that emerged from interviews and her active social media presence suggests a fun-loving, talented young woman, a workout enthusiast and a wide reader, fond of kale, dedicated to her cats and dog and her work. She had no apparent history of leaking or any disciplinary proceedings during her military service.On Tuesday, Ms. Winner was being held at a jail in Lincoln County, Ga., northwest of Augusta, after an 11-minute court appearance a day earlier. A federal magistrate judge scheduled a detention hearing for Thursday.Her case came \u201ctotally out of left field,\u201d said her stepfather, Gary Davis, who arrived in Georgia from Texas in recent days. She had been involved in animal rescue and service groups, Mr. Davis said in a brief interview outside Ms. Winner\u2019s home as steady rain poured on Augusta on Tuesday.He added: \u201cReality, she\u2019s just a good kid. She\u2019s got a great big heart.\u201dMs. Winner had followed an older sibling into the Air Force, Mr. Davis said.Reality Leigh Winner, an intelligence contractor, was charged with sending a classified report about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election to the news media, the Justice Department announced Monday, the first criminal leak case under President Trump.\u201cShe looked at the Air Force and wanted to serve her country, and she did that with honors and did an exemplary job,\u201d he said.Despite the swift and apparent success of the investigation, the case is the latest blow to the N.S.A., the nation\u2019s largest intelligence agency, which prefers to work in the shadows and for decades largely succeeded in doing so.Then came a yearslong debate over warrantless wiretapping during the George W. Bush administration, the leak to the news media in 2013 of hundreds of thousands of documents by Edward J. Snowden, and last year, the theft of N.S.A. hacking tools that were made available on the web by a still-unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers.The Snowden and Shadow Brokers leaks have deeply shaken the agency, raising the question of whether it will ever be able to protect its secrets again.But the prosecution of Ms. Winner may send a deterrent message to the huge, scattered work force of employees and contractors of the N.S.A., showing that the authorities have sophisticated ways to track down leakers in certain circumstances.Ms. Winner left many clues when she took a single N.S.A. document, a May 5 report detailing hacking by the G.R.U., Russian military intelligence. The report described hacks in August against a company that sells software related to voter registration and another, a few days before the election, against 122 local election officials.An F.B.I. affidavit said a visible crease mark on the file, a scan of which The Intercept provided to the government while trying to authenticate it, prompted investigators to surmise it was a printout.\u201cThe N.S.A. almost certainly has a record of who used the printer at that time,\u201d he wrote.Ms. Winner\u2019s apparent Twitter feed, which used a pseudonym but had a photo of her and the same account name as her Instagram feed, makes clear her hostility toward Mr. Trump. That suggests a possible motive for leaking: highlighting Russian hacking of election-related targets, amplifying the narrative that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is tainted.On social media \u2014 her Twitter feed went silent soon after she became an N.S.A. contractor in February \u2014 she denounced Mr. Trump as \u201cthe orange fascist we let into the white house\u201d and mocked Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a \u201cConfederate.\u201d She expressed concern about climate change, and support for the Black Lives Matter movement and other liberal views.Raised in Texas, Ms. Winner received her legal name \u2014 Reality Leigh Winner \u2014 from her biological father, who, Mr. Davis said, \u201calways wanted a real winner, so he named her Reality Leigh.\u201d\u201cThe plan was to call her Leigh,\u201d Mr. Davis said, \u201cand one of the first babysitters that they had started calling her Reality, and it stuck.\u201dShe had been living in Maryland, not far from the N.S.A.\u2019s main campus at Fort Meade, and she sounded a bit lonely on social media as she settled in her new home in Georgia.One Facebook shot, showing a cat in a guitar case, also reveals the spines of a pile of her books. They suggest her range as a linguist \u2014 a Kazakh textbook and another on Uzbek verbs \u2014 as well as her diverse interests. There is a manual for fitness instructors; the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu book of scripture; and several novels, including Salman Rushdie\u2019s \u201cThe Satanic Verses.\u201dMs. Winner taught at Oh Yeah Yoga, a small studio owned by Annalisa Adams, who said attendance for her Friday evening class had grown. On Saturday night, Ms. Winner\u2019s mother sent Ms. Adams a Facebook message and said a family emergency would indefinitely keep her daughter from teaching.\u201cThis is a complete shock to us,\u201d Ms. Adams said.Ms. Winner lived in a small rented home about a five-minute drive from the famed Augusta National Golf Club. The house was a study in contrasts: a colorful, funky welcome mat rested out the door, and a small no-trespassing sign, with a silhouette of a rifle and the words \u201cWE DON\u2019T CALL 911\u201d posted above the porch.Her Nissan Cube remained parked outside. One of the many stickers hailed the Sierra Club; another showed she had completed a half-marathon, and a third was an admonition: \u201cBe truthful, gentle and fearless.\u201dCharlie Savage reported from Washington, Scott Shane from Baltimore and Alan Blinder from Augusta, Ga.

{"Headline": "Your Next Lesson: New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byWine SchoolConfession: It has been a while since I have regularly consumed our next wine, New Zealand sauvignon blanc. I used to drink it more consistently years ago, back in the 1990s, when I found it a versatile partner in the restaurants I frequented.It has been a resounding success story. Sauvignon blanc put New Zealand on the map as a wine-producing country, and its brash, herbaceous style proved highly popular with consumers.In recent years, though, I began to find the wines fatiguing. They seemed not so brash, with riper tropical fruit flavors, and often with a bit of sweetness. I attributed this, perhaps unfairly, to many producers coasting with a cash cow as they put their more serious efforts into pinot noir, which some New Zealanders believe is a wine of higher status.Nonetheless, the classic New Zealand style has remained influential as producers from South America to the United States to South Africa to France itself have emulated it. When good, the wines can be energetic, vivacious and brisk. It seemed like a good, summery selection to revisit or to explore for the first time.Here are my three recommendations:If you can\u2019t find these, have no fear. Dozens of other labels will do. Momo is the entry level for Seresin. If you don\u2019t mind spending a little more for the estate\u2019s flagship wine, it\u2019s worth trying. Other producers to look out for include Arona, Dog Point, Highfield, Craggy Range, Lawson\u2019s Dry Hills and Whitehaven.These wines go well with many summery foods, particularly salads, asparagus and simple seafoods, as well as many Thai and Vietnamese dishes. I also like them with Middle Eastern spreads, like hummus and baba ghanouj, and kebabs.Drink these cold, not icy, but on the colder end of the spectrum.Characteristics to ConsiderAromaGrassy is the reflex description for these wines.

{"Headline": "Shooting Is Latest Eruption in a Grim Ritual of Rage and Blame", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "Supported byAnd with lawmakers, legislative aides and Capitol police officers hospitalized on Wednesday, a process of mourning and recrimination unfolded as a kind of familiar ritual, with a somber statement from the president and bipartisan denunciations of violence quickly giving way to finger-pointing and blame on social media.Even high-level gestures of conciliation, including from President Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders, did little to blunt the sense that America\u2019s civic culture is consumed with anger and breaking down \u2014 though mental illness sometimes makes it impossible to say exactly what leads to violence.Former Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said the violence reflected a contagion in America\u2019s political culture, in which adversaries were treated as \u201cpeople to be destroyed.\u201d He said Mr. Trump and Democratic leaders, as well as the news media, all deserved blame.\u201cWe are inundated by rage,\u201d Mr. Danforth, who is an ordained minister, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not just practicing politicians. It\u2019s the demand from the base of the two parties, and it is in large part encouraged by the media.\u201d\u201cIt apparently works,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wins elections, wins ratings.\u201d\u201cFast-forward to 2017, and I\u2019m sorry to say, it gets worse,\u201d said Mr. Barber, a Democrat. \u201cWhat happened in 2016 was a presidential campaign that I think really ramped up the anger and vulgarities that we see directed at members of Congress.\u201dThat toxicity does not emanate only from politicians, Mr. Barber said. \u201cI am on Facebook and I see things there that I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone saying about another person,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia. It\u2019s time for all our leaders, from the president on down, to say, \u2018Stop.\u2019\u201dVoters on the left and the right described themselves as shaken and fearful of what might happen next. Among conservatives, the shooting appeared to confirm a belief that liberal opposition to Mr. Trump had taken a sinister turn, veering into outright violence. For liberals, the attack stirred concern about the potential for extremism on the left, and deepened a sense \u2014 dating from Barack Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 that ordinary partisan conflicts had taken on more menacing overtones.In Fairhope, Ala., B. J. Middleton, a retired police officer, said the explosive political atmosphere recalled the time of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination in 1968. Mr. Middleton, 78, who supports Mr. Trump, said he increasingly feared \u201cviolence coming from the left.\u201d\u201cI was there for the riots and what happened to Dr. King, and I\u2019ll tell you, it feels like we\u2019re building toward something again,\u201d Mr. Middleton said.Kayla Winner-Connor, a graduate student in Los Angeles, said she was dismayed but not surprised by Wednesday\u2019s violence.\u201cI hate to say that \u2014 everything we\u2019re hearing seems really extreme and it has been polarized for a while, but now it is dangerous,\u201d said Ms. Winner-Connor, who said she was not a supporter of Mr. Trump. She added, \u201cHis agenda feels so wrong and I feel an emotionally charged response, but this is spawning some extreme reactions.\u201dHope that the political system would self-correct seemed to compete with cynicism about the idea that things might even be salvageable. Kari Duma, 45, of Tucson, said she was skeptical that the country would hear Wednesday\u2019s gunshots as a \u201cwake-up call.\u201d\u201cHow many wake-up calls do we need?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe thing is, people are not afraid to attack other people because of politics and beliefs.\u201dThere is a long history of political bloodshed and assassination in the United States, sometimes carried out by ideological actors and at other times by people who are mentally unstable. Gunmen have killed four presidents and shot at several others, and killed Dr. King, Robert F. Kennedy and the pioneering gay politician Harvey Milk.The apparent violent turn in national politics, and the disappearance of traditional rules of civility, also come as mass shootings \u2014 usually targeting nonpolitical civilian targets, in schools and public places \u2014 are on the rise.Some question the correlation between violence and political rhetoric, stressing that gunmen who attack political targets are often unstable or angry for unrelated reasons.George Brauchler, a Colorado district attorney who prosecuted James Holmes, who killed 12 people in an Aurora movie theater in 2012, said he was inclined to view the gunman outside Washington on Wednesday chiefly as \u201cevil.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that politics facilitates that or if it\u2019s just an excuse for it,\u201d said Mr. Brauchler, a Republican who is running for governor. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, in the absence of a political issue, this guy would have lived a law-abiding life.\u201dAmong politicians and voters on Wednesday, there was at least a visceral link between the latest violence and a long-running disintegration of civic norms, which has left candidates and commentators freer than ever to stoke hateful impulses with little fear of consequences.In 2011, the shooting of Ms. Giffords by a mentally ill assailant came during a convulsive political period, when a bitter debate over health care yielded a wave of threats against lawmakers. Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate, drew sharp criticism for having posted a graphic online that showed cross hairs over the districts of several members of Congress, including Ms. Giffords \u2014 though no connection to the crime was established.Frank Keating, who was the governor of Oklahoma when antigovernment militants bombed a federal building there in 1995, killing 168 people, said figures of public authority needed to be more sensitive to the impact of their words on \u201cunstable people.\u201d\u201cThere are people that are right on the edge, partisans in both parties, that could \u2014 would \u2014 do terrible things if that trip wire is tripped,\u201d said Mr. Keating, a Republican. \u201cThe rhetoric needs to come down about 17 notches.\u201dVoters on both sides of the political divide shared that sentiment.

This is especially handy lately, in our strange moment of flux. A wide-\u200beyed observer of today\u2019s political media wouldn\u2019t just see different voices and outlets with contrasting tendencies. It would see a disorienting game of rhetorical appropriation, in which it is constantly unclear who stands for which principles and why.An essential feature of the rise of Trumpism has been the brazen inversion, that trusty maneuver in which you wield your critics\u2019 own values against them \u2014 say, borrowing the language of social justice to argue that the \u201coppressor\u201d is actually oppressed or suddenly embracing progressive social causes in the service of criticizing Islam. It\u2019s a blunt but effective rhetorical confiscation, in which a battle-ready right relishes its ability to seize, inhabit and neutralize the arguments and vocabularies of its opponents, reveling in their continued inability to formulate any sort of answer to the trusty old \u2018\u2018I know you are, but what am I?\u2019\u2019Early in the 2016 election cycle, \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 was much closer to being a literal description of the pro-Trump media coterie: They stood in opposition not just to \u2018\u2018mainstream\u2019\u2019 media or the presumptive Democratic nominee but to the Republican establishment as well. Now, though, the word is both more broadly applied and less obviously applicable. This so-called alternative media is not just amplifying voices that more established media would rather not deal with; it is echoing and amplifying the voice of a Republican president presiding over a unified government. Critics may guffaw at Kellyanne Conway\u2019s \u2018\u2018alternative facts,\u2019\u2019 express revulsion at the white nationalist Richard Spencer\u2019s \u2018\u2018alt-right\u2019\u2019 or tilt their heads at Sean Hannity\u2019s attempt to brand an \u2018\u2018alt-left.\u2019\u2019 But the cumulative effect is undeniable: The \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 appropriation is working, and far more quickly than anyone might have expected.To that end, there are now explicitly ideological online platforms vying to create a whole alternative \u2014 and \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 \u2014 infrastructure for practicing politics and culture online. Fringe-right media is extremely active on Twitter, but when its most offensive pundits and participants are banned there, they can simply regroup on Gab, the platform Breitbart recently described as a \u2018\u2018free speech Twitter alternative.\u2019\u2019 Reddit, a semireluctant but significant host to right-wing activists, has a harder-right alternative in Voat, where users are free to post things that might get them banned elsewhere. Or there\u2019s the politics community on 4chan, which has long been the de facto \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 to other online communities, serving as a lawless exile, a base for war with the rest of the web and, in recent years, a shockingly influential source of political memes \u2014 the closest thing the new right has to a native culture.There is no burgeoning right-wing \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 Facebook or YouTube yet, but that development feels inevitable. The structures and communal ideals of the internet\u2019s biggest platforms \u2014 the closest thing that exists to a dominant culture online \u2014 are just waiting to be inverted, seized and used for new ends, like the liberal discourse before them.In retrospect, the essay is both overheated and prophetic, clearly ideological and narrow in its context. But its sensibility is clear. It demands safety from, not access to, the vast corporate system against which it defines itself. And more than anything, it presents the alternative as skeptical of, and in some ways incompatible with, power.The new reactionary \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 movement is also keenly aware of power, but it craves it, worships it, is constantly devising plans to acquire it. It has traded a siege mentality for a war bearing; its platforms are less gathering places for expressions of dissent than staging grounds against the venues to which they\u2019re opposed and against which they expect to win. Their rhetoric and style want to evoke, in some ghoulish upside-down way, heroic rebellion, regardless of how well their aims align with the powers that be. And so we get, for instance, the consummate \u201990s outsider Alex Jones \u2014 against the world but also taking over the world, under attack from elites but also on the phone with the president.At first glance, this seems incoherent. It\u2019s a libertarian resistance with an authoritarian program; a counterculture that yearns for tradition. But again, fresh eyes might help us avoid underestimating what is happening here. This \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 is not limited by consistent adherence to its own principles. This self-described underdog sees nothing problematic in its affinity for power. In fact, it believes, rightly, that to the right audience, contradiction is exciting. Nothing could be better for an insurgent political force than to be seen as a scrappy outsider. And nothing could be better for the aspiring mainstream \u2014 this time not corporate, or cultural, but political \u2014 than to adopt the permanent pose of the alternative.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

The \u201cdeportation force\u201d President Trump promised during the campaign had finally arrived, it seemed.Journalists at Univision\u2019s headquarters here started hitting the streets, calling contacts and analyzing a photograph of a supposed ICE bus in action.No sweep was underway, they learned; the photo was from 2014.Just another day covering President Trump\u2019s America at Univision News.By now you\u2019ve probably heard that this is a golden age for journalism \u2014 how The New York Times and The Washington Post are warring for scoops in ways reminiscent of the Watergate era; how an information-hungry public is sending subscriptions and television news ratings soaring, reinvigorating journalists and reaffirming their mission (\u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness\u201d and all that).But the story isn\u2019t complete if it doesn\u2019t include Univision News, one of the most striking examples I\u2019ve seen all year of a news organization that is meeting the moment.Election night raised the stakes.\u201cOn the one hand, we knew that it would have a terrible impact on the Hispanic community in the United States,\u201d Univision\u2019s president of news, Daniel Coronell, told me as we sat in his office overlooking the buzzing central newsroom.But that was quickly followed by the realization that, as of that night, Univision\u2019s news would be \u201cabout the survival of, the permanency of, the members of the community,\u201d he said.Univision was ready for that challenge in a way it probably would not have been a few years ago.Mr. Lee started by creating investigative and documentary units. As a onetime journalist in Colombia \u2014 where his work linked onetime drug lords to political leaders \u2014 Mr. Lee knew something his competitors did not: Some of the best and bravest journalists in the world were on the sidelines, chased out of their newsrooms or home countries by murderous regimes their work had exposed.Mr. Coronell, for example, fled his country after receiving unnervingly detailed death threats against his 6-year-old daughter.The latest influx of talent has come from Venezuela, where crackdowns on journalists under the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and a hostile takeover of major media companies by government allies, have put reporters in danger while stifling their work.Their hiring has coincided with the latest expansion effort at Univision, led by the former deputy managing editor of the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, Borja Echevarr\u00eda, to move more aggressively into digital journalism.With a team that includes 75 new hires in the last two years, Mr. Echevarr\u00eda has started new units for special investigative projects, podcasts, and data journalism, mobile video and informational graphics.Every newsroom making the digital transition is building similar teams, aimed at producing new forms of journalism for mobile phones and modern attention spans. But at Univision, the effort is infused with a direct sense of urgency.At a cluster of desks at one edge of the cavernous newsroom during my visit, Almudena Toral, the director of digital video, was tweaking a segment \u2014 animated by a newly arrived Venezuelan designer \u2014 that she explained as follows: \u201cWhat should I do if ICE comes for me in my house?\u201dNearby, the data journalism team was putting the finishing touches on a statistical analysis showing the lack of legal representation of undocumented immigrants who go before immigration judges.Then there was the fact-checking team, the first of its kind operating in Spanish in the United States. It has had no shortage of assignments, as falsehoods about immigrants continue to spread at even the highest levels of government. To wit: the president\u2019s assertions that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally last year.But it\u2019s also an environment that so many Univision journalists say they are used to.They saw it in the election campaign, when Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters would shout at journalists, \u201cTell the truth!\u201d That was what supporters of the former Venezuelan strongman Hugo Ch\u00e1vez used to do, the photo editor here, David Maris, recounted to me.And they see it now, as Mr. Trump escalates his attacks on journalism and those who produce it.\u201cEvery single investigation in Colombia or Guatemala or Mexico,\u201d Mr. Coronell, the news president, told me, \u201cis followed by \u2018This journalist has his own agenda; he\u2019s trying to affect my government\u2019 and \u2018That\u2019s fake news.\u2019\u201dSo, here in America in 2017, he said, \u201cmany of us, we know the movie \u2014 we\u2019ve seen it in Spanish.\u201dThere\u2019s one important difference he and others here pointed to, and that\u2019s the Constitution, which enshrines a free press and our human rights.\u201cIt\u2019s crucial for us that people know their rights and the possibilities,\u201d Mr. Coronell said. \u201cAnd we are working all the time to use the investigative journalism tools in order to provide better information to our community.\u201dThat community has a dearth of reliable information and an excess of misinformation, like frequent false reports about raids, which can mean \u201cpeople don\u2019t leave their homes to go to the grocery store or to take their kids to school,\u201d as the Hispanic Federation\u2019s president, Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n, said in an interview last week. He called Univision \u201ca lifeline.\u201dThat role can lead to charges that Univision is more an activist organization than a journalistic one, which the newsroom here rejects.\u201cWhen it comes to things related to corruption or human rights abuses, you really are a counterpower,\u201d Mr. Zamora said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not that you are an activist. That\u2019s what journalism is for.\u201dJaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Most people are off from work. They have downtime and seek to fill it. And what better time to take up a new hobby than when you have hours to devote to it?What most people eventually find out is that there is a \u201ctrickiness curve\u201d to the solving week, and that their best bet for learning how to solve comes from starting with the Monday puzzles. I suspect this is why some people feel that they can\u2019t solve a crossword puzzle; it boils down to when they first meet up with it. If they pick up a puzzle for the first time on a Saturday or Sunday and take a peek at what\u2019s in store for them, I wouldn\u2019t blame them one bit for placing it gently back down and tiptoeing away, never to try again.But you have to start somewhere, and that somewhere is at the beginning. Start with the Monday puzzles, and work your way through the week.I\u2019ll show you why that is: Take a look at the clue for 1A, \u201cBegin at the beginning.\u201d What a coincidence, and what a nicely written, misdirected, Saturday-level clue. On the surface, it sounds like my advice, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s not what it means at all, though, at least not on a Saturday. The answer is MENACHEM, as in the former prime minister of Israel MENACHEM Begin, and those of you who are just starting to solve are probably sitting there, wondering why Mr. Diehl and Will Shortz might do that to you.Quite a brain twister, isn\u2019t it?Now, if you\u2019re just starting out, Mondays are a great place to strengthen that solving muscle. In a Monday puzzle, that same entry might be clued with a much more straightforward, in-your-face clue, like \u201cFormer Israeli prime minister ___ Begin.\u201d It might not be quite that easy, but you get the idea; the clue would supply you with more than enough basic information to solve it and your brain just loves filling in missing information.And please, if you are just starting out with crosswords, begin at the beginning. You\u2019ll work your way to puzzles like this one, I promise, because you\u2019ll eventually crave more of a challenge than the early week puzzles. And that\u2019s when the real fun begins.\u25a0 15A/7D: Tricky one, especially if you don\u2019t remember which mission the Apollo space program was on in 1968. I was fairly confident that the answer was APOLLO and ended in a I (Roman numeral 1), but wasn\u2019t sure if the penultimate letter would be a V or an I. The crossing is also wordplay, making solving this entry more difficult. However, the \u201cForerunner of a race?\u201d speaks not to a race on foot, but the human race, and the answer is the biblical EVE, making APOLLO VI the answer to 15A.\u25a0 17A: HOT TOWEL makes its New York Times Crossword debut today, as a \u201cStaple of a barbershop shave.\u201d That\u2019s probably the best-known way to clue that entry, although you also sometimes get a HOT TOWEL at the beginning of a meal at a Japanese restaurant.\u25a0 27A: I really wanted \u201cMom and pop business?\u201d to be PARENTING, but the entry had too many letters. The answer is DNA TESTING.\u25a0 8D: \u201cGeneral expenses\u201d in \u201cIncome for general expenses?\u201d are the expenses for a military general.\u25a0 9D: I will tell you what \u2014 if I ever try sky diving, the last thing I would want is an ALTIMETER. My preference would be for a bottle of vodka.\u25a0 37D: I knew this had to do with curbing calories as opposed to physically passing the dessert, because a) it has the question mark, and 2) what else could be a synonym for passing a dessert. The way this needs to be read is as \u201cPassed [on] the dessert?\u201d and the answer is DIETED.Coming up with interesting clues for themeless puzzles is always a learning experience for me. With this puzzle I discovered that Mr. Begin still makes a great misdirect (I last used him in 2001: \u201cBegin, later in life\u201d = PEACE NOBELIST), Mahatma means \u201cGreat soul,\u201d the national bird of Trinidad and Tobago (Will\u2019s clue), McDonald\u2019s actually dishes out over 3 million Happy Meals a day, and decaf coffee dispensers often have orange lids because of the original decaf Sanka\u2019s can color (though that didn\u2019t make the final clue set).Crosswords are always such a font of information.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

Census data released this week shows that one in two Australians are now either born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas, and that Australia\u2019s Indigenous population has grown as well.John Eligon, who I worked with closely before I came to Australia, spent nearly a month traveling all over Australia and the Torres Strait Islands, visiting a wide variety of Indigenous communities.\u201cI heard stories of frustration and anger, resistance and resilience,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I saw was a complex reality for Australia\u2019s First Nations people.\u201dWhat\u2019s striking to anyone who watches or reads what John produced is the degree to which he was able to get these people and others to open up about their lives. He drew out heartfelt stories about suicide and discrimination but also moments of pride, expertise and humor. Even in outtakes from the project that we\u2019ve been sharing, such as this interview above with Ms. Lui, there\u2019s an authenticity and candor that illuminates the lived experience of race.In the end, we hope, it all amounts to a nuanced portrait of a community that made clear to John that there is more symbolism than substance in the way that Australia interacts with its colonial legacy. Just about everyone John talked to emphasized that more work needs to be done in Australia, not just in terms of policy, but also in terms of personal interaction and prejudice.\u201cIt\u2019s that low hum of racism that people deal with every day,\u201d said Stan Grant, the ABC\u2019s most prominent Aboriginal journalist, in an interview with John. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, you know, this is necessarily going to ruin someone\u2019s life.

{"Headline": "What About the Terrorism of the Far Right?", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsWhile attacks by violent jihadists understandably command the most attention, we need to be wary of ignoring the threat from those radicalized by an increasingly well-connected and mobilized far right. The ideologies of these movements are symbiotic, with both sides playing off a fear of the other to tailor their messages and attract new audiences. Left unchecked, competing outrages and persecution narratives could lead to a cascade of radicalization, in which extremists on each side feed the other\u2019s growth.Seemingly isolated attacks like the one in Finsbury Park don\u2019t always get the response from policy makers that they should, partly because the casualty count tends to be lower and because the lone attacker does not necessarily belong to any proscribed organization, so there appears to be less systemic risk. Other daily incidents, below the threshold of terrorist violence, like a Muslim woman getting her hijab yanked on the street or being insulted on the subway, are not seen as related to this broader phenomenon of emboldened extremism.Our research on far-right movements in Britain looked at people interacting with 162 British-based Facebook pages that show support for far-right ideologies. These included the Facebook pages of political parties, protest movements and news sources. Our analysis of about 7,000 users regularly engaging with these pages suggested that some 2,500 expressed support for extreme violence. (The suspect in the Finsbury Park attack did not show up in our study.) Violent sentiment was overwhelmingly aimed at Muslims, as well as immigrants and refugees. More than 70 percent of these users were over the age of 45. (This is in contrast to the online supporters of the Islamic State, who are overwhelmingly under the age of 30.) A majority of users appeared to be from economically deprived backgrounds; a few were either members of the British armed forces or veterans. All of them were white.A vanishingly small number of those we surveyed expressed explicit support for white supremacy or neo-Nazi ideology. Instead, these Facebook users appeared mainly motivated by patriotism, grievances over immigration and integration, and the perceived threat of Islam.Because of a high level of public vigilance about jihadist groups, Islamist extremists are increasingly cautious in their behavior, particularly online. The intense focus on the propaganda they produce means that pages calling for violence against the West and expressing support for terrorism are swiftly taken down, and their users barred.There has rightly been a great deal of effort put into countering jihadist groups and their supporters in the West. Now more than ever, though, there needs to be similar investment and planning to check far-right radicalization and understand the mechanisms that propel attacks like the one in Finsbury Park.Advertisement"}

These are indisputably signs of progress and, as such, something to toast. But that progress has come too slowly. None of it should have to be so surprising, special or rare in the year of our Lord 2017.\u201cIt\u2019s where we are in our culture,\u201d said Sue Kroll, the president for marketing and distribution at Warner Bros., the studio behind \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d \u201cWhen things work on this kind of massive scale, people are surprised.\u201dOf course, she noted, they shouldn\u2019t be.That\u2019s the way it has been for so long in Hollywood, where until relatively recently men almost exclusively called the shots, made the rules and rarely faced accountability for their behavior. Change seems to be coming, though haltingly.Now, \u201cthere\u2019s a large segment of the population, men and women, who have a raised consciousness about powerful men getting away with\u201d sexual assault and \u201creally abysmal patterns of many years of sexual harassment,\u201d said Nancy Erika Smith, the lawyer for the former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, whose lawsuit accusing Roger Ailes of sexual harassment led to his ouster as the network\u2019s chairman.That raised consciousness \u2014 which has led to a so-called Cosby Effect, emboldening more women to step forward with allegations they were previously afraid to share \u2014 is another sign of progress to cheer.Of course, it\u2019s a low-bar celebration: \u201cHooray for us \u2014 we\u2019re no longer ignoring women with serious claims of abuse or harassment.\u201dEven the success of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d couldn\u2019t come without a hitch. Look at what happened last week in Austin, Tex., where the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema\u2019s Ritz theater announced that it would celebrate \u201cWonder Woman\u201d with a women-only screening this Tuesday.Seemed innocent enough. The theater holds all sorts of specialty screenings, for veterans and active-duty military, for kids, for lesbians and gay people, for the hearing impaired.Another man wrote, \u201cIf people can bring a lawsuit against a baker for not making homosexual couples a cake, this place should undoubtedly be receiving many lawsuits for gender discrimination.\u201d\u201cThe notion of a woman hero is a fine example of women\u2019s eagerness to accept the appearance of achievement without actual achievement,\u201d the email read. \u201cAchievements by the second-rate gender pale in comparison to virtually everything great in human history was accomplished by men, not women.\u201dThe Austin dust-up carried whiffs of the row over the 2016 Sony Pictures remake of \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d which cast women in the starring roles.But her publicist told me that it wasn\u2019t the time, though maybe it would be down the line \u2014 apparently closer to its premiere. That, obviously, would better suit marketing imperatives.It was a good reminder that the real currency in Hollywood is less principle than success.That\u2019s fitting.

Speaking strictly from a wine point of view, when ros\u00e9 crossed over to become a symbol of pleasurable summer living, it was time to beware.The wine industry sought to capitalize on ros\u00e9\u2019s popularity by making more of it. A lot more of it. Much of it is pretty dreadful, sped along the assembly line to be ready by late spring, yet short-lived enough to be dead by the end of summer.

It is savory, stony and totally refreshing, with flavors of red berries and citrus and a lingering saline edge.This is the archetypal Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9: pale pink and made from a typical blend of grapes, usually cinsault, grenache and syrah. With the aromas of fresh fruit and warm stones, the wine has presence and depth, and still goes down easy. (Rosenthal Wine Merchant, New York)This rosato, just one of several Italian words for ros\u00e9s (including cerasuolo and ramato), comes from a historic producer of Chianti Classico. Naturally, it is made of sangiovese, the grape of Chianti. While it smells of flowers and bath powder, this lovely wine has a peachy flavor that is nonetheless savory, earthy and sinewy. (Polaner Selections)Birichino, a Central Coast n\u00e9gociant, has appeared regularly in the 20 Under $20 columns for the simple reason that its wines are always good and good values. This ros\u00e9, made from a host of southern French varieties, is bone-dry with a savory edge, just right for burgers or the sort of Mediterranean dishes you might serve at an outdoor lunch.This Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 is a tad firmer than is typical, courtesy of a high proportion of cabernet sauvignon added to the otherwise familiar blend of grenache, cinsault and mourv\u00e8dre. It is floral, earthy and savory, and despite the cabernet, is as easygoing, flirtatious and transporting as any other Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9. (Skurnik Wines)This excellent, unusual ros\u00e9 comes from the country of Georgia, one of the most ancient wine regions in the world, from an odd pigmented clone of the white rkatsiteli grape. And it is made in the ancient way: The grapes, indigenous to Georgia, are fermented in qvevri, clay amphora-like vessels lined with beeswax and buried in the earth.20 PhotosAtypically for a ros\u00e9, the juice is fermented with the grape skins for 10 days, giving the wine color and a pleasant rasp of tannin. It smells like flowers and herbs, and is a wine of real substance, though it is low in alcohol, at just 11.5 percent. (Terrell Wines, San Francisco)Ros\u00e9 de Printemps translates to \u201cros\u00e9 of spring,\u201d but this bone-dry, peppery wine is more a refreshing wine of summer. Grassroots Wine, an excellent importer and distributor in the Southern United States, getes this wine from a cooperative in the Carc\u00e8s region of Provence. In a word, \u201cdeelish.\u201d (Grassroots Wine, Birmingham, Ala.)Johannes Leitz is a top Rheingau producer whose best wines are old-vine rieslings grown on impossibly steep slopes. Pinot noir ros\u00e9 must be a sort of cash cow, but who could begrudge him when the wine is so pleasing and refreshing. It is bone-dry and smells like pinot noir, but its savory flavors give it another dimension. (Schatzi Wines, Milan, N.Y.)For New Yorkers who would like to drink local, and for anyone else simply interested in a good ros\u00e9, W\u00f6lffer Estate on the South Fork of Long Island makes this dry, fresh and pleasing blend of cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, merlot and riesling. It is peachy and well balanced with an underlying note of anise.The winemaker Fran\u00e7ois Chidaine, best known for his excellent Montlouis, makes this zesty ros\u00e9 from the red grapes grolleau, pinot noir and gamay. It is rather full-bodied with a color almost of maraschino cherries. The wine is bone-dry and floral, with a kind of dark, herbal edge. (Polaner Selections)I am a fan of just about anything Jean-Paul Brun produces, from his cru Beaujolais to his straightforward Beaujolais L\u2019Ancien Vieilles Vignes and Beaujolais Blanc to this lovely ros\u00e9, made of gamay mostly from young vines. The wine, a gorgeous shade of pale cherry, is softly fruity with a lively, stony core. Refreshing and to the point.

{"Headline": "Yoga Teachers Need a Code of Ethics", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorUnfortunately, the case of Mr. Choudhury is not unique. In 2016, a beloved teacher in the New York City-based Jivamukti Yoga center, known for its celebrity clientele, was sued, along with the center and its leaders, for sexual abuse by her mentee. John Friend\u2019s Anusara community was rocked and dissolved in 2012 after he was discovered having affairs with married students and performing Wiccan-like sex rituals. Kripalu\u2019s Amrit Desai was accused of sexual misconduct and abuse of authority in 1994 and a $2.5 million settlement was paid (the Kripalu Center in Massachusetts divorced itself from Desai and reorganized). And there are, of course, countless under-the-radar stories of yoga teachers coming on to students or touching them inappropriately in class.This must stop. As a practitioner of yoga for 20 years who has been teaching for a decade, I know that people often approach spiritual practices like yoga and meditation when they are vulnerable. They come recovering from broken bones and hearts, and usually at some greater personal crossroads. They come with trauma, addictions or eating disorders. They come after divorce. They come with hope.In this state of vulnerability, it is absolutely critical that students feel safe. Teachers, like therapists or educators in other fields, have an inherent power, which can be used to either heal or exploit. But because it is also easy to conflate the goodness of yoga with the teachers themselves, instructors can benefit from an aura of ethical conduct, or even holiness \u2014 what some call a spiritual blanket that protects those who abuse their power. While it is up to students to discern between teacher and teachings, those in authority have a responsibility to protect.Yoga transformed my life: healing a back injury, giving me tools to work with my anxiety and providing a spiritual home. Had it not, I would have quit. Some victims have quit, and face years of trauma from what should have been a refuge from the hurt of life: spiritual practice. This sort of violation denotes rape on many levels: spiritually, mentally, emotionally and, yes, sometimes physically.When I began teaching yoga at an all-girls charter school in Lower Manhattan, we took the first class to create a \u201cyoga contract.\u201d Girls from 5 to 12 years old brainstormed and signed lists of rules to \u201ckeep everyone safe and happy\u201d during practice. Rules they themselves invented included \u201crespect others\u2019 space\u201d and \u201cuse active listening.\u201d As the teacher, I signed, too. We ended each class with a Sanskrit chant that translates to, \u201cThe one true teacher lives in the center of your heart.\u201d I wanted these young girls to know, though teachers are helpful guides, the one true authority is inside of them. I wanted them to carry this lesson forward into their adult yoga world as women. Mr. Choudhury and others like him could learn plenty from these girls.We cannot rely on karma alone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video of Police Killing of Philando Castile Is Publicly Released", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byThe video reveals how a mundane conversation about a broken taillight devolved within seconds into gunfire. The newly released footage provides the fullest account yet of an episode that led to a national debate over police conduct toward black people, but it also leaves unanswered critical questions about what happened that day.The video opens at dusk on July 6, 2016, on a busy street near the Minnesota state fairgrounds. Officer Yanez is following a white Oldsmobile driven by Mr. Castile in Falcon Heights, a St. Paul suburb. When Officer Yanez turns on his flashing lights, Mr. Castile, a longtime school cafeteria worker, quickly pulls to the side and stops his car. Ms. Reynolds is in the front passenger seat, and her young daughter is in the back.Though it is not heard on the video, Officer Yanez radioed to a colleague that he thought Mr. Castile matched the description of a robbery suspect from a few days earlier. He tells a fellow officer that Mr. Castile\u2019s \u201cwide-set nose\u201d looked like the robber\u2019s. Officer Yanez waits for the second officer to arrive before pulling Mr. Castile over, but he never mentions his robbery suspicions to Mr. Castile.Most revealing, perhaps, about the newly released video are the voices that can be clearly heard on it \u2014 a calm, polite discussion at first, and then, in seconds, a sudden burst of tension and shots.At first, Officer Yanez walks up to Mr. Castile\u2019s window and tells him that his brake light is broken. The officer asks for proof of insurance and a driver\u2019s license. Mr. Castile responds politely and hands his insurance card through the window.Mr. Castile, who had a permit to carry a gun, then says, \u201cSir, I have to tell you I do have a firearm on me.\u201dOfficer Yanez then reaches toward his holster and says, \u201cO.K., don\u2019t reach for it, then.\u201dThis is a collection of the viral footage that has prompted a national conversation about race and policing.Mr. Castile starts to answer, but is cut off by Officer Yanez, whose voice is now raised. \u201cDon\u2019t pull it out!\u201d the officer yells.\u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out,\u201d Mr. Castile says, and Ms. Reynolds also tries to assure Officer Yanez that her boyfriend is not grabbing the gun.Officer Yanez again yells, \u201cDon\u2019t pull it out!\u201d Then he fires seven shots, fatally wounding Mr. Castile. \u201cI wasn\u2019t reaching,\u201d Mr. Castile says softly just after the gunfire stops.In the minutes after the shooting, Officer Yanez keeps his gun pointed into the car as he calls for backup and an ambulance. He grows emotional and repeatedly yells an expletive.The video does not show images that might have been essential for jurors to consider: a full view of the front seat of Mr. Castile\u2019s car, which would have showed his hands \u2014 and what he was reaching for \u2014 just before the shooting.Officer Yanez has said that Mr. Castile was reaching for his gun, and his lawyers made that a central point in his defense. Officer Yanez, who was charged with three felonies, including second-degree manslaughter, told jurors he feared for his life. But Ms. Reynolds has said that Mr. Castile was simply reaching for his driver\u2019s license, as the officer had asked him to do.From where the dashcam was perched, though, behind the car, the video cannot resolve this.The footage quickly spread Tuesday afternoon after it was released by state investigators. The images drew anger, prompting responses on social media from rights activists and others.Protesters have marched in the St. Paul area since the acquittal on Friday, calling the shooting unreasonable and evidence of racism in the justice system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Britain Really Do Much More to Tighten Security?", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 British police and security services already have some of the most powerful surveillance laws in the world, with weak judicial oversight and little criticism on privacy issues from a public that generally trusts its government and Civil Service.Surveillance cameras are everywhere, especially in cities, and there are relatively few restrictions on the mass collection of telephone and internet data by the government.Her comments were criticized as political and brought concerns about whether, if re-elected, her antiterrorism plans could be effective and also protect civil liberties. In her remarks, she announced a review of counterterrorism policy, harsher sentences for terrorism offenses, and an effort to crack down on \u201csafe spaces\u201d online and in self-segregated Muslim communities that can harbor extremism.\u201cIt will only be defeated when we turn people\u2019s minds away from this violence,\u201d she said, and make young people \u201cunderstand that our values, pluralistic British values, are superior to anything offered by the preachers and supporters of hate.\u201dThat was a departure for the British government, said Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, a politically conservative research organization in London that focuses on democracy and anti-extremism.\u201cFor a long time, this government didn\u2019t really look at the ideology of radical Islam, but law and order,\u201d he said.Mrs. May recognized on Sunday, he added, \u201cthat ideology is the central point, and that the ideological challenge will be tougher, to talk to communities and push them to resolve the ideological fight within themselves.\u201dMrs. May is acknowledging that \u201cthe communities are not so good at policing themselves,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said.\u201cYou need more grass-roots intelligence, not community intelligence,\u201d he said, with less delicacy about community sensitivities and more willingness on the part of the British to use the vast powers they already have under the law.In a time of growing anxiety over terrorism, it is a bargain that Europeans may be more inclined to accept. There were, for instance, no protests when France\u2019s new government suggested last month that it would seek a sixth extension for the state emergency the country has been living under for a year and a half.But it is not clear that tougher surveillance and policing measures alone are the solution. Mrs. May promises more help for stretched counterterrorism police and intelligence agencies.But Mrs. May was selling old rope, said Peter R. Neumann, a professor of security studies at King\u2019s College London and director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization. The statements amount to a recycling of previous efforts to toughen antiterrorism laws, he added, and of the Conservative Party\u2019s criticism of the powers of internet and social media companies to resist targeted government surveillance of suspects. That theme is also prominent in the party\u2019s election platform.In fact, Mr. Neumann said, technology companies are much more responsive now to government requests to shut down accounts or videos expressing extremist views than they were three years ago. But that has pushed extremists to use encrypted channels of communication, like Telegram, he said.\u201cYou can\u2019t eradicate the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people have not gone away but gone to a different platform, one much more difficult for intelligence agencies to monitor.\u201dMrs. May and her predecessor, David Cameron, regularly pushed big technology companies to allow a \u201cback door\u201d for intelligence agencies into encrypted communications. While the companies have quietly been much more helpful on security cases, they have refused those \u201cback door\u201d requests, although intelligence agencies are working separately to create them.On Sunday, Mrs. May\u2019s successor as home secretary, Amber Rudd, said that technology companies could do \u201cso much more\u201d to restrict extremism online. \u201cIt is not good enough to say, \u2018Do no harm.\u2019 We have to get them to actively work with us to stop their platforms being used to radicalize people.\u201dShe said that more needed to be done to take down extremist materials, but she also said that social media giants should limit end-to-end encryption, which many extremist groups use to plot attacks.These are familiar Tory themes. Mrs. May herself has called for democratic governments to demand greater controls over how services like WhatsApp and FaceTime could be used by attackers to spread extremist messages online, as well as how extremists could use social media to promote their views to a global digital audience.These demands have raised concerns from some of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest companies, as well as from online-privacy campaigners, which claim that the new powers would infringe on people\u2019s liberties.The step comes less than a year after the British government passed some of the most far-reaching legislation in the world, giving law enforcement agencies widespread powers to monitor both internet and phone traffic. Britain currently has access to the metadata of online communications without a warrant, but not to the content of individual messages.In recent years, tech companies have repeatedly said they are willing to work with law enforcement to crack down on extremists using their services, but they have added that weakening encryption could also allow for the illegal collection of personal information by domestic or foreign intelligence services, among others.Islamic extremists have carried out over a dozen deadly terror attacks in Western Europe since 2015.\u201cIn terms of surveillance power, Britain is already better equipped than any other European country,\u201d said Mr. Neumann of King\u2019s College London. \u201cThere is no real judicial oversight: Cabinet ministers sign off on warrants, so the executive signs off on itself.\u201dUnlike in the United States, the British Parliament\u2019s intelligence oversight committee is weak and has very little subpoena power.\u201cThe British have no trouble listening in to anyone\u2019s phone or going into anyone\u2019s house,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the government uses those powers very carefully, which shows how the unspoken consensus here works,\u201d he added, noting that the country has no written Constitution.In countries with written Constitutions, like Germany and the United States, \u201cyou can define extremism as those opposed to the precepts of the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cMay talked of \u2018British values\u2019 as the antithesis to extremism, but it\u2019s hard to articulate what extremism means and enforce it legally\u201d \u2014 let alone decide what British values actually mean.\u201d\u201cYou can say that means being friendly, moderate and polite,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut you can\u2019t legislate politeness.\u201dThere are unconfirmed reports that at least one of the London assailants was a Muslim who had been influenced by Mr. Choudary.\u201cChoudary was for years the single person most responsible for Islamist recruiting and propaganda, but he wasn\u2019t charged until 2015, when May had been home secretary for five years,\u201d Mr. Neumann said.\u201cHe was a real life radical preacher who recruited people face to face,\u201d he said, \u201cand much more important for jihad in Britain than Twitter or Facebook.\u201dMark Scott contributed reporting from Rome, and Adam Nossiter from Paris.Advertisement"}

Our site had vanished from the internet in Egypt. After some technical tests and conversations with users of different internet service providers, we realized what had happened: Mada Masr was being blocked in Egypt.Mada Masr was born in a moment of political uncertainty. It was June 2013, when people were protesting the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood. Then the military intervened, ousted President Mohamed Morsi and appointed a government until their commander, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was elected president a few months later.Dissent \u2014 or any act resembling critique of public policy \u2014 was the casualty: endless administrative detentions for some political dissidents, hasty litigation and harsh mass verdicts for others; random killings of political opponents; systematic intimidation of activists, independent journalists and human rights defenders; legislated restrictions on the media and civil society. The authorities rendered the political space void. All other actors were pushed to the margins.Stepping into this void, a number of journalists in Egypt started publishing about all of the above. We called ourselves Mada Masr. \u201cMada\u201d is the Arabic word for \u201creach,\u201d like the horizon. We chose it as a reminder of the possibility of seeing a way out. Mada is also the spot where a gem or stone is placed on a ring, a symbol of taking a position, not succumbing to the reality of our violent exclusion from politics.Four years after its founding, and after constant news coverage, multiple investigative reports and scores of insightful articles about what Egypt has become, Mada Masr was blocked. No one has claimed responsibility for the blockade, which was conducted through an RST injection, a technology China uses to block websites as part of its infamous firewall. An RST injection is a reset command by a third party that prevents data from traveling through an internet protocol, which is the system that connects computers to the internet.News spread in state-affiliated media, which quoted anonymous security sources saying that the authorities had ordered the blocking of a number of websites in Egypt for supporting terrorism and spreading lies. In addition to Mada Masr, a number of other sites have been blocked, including Al Jazeera, the HuffPost\u2019s Arabic-language site, and the Egyptian financial newspaper Al Borsa and its English sister publication, Daily News Egypt.But still, no one from the government has spoken to us.Of course we want freedom. But we at Mada Masr \u2014 like many other groups \u2014 have learned how to thrive in precarity.I am not sure that blocking our website and other websites is the most productive way to stop the flow of knowledge. We are agile. And although the internet has morphed from an ultimately free space into one that governments and big private players have turned into their own terrain, it is still a place where we are able to emerge and re-emerge. Do those invisible powers that come up with the idea of blocking websites or sign off on such decisions know that?The state is powerful and will always be more powerful. But we have also been building power. We at Mada Masr belong to the many in Egypt today who did not disappear when we lost but instead remain in the hide-outs created by that political void. At moments of crisis, at times of direct collision with state power, those hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of us have not really drowned in despair, but rather we have been able to craft politics. And in being political, we recognize and grab moments of possibility, even if they come wrapped in crisis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fattier Pork Is Better Pork", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteAs the availability of good, fat-marbled pork has risen, so has my adoration of that stalwart favorite, the bone-in pork chop.Things used to be different.You can still certainly find lean pork chops, and if you like them, feel free to use them in this recipe. But the more succulent, dark pink meat of thick-cut chops, most likely raised on small farms, is probably in the supermarket refrigerator case right alongside the skinnier chops. Look for a creamy layer of fat surrounding the meat and bone \u2014 this is a sign of something good.For the cook, the fat serves several purposes: It insulates the meat, keeping it juicier for longer, giving you a larger margin of error when it comes to cooking. Even if you overshoot your target temperature, the fat protects the flesh, keeping it moist.Fat also adds flavor, meaning you don\u2019t need to do too much to your chops beyond adding a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper to make them taste fantastic.This said, marinating the chops can make them even better. Here, I smear them with a paste of turmeric, tamarind, cumin, chile, garlic, ginger and a touch of fish sauce. It\u2019s not a flavor combination that\u2019s authentic to any one place, but the sour, pungent and salty notes all go together beautifully.A brief stint of high-heat searing followed by a jaunt to the oven allows the edges of the chops to caramelize and the center to cook a little more slowly. If you are grilling instead of roasting, a combination of direct heat and indirect heat yields similar results.I like my pork chops cooked between medium-rare and medium, with meat that\u2019s distinctly pink and juicy. I aim for an internal temperature of 135 degrees and let the meat rest for a few minutes, allowing the temperature to rise and the juices to reabsorb. Then I carve it off the bone and serve it in slices.With all the aromatics in the marinade, these chops don\u2019t need a sauce, though a spoonful or two of the drippings makes them glisten and intensifies their already wonderfully rich flavor: the taste of good, fatty pork.And to Drink ...cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Role in European Elections Under Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byMr. Dodd, a maker of musical instruments in northern England, joined an experiment. He and around 10,000 others volunteered their data, allowing researchers to monitor in real time which political ads were showing up in their Facebook news feeds as Britain\u2019s election approached.Their goal: to shed more light on how political campaigns are using Facebook and other digital services \u2014 technologies that are quickly reshaping the democratic process, but which often offer few details about their outsize roles in elections worldwide.\u201cThese political ads aren\u2019t regulated; nobody knows what is being said on Facebook,\u201d said Mr. Dodd, 26, who planned to vote for the Labour Party on Thursday elections, but who continued to be bombarded with online messages from the Conservatives. \u201cWherever politics is concerned, there needs to more transparency.\u201dFacebook provides little information on how political parties use ads to reach undecided voters on the site. And concern has been growing since the American presidential election about the company\u2019s role in campaigns, including about how politically charged fake news is spread online.Costing less than $1,000 to build, the technology, which works as a plug-in on desktop web browsers and anonymizes users\u2019 personal information, was created because the social network does not share information on political ads shown to its more than 36 million users in Britain, roughly half the country\u2019s population.That lack of information has raised hackles about the activities of both Facebook and politicians in a country where campaigns are highly regulated and political financing is tightly capped.\u201cPolitical advertising is fundamentally different; there\u2019s a lot of concern about what\u2019s being seen on Facebook,\u201d said Sam Jeffers, the group\u2019s co-founder and a former digital media strategist. \u201cThe people deserve some sense of what\u2019s going on.\u201dAs the volunteer group is not completely representative of the British population, the data is by no means perfect, highlighting the difficulty of tracking political activity on Facebook.In the buildup to the election, for instance, the data showed that the Liberal Democrats \u2014 who are likely to remain a minority presence in Parliament \u2014 posted the largest number of political ads on Facebook. The Conservative Party was second, despite the political party\u2019s pledge to spend 1 million pounds, or $1.3 million, on social media messaging. The Labour Party, which planned to spend a similar amount, was in third place.Initially, all the British parties spent money on broad-brush messages that blanketed the social network without targeting specific voters. But as Election Day approached, that strategy began to change.The ads have included Conservative Party messages about potential nuclear energy jobs in three areas in northern England with ties to the industry, and that are some of the country\u2019s most contested districts. By contrast, the Labour Party targeted older women nationwide with directed ads about potential threats to their pensions.\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental conversation to have about how we regulate this,\u201d said Nick Anstead, a media and communications expert at the London School of Economics. \u201cFacebook has a responsibility to tell its users who is buying advertising that is targeting their votes.\u201dIn response, the company says its roughly two billion users worldwide have complete control over which ads they are shown on the network, and that it is the responsibility of individual political parties to comply with their countries\u2019 electoral laws. Facebook adds that its commercial agreements and protection of individuals\u2019 privacy restrict it from sharing more data on how information is distributed on the platform.\u201cFacebook\u2019s goal is to make it easier for people to get the information they need to vote,\u201d Andy Stone, a company spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage any and all candidates, groups and voters to use our platform to engage in the elections.\u201dAcademics and others scrutinizing the vote also said the company\u2019s failure to provide data on what Facebook users in France shared among themselves made it virtually impossible to determine if false reports spread on the network affected the overall result.For Ben Scott, such issues bring back mixed memories of the American presidential election, when he was a digital consultant for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.He has now turned his attention to a project at the New Responsibility Foundation, a Berlin-based research organization that is monitoring the spread and impact of fake news ahead of Germany\u2019s election in September.He and his team are categorizing potential online misinformation in a digital database, tracking how these false reports spread across social media and the wider web and conducting focus groups to gauge the impact on voters\u2019 decisions.The role of companies like Facebook in spreading online falsehoods is limited in Germany, Mr. Scott said, because social media does not play as significant a role in everyday politics as it does in the United States.Still, the social media giant \u2014 which has roughly 36 million users in Germany \u2014 is a force to reckon with in the coming election.Despite Mr. Scott\u2019s discussions with Facebook about potential collaborations, the company has so far declined to give his research project any data on how local users share potential misinformation among themselves on the social network.\u201cIf we see something getting significant media attention and there\u2019s a sudden spike,\u201d Mr. Scott said, \u201cthen we can guess there\u2019s something going on inside Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And it\u2019s not a fight between Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s not rich versus poor or urban versus rural. This is a fight to define what kind of country we are. It\u2019s a fight to determine what kind of country we will be. And it\u2019s a fight to determine whether we are willing to stand up for our deepest values.

They need them around Halcottsville, in the 19th Congressional District, where the party should be able to prevail but keeps falling short.Its optimism grows with Trump\u2019s woes. But will Democrats put forward the right candidate for a largely working-class region whose barns need paint, whose town centers want for bustle and whose manufacturing plants are too few and far between?\u201cI liked her mind,\u201d Margulies said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m not practical.\u201dWell, the time for romance is past. The 2018 midterms could hinge on how ruthlessly pragmatic Democrats are.From the scandalous look of the last week, dominated by James Comey\u2019s testimony, Democrats are beautifully positioned to trounce Republicans wherever Republicans are trounce-able. But the party has done an ace job of sabotaging itself before. The 19th District, also known as the Hudson Valley, tells that story well.They\u2019re still not sure how much of Trump\u2019s victory had to do with Hillary Clinton\u2019s flaws versus the party\u2019s poor grasp of America, and the more they focus on the former, tattling for the tell-all book \u201cShattered\u201d and then tittering over its revelations, the less they own up to the latter.Then there are the candidates, who sometimes step forward, or are elevated, independent of any master plan. Democrats in the 19th haven\u2019t been riding optimal ones.Their horse in 2014 was a pampered foal, Sean Eldridge, then 28, who is married to the Facebook multimillionaire Chris Hughes and qualified for the race by purchasing a $2 million country house just an hour from the $5 million country house the couple already owned.He ran against a popular, deft incumbent who then decided to retire from the House after 2016, so Democrats nursed renewed hopes in last year\u2019s congressional election. Party chieftains in Washington put the Hudson Valley high on their wish list of House seats to turn blue.Teachout was the favorite of the local progressives who held sway in the primary. She had been anointed by Sanders. She had attained some celebrity by challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s 2014 re-election bid. So they passed over Will Yandik, a relative moderate whose family farm went back several generations and who had graduated from a local high school before getting bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in the Ivy League.\u201cI don\u2019t know that I would have won,\u201d Yandik told me. \u201cI would have come closer than Zephyr Teachout.\u201d Looking ahead, he said that \u201cin a swing district where every single percentage point matters, the inability to demonstrate a cultural connection to the district is a liability.\u201dHe\u2019s taking a pass on 2018 but is watching to see whether Democratic primary voters \u201care going to be strategic and pick a centrist and someone with deep roots \u2014 someone who can beat John Faso \u2014 or whether they are going to adhere to their progressive principles and put a firebrand like Zephyr Teachout up again.\u201dThe Hudson Valley is shaping up to be a laboratory for how Democrats do \u2014 or don\u2019t \u2014 stage a comeback. Several political analysts pointed out to me that before new congressional boundaries took effect for the race of 2012, much of it fell in the 20th District, which Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat, won in 2006 and 2008. (She later graduated to the Senate.) Of course she was less liberal back then, when she bragged about the guns under her bed and opposed driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented immigrants.For now, party leaders are optimistic. Just five months into his first term, Faso is being hammered for his support of the Republican health care bill and his broken promise to protect people with pre-existing conditions. He\u2019s being hounded by Democratic activists whenever he makes public appearances in the district, so he makes almost none. It\u2019s hard to imagine how he will run a re-election campaign as the invisible man, and his perceived vulnerability has already attracted eight challengers.And among Trump voters, there\u2019s frustration, even anger. I ran into one of them, Renee Gardner, a hotel maid, at a Memorial Day weekend street fair in the center of Fleischmanns, a once-prosperous village along a stretch of the Catskill Mountains that has been called the Jewish Alps. She sat alone in a gazebo as a band played Patsy Cline\u2019s \u201cCrazy.\u201d\u201cEverything Trump was talking about sounded fantastic,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I believe most politicians are crooks, so let\u2019s get a real person in there \u2014 even if he\u2019s a crook, too. But I\u2019ve learned a lot by watching that gay woman and Anderson Cooper.\u201d She was referring to Rachel Maddow. And she has reached a conclusion about Trump, bolstered by his incessant tweeting: \u201cHe\u2019s a moron.\u201dShe was fairly certain that she voted for Faso in 2016 \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not very political,\u201d she explained \u2014 but hadn\u2019t yet contemplated 2018. When she does, will she find a candidate to her liking?I heard complaints that Teachout\u2019s approach was \u201ctoo intellectual,\u201d \u201ctoo global.\u201d So far, the candidates for 2018 do seem more narrowly attuned to economic issues.Democrats in the Hudson Valley are especially focused on health care, as I could tell from a demonstration against Faso in Kinderhook, just outside his office there. Many of the signs carried by about two dozen protesters referred to Obamacare, though my favorite ridiculed Trump\u2019s exemption from military service with the words \u201cShow Us Your Bone Spurs.\u201d On the reverse side it said, \u201cWe Shall Overcomb.\u201dBut health care wasn\u2019t a bridge to victory in the recent special election in Montana. Maybe that\u2019s because of the state\u2019s conservative bent, or maybe Democrats need to recalibrate. I also worry, based on my travels through the Hudson Valley, that anti-Trump political activism is scattered across too many issues and subgroups.I saw panic about the country\u2019s direction. I\u2019m not sure I sensed a commensurate cunning. I saw passion. But passion doesn\u2019t equal unity, and unity is the surer way to overcomb.Advertisement"}

An Oculus spokeswoman said Mr. Luckey\u2019s departure had not been connected to his political views. But the person who knows Mr. Luckey said he had been pushed out and was rarely seen in the Oculus offices after the news about his political activities broke.Soon after, he was working on his next start-up idea: The company plans to use a technology found in self-driving cars called lidar \u2014 shorthand for light detection and ranging \u2014 as well as infrared sensors and cameras to monitor borders for illegal crossings, according to the three people familiar with the plan.As as he sees it, according to those familiar with the plan, the technology can be used for many kinds of perimeter security, including military bases and stadium events, where it could be used to detect drones. Software would help the system figure out which objects to ignore, like birds and coyotes.Those familiar with the plan say Mr. Luckey believes his system, which can be mounted on telephone poles, can be built far more cost effectively than Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed wall on the Mexican border \u2014 and with fewer obstacles from landowners.Mr. Thiel\u2019s investment firm, Founders Fund, plans to invest in it, according to people with knowledge of its plans. They said the firm sees Mr. Luckey\u2019s venture in the mold of Palantir Technologies, a data-mining company co-founded by Mr. Thiel, which serves a wide range of clients, including intelligence agencies. A spokeswoman for Founders Fund declined to comment.And Mr. Luckey discussed the idea of using sensor technology on the Mexican border with Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u201cThe secretary had a very brief meeting where he listened to Mr. Luckey about using technology on the border and referred him to the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d said Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for Mr. Zinke. \u201cThere was no action after the meeting.\u201dAn article on June 5 about Palmer Luckey, a founder of Oculus VR who is working on a new start-up, misidentified the county where he grew up.

{"Headline": "Trump Meets India\u2019s Leader, a Fellow Nationalist Battling China for His Favor", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, two nationalist leaders with a shared passion for social media, met on Monday as India sought to vie with China for Mr. Trump\u2019s favor in the region.Mr. Trump lavished praise on Mr. Modi, calling him a \u201ctrue friend\u201d with ambitious plans to fight corruption and cut taxes. The two men also share a devotion to Twitter and Facebook to bypass the news media and reach their publics directly.The display of warmth, a senior White House official said, was at least partly aimed at President Xi Jinping of China, who has disappointed Mr. Trump in recent weeks by failing to impose more pressure on neighboring North Korea to curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Pointedly, Mr. Trump noted that India had helped the United States enforce sanctions on North Korea. \u201cThe North Korean regime is causing tremendous problems,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s something that has to be dealt with \u2014 and probably dealt with rapidly.\u201dMr. Modi returned the favor, praising Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cvast and successful\u201d business experience, which he predicted would galvanize relations between the United States and India. He also invited Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka to a conference of entrepreneurs in India.Yet the mutual admiration masked a more complicated dynamic between India and the United States. While ties between the two have grown steadily closer over the last two decades, India faces new uncertainties with Mr. Trump, who has shown less interest than his predecessors in maintaining a web of trade and security alliances in Asia.\u201cIndia would like to continue to deepen its friendship, but Trump can only be an object of concern, even if he tweets lovely compliments after dinner,\u201d said Ashutosh Varshney, director of the Center for Contemporary South Asia at Brown University. \u201cIndia might get a good deal, or not a bad deal, or a bad deal, or no deal. Who can say?\u201dFor now, the United States and India are finding common cause in pushing back against China\u2019s maritime ambitions. Before Mr. Modi\u2019s visit, the Trump administration approved the sale of 22 surveillance drones to India, which New Delhi can use to eavesdrop on Chinese naval movements in the Indian Ocean. Mr. Trump also spoke about a huge joint naval exercise in the Indian Ocean that will involve Japanese, Indian and American warships.India has its own deep-rooted suspicions of China. Mr. Xi\u2019s marquee development project \u2014 known as One Belt, One Road \u2014 seeks to knit together China, South and Central Asia, and Europe through a vast array of ports, roads and railways, mostly funded by China. India views the project as a threat to its historically dominant position in South Asia.The sale of the so-called Guardian drones builds on years of deepening cooperation between the United States and India on maritime security, as India searched for ways to track Chinese submarines entering the Indian Ocean.Though India is traditionally wary of military alliances, the two countries have explored ways to create a naval network that would balance China\u2019s maritime expansion. Among the proposals are joint naval patrols in the South China Sea, an idea India has so far rejected.The drones, which have never before been sold to a non-NATO country, could be especially valuable if they are flown over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, giving India control of a so-called choke point that is one of China\u2019s greatest marine vulnerabilities.They could be used with India\u2019s fleet of Poseidon surveillance aircraft, which it acquired from the United States beginning in 2013, said David Brewster, a visiting fellow at the National Security College of Australian National University. The Poseidon \u201csub-hunters\u201d can also be staged from the Andaman and Nicobar island chain.The announcement of the sale was followed closely by Chinese news organizations. China Central Television declared, \u201cThe Indian Navy wants to use these drones to put the whole Indian Ocean under its surveillance.\u201dMr. Modi and Mr. Trump have much in common, including a history of anti-Muslim rhetoric, a nationalist focus on homegrown manufacturing, a fraught relationship with the news media, and electoral campaigns that benefited from the proliferation of fake news.Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, hailed Mr. Modi\u2019s victory in 2014 as part of a global revolt against uncaring elites. He has told colleagues he views Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump as symbolizing the same nationalist passions in the world\u2019s two largest democracies.Yet they are also very different: Mr. Modi is a deeply religious ascetic who often fasts and points to his lack of family as proof of his commitment to India and resistance to corruption. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been widely criticized for his treatment of women and his extravagant lifestyle, and has celebrated his children\u2019s business dealings even amid accusations that they are using his office for personal enrichment.\u201cTrump is not going to want to improve ties with India because of the importance of the international liberal order or to invest in an architecture of Asian alliances, as the last two administrations did,\u201d said Ashley J. Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cSo the Indians want the two men to build a personal rapport so that Trump invests in India because he thinks Modi is a great guy. That\u2019s the best you can get.\u201dWith little chance of any grand bargains between the countries, both sides are mainly hoping the two leaders get along. Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, played host to Mr. Modi at a dinner after their appearance together in the Rose Garden. At the end of their remarks, Mr. Modi dispensed with the usual energetic handshake and rather awkwardly hugged Mr. Trump.\u201cWhether two nationalists will actually hit it off is harder to say,\u201d said Daniel S. Markey, an expert on India at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cMy guess is they will gamely play along for the cameras, and then go back to their respective sides and complain that the other guy was very strange and hard to understand.\u201dEllen Barry and Hari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cyberattack Hits Ukraine Then Spreads Internationally", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byIn Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, A.T.M.s stopped working. About 80 miles away, workers were forced to manually monitor radiation at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant when their computers failed. And tech managers at companies around the world \u2014 from Maersk, the Danish shipping conglomerate, to Merck, the drug giant in the United States \u2014 were scrambling to respond. Even an Australian factory for the chocolate giant Cadbury was affected.The outbreak was the latest and perhaps the most sophisticated in a series of attacks making use of dozens of hacking tools that were stolen from the National Security Agency and leaked online in April by a group called the Shadow Brokers.The National Security Agency has not acknowledged its tools were used in WannaCry or other attacks. But computer security specialists are demanding that the agency help the rest of the world defend against the weapons it created.\u201cJust because you roll out a patch doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be put in place quickly,\u201d said Carl Herberger, vice president for security at Radware. \u201cThe more bureaucratic an organization is, the higher chance it won\u2019t have updated its software.\u201dBecause the ransomware used at least two other ways to spread on Tuesday \u2014 including stealing victims\u2019 credentials \u2014 even those who used the Microsoft patch could be vulnerable and potential targets for later attacks, according to researchers at F-Secure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm, and others.A Microsoft spokesman said the company\u2019s latest antivirus software should protect against the attack.The Ukrainian government said several of its ministries, local banks and metro systems had been affected. A number of other European companies, including Rosneft, the Russian energy giant; Saint-Gobain, the French construction materials company; and WPP, the British advertising agency, also said they had been targeted.Ukrainian officials pointed a finger at Russia on Tuesday, although Russian companies were also affected. Home Credit bank, one of Russia\u2019s top 50 lenders, was paralyzed, with all of its offices closed, according to the RBC news website. The attack also affected Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company that employs about 80,000 people, the RBC website reported.In the United States, the multinational law firm DLA Piper also reported being hit. Hospitals in Pennsylvania were being forced to cancel operations after the attack hit computers at Heritage Valley Health Systems, a Pennsylvania health care provider, and its hospitals in Beaver and Sewickley, Penn., and satellite locations across the state.Qantas Airways\u2019 booking system failed for a time on Tuesday, but the company said the breakdown was due to an unrelated hardware issue.The Australian government has urged companies to install security updates and isolate any infected computers from their networks.\u201cThis ransomware attack is a wake-up call to all Australian businesses to regularly back up their data and install the latest security patches,\u201d said Dan Tehan, the cybersecurity minister. \u201cWe are aware of the situation and monitoring it closely.\u201dA National Security Agency spokesman referred questions about the attack to the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security is monitoring reports of cyberattacks affecting multiple global entities and is coordinating with our international and domestic cyber partners,\u201d Scott McConnell, a department spokesman, said in a statement.Computer specialists said the ransomware was very similar to a virus that emerged last year called Petya. Petya means \u201cLittle Peter,\u201d in Russian, leading some to speculate the name referred to Sergei Prokofiev\u2019s 1936 symphony \u201cPeter and the Wolf,\u201d about a boy who captures a wolf.That means anyone could launch the ransomware with the click of a button, encrypt someone\u2019s systems and demand a ransom to unlock it. If the victim pays, the authors of the Petya ransomware, who call themselves Janus Cybercrime Solutions, get a cut of the payment.That distribution method means that pinning down the people responsible for Tuesday\u2019s attack could be difficult.The attack is \u201can improved and more lethal version of WannaCry,\u201d said Matthieu Suiche, a security researcher who helped contain the spread of the WannaCry ransomware when he created a kill switch that stopped the attacks.In just the last seven days, Mr. Suiche noted, WannaCry had tried to hit an additional 80,000 organizations but was prevented from executing attack code because of the kill switch. Petya does not have a kill switch.The hackers behind Petya demanded $300 worth of the cybercurrency Bitcoin to unlock victims\u2019 machines. By Tuesday afternoon, online records showed that 30 victims had paid the ransom, although it was not clear whether they had regained access to their files. Other victims may be out of luck, after Posteo, the German email service provider, shut down the hackers\u2019 email account.In Ukraine, people turned up at post offices, A.T.M.s and airports to find blank computer screens, or signs about closures. At Kiev\u2019s central post office, a few bewildered customers milled about, holding parcels and letters, looking at a sign that said, \u201cClosed for technical reasons.\u201dThe hackers compromised Ukrainian accounting software mandated to be used in various industries in the country, including government agencies and banks, according to researchers at Cisco Talos, the security division of the computer networking company. That allowed them to unleash their ransomware when the software, which is also used in other countries, was updated.The ransomware spread for five days across Ukraine, and around the world, before activating Tuesday evening.\u201cIf I had to guess, I would think this was done to send a political message,\u201d said Craig Williams, the senior technical researcher at Talos.One Kiev resident, Tetiana Vasylieva, was forced to borrow money from a relative after failing to withdraw money at four automated teller machines. At one A.T.M. in Kiev belonging to the Ukrainian branch of the Austrian bank Raiffeisen, a message on the screen said the machine was not functioning.Ukraine\u2019s Infrastructure Ministry, the postal service, the national railway company, and one of the country\u2019s largest communications companies, Ukrtelecom, had been affected, Volodymyr Omelyan, the country\u2019s infrastructure minister, said in a Facebook post.Officials for the metro system in Kiev said card payments could not be accepted. The national power grid company Kievenergo had to switch off all of its computers, but the situation was under control, according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. Metro Group, a German company that runs wholesale food stores, said its operations in Ukraine had been affected.At the Chernobyl plant, the computers affected by the attack collected data on radiation levels and were not connected to industrial systems at the site, where, although all reactors have been decommissioned, huge volumes of radioactive waste remain. Operators said radiation monitoring was being done manually.Cybersecurity researchers questioned whether collecting ransom was the true objective of the attack.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that this attack could have been a smoke screen,\u201d said Justin Harvey, the managing director of global incident response at Accenture Security. \u201cIf you are an evildoer and you wanted to cause mayhem, why wouldn\u2019t you try to first mask it as something else?\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the occupation of Justin Harvey. He is the managing director of global incident response at Accenture Security, not the chief security officer for the Fidelis cybersecurity company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia Makes Riesling Its Own", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byWines of The TimesWines made from the handful of international grapes planted throughout the world must have qualities that cause them to stand out or they run the risk of being ignored.Why, for example, would you choose a South African cabernet sauvignon over one made in Argentina, or Australia, or the United States, to say nothing of Italy or France?The answer may be as simple as pricing. Which region, all else being equal, offers the best value? Or it could be an issue of brand names and labels: What leaps out from the supermarket shelves to grab your attention?That is the initial level of differentiation. A deeper examination would assess whether a wine reflects the character and distinctiveness of a particular place. What does it mean for a cabernet sauvignon blend to come from Tuscany rather than Bordeaux? Do the wines express certain qualities that can come only from those particular places where the grapes are grown?Perhaps to a greater degree than other international grapes, riesling has a remarkable ability to convey the character of many different terroirs, a shorthand term that encompasses not merely the soil in which the grapes are grown, but also their microclimate, the elevation of the vines, their exposure to the sun and the human touch.One reason for this evident transparency may be that riesling has traditionally been grown in many places for which it is particularly well suited. Riesling has flourished in distinctive ways in the Mosel and Rhine valleys of Germany, in Austria and in Alsace.Beyond its Germanic homelands, noteworthy rieslings come from northern Italy, from the Finger Lakes of New York, from Napa Valley and the Northwest, from Michigan and New Zealand, and yes, from Australia.You could make the argument that pinot noir and chardonnay, too, are gifted transmitters of terroir. That is correct, but both grapes have also been widely planted in so many unsuitable places that, outside their homeland in Burgundy, their messages have often been muddied.Riesling is no newcomer to Australia. It dates back to the 19th century when German immigrants brought the grape with them. Decades ago it was the most-planted white grape in Australia, though it has been overtaken by chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and s\u00e9millon.So what does Australian riesling taste like? As with any broad, well-spread-out area, it\u2019s hard to generalize. But lime is a good place to start, especially with Clare Valley rieslings, which can also have a floral quality. Many have an earthy minerality, too, sort of a wet stone aroma, and the best are textured and resonant.\u201cI look for lime, petrol, white flowers, sometimes tropical flavors,\u201d Jeff said. In Australia, he said, oysters are often served with lime rather than with lemon, making dry Australian riesling an excellent pairing.I confess, I\u2019ve rarely heard an American use the word \u201cpetrol\u201d except when talking about riesling, which shows the influence of British wine writers. But the aroma is distinct, and more often reminds me of kerosene. It is especially apparent in rieslings with at least a few years of age.Our biggest complaint was a wide swing in quality. Our favorites were delicious and intriguing, certainly answering the question, \u201cWhy Australian riesling?\u201d But some were dull or unbalanced. These answered the question in a different way.Our top wine was the 2014 Pikes Traditionale from the Clare Valley, deep and savory with aromas and flavors of wet stones, lime and flowers. It had a delicacy and subtlety that we especially liked, and it was only $19, which made it our best value.At No. 5 was the 2014 Best\u2019s from Great Western, a lively wine with plenty of peachy fruit and just a touch of sweetness. The rich, floral 2015 St. Hallett from Eden Valley was No. 6, while the full-bodied 2015 Rolf Binder Highness from the Eden Valley, with aromas and flavors of flowers and lime, was No. 7.Two of the better known names in Australian riesling also made our list but at the bottom. The Grosset Polish Hill riesling is generally a standard-bearer for the Clare Valley. The 2014 was tangy and structured, but not showing much beyond an aroma of ripe fruits. It, too, may improve with time. And the 2014 Leeuwin Estate Art Series from the Margaret River in Western Australia was crisp, straightforward and pleasing.Obviously, 20 bottles is far too small a sample to definitively answer the existential question for Australian riesling. But our tasting did the next best thing, offering several possible reasons for wanting to drink Australian rieslings.In our small sample, we found lively, tangy, moderately priced wines that are delicious young. We found deeper, more resonant wines that should age well, and these too were moderately priced, relative to fine rieslings from elsewhere.Meanwhile, we must live in a different question: What about all those small-production rieslings that never leave Australia? I\u2019m afraid there is only one way to find out.BEST VALUELively, long, subtle and deep, with earthy aromas and flavors of flowers, wet stones and lime.

{"Headline": "Video Review: After 15-Year Break, Lincoln Continental Returns With Style", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byDrivenThe Continental name carries gravitas. So much, in fact, that it\u2019s easy to forget that Lincoln hasn\u2019t used the nameplate since 2002. It\u2019s like realizing that Team Flakes hasn\u2019t been available in the grocery store for years.Unlike the breakfast cereal, Continental is back. After a 15-year sabbatical, this luxury sedan arrives looking toned, confident and, well, familiar. When the concept debuted in 2015, Luc Donckerwolke, Bentley\u2019s design director at the time, famously asked the Lincoln team on Facebook, \u201cDo you want us to send the product tooling?\u201d The production car retains a Bentley Flying Spur silhouette, and the Revel speaker grilles carry an uncanny resemblance to their Burmester counterparts in a Mercedes.As others before me have said, \u201cGood artists copy; great artists steal.\u201dThere is original character, especially the exterior door pulls integrated into the chrome window beltline. Touch the electronic pad inside them and the doors open with a slight spring-loaded pop. Top-tier models get a power mechanism that gently cinches the doors closed the last inch or so. They\u2019re not the rear-hinged doors of the 1960s Continentals, but they attract attention.Lincoln wisely decided not to out-German the Germans. Instead, it focused on updating the Continental\u2019s American pampering abilities.Before diving further into this 10th generation (the \u201cMark\u201d designation is no longer used), a quick Continental primer. The original 1939 model was commissioned by Edsel Ford to be his personal vehicle. Frank Lloyd Wright was so smitten, he bought two. In 1956, the Mark II Continental cost an eye-popping $10,000, and it was a star driven by the stars. Warner Bros. thanked Elizabeth Taylor for making the film \u201cGiant\u201d by giving her one in a custom color that matched her dazzling eyes.The ninth-generation Continental had become a warmed-over Ford. The new one\u2019s sole visual cue to its Ford origins is the Sync 3 user interface. The chassis structure may be adapted from the Fusion/MKZ platform, but that\u2019s out of sight. The Lincoln deservedly gets its own knobs with a ribbed look and feel.There are three V6 engine choices. I drove the most powerful, a twin-turbocharged 3-liter with 400 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque. Choosing it demands all-wheel drive that sends varying power to each wheel. Buyer\u2019s note: It\u2019s more sophisticated than the all-wheel-drive mechanics paired to the turbocharged 2.7-liter engine. Base-model Continentals are front-wheel drive.The six-speed transmission operates with push buttons near the dashboard LCD screen. This layout is simplicity defined, but I hesitated every time I engaged it. Could it be too straightforward? Drive modes adjust the steering weight, suspension firmness, and throttle and transmission response. Altering the modes, though, means diving a couple of pages into the menu.The 3-liter moves out smartly with 0- to 60-mile-an-hour excursions taking a brief five seconds. The muted growl is pleasant. The cabin, aided by noise cancellation technology, is hushed in the expected way.Motoring to the grocery store in comfort mode, the Continental mostly shrugs off big bumps and potholes while quelling float and wallow. No need to shop for Dramamine. In its most athletic mode, the big Lincoln hustles through turns in dignified form. It lacks the athletic dynamisms of a Cadillac CT6, but the Lincoln insulates passengers from rough roads more effectively. Given the current state of highways, the Lincoln arguably provides a better real-world dynamic.Continental doesn\u2019t provide the creaminess of a BMW 5 Series or Mercedes E-Class, but it\u2019s more affordable. The base Continentals begin at $45,645. The fully optioned Black Label edition can rise past $81,000. My tester, a well-equipped Reserve model, retails for about $72,600. It comes with a $4,215 technology package that includes automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, head-up display and semiautonomous parking.The Environmental Protection Agency rates the turbo 3-liter\u2019s fuel economy at 16 miles per gallon in the city, 24 highway and a 19 m.p.g. average. That brings up the rear in this class. At least it runs on standard-grade gas.The cabin has the right ambience for a Continental, though it is on the shiny side. Keep a set of sunglasses aboard; there\u2019s enough brightwork and glossy wood to trim a yacht. Run a hand across the dashboard, though, and it feels rubbery; touch the door pulls and the sensation is distinctly vinyl. Perhaps upgrading to the Black Label level puts buttery leather in those places. For $1,500, you get 30-way adjustable seats. Who knew there were 30 ways to tweak a chair?Of course, the back seat is spacious \u2014 it\u2019s a Lincoln Continental. Equipped as mine was with an $850 climate package, it offers passengers their own temperature zone, toasty seat cushions and a power rear sunshade. Those who are driven should spring for the $4,300 back seat package that adds all sorts of amenities and a richer Bentley-esque atmosphere. (The rear armrest on my car had plastics more suited to a Focus.)The well-trimmed but modest trunk has the same useful size as a Honda Civic\u2019s. Fortunately, the seats split and fold.Team Flakes may be gone for good, but the Lincoln team did a commendable job of returning the Continental to market. It has been updated to meet modern luxury demands. Shunning retro design and a harsh sporty ride, the Continental feels comfortable in its own skin, even if it\u2019s not a completely original one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Investigate Video of an Off-Duty Officer Pinning a Teenager", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byAn off-duty police officer in an Illinois village pinned a teenager to the ground and threatened him while accusing him of trespassing, according to a video that the police said they were investigating.The video, recorded on Saturday by a friend of the teenager, shows the officer in his front yard in the village of Lansing, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, wearing civilian clothes. He appeared to be holding down the teenager with a hand at the boy\u2019s neck. The officer, who is white, can be heard using expletives and saying that he could kill the teenager, Jordan Brunson, 15, who is black.Jordan\u2019s aunt, LaShawnya Brunson, 42, said she saw the video on Sunday.She said on Tuesday: \u201cOf course I was disgusted. I was upset. I was angry. I was confused, like why did you do this to this juvenile?\u201dShe added, \u201cBut my anger intensified when I realized it was a cop.\u201dAndrew M. Stroth, a lawyer representing Jordan and his family, said Jordan did nothing that would warrant being pinned to the ground.\u201cThe video speaks for itself,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cYou have a white police officer who threatened to kill a 15-year-old African-American minor, and to me it\u2019s just a complete lack of judgment by a member of the police using unnecessary and excessive force.\u201dA fight involving about 30 juveniles had started on Saturday afternoon, according to a statement from the Lansing Police Department. The mass altercation had broken up by the time officers responded.Nearby, on his property, the off-duty officer, who was not identified, found a backpack with a hat and a BB gun. He then \u201cencountered a male white juvenile on his property, bleeding from the face\u201d who had been involved in the fight, the statement said. The owner of the backpack was not immediately clear.As Jordan approached, the officer told both teenagers to stay until other officers arrived. But \u201cthe juveniles refused to stay and attempted to leave, resulting in the off-duty officer physically detaining one of the juveniles,\u201d the statement said. The boys were turned over to the police and later taken home.The clip, which was posted on Facebook by family members on Monday, did not capture the entire interaction. The man cannot be heard identifying himself as an officer, and it was not clear from the police statement whether he did so at any point.The teenagers can be heard asking the officer to let Jordan go.\u201cI\u2019m not involved in this,\u201d the 15-year-old said as an off-duty officer detained him. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201dThe Police Department said it was investigating.

{"Headline": "For This Soup, Some Assembly Is Required (and Provided)", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byHungry City12 Photos\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a scholar who was studying hard for his imperial exams on a small island of Yunnan.\u201d So begins the legend of crossing-the-bridge noodles, as written on the wall at Western Yunnan Crossing Bridge Noodle in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.The scholar\u2019s wife brought him soup every day, but by the time she crossed the bridge it was cold. He grew wan. Then she started spooning chicken fat over the broth to keep the heat in, and carrying the other ingredients separately so they wouldn\u2019t get soggy.Here the soup comes seething in a stone bowl \u2014 heart-shaped stickers on the tables warn, \u201cPlease beware of burns\u201d \u2014 with springy rice noodles on the side and a tray of ingredients around a box of raw beef. The waitresses take charge, first slipping into the soup the beef with its broad stripes of fat, then a raw quail egg like a golden eye.This is followed, swiftly, by a clingy sauce of ground pork and fermented soybeans; small rubbery umbrellas of wood-ear mushrooms and kernels of corn; dense pressed bean curd, invoking havarti cheese, and limp bean-curd skin like shredded bandages; suancai (pickled mustard greens) and garlic chives; panels of canned ham disconcertingly akin to Spam; and a chicken wing steamed over soy-tinged water.Last in are the noodles. Instructions on the wall advise waiting 10 seconds before you eat. (If you do not speak Mandarin or Fuzhou dialect, the waitresses work in silence.)The bowl is wide and deep, and the soup seems to go on forever. (Each is less than $10.) The broths let the flavors of the different add-ins come through, with lovely sunny notes from the bright, sweet corn and, in one precious spoonful, the voluptuous quail egg yolk. In lieu of beef, you may substitute a pork chop, steamed like the chicken wing and arriving slightly damp, or loops of pig intestine, teeth-resistant and netherworldly. But the strips of beef take best to the broth, thin enough to cook quickly without seizing up.Of the five broths on offer, ignore the one infiltrated by kimchi, which has heat but little tang, and another with a tomato base that can\u2019t help but invoke, for a Western diner, an attenuated version of Campbell\u2019s tomato soup. Greatness lies elsewhere, in the so-called Original, which is cloudy with fat, from stock made with a whole chicken, and tastes clean and rich at once. This is even better in a version rouged by chile oil and hiding traces of Sichuan peppercorn, their presence betrayed by a gradual blurring of the lips. Best is one suffused by sour pickled millet pepper, indigenous to Yunnan Province, in southwestern China.There is not much need for side dishes: cucumbers tossed with seemingly more sugar than vinegar; Hmong-style beef, jerkylike in texture, fried with tsaoko (a type of wild black cardamom) and cinnamon and jarringly sweet. Better to focus on the soup and finish the meal with pumpkin cakes, which harbor little hearts of red bean paste.The dining room is half-sunk under the sidewalk, the entrance noted by jagged wooden signs. A portrait of an Akha woman from the hills of Yunnan, her headdress fringed with silver coins, hangs by the door. In a departure from the neighborhood\u2019s typically efficient, underdecorated Chinese restaurants, the inside is papered in black murals with bright drawings \u2014 of the pondering scholar and his persevering wife, of stray leaves and spice \u2014 and lit by tasseled lanterns. Diners huddle at dark wood tables with chicly skeletal chairs.The owners, Tara Chen and her younger brother, Yong Ting Chen, the chef, are natives not of Yunnan but of Fujian Province, on China\u2019s southeast coast, like many of the neighborhood\u2019s recent immigrants. The restaurant, it turns out, is a franchise of a chain in China. Mr. Chen, the chef, studied hard to learn the recipes.As for the scholar on the island: He regained his strength, fortified by his wife\u2019s soups. And passed the tests.A earlier version of this article misstated the previous name of Yun Nan Flavour Garden. It was Yun Nan Flavour Snack, not Yun Nan Flavour Shack.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loving, 50 Years Later", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "This week marks the 50th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, the landmark Supreme Court decision that invalidated state laws restricting interracial marriage. Recently, we asked readers to share their experiences about being in a mixed-race relationship. We received more than 2,000 stories in just a few days.Married: Medina, Ohio, July 18, 1992\u2018Luckily we were young, bullheaded and foolish.\u2019After we got engaged (which was mainly because I was pregnant) my then-boyfriend was asked by one of his family members: \u201cDo you really love her or are you just trying to tick your parents off?\u201dWe learned quickly that we couldn\u2019t answer all of the questions that our families had. Luckily we were young, bullheaded and foolish, so we decided not to let other people\u2019s issues with our marriage become our own. We had to focus on us. This meant that my husband had to sacrifice some of his relationships for a short season in order to marry me. Thankfully, they have since reconciled.We made it a priority to make sure that our kids had friends of all races. Early on in our lives, we hung out with another biracial couple that looked like us, so that our kids saw black moms and white dads as normal.As a couple, we learned to be upfront with each other about race. It didn\u2019t start that way. Attraction led to confusion. Our life experience and cultural filters created a need for us to learn each other\u2019s ways. Like, letting him, when he was my boyfriend, into my dorm room while I was relaxing my hair. I had to let him see me being fully me. Another time when my father-in-law and I went to a country music concert with his favorite artist \u2014 that was culture shock! But, it was the music of my husband\u2019s experience and it helped me learn more about the people in my family.It\u2019s taken a long time to learn this, but we believe that our relationship is more important than one of us being right. We don\u2019t want race to ever become a wall that divides us.Married: Washington, D.C., May 30, 2016\u2018We learned that sometimes things just take time.\u2019For two seemingly different individuals, we share a love for food, family and passion for social and environmental causes. As much as our relationship seemed normal to both of us, we learned that it wasn\u2019t for my parents and relatives. It took a year of argument, tears, anxiety, smiles and patience for my parents to finally accept our relationship. We waited for their blessing before we had our wedding. Unfortunately, my aunt, whom my family is very close to, decided to stop talking to me because she feels ashamed of me. We learned that sometimes things just take time for acceptance.Married: Las Vegas, July 19, 1969My parents fell in love at a time when many in the Black Power movement that my father helped lead for a time came to oppose interracial marriage. My parents wed in Las Vegas to avoid attention, but soon found themselves back East defending their hearts to both blacks and whites, telling family, friends, and colleagues, \u201cLove is colorblind,\u201d and \u201cThe heart knows no color.\u201d My mother recalls, \u201cVery few white people understood why I would do such a thing. And so I lost a lot of friends and family that way. If they had researched Nathan, they would have found out that he was far more educated than they were, generally.\u201d In his unpublished memoir, my father reflected on those days, \u201cThe black\u2019s continuation through in-group marriage would seem to be inadvisable and errant in relationship to God\u2019s purpose.\u201dIn 1972, my mother completed a Master\u2019s degree in Afro-American studies. I was born in August, 1974. Looking back, my mother tells me, \u201cIn the \u201970s and \u201980s in upstate New York, we knew we had to keep you in a private school to protect you from a wider society that was not always welcoming.\u201d Indeed, I faced overt, aggressive comments from other black kids like, \u201cYou\u2019re not really black,\u201d and \u201cYou think you\u2019re better than us.\u201dThe same month that my parents met, my father testified on Capitol Hill, stating that Black Power \u201cspeaks to the empowerment of human life for fulfillment.\u201d While Carolyn and Nathan hoped their marriage would provide them with that same empowerment, in reality they were ahead of their time, pioneers for radical integration, at a time when most were still digesting moderate civil rights.Married: A small wedding in Cambridge, Mass.; an epic wedding in Sri Lanka; and another, large wedding in Cambridge, 1988 and 1989.\u2018Race is only one element of difference.\u2019When you\u2019re a couple, having different backgrounds simultaneously enriches and stresses your relationship. Race is only one element of difference, and, in my experience, a minor one. I\u2019m only reminded that we are a \u201cmixed couple\u201d by others, when our appearance triggers some kind of reaction, most often \u2014 but not always \u2014 love, approval and sometimes what seems like a tiny bit of envy.We now live in California, where mixed-race kids are relatively common. Our daughter has had to face the challenges of being biracial. She is accustomed to the consternation she causes when others can\u2019t quite figure out \u201cwhat she is.\u201d She is often mistaken for a Latina, and has a traditional Sri Lankan first name that is often mistaken for African-American. But she has risen to meet those challenges, and is a strong, confident person who knows that above all she is unique.Married: Tybee Island, Ga. May 18, 2001\u2018I\u2019ve learned that most people are tolerant, but that is different from being accepting.\u2019I have learned that not only is \u201cdriving while black\u201d a real thing, but also that riding with a black male will get you pulled over. I\u2019ve learned to ignore disapproving looks from older white people in public places. I\u2019ve learned to expect the surprise on people\u2019s faces when I start a new job and put up photos of my family on my desk. I\u2019ve learned that in a small town that is predominately white, people will use my husband as their proof that they aren\u2019t racist because they associate with a black guy. I\u2019ve learned that most people are tolerant, but that is different from being accepting. While we may have come a long way from the days of the Lovings, there is still a long way to go, especially in the South.My husband is a police officer in a large city close to our tiny town. We have frequent heated discussions where I accuse him of being more of a cop than a black man. My older sons were called Oreos in elementary school; they have been racially profiled by police as adults. My teenage son who still lives at home seems to identify much more with the black side of our family and often makes disparaging remarks about things he sees \u201cwhite people\u201d do.I have cautioned all of them to please be careful when in any situation with law enforcement. I tell them to keep their hands where they can be seen, just say yes sir and don\u2019t do or say anything that could cause a misunderstanding. I wouldn\u2019t tell them these things if they were white.Having children (and nieces and nephews) that are black has caused me to view the world differently than I might have if I\u2019d married someone of my own race. I think I am more enlightened, I think I see things from a perspective I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise had.Married: Baltimore, June 21, 2015\u2018For some of them, it was their first interaction with a black person.\u2019My friends tried to dissuade me from dating Shah. With deeply concerned voices, they asked me, \u201cWhat will people say? What could you possibly have in common?\u201d After three months of dating seriously, he invited me to meet his family. His extended family from India happened to be in town for their annual trip to the U.S. Imagine, one little black girl surrounded by 20 of his Indian cousins, uncles, aunts and grandparents. It was intimidating, but I held my own, as they fired away questions (about my education, my parents\u2019 professions, my hair, my being an N.F.L. cheerleader, my siblings).After leaving that night, my future husband called me almost in tears. His aunts had asked things like, \u201cWhy a black woman? You can find a beautiful, smart Indian woman to marry!\u201d Surprisingly, the eldest in the family, his grandfathers, Dada ji and Nana ji, were our strongest advocates.Despite the negative chatter, Shah and I knew our love for one another would sustain us. All has now been forgiven, and the family has a lot of love for me. I learned that they were scared of the unknown; for some of them, it was their first interaction with a black person. Since then they have welcomed me into their homes with open arms. His extended family was present at our fairy-tale wedding, as were my friends. His family in India has made two trips to see us. We drink wine, chat about life, discuss home decor, politics and go shopping. Had Shah or I succumbed to the pressure, we would have missed out on the greatest love of all!Shah and I don\u2019t have children yet, but are planning to. We often have discussions like, \u201cIf we have a boy, will he keep his hair and wear a turban like his daddy? What race will our kids identify as? Should we take the kids to both gurdwara and church, or will that just confuse them? How often will we visit family in India? Should we raise the kids in India for a couple years?\u201d Whatever happens, I\u2019m sure they will be strong like their mom and dad and will be brave enough to handle anything that comes their way.Married: Alexandria, Va., August 3, 2013\u2018We have learned a lot about what it means to be allies.\u2019We have learned a lot about what it means to be allies since we started dating and especially since we have been married. I remember one night, about two months into our relationship, when we were walking home late from a bar in D.C., we walked by some young African-American men sitting on their stoop. They called to me, and I ignored them because I ignore most men who call to me on the street. They called me a \u201cchink,\u201d and I continued to ignore them as we walked on. Then, I felt something hit me \u2014 a small rock. They were throwing them at us, and I wondered why. When I mentioned it to Mike, he said he\u2019d flipped them off.I felt outrage \u2014 not at those boys because let\u2019s face it, they were kids \u2014 I was so angry at Mike. Never, in a million years, would I have felt safe antagonizing those boys by expressing my anger the way that he had. I realized how privileged he was to feel it was O.K. to do that without consequence. I didn\u2019t mention it that night to him until after we were married. And when I did, he understood. He wouldn\u2019t have understood if I had brought it up when it happened. It took eight years of conversation and real intimacy to bring this evolution about \u2014 my trusting him and telling him the story from my point of view, and his vulnerability in hearing it.Married: Greensboro, N.C., June 1963\u2018My husband made a deal with the minister.\u2019I\u2019ve had many incidents of discrimination throughout my life. My mother never trusted a white man until close to her death in 2004, when my husband helped her and he finally gained her trust.Married: Boulder County, Colo., November 24, 2004\u2018I sense disgust and hate from total strangers for the first time in my life.\u2019Since we first started seeing each other, I sense disgust and hate from total strangers for the first time in my life. Many white people have told me that my husband looks fierce. He doesn\u2019t. We are often placed at the restaurant table closest to the kitchen; white ladies grip their purses and move closer to their companions when we pass. The police stop us for no reason. Today, I pay little attention to prejudiced people. Sometimes we even laugh about particularly racist responses to us.My husband, our children and I all feel that the black community is more at ease with us than the white.The racism against Obama was plain to us from the start but not to our white acquaintances. The racism surrounding Trump\u2019s campaign was obvious to me but not to my husband; he could not take the man\u2019s candidacy seriously. My youngest daughter and I rebuked him when he supported Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton at our state caucus, as we perceived her to be the more qualified and only viable choice for minorities. On election night, my husband had taken me to dinner to celebrate Hillary\u2019s \u201cinevitable win.\u201d When Trump won the Electoral College we left our meals half eaten.We have dropped associates that we once tolerated if they are overtly Republican or nonprogressive. We feel paranoid.Married: Northampton, Mass., 2006\u2018This understanding of marriage has deep historical and familial significance for me as a black woman.\u2019We are both a \u201cLoving\u201d and a \u201cGoodridge\u201d family: We have been partners for 29 years but did not marry until 2006, after same-sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts. Our choice to marry was informed by the history of what race and marriage meant to my enslaved ancestors, who struggled to have their antebellum marriages recorded. We have been surprised by the ways that our families are more accepting of us as a same-sex couple than they are about transracial marriage.Choosing to marry after 17 years of extralegal partnership gave us striking clarity that marriage is not about love or commitment, but a political arrangement about ownership of property and the right to defend it. This understanding of marriage has deep historical and familial significance for me as a black woman that my partner had never had to consider.Married: Los Angeles, January 27, 1967\u2018Our friends thought we were pretty brave, but in reality incidents of prejudice were usually subtle.\u2019We married six months before Loving v. Virginia. We were in California, where the law forbidding Caucasians to marry Asians was struck down in the 1940s. We and our friends thought we were pretty brave, but in reality incidents of prejudice were usually subtle and relatively rare. That\u2019s partly because Asian Indians were so rare in the United States in 1967; nobody knew enough Indians to form an opinion.We learned two important things about marrying across cultures: 1) From day one, you\u2019ll have to try harder to understand each other; we could never take each other for granted. That gave us a big advantage. 2) Both of our lives were enriched, and the lives of our families as well.When Basab died 50 years after we met, his memorial service was filled with our family and friends from all sides of the globe.Produced by Umi Syam, Liriel Higa and Sara Barrett.

And she was killed in the most innocent of locations: an ice cream shop where she\u2019d gone to break her Ramadan fast and beat the heat.\u201cShe is too small to go so early,\u201d one of her cousins said. \u201cI still expect her to come and tease me, and play around, and make fun and joke.\u201dI met a lot of little girls like that in Iraq during the worst years of the war. Our bureau was a short walk from the ice cream shop where she was killed, and the neighborhood, Karada, was often targeted because it was a place where Sunni and Shiite Muslims lived side by side, rejecting the sectarianism that never seems to cease.Car bombs like the one that killed Zynab used to be a daily occurrence. It\u2019s what we woke up to with the sunrise. And Iraqis, especially young Iraqis, inevitably found ways to endure. Whenever we left the bureau to report, we\u2019d drive by a gaggle of children playing soccer or climbing the blast walls, finding ways to laugh between explosions.I\u2019ve often wondered what happened to her.Now I also wonder about Zynab.What might her future have been? She was born here in Australia and was on her fourth trip to Iraq, to visit her ailing grandfather. Going back and forth, growing up as the daughter of refugees who fled 20 years ago, what might she have accomplished in Australia or in Iraq?These kinds of questions are not often asked in public debates about terrorism or refugees, at least not when the victims are Muslim.All of which raises an important question: How does a democratic society learn to calibrate its concern, to distinguish the Zynabs of the world from their potential attackers?It\u2019s an enormous challenge, not just for government but for every citizen, and it will play out in the minds and interactions of all of us for years to come. This week, at least, I\u2019m seeking solace in one of the many things I learned in war: Even in the world\u2019s most violent places, there are always more victims than perpetrators; there are more people who want to just live rather than to kill or die.Now for some lighter fare.Here are a few of my favorite Times stories from the past week, plus a recommendation from one of our talented new young hires, Isabella Kwai.________________________It\u2019s an investigation into how the police handled the case of Jacob Wetterling, an 11-year-old who was abducted from a town in Minnesota in 1989.

{"Headline": "Delete Hate Speech or Pay Up, Germany Tells Social Media Companies", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Social media companies operating in Germany face fines of as much as $57 million if they do not delete illegal, racist or slanderous comments and posts within 24 hours under a law passed on Friday.The law reinforces Germany\u2019s position as one of the most aggressive countries in the Western world at forcing companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter to crack down on hate speech and other extremist messaging on their digital platforms.Technology companies and free speech advocates argue that there is a fine line between policy makers\u2019 views on hate speech and what is considered legitimate freedom of expression, and social networks say they do not want to be forced to censor those who use their services. Silicon Valley companies also deny that they are failing to meet countries\u2019 demands to remove suspected hate speech online.\u201cWith this law, we put an end to the verbal law of the jungle on the internet and protect the freedom of expression for all,\u201d Mr. Maas said. \u201cWe are ensuring that everyone can express their opinion freely, without being insulted or threatened.\u201d\u201cThat is not a limitation, but a prerequisite for freedom of expression,\u201d he continued.The law will take effect in October, less than a month after nationwide elections, and will apply to social media sites with more than two million users in Germany.It will require companies including Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, to remove any content that is illegal in Germany \u2014 such as Nazi symbols or Holocaust denial \u2014 within 24 hours of it being brought to their attention.The law allows for up to seven days for the companies to decide on content that has been flagged as offensive, but that may not be clearly defamatory or inciting violence. Companies that persistently fail to address complaints by taking too long to delete illegal content face fines that start at 5 million euros, or $5.7 million, and could rise to as much as \u20ac50 million.Every six months, companies will have to publicly report the number of complaints they have received and how they have handled them.In Germany, which has some of the most stringent anti-hate speech laws in the Western world, a study published this year found that Facebook and Twitter had failed to meet a national target of removing 70 percent of online hate speech within 24 hours of being alerted to its presence.The report noted that while the two companies eventually erased almost all of the illegal hate speech, Facebook managed to remove only 39 percent within 24 hours, as demanded by the German authorities. Twitter met that deadline in 1 percent of instances. YouTube fared significantly better, removing 90 percent of flagged content within a day of being notified.Facebook said on Friday that the company shared the German government\u2019s goal of fighting hate speech and had \u201cbeen working hard\u201d to resolve the issue of illegal content. The company announced in May that it would nearly double, to 7,500, the number of employees worldwide devoted to clearing its site of flagged postings. It was also trying to improve the processes by which users could report problems, a spokesman said.Twitter declined to comment, while Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The standoff between tech companies and politicians is most acute in Europe, where freedom of expression rights are less comprehensive than in the United States, and where policy makers have often bristled at Silicon Valley\u2019s dominance of people\u2019s digital lives.But advocacy groups in Europe have raised concerns over the new German law.\u201cSetting the rules of the digital public square, including the identification of what is lawful and what is not, should not be left to private companies,\u201d they wrote.Even in the United States, Facebook and Google also have taken steps to limit the spread of extremist messaging online, and to prevent \u201cfake news\u201d from circulating. That includes using artificial intelligence to remove potentially extremist material automatically and banning news sites believed to spread fake or misleading reports from making money through the companies\u2019 digital advertising platforms.An article on Saturday about Germany\u2019s new law to crack down on hate speech in social media misstated the surname of a member of the Global Public Policy Institute who criticized the legislation.

{"Headline": "In \u2018The Changeling,\u2019 the Dark Fears of Parents, Memorably Etched", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesOne of the reasons to read Victor LaValle\u2019s novels is the simple sentence-by-sentence pleasure of them \u2014 they offer hundreds of baby dopamine hits, tiny baths for the prose snob\u2019s reward system. His imagination is unusually visual. His sensibility is so deadpan that it borders on a kind of derangement. And he has a real flair for the strategically placed f-bomb, which, in my view, is an underrated skill. They detonate when you least expect them, in sentences as otherwise lovely as a tulip.It\u2019s hard to convey that last talent in a family publication. But not the others. There\u2019s an image in LaValle\u2019s new novel, \u201cThe Changeling,\u201d that\u2019s so impressively gruesome that it\u2019s taken up residence in my dreams: Apollo, the protagonist, suddenly wakes up in his kitchen to find that he\u2019s been yoked by a bike lock to a hot water pipe.The teakettle on Apollo\u2019s stove is rattling and wailing. His 6-month-old boy is shrieking in the room next door, contributing to the whistling din. Apollo tries to get up. It\u2019s a natural reflex with unfortunate consequences.\u201cWhen he pulled forward and gasped, the lock resisted, and he slumped backward,\u201d LaValle writes. \u201cAs soon as he did, the back of his exposed neck touched the steam pipe like a pork cutlet pressed against a hot skillet.\u201dA pan-seared neck is the least of his problems. Apollo\u2019s wife then clubs him in the face with a claw hammer. After cracking his cheekbone, she wanders into the baby\u2019s room, serenely balancing the teakettle in the palm of her hand.The point is that readers are always struggling to communicate the odd hybridity of LaValle\u2019s work, which blends social criticism with horror with the supernatural, while remaining steadfastly literary. And it\u2019s true: His novels are tough to classify.The difficulty with hybrids, though, is that they\u2019re often more awkward than elegant. You see the exact ridge in the sinew where man becomes beast.\u201cHere\u2019s to the Daddy of our dreams,\u201d she wrote.The message is plump with meaning. Apollo\u2019s father abandoned his family when Apollo was just 4. He\u2019s been having the same recurring nightmare about the vanished man ever since.None of these fantastical elements are a problem per se. All LaValle novels come to that sharp bend in the river where things start rippling toward the weird. The problem, in \u201cThe Changeling,\u201d is that LaValle sometimes skywrites his main themes so that no one will miss them \u2014 he explains his own allegory, essentially, in real time. At one point, a character laments that fairy tales lost their spooky appeal once people began assigning morals to them. Yet that\u2019s often what\u2019s going on here.\u201cWhen you have to save the one you love, you will become someone else, something else,\u201d that same character later tells Apollo. \u201cYou will transform. The only real magic is the things we\u2019ll do for the ones we love.\u201dThese lines feel unworthy of the author. They made me disconnect from the story entirely. It was as if the line had gone dead.But I did find my way back. The questions LaValle asks are hairy and urgent: How do we protect our children? Especially in the digital age? For it turns out that Apollo has been taking many, many pictures of his beautiful son \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t he? \u2014 and uploading them to Facebook, as all modern parents do.They\u2019re the modern equivalent of Chekhov\u2019s gun. They might sit harmlessly onscreen in Act I. But they\u2019ll be fully weaponized by Act III. \u201cPosting online is like leaving your front door open and telling any creature of the night it can enter,\u201d one of the story\u2019s villains tells him.How I wish \u201cThe Changeling\u201d had been more artful in exploring these questions and ideas. I also could have done without the strained allusions to Donald J. Trump, Fox News and the far right, which seem to have blown in from some neighboring land until they finally reveal their connection.But Lavalle\u2019s observations about race remain, as ever, both stinging and mordantly funny. (\u201cThat was fast,\u201d Apollo, who is black, says when he\u2019s stopped by a cop in a white section of Queens.) And his imagery is a source of immense satisfaction. Stepping into a brown shag-carpeted room \u201cwas like being inside a Wookiee\u2019s armpit\u201d; when Apollo zonks on the laundry room couch, he \u201cnuzzled into it like a tick\u201d; a monster is \u201cas tall as the sail of a sloop.\u201dIf monsters are your subject, writing like an angel helps.Advertisement"}

Do you think those rules and penalties are fair and effective? Why or why not?College students have flooded into computer science courses across the country, recognizing them as an entree to coveted jobs at companies like Facebook and Google, not to mention the big prize: a start-up worth millions.The exploding interest in these courses, though, has coincided with an undesirable side effect: a spate of high-tech collegiate plagiarism. Students have been caught borrowing computer code from their friends or cribbing it from the internet.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about it, both inside a department as well as across the field,\u201d said Randy H. Katz, a professor in the electrical engineering and computer science department at the University of California, Berkeley, who discovered in one year that about 100 of his roughly 700 students in one class had violated the course policy on collaborating or copying code.Computer science professors are now delivering stern warnings at the start of each course, and, like colleagues in other subjects, deploy software to flag plagiarism. They have unearthed numerous examples of suspected cheating.At Brown University, more than half the 49 allegations of academic code violations last year involved cheating in computer science.At Stanford, the alma mater of the founders of Google, Snapchat and countless other internet wonders, as many as 20 percent of the students in one 2015 computer science course were flagged for possible cheating.In interviews, professors and students said the causes were not hard to pin down.\u201cYou\u2019ve got kids who were struggling with spending a third of their time on their problem sets with the option to copy from the internet,\u201d said Jackson Wagner, who took the Harvard course in 2015 and was not accused of copying. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why people cheat.\u201dComplicating matters is the collaborative ethos among programmers, which encourages code-sharing in ways that might not be acceptable in a class. Professors also frequently allow students to discuss problems among themselves, but not to share actual code, a policy that some students say creates confusion about what constitutes cheating.\u2014 Do you think academic dishonesty should be handled differently in computer programming classes than in other subjects? If so, how? If not, why not?\u2014 Is the Harvard professor David J.

I wondered.And then I wondered, How did we get here?It is a question others are asking, and for many liberal Indians, last weekend was when the vessel spilled over.\u201cHe has forgotten the fundamentals of the Constitution that he was supposed to uphold, which is the right to life,\u201d Mr. Pande said. \u201cThe fact that he did not come out openly and condemn the Dadri murder, that is when I decided this man does not deserve to be here.\u201dThe message seemed to have penetrated the highest levels of government, because on Thursday, in an address at the ashram where Gandhi established his nonviolence movement, Mr. Modi issued a rare condemnation of the vigilante killings. He said that cows must be protected, but within limits.\u201cDo we get the right to kill a human being?\u201d he said. \u201cIs this devotion to the cow? Is this cow protection? This cannot be the path of respected Bapuji,\u201d he said, referring to Gandhi.\u201cToday, when I hear that in the name of the cow someone has been killed, I say the law should take its course; human beings have no right to take the law into their hands,\u201d he said.Unlike Hindu-Muslim riots, which have become less frequent in recent decades, lynchings are not counted systematically in India, nor are the death tolls dramatic enough to register to most Indians as a national crisis.\u201cThey are pretty indifferent,\u201d said Shivani Kasumra, 20, a university student, of her own middle-class relatives. \u201cThey say this is retribution, that they are terrorists, and that they will convert Hindus to Islam. This is a common Hindu sentiment. Somehow they feel wronged.\u201dIn Delhi, the activists gathered on a street set aside for public protest, and they listened as Mohammad Asaruddin, a relative of the 15-year-old killed last week, read a letter in Hindi, which he said contained a last message to the victim\u2019s mother.\u201cDear Ma, I am home,\u201d it said. \u201cYou wanted me to buy new clothes from Delhi, but fate has landed me in heaven, where you don\u2019t have marauding mobs. I am home. Yours, Junaid.\u201dMany reporters had not visited the street for several years, since the vast anticorruption movement that helped sweep the Indian National Congress party out of power. Among the protesters were a number of figures shut out from the new right-wing order, including Swami Agnivesh, a Hindu holy man staunchly associated with Congress party causes; a transgender woman who introduced herself as Vqueeram; and Tehseen Poonawalla, a political trend-watcher and the debonair son of an industrialist. Two hours later, they filed out into the humid darkness, murmuring hopefully to one another about the movement they hoped would grow out of the event.\u201cIt does no damage whatsoever to Modi and his party, because what this protest says is, \u2018Muslims are getting lynched,\u2019 and a lot of Hindutvas out there will say, \u2018That\u2019s the point,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Vij said, referring to far-right Hindus. \u201cSociety at large is turning right-wing.

As has been the case for years now, these technology giants sit on trillions of dollars in cash, are growing at a breakneck pace and, compared with companies in earlier tech frenzies, do not have absurd valuations.Yet it has been this lack of an identifiable cause \u2014 a disappointing earnings result or a major investor\u2019s unloading stock, for example \u2014 that has been worrying some market specialists.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dOn Monday, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was also slightly lower, off 0.1 percent.Netflix helped lead the way, declining 4.2 percent. Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.In the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.The declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.To the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500\u2019s return of more than 8 percent this year.The bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.UBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.While traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors \u2014 given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market \u2014 will stick with them.According to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today\u2019s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.Hedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer \u201cFaamg,\u201d substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)Compared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins \u2014 exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges \u2014 that is a very small figure.To a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.In the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.Credit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.In the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change.Advertisement"}

Prosecutors, who opposed a commutation of the sentence, said later Thursday that they would not appeal the decision.Mr. Olmert described his fall as \u201cpainful and strange\u201d at the time, and the weeks leading up to the decision for his release have been no less tumultuous.The police have been looking into the possibility that Mr. Olmert mishandled classified information when he gave part of a manuscript that he had written behind bars to one of his lawyers to take out of the prison.Mr. Olmert\u2019s lawyers argued that the manuscript would be subject to military censorship before publication and that there had been no security breach.Mr. Olmert \u2014 who as prime minister led a monthlong war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006 and held extensive peace negotiations with the Palestinians and indirect talks with Syria \u2014 complained during a recent parole board hearing that the authorities were turning him into a \u201ctraitor,\u201d according to Israeli news reports.Israel has remained silent about a 2007 airstrike that was widely attributed to it and that took place during Mr. Olmert\u2019s tenure, destroying a nuclear reactor that was under construction in Syria.Amid the tumult, Mr. Olmert suffered chest pain and was hospitalized for a week. He was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday.Mr. Olmert\u2019s legal troubles began in 2008, two years after he became prime minister, and he was forced to resign from office under the growing weight of police investigations. A lawyer by profession, he entered public life in his 20s. He was convicted of taking bribes as mayor of Jerusalem \u2014 a role he filled from 1993 to 2003 \u2014 in part to facilitate the construction of a large housing complex known as Holyland, despite fierce local opposition.Mr. Olmert is not expected to make a formal political comeback anytime soon; the law bars him from holding office for seven years.There was little sign of a public outcry as news of the parole board\u2019s decision filtered through Israeli society; many observers seemed ready to move on.Some political rivals have come out in support of Mr. Olmert in recent weeks. Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, wrote in a Facebook post on June 23: \u201cIt is time to release Ehud Olmert. Despite our differences of opinion, there is no argument over Prime Minister Olmert\u2019s decisive contribution to the security of Israel.\u201d He added, \u201cThe time has come for a degree of mercy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kind of rare,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. City Hall\u2019s many elevated spaces make for irresistible jungle gyms, one of which was used by the child in the background. The complementary patterns of the women\u2019s head scarves and the marbled side of the building caught Mr. Arnold\u2019s eye, as did the humor in this moment. \u201cAny time I see two people sharing one slot in a revolving door, I have to take a picture,\u201d he said.Although most of the couples choose to be less formal, this one was not. \u201cThese guys were taking this very seriously, and it was kind of a refreshing change of pace,\u201d Mr. Arnold said.\u201cThese little trash tornadoes\u201d are a common sight in New York, Mr. Arnold said, but at City Hall the trash is \u201cbeautifully selected rose petals, confetti and sparkles instead of newspapers and plastic bags. You get this wind tunnel of shiny flowery things.\u201dThe back of this woman\u2019s jacket said \u201cTill Death Do Us Party.\u201d Mr. Arnold described this man and woman as one of the hipper, more fashionable couples he saw during his month. \u201cThere was something really nice about the detail of her pierced septum and her cigarette and her high-cut dress and leather jacket,\u201d he said.This photo tells a full story to the photographer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a newly married couple looking a little bit disenchanted and a little bit stressed,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cBehind them is the courthouse, and on the other side is a truck full of caskets. We\u2019ve got love, taxes and death, all in one frame.\u201d \u201cIn the absence of a great planned church wedding, you kind of compensate with the little choices, and oftentimes that means a color theme,\u201d Mr. Arnold said of this family in red.Mr. Arnold was drawn to the gold color of this woman\u2019s traditional head wrap, and how it was reflected in the marbled side of the building. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this great backdrop for this sparkling silver bride,\u201d he said.Back at Mr. Taxi\u2019s flower stand, Mr. Arnold was struck by a child that was dressed up in a tiered white dress and tiara. \u201cAs glamorous as the bride and the bridesmaid are, this little girl is kind of outdoing both of them,\u201d he said. When the woman walked into the courthouse, the photographer said, \u201cGood luck.\u201d \u201cThanks, I\u2019m going to need it,\u201d she said.This pretzel and hot dog vendor encounters hundreds of newlyweds who trade a big fancy white cake for a pretzel and soda. \u201cYou get this great New York-ification of the wedding process,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cMustard isn\u2019t usually incorporated into your usual idea of a wedding, but it figures very heavily in the City Clerk\u2019s Office wedding.\u201dMr. Arnold wasn\u2019t sure if these two got married, but they did take advantage of the rose stand. \u201cI thought this was kind of a nice, sweet, quiet moment that transcended the whole City Clerk scene,\u201d he said.Seconds before this photo was taken, this young ring bearer\u2019s uncles were playing with his Frisbee, not giving it to him. But what initially caught Mr. Arnold\u2019s eye was the bride on the right, who was wearing a sheer dress over biker shorts.Everyone can calm down, this is the ring finger. \u201cI try not to do too many photos of people posing for pictures, but this pose is just irresistible,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cAnd, look, you even get to see their rings!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Problem With Participatory Democracy Is the Participants", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byOpinionAt backyard barbecues this holiday weekend, liberals will gab with one another about how much time they\u2019re spending on politics. More than ever, they are watching cable news, and refreshing Twitter and Facebook feeds.Political hobbyists want easy ways to register their feelings. Democrats in particular embrace tools like Resistbot that offer instantly gratifying participation. Beyond the current political climate, Democrats, more than Republicans, believe in mass participation as a core value and also believe it empowers their side.But cheap participation reflects a troubling infirmity in how partisans of both parties engage in politics. In fact, it is not because of gerrymandering, Citizens United, cable news or any of the other common scapegoats that our system is broken, but because of us: ordinary people who are doing politics the wrong way.For years, political scientists have studied how people vote, petition, donate, protest, align with parties and take in the news, and have asked what motivates these actions. The typical answers are civic duty and self-interest.But civic duty and self-interest do not capture the ways that middle- and upper-class Americans are engaging in politics. Now it is the Facebooker who argues with friends of friends he does not know; the news consumer who spends hours watching cable; the repeat online petitioner who demands actions like impeaching the president; the news sharer willing to spread misinformation and rumor because it feels good; the data junkie who frantically toggles between horse races in suburban Georgia and horse races in Britain and France and horse races in sports (even literal horse races).What is really motivating this behavior is hobbyism \u2014 the regular use of free time to engage in politics as a leisure activity. Political hobbyism is everywhere.Then there are the well-intentioned policy innovations over the years that were meant to make politics more open but in doing so exposed politics to hobbyists: participatory primaries, ballot initiatives, open-data policies, even campaign contribution limits. The contribution rules that are now in place favor the independent vanity projects of wealthy egomaniacs instead of allowing parties to raise money and build durable local support.The result of this is political engagement that takes the form of partisan fandom, the seeking of cheap thrills, and amateurs trying their hand at a game \u2014 the billionaire funding \u201csuper PACs\u201d all the way down to the everyday armchair quarterback who professes that the path to political victory is through ideological purity. (In the face of a diverse and moderate country, the demand for ideological purity itself can be a symptom of hobbyism: If politics is a sport and the stakes are no higher, why not demand ideological purity if it feels good?)Not all activism is political hobbyism. A Black Lives Matter protest meant to call attention to police misconduct and demand change on an issue with life-or-death consequences is not hobbyism. Neither is a spontaneous airport protest over the president\u2019s travel ban, which also had clear goals and urgent demands.What about attendance at town hall meetings hosted by members of Congress? These events could be places for serious discourse and reveal crucial citizen perspectives on matters of public policy, but they are more often hijacked by fair-weather activists looking to see action. It is certainly peculiar that Democrats who are motivated by the health care debate now couldn\u2019t be bothered to show up at town hall meetings back in 2009 (or to vote in 2010), and the Tea Party activists of 2009 can\u2019t be bothered now, since it wouldn\u2019t be any fun for them.The Democratic Party, the party that embraces \u201cengagement,\u201d is in atrophy in state legislatures across the country. Perhaps this is because state-level political participation needs to be motivated by civic duty; it is not entertaining enough to pique the interest of hobbyists. The party of Hollywood celebrities also struggles to energize its supporters to vote. Maybe it is because when politics is something one does for fun rather than out of a profound moral obligation, the citizen who does not find it fun has no reason to engage. The important parts of politics for the average citizen simply may not be enjoyable.Political hobbyism is a problem not just for Democrats. The hobbyist in the Oval Office is evidence enough of the Republican version. Donald Trump\u2019s election was possible because both political parties mistakenly decided several decades ago to have binding primary elections determine presidential nominations. Rather than having party leaders vet candidates for competency and sanity, as most democracies do, our parties turned the nomination process into a reality show in which the closest things to vetting are a clap-o-meter and a tracking poll.Nevertheless, the problem of hobbyism holds more severe consequences for Democrats than for Republicans because of their commitment to mass engagement as a core value. An unqualified embrace of engagement, without leaders channeling activists toward clear goals, yields the spinning of wheels of hobbyism.Democrats should know that an unending string of activities intended for instant gratification does not amount to much in political power. What they should ask is whether their emotions and energy are contributing to a behind-the-scenes effort to build local support across the country or whether they are merely a hollow, self-gratifying manifestation of the new political hobbyism.Advertisement"}

And the ride-hailing company has plenty of cash on hand: $7.2 billion, about the same amount it held at the end of 2016.But Uber also announced that its head of finance, Gautam Gupta, was leaving to join a start-up \u2014 the latest in a string of executive departures.Two lawsuits against the pharmaceutical industry are highlighting the problem of widespread opioid abuse in the United States.Ohio\u2019s attorney general, Mike DeWine, said in the lawsuit that drug makers have promoted opioids as treatment for chronic pain, even though these drugs were once used primarily for acute, or short-term pain.Evzio was seen by addiction experts as an easier way to stop fatal overdoses. But the company quintupled the price of Evzio in the middle of a national opioid abuse epidemic, prompting letters from lawmakers who demanded to know why the price had shot up.Express Scripts says it is owed more than $14.5 million in fees and rebates related to Evzio, and it has dropped the drug from its preferred list.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nancy Pelosi, Washington\u2019s Latest Wicked Witch", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byDispatchThe wicked witch is back. This time, her name is Nancy Pelosi.Ms. Pelosi is just the latest in a long line of female politicians \u2014 on the left and the right \u2014 who have proved rich and resonant targets. Hillary Clinton. Sarah Palin. Michele Bachmann, the former House member from Minnesota. Then Hillary Clinton once more.In each case, gender wasn\u2019t the only issue. There were plenty of self-inflicted wounds, as well as genuine ideological opposition. Yet each woman was attacked in ways that play off sometimes subliminal, often indignantly denied, biases about women shared by men and women alike.Overtly ambitious women stir unease and register as less likable, said Adrienne Kimmell, executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which has been studying women\u2019s political races for 20 years. Voters have more trouble relating to a powerful woman than a powerful man. Women who are seen as political insiders \u2014 or as dishonest, which many voters lump together \u2014 suffer more than do men. Witness the 2016 election.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t even aware that it\u2019s discomfort with women who have too much power,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a veteran strategist and president of Bellwether Research who has advised many Republican campaigns. \u201cRepublican women disliked Hillary Clinton even more than Republican men. They couldn\u2019t stand her. They couldn\u2019t relate to her.\u201d As Ms. Kimmell put it: \u201cAmbition is a four-letter word for women.\u201dThat discomfort is reflected in visual portrayals of female politicians, who are often depicted as unstable and physically repulsive. Unless, as in Ms. Palin\u2019s case, they\u2019re mocked as too attractive to take seriously.Another frequent trope is labeling women as crazy, which Ms. Matthews said was thrown at Mrs. Bachmann, along with Ms. Pelosi and Mrs. Clinton \u2014 who, for good measure, was mocked for her laugh, often likened to a cackle.Ms. Pelosi and Mrs. Clinton have also come under fire from their own party, with pointed references to their ages and the need to step aside to make way for a younger generation. \u201cTo me, what keeps coming back is women aren\u2019t allowed to age,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cWe don\u2019t drum out older men and tell them they can\u2019t be in the positions that they\u2019re in.\u201d She said she did not recall comparable pressure being brought to bear on Tip O\u2019Neill, who served five consecutive terms as speaker of the House and retired at 75. Ms. Pelosi is 77.But it\u2019s hard to escape the way Ms. Pelosi, like Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin before her, became lightning rods for derision and contempt, expressed in ways that compound lingering stereotypes, whether or not we want to acknowledge them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Around the World in an Evening at the Queens Night Market", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byHungry City17 Photos\u201cThis is what you eat in La Paz at 4 a.m.,\u201d said the man half-devoured by smoke as he stood at the grill, stroking oil over beef hearts with a brush of banana husks.In one hand, I clutched a newspaper printed in Bengali, whirled into a thonga, or cone, and brimming over with jhal muri: a loose bouquet of cilantro, puffed rice, crunchy filaments of fried chickpea flour and hoops of green chile like castoff earrings. Mustard oil trickled through. The heat clarified the soul.In the other hand was a cup of chicha morada, a Peruvian drink of purple corn brewed with pineapple peels, cinnamon and cloves, and darker than any wine, so purple it was nearly black. The sweetness was a jolt, and then it was gone.A giant inflatable lucky cat, the talisman of storefronts all over Asia, waved its paw by the fence. Burnished ducks hung inside a stall, as if in a restaurant window in Chinatown. A crowd had gathered around a woman dripping molten sugar from a spoon onto a marble slab, letting it crystallize into the shapes of butterflies, bearded goats and koi with pursed lips, which children then toted around on sticks like lollipops.There are other, more celebrated open-air food bazaars in town. But, for me, none is more surprising, thrilling and inspiring than the Queens Night Market. It runs Saturday nights from April to October (with brief breaks during the United States Open and Maker Faire), but in summer it has the most shimmer.Advice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.The market, which began in 2015, is a testament to both the cultural riches of Queens and the vision of its founder, John Wang, a former lawyer born in Texas to parents of Taiwanese descent. His goal is to showcase vendors \u201cfrom every country represented\u201d in New York City; the vendor application asks how each menu relates to the seller\u2019s heritage. Because the majority of vendors are first-time entrepreneurs, he offers free small-business seminars and recruits corporate sponsors to help lower their fees.Crucially for marketgoers, he has imposed a $5 price cap per dish (with a $6 exception for a few vendors whose margins are \u201crazor thin\u201d). This encourages smaller portion size and grazing, so I was able to try a dozen booths on each visit. I still mourned all that I had missed.Some pleasures I may never know again, like slippery sweet-potato noodles glossed with black vinegar and chile oil and betraying a throb of Sichuan peppercorn, from a stall whose sign sadly proclaimed, \u201cThis is our last week.\u201d (Please return next summer.)At the end of each night, I found myself surrounded by people nibbling helixes of skewered potato slices; gawking as strips of dough were wrapped in spirals around fat metal cylinders to make kurtoskalacs, Transylvanian cakes traditionally roasted over a spit; and extolling the glories of moffles, waffles made with mochiko (glutinous rice flour). But by then I could eat no more.The market\u2019s layout is thoughtful, with room to roam, an A.T.M. in a cloaked booth, picnic tables and portable sinks. Mr. Wang arrives at the park at 7 each Saturday morning to set up, and sometimes doesn\u2019t leave until 24 hours later. His staff members are almost entirely volunteers. They deserve applause.Beyond the fence is a beer and wine garden and a lawn where people roll around in knockerballs \u2014 plastic spheres that you can fit your body inside. More than a half-century ago, the park hosted the 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair, whose theme was \u201cPeace Through Understanding.\u201d The public swooned over rocket men in jet packs and dioramas of lunar colonies.But what has perhaps lasted longest in our national memory is the Disney attraction first unveiled at the fair, a cruise by slow boat through caves thronged by dolls of almost every nation, chorusing as one. You know the song: \u201cIt\u2019s a small world after all.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated an ingredient in the Persian love cake at Sweet Zahra. It is cardamom, not saffron.

{"Headline": "How the Dark Web\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts Went Down", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.When Ross Ulbricht created the Silk Road, a clandestine online drug bazaar hidden on the deep web, he was a 26-year-old libertarian idealist living in Austin, Tex., talking his girlfriend\u2019s ear off about Austrian economics and seasteading experiments \u2014 the idea of creating communities in the middle of the sea, free from government regulations. For all his lofty ambitions, he felt like a failure. He had flunked his Ph.D. exam and was unable to find a buyer for his seasteading gaming simulation. But with the Silk Road he was able to marry his business ambitions and anti-authoritarian philosophy; he envisioned it as a powerful way to defy what he perceived to be the state\u2019s irrational drug policies. Using an anonymizing browser like Tor and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, people could discreetly buy and sell drugs. Ulbricht taught himself to code and he began by selling mushrooms that he grew himself.By the time Ulbricht was arrested two years later, the Silk Road was an estimated $1.2 billion business that expanded into heroin, guns, hacking tools, counterfeit cash and cyanide. Ulbricht, a former Boy Scout, had tried to commission five murders as the Dread Pirate Roberts, the pseudonym under which he ruled the site. The obsessive, dizzying manhunt to apprehend him involved a slew of government agencies and ended with a neck-breaking plot twist: double agents and hundreds of thousands of dollars in missing Bitcoin.Ulbricht is currently appealing a life sentence for seven convictions, including narcotics, money laundering and the kingpin statute, more typically applied to Mafia bosses or cartel leaders. Evidence unearthed by federal agents included his journal, along with nearly two million words of chat logs between Dread Pirate Roberts and his underlings detailing the operations of the site.The cast of characters has been established over the years since Ulbricht\u2019s arrest, but Bilton\u2019s impressive reporting gives more space to a story that could use some sprawl. For instance, close observers may remember Gary Alford, the criminal investigator with the I.R.S., who was the first agent to come across Ulbricht\u2019s name in conjunction with the Silk Road. Previous accounts gave us the logistics, but Bilton\u2019s book gives us psychological shading and insight into Alford\u2019s method. Alford was born in Brooklyn in 1977, the summer the Son of Sam terrorized New York. It stuck with him that the N.Y.P.D. finally caught the serial killer by poring over parking tickets. He had a hunch he could ensnare Dread Pirate Roberts the same way, and began to look for a sloppy mistake. Sure enough, he discovered that Ulbricht left an anonymous comment on a forum called the Shroomery when he was trying to drum up attention for his new site. However, he had neglected to scrub his email address.In Bilton\u2019s account an unexpected symmetry emerges between the agents investigating Ulbricht and the kingpin himself. They\u2019re all fighting feelings of inferiority and treating the Silk Road as a chance to prove themselves. Bilton\u2019s focus is on the hunt, and the book seems determined to sustain the suspense, even when it\u2019s baked into the plot. Many chapters end with a cliffhanger, which adds a cinematic quality but veers into pulpy true crime when it feels like there\u2019s more pathos at stake. Sometimes the facts are more satisfying than the framing.Ulbricht\u2019s rise and fall is like the start-up hero\u2019s journey reflected in a black mirror. He was fond of the same Ayn Rand quotes as other founders: \u201cThe question isn\u2019t who is going to let me; it\u2019s who is going to stop me.\u201d He had his own version of a consigliere, in the form of Variety Jones. (Ulbricht\u2019s ex-girlfriend gets a lot of space, but the most tender and complex relationship of the book is between him and Variety Jones.)Ulbricht also had the same blinkered view of the consequences of his actions. However, unlike the moral transgressions of the Uber C.E.O. Travis Kalanick or the Theranos C.E.O. Elizabeth Holmes, his came with chat logs. The documentation offers a small window into one of late capitalism\u2019s best kept secrets: How these messianic entrepreneurs talk behind closed doors when they fall so far from their ideals. I wish there had been more focus on that rather than scenes inside a Samsung factory or yet another of Ulbricht\u2019s beach vacations.Since the arrest, Ulbricht\u2019s situation seems decidedly less fringe. Libertarianism has rolled up into the Republican mainstream. The rhetoric that inspired him, from books by Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises, has found its way into the Republican Party. Gawker, the site responsible for first reporting on Silk Road, is dead, bankrupted by Peter Thiel, the libertarian billionaire venture capitalist, Trump adviser and Facebook board member.Like some other start-up founders, Ulbricht is undone by his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and narcissism. \u201cI remember clearly why I created the Silk Road,\u201d he said at sentencing. \u201cI wanted to empower people to be able to make choices in their lives, for themselves and to have privacy and anonymity.\u201d The judge responded: \u201cNo drug dealer from the Bronx selling meth or heroin or crack has ever made these kinds of arguments to the court. It is a privileged argument. You are no better a person than any other drug dealer. ... You were captain of the ship, as the Dread Pirate Roberts, and you made your own laws and you enforced those laws in the manner that you saw fit.\u201d As she handed down the sentence, she said: \u201cIt was, in fact, a carefully planned life\u2019s work. It was your opus. You wanted it to be your legacy \u2014 and it is.\u201dNitasha Tiku is a senior writer for Wired covering Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

Many travelers want something fresh and different, instead of the standardization of the large hotel brands.Expanding beyond large areas like New York and Los Angeles largely comes down to cost. In New York, for instance, construction and labor costs have outstripped increases in room rates, making it difficult to generate attractive returns on investment.Building a luxury hotel in New York costs about $1.5 million per room, Mr. Hanson said, compared with just $500,000 in many smaller cities.\u201cCosts have increased dramatically in gateway markets, and many brands need to continue growing, so they are looking outside the typical cities,\u201d Mr. Hanson said.Websites like Trip Advisor also make it easier for boutique hotels to find and market their rooms to guests. Their reviews and photographs give guests greater comfort in booking these boutique properties, according to Aran Ryan, the director of lodging analytics at Tourism Economics.\u201cThere is also more value in staying at boutique hotels than before, since guests can post their distinctive experiences on Instagram or Facebook,\u201d he said.Marriott, one of the country\u2019s largest hotel chains, is introducing numerous boutique hotels under its Autograph Collection. Known as soft brands, these boutique hotels have access to Marriott\u2019s booking service and loyalty program, but retain their own identity rather than becoming full franchises. The locations include the Empire Hotel in Birmingham, Ala. and the Elizabeth Hotel in Fort Collins, Colo. The company also has a brand of boutique hotels known as Edition Hotels.Hilton, which is pursuing the same strategy with Curio, counts among its properties the Asheville Foundry Inn in Asheville, N.C., and the Hoodoo Moab in Moab, Utah.With so many new rooms, there are some concerns about oversupply. For instance, the growth in a common industry metric, revenue per available room, is expected to slow this year. After rising 3.2 percent last year, it is expected to grow 2.2 percent this year, according to Mr. Ryan.The new level of competition is playing out in Durham. Across the street from the Unscripted Durham is another boutique hotel, 21c Museum Hotel, which has historic architecture and a rotating collection of artwork on display.Ms. Hills, whose company Austin Lawrence Partners is Unscripted Durham\u2019s developer, insists that the two properties are distinct and that there is sufficient demand in the city to sustain them both.The Dream Hotel Group hopes Unscripted Durham will be the first in a string of Unscripted hotels. A second property is scheduled to open in Flower Mound, Tex., in 2019, and discussions are underway for other locations including Phoenix; Austin, Tex.; and Long Island City, Queens.With Unscripted Durham, Austin Lawrence Partners is the developer and managing general partner and will pay the Dream Hotel Group a fee to manage it\u201cIt used to be that boutique hotels worked in the coastal cities like New York, but now the center of the country is also looking toward this lifestyle,\u201d said Jay Stein, the chief executive of the Dream Hotel Group. \u201cWe are excited to become part of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So, with a calendar-sanctioned new season upon us, it\u2019s time to indulge, if you haven\u2019t already, in some warm-weather wardrobe updates. Purchases should fall into two categories: essentials, like walkable (but chic) sandals and fuss-free skin care; and the just-for-fun fashion things, like a jaunty tie-up top or a tropical print dress, that simply put a smile on your face.A tie-front top is a little bit \u201cBlue Lagoon,\u201d a little bit disco, but mostly it\u2019s a lot summer. Perfect over a bikini, sultry with a pair of jeans and surprisingly elegant with high-waist trousers, this is the top you\u2019ll wear all season long.Everlane\u2019s new Bridge sandal has the makings of a classic. Handmade in Italy in vegetable-tanned Italian leather, in an array of colors, it could pass for a coveted luxury item \u2014 but at $88, it\u2019s a fraction of the price.There is little wonder maxi slip dresses become ubiquitous once things get steamy. Next to your birthday suit, little else is more liberating \u2014 or airy. This summer, the staple, which in years past has tended toward \u201990s minimalism, is significantly punched up by way of the season\u2019s fanciful tropical prints.Fuss-Free Face OilThat fashion insider with suspiciously good skin you may have noticed of late? Ask her secret and she may have two words for you: Vintner\u2019s Daughter. The company, founded by the winery owner April Gargiulo, makes a serum from whole, nutrient-dense botanicals (as opposed to extracts) to be extra potent. We know that in the heat there are two possible outcomes when it comes to skin: sweaty and glowy. If word of mouth is anything to go on, the serum, which helps restore the skin\u2019s texture and radiance, brings about more of the glow.The Spanish line Sunad, founded by Paloma Canut and Ana Marroqu\u00edn, both Parsons graduates, is focused on one thing: creating the perfect shirt. Handmade in Madrid from natural fabrics, the line of easy button-ups cut in just-right silhouettes is ideal at the office or as a cover-up on the beach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Will Use Artificial Intelligence to Find Extremist Posts", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Responding to complaints that not enough is being done to keep extremist content off social media platforms, Facebook said Thursday that it would begin using artificial intelligence to help remove inappropriate content.One of the first applications for the technology is identifying content that clearly violates Facebook\u2019s terms of use, such as photos and videos of beheadings or other gruesome images, and stopping users from uploading them to the site.\u201cTragically, we have seen more terror attacks recently,\u201d Ms. Bickert said. \u201cAs we see more attacks, we see more people asking what social media companies are doing to keep this content offline.\u201dThe same system, they wrote, could learn to identify Facebook users who associate with clusters of pages or groups that promote extremist content, or who return to the site again and again, creating fake accounts in order to spread such content online.\u201cIdeally, one day our technology will address everything,\u201d Ms. Bickert said. \u201cIt\u2019s in development right now.\u201d But human moderators, she added, are still needed to review content for context.Brian Fishman, Facebook\u2019s lead policy manager for counterterrorism, said the company had a team of 150 specialists working in 30 languages doing such reviews.\u201cWe cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed,\u201d Ms. May said after the bombing of a concert in Manchester that killed 22 people. \u201cYet that is precisely what the internet \u2014 and the big companies that provide internet-based services \u2014 provide.\u201dJ. M. Berger, a fellow with the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism at The Hague, said a large part of the challenge for companies like Facebook is figuring out what qualifies as terrorism \u2014 a definition that might apply to more than statements in support of groups like the Islamic State.\u201cThe problem, as usual, is determining what is extremist, and what isn\u2019t, and it goes further than just jihadists,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they just talking about ISIS and Al Qaeda, or are they going to go further to deal with white nationalism and neo-Nazi movements?\u201dMs. Bickert said Facebook was hopeful that the new artificial intelligence technology could be used to counter any form of extremism that violated the company\u2019s terms of use, although for the time being it will be narrowly focused.Still, questions about the program persist.\u201cWill it be effective or will it overreach?\u201d said Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cAre they trying to discourage people from joining terrorist groups to begin with, or to discourage them from posting about terrorism on Facebook?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Car Companies Are Hiring Computer Security Experts", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byBitsIt started about seven years ago. Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientists were being assassinated in a string of similar attacks: Assailants on motorcycles were pulling up to their moving cars, attaching magnetic bombs and detonating them after the motorcyclists had fled the scene.In another seven years, security experts warn, assassins won\u2019t need motorcycles or magnetic bombs. All they\u2019ll need is a laptop and code to send driverless cars careering off a bridge, colliding with a driverless truck or coming to an unexpected stop in the middle of fast-moving traffic.Automakers may call them self-driving cars. But hackers call them computers that travel over 100 miles an hour.\u201cThese are no longer cars,\u201d said Marc Rogers, the principal security researcher at the cybersecurity firm CloudFlare. \u201cThese are data centers on wheels. Any part of the car that talks to the outside world is a potential inroad for attackers.\u201dThose fears came into focus two years ago when two \u201cwhite hat\u201d hackers \u2014 researchers who look for computer vulnerabilities to spot problems and fix them, rather than to commit a crime or cause problems \u2014 successfully gained access to a Jeep Cherokee from their computer miles away. They rendered their crash-test dummy (in this case a nervous reporter) powerless over his vehicle and disabling his transmission in the middle of a highway.\u201cCar hacking makes great headlines, but remember: No one has ever had their car hacked by a bad guy,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter last Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s only ever been performed by researchers.\u201dStill, the research by Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek came at a steep price for Jeep\u2019s manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler, which was forced to recall 1.4 million of its vehicles as a result of the hacking experiment.It is no wonder that Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, called cybersecurity her company\u2019s top priority last year. Now the skills of researchers and so-called white hat hackers are in high demand among automakers and tech companies pushing ahead with driverless car projects.Uber, Tesla, Apple and Didi in China have been actively recruiting white hat hackers like Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek from one another as well as from traditional cybersecurity firms and academia.Last year, Tesla poached Aaron Sigel, Apple\u2019s manager of security for its iOS operating system. Uber poached Chris Gates, formerly a white hat hacker at Facebook. Didi poached Mr. Miller from Uber, where he had gone to work after the Jeep hack. And security firms have seen dozens of engineers leave their ranks for autonomous-car projects.Mr. Miller said he left Uber for Didi, in part, because his new Chinese employer has given him more freedom to discuss his work.\u201cCarmakers seem to be taking the threat of cyberattack more seriously, but I\u2019d still like to see more transparency from them,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter on Saturday.Like a number of big tech companies, Tesla and Fiat Chrysler started paying out rewards to hackers who turn over flaws the hackers discover in their systems. GM has done something similar, though critics say GM\u2019s program is limited when compared with the ones offered by tech companies, and so far no rewards have been paid out.Granted, they had to be in the Jeep to make all that happen. But it was evidence of what is possible.Security researchers have also had their way with Tesla\u2019s software-heavy Model S car. In 2015, Mr. Rogers, together with Kevin Mahaffey, the chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company Lookout, found a way to control various Tesla functions from their physically connected laptop.One year later, a team of Chinese researchers at Tencent took their research a step further, hacking a moving Tesla Model S and controlling its brakes from 12 miles away. Unlike Chrysler, Tesla was able to dispatch a remote patch to fix the security holes that made the hacks possible.In all the cases, the car hacks were the work of well meaning, white hat security researchers. But the lesson for all automakers was clear.The motivations to hack vehicles are limitless. When it learned of Mr. Rogers\u2019s and Mr. Mahaffey\u2019s investigation into Tesla\u2019s Model S, a Chinese app-maker asked Mr. Rogers if he would be interested in sharing, or possibly selling, his discovery, he said. (The app maker was looking for a backdoor to secretly install its app on Tesla\u2019s dashboard.)Criminals have not yet shown they have found back doors into connected vehicles, though for years, they have been actively developing, trading and deploying tools that can intercept car key communications.But as more driverless and semiautonomous cars hit the open roads, they will become a more worthy target. Security experts warn that driverless cars present a far more complex, intriguing and vulnerable \u201cattack surface\u201d for hackers. Each new \u201cconnected\u201d car feature introduces greater complexity, and with complexity inevitably comes vulnerability.Twenty years ago, cars had, on average, one million lines of code. The General Motors 2010 Chevrolet Volt had about 10 million lines of code \u2014 more than an F-35 fighter jet.Today, an average car has more than 100 million lines of code. Automakers predict it won\u2019t be long before they have 200 million. When you stop to consider that, on average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of software code, the potentially exploitable weaknesses add up quickly.The only difference between computer code and driverless car code is that, \u201cUnlike data center enterprise security \u2014 where the biggest threat is loss of data \u2014 in automotive security, it\u2019s loss of life,\u201d said David Barzilai, a co-founder of Karamba Security, an Israeli start-up that is working on addressing automotive security.To truly secure autonomous vehicles, security experts say, automakers will have to address the inevitable vulnerabilities that pop up in new sensors and car computers, address inherent vulnerabilities in the base car itself and, perhaps most challenging of all, bridge the cultural divide between automakers and software companies.\u201cThe genie is out of the bottle, and to solve this problem will require a major cultural shift,\u201d said Mr. Mahaffey of the cybersecurity company Lookout. \u201cAnd an automaker that truly values cybersecurity will treat security vulnerabilities the same they would an airbag recall. We have not seen that industrywide shift yet.\u201dThere will be winners and losers, Mr. Mahaffey added: \u201cAutomakers that transform themselves into software companies will win. Others will get left behind.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Thus did Mildred Loving, both black and Native American, and her husband, Richard, who was white, make civil rights history.The Lovings were arrested in July 1958, when the local sheriff burst into their bedroom in the middle of the night, demanding to know what they were doing together. They had married in the District of Columbia, but their union was illegal in Virginia. A county judge offered a deal: They could avoid prison if they promised to leave Virginia and not return for 25 years.They moved to Washington, but a longing for home upended the agreement. Mildred, missing her family, wrote a letter to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. He referred the matter to the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the constitutionality of Virginia\u2019s anti-miscegenation law. Yet the Lovings \u2014 Richard died in 1975, and Mildred in 2008 \u2014 were reluctant civil rights icons.To get the conversation started, we put that question to Mrs. Cosby.

{"Headline": "To Stay in Love, Sign on the Dotted Line", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byModern LoveA few months ago my boyfriend and I poured ourselves two beers and opened our laptops. It was time to review the terms of our relationship contract.Did we want to make changes? As Mark and I went through each category, we agreed to two minor swaps: my Tuesday dog walk for his Saturday one, and having me clean the kitchen counters and him take over the bathtub.The latest version of \u201cMark and Mandy\u2019s Relationship Contract,\u201d a four-page, single-spaced document that we sign and date, will last for exactly 12 months, after which we have the option to revise and renew it, as we\u2019ve done twice before. The contract spells out everything from sex to chores to finances to our expectations for the future. And I love it.Writing a relationship contract may sound calculating or unromantic, but every relationship is contractual; we\u2019re just making the terms more explicit. It reminds us that love isn\u2019t something that happens to us \u2014 it\u2019s something we\u2019re making together. After all, this approach brought us together in the first place.In the past, expecting a relationship to work simply because the people involved loved each other had failed me. I spent my 20s with a man who knew exactly what he wanted and how he wanted to be. All I had wanted was for him to love me.We were together for almost a decade, and in that time I somehow lost track of my own habits and preferences. If I wanted to split the grocery bill, he suggested I buy only things we both liked. If I wanted to spend weekends together, I could go skiing with him and his friends. And so I did. I made my life look like his.It wasn\u2019t until I moved out that I began to see that there hadn\u2019t been room for me in my relationship. And not merely because my ex hadn\u2019t offered it \u2014 it had never occurred to me to ask. I was in love, and love meant making compromises, right? But what if I had loved him too much?Years earlier I had read Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own\u201d and thought I understood it, but I hadn\u2019t. At 20, I gave myself over to love, and it wasn\u2019t until the relationship ended, when I was 29, that I discovered what it meant to fully inhabit my days and the spaciousness of my own mind. It was such a joy to find that my time was mine, along with every decision from what to cook to when to go to bed.I resolved that in my next relationship I would love more moderately, keeping more of me for myself.When I met Mark, he fit into my life so easily it surprised me. My friends liked him. My dog, Roscoe, yelped with happiness at the sight of him. But when we started talking about living together, I was wary.I worried that the minutiae of domesticity would change us into petty creatures who bickered over laundry. More than that, I worried I might lose myself again, to a man and a relationship, overtaken by those old ideas about how love conquers all.Mark had his own reservations. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it just because it\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI only want to live together if it\u2019ll make our lives better.\u201dWe spent weeks anxiously enumerating the pros and cons of cohabitation.Months earlier we had come across a book \u2014 \u201cThe New I Do: Reshaping Marriage for Skeptics, Realists and Rebels\u201d \u2014 that recommends short-term marriage contracts. We liked the idea and realized we could take this approach to living together.Many of us don\u2019t notice the ways romantic love acts as an organizing force in our lives, but it is powerful. Some use the term \u201crelationship escalator\u201d to describe the way we tend to follow familiar scripts as we proceed in a relationship, from casual dating to cohabitation to marriage and family. These scripts that tell us what love should look like are so ubiquitous they sometimes seem invisible.In my last relationship, I had spent a lot of time worrying about whether we were moving up the escalator. I wasn\u2019t even sure what I wanted, but trying to figure that out through conversation seemed terrifying. Instead, I picked fights, about money or chores or how to spend the weekend. If I was angry, it was somehow easier to be honest.With Mark, I wanted to do better.Our contract addresses much of what must be negotiated in any relationship, especially when cohabitating. It begins with our reasons for being together: \u201cWe aspire to help each other be more ethically-minded and generous friends, community members and global citizens.\u201d I know it sounds idealistic, but I\u2019ve had relationships that left me feeling lonely and small. This time I wanted to be more intentional about looking outward as much as we look in.The terms range from the familiar (\u201cWe will take care of each other when one of us is sick\u201d) to the fanciful (\u201cIf we\u2019re both sick, it\u2019s all up to the dog\u201d). In fact, Roscoe gets an entire section, detailing his walking schedules, vet visits and even how sweet we think he is.We have a houseguest section (guests can stay for up to two weeks but must be mutually vetted) and an item that deals with Mark\u2019s sweaty running clothes (\u201cHe agrees to hang these up in the spare room or on the back of the bathroom door but he wants Mandy to know that this may be a fairly common occurrence\u201d).We agree to split the bill when eating out with one exception: \u201cSpecial meals (date night, celebrations, etc.) will not be split so one person can treat the other.\u201dIt was important to me to eat breakfast together because this was something my family did growing up, so we put that in writing. It\u2019s amazing how empowering this can feel: to name your desires or insecurities, however small, and make space for them. It\u2019s such a simple thing, but it wasn\u2019t easy. I wasn\u2019t used to knowing what I wanted in a relationship, much less saying it aloud. Now, I have to do both.We wanted to take nothing for granted, which has meant having the kinds of conversations I previously avoided. Under \u201cSex and Intimacy,\u201d for example, we wrote that we agree to be monogamous because, right now, monogamy suits us. But we don\u2019t assume it\u2019s what we will always want.Our contract isn\u2019t infallible, or the solution to every problem. But it acknowledges that we each have desires that deserve to be named and recognized.As we concluded the recent renewal of our contract, Mark typed a new heading near the end: Marriage. \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d he asked, sitting back as if he had just asked where I want to get takeout.I stared into my beer. This wasn\u2019t the first time we had talked about marriage, but now, with the contract open, it felt official. I squirmed, knowing that part of me wanted to say, \u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d while another part wanted to reject the institution altogether and do love and commitment on our own terms.\u201cWhat would marriage offer us that we don\u2019t already have?\u201d I asked.\u201cGood question,\u201d he said.\u201cIt would be nice to hear our friends make funny and heartwarming speeches about us,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really want to plan a wedding, or pay for it.\u201dHe agreed. And yet, we like this thing we have created.I know that a lifetime commitment is supposed to involve a surprise proposal, a tearful acceptance and a Facebook slide show of happy selfies. But if it\u2019s the rest of our lives, I want us to think it through, together.Finally Mark typed: \u201cWe agree that marriage is an ongoing topic of conversation.\u201dIt seemed a trivial thing to put in writing, but talking \u2014 instead of just waiting and wondering \u2014 has been a relief to us both.As I type this, Mark is out for a run and the dog is snoring at a volume that is inordinately sweet, and I am at home in the spaciousness of my own mind. I have failed at my goal of loving more moderately, but for the first time in my life I feel as if there is room for me in my relationship, and space for us to decide exactly how we want to practice love.It may look as though we\u2019re riding the relationship escalator, but I prefer to think we\u2019re taking the stairs.Mandy Len Catron, who lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, is the author of \u201cHow to Fall in Love With Anyone,\u201d published this month.modernlove@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reader Center: Covering Studies That Were Not Peer Reviewed", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byBulletin BoardHello, everyone,Many reporters and editors at The New York Times spend a good deal of time listening to readers\u2019 questions, concerns and suggestions. But our readers often don\u2019t know how we\u2019re thinking about or responding to this feedback. (Unless, of course, a correction is issued.)We\u2019d like to change that.Thanks so much.June 29, 2017I understand the reader\u2019s concern about this. In a case like this, where research is published and promoted on a matter of particular public interest, we have to make a decision as to what best serves our readers. Given the attention (and debate) these studies were bound to receive, and the credentials of the researchers, we felt it was best not to ignore the work but to examine it as fully as possible \u2014 including possible flaws in methodology \u2014 while including a note specifying that it had not yet been peer reviewed.I hope it will be at least some reassurance to our reader to know that her point is something we considered closely before publication. I\u2019m sure it is a subject we will continue to watch as further research and political developments arise.\u2014 Kevin McKenna, Deputy Business EditorJune 29, 2017Our editorial sparked a heated discussion in Catalonia, including a debate on our intended meaning. The Times received a flurry of emails from readers, some asking us to clarify our position on the referendum.The debate focused on this paragraph:\u201cThe best outcome for Spain would be to permit the referendum, and for Catalan voters to reject independence \u2014 as voters in Quebec and Scotland have done. Otherwise, Madrid\u2019s intransigence will only inflame Catalan frustrations.\u201dReaders asked, does the Editorial Board think a rejection of independence would be best for Spain, or for Catalan voters?The point of the editorial was that much of the Spanish government\u2019s problem with Catalonian separatism is due to Madrid\u2019s antagonism, mismanagement and incompetence, which have fortified the appeal for a measure that may not truly have deep support.We aren\u2019t advocating Catalan independence, but rather a far more aggressive effort by the Spanish government to address the grievances of Catalonians. A referendum that ended in a no vote might well lance the boil, as it appears to have done in Scotland. The Spanish government regards a referendum as unconstitutional and, even if it was ultimately ruled legal, it should be regarded as a last-ditch measure to resolve political differences better settled through negotiations.\u2014 Editorial BoardJune 26, 2017Perhaps it would be best to hear directly from the reporter of this article, Jessica Bennett.\u2014 Stuart Emmrich, Styles EditorBut as it pertains to this specific article, the simple answer is that it was the Styles section of the Times that saw fit to give me a writing contract, so I take all of my stories to the editors there first. As a journalist who primarily covers issues of gender and culture, it doesn\u2019t bother me to see my stories appear alongside fashion reports because I don\u2019t think these things are mutually exclusive.But... I hear this critique loud and clear \u2014 maybe now is not such a bad time to rethink the section\u2019s title?June 23, 2017Our international readers occasionally express concern that our coverage is too focused on the United States or an American perspective on the world. Every time we refer to London as \u201cacross the pond,\u201d some British readers cringe.We\u2019re working hard to find the right mix for our vast and varied readership. We are in the process of rolling out redesigned digital platforms that will allow us to personalize the home screen, so readers who live in Europe might get more British election coverage than, say, people in Nepal or Nebraska.Interestingly, on June 8, 24 percent of British visitors to nytimes.com read something about Mr. Comey, and 17 percent read something about Mrs. May (5 percent read both). Maybe that\u2019s because Brits come to us for news about the United States, and rely on local sources for local politics. Or maybe it\u2019s because that\u2019s what we had on the top two scroll-screens of the website.June 23, 2017But a photo sometimes only tells a partial story. The Times building is home to other corporate entities, including the law firm of Covington & Burling. The firm was hosting a reception honoring the national organization representing court-appointed special advocates for children, and Mr. Comey and his wife, who have been foster parents to a number of children, were attending.Sometime after 9 p.m., a person close to Mr. Comey, who hoped to clarify the matter, sent along pictures, including one of the nearly 6-foot-8 Mr. Comey surrounded by young children at the law firm\u2019s offices, to prove where he had been. A spokeswoman for The Times also said that Mr. Comey hadn\u2019t visited the newsroom.June 22, 2017But there is no question that what took place in those prisons was torture. Prisoners were repeatedly waterboarded, subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation and shackled in painful positions.\u2014 Dean Baquet, Executive EditorJune 22, 2017June 22, 2017Ms. Hunt and others raise a good question. It is a challenge to illustrate a general problem like obesity. We sought to protect the individual\u2019s privacy. We didn\u2019t intend to demean her by using a picture that didn\u2019t show her face. But we\u2019ll think hard the next time we\u2019re wrestling with this issue.\u2014 Celia Dugger, Health and Science EditorJune 22, 2017Many readers thanked Walt and The Times for shining a light on the case and expressed their condolences to the family of the mother, Michelle O\u2019Connell, and respect for Rusty Rodgers, an officer whose investigation upended his own life. Some recalled first learning about the case through Walt\u2019s article in 2013.\u2014 Cynthia Collins, Social Media and Community EditorJune 22, 2017Wendy Finke, a Times subscriber from Cincinnati, flew to New York last week to attend the newsroom\u2019s morning news meeting, long called the Page One meeting.Wendy, a cardiac nurse, was one of 1,500 Times subscribers who entered a contest to win a spot at one of the twice-daily meetings. Other winners will attend future meetings.\u201cOne thing that surprised me was how young everyone was,\u201d Wendy emailed me after her visit. \u201cAs we walked about the offices and you introduced me to so many people, I had a feeling of enthusiasm (maybe some of that is that people were being so polite to me, but it felt genuine) and innovation.

And then sear them in a well-seasoned or nonstick pan, well swirled with olive oil and heated until it is nearly about to smoke. Cook, turning the pieces a few times, until they are golden brown on all sides. Call your people to the table. Everyone gets a slice or two of cheese and a healthy pile of salad.

{"Headline": "Airlines Redesigning Uniforms Find Out How Complicated It Is", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byLong ago, airline uniforms reflected the glamour of flight. Now, they have to serve more utilitarian needs. Do they reflect the airline\u2019s image? Will they look good on most everyone? And, perhaps most important, are they comfortable?Several domestic airlines have been wrestling with the answers to those questions as they redesign uniforms that, in some cases, were last updated decades ago.For American Airlines, which introduced new uniforms in September, the different look was an important step in conveying a unified brand image since its merger with US Airways in 2013.\u201cThere was a visual difference in what people were wearing, and I think, inherently, that kind of creates a barrier,\u201d said Brady Byrnes, the airline\u2019s director of global marketing. After the rollout of the new uniforms, he said, \u201cyou could just feel a shift.\u201dPeople who work on airline uniform designs say it\u2019s common for the process to take two or three years, sometimes longer.Ekrem Dimbiloglu, director of airport customer experience for Delta Air Lines, agreed that \u201cthere\u2019s a very long lead time associated with producing garments.\u201dIn 2015, Delta tapped the fashion designer Zac Posen to develop its new uniforms, which will be rolled out to around 60,000 employees next year. \u201cIt\u2019s a million-plus garments,\u201d Mr. Dimbiloglu said.One reason the new designs take so long is that airline uniforms, unlike ordinary work clothes, have to be multifunctional.\u201cWhen you look at a flight attendant dress, it just looks like any other dress,\u201d Mr. Byrnes said. In reality, both the cut and the fabric have to accommodate a range of motion, from hoisting bags into the overhead bins to crouching down in the galley.\u201cIt\u2019s a very physical job. It has to bend and stretch and move,\u201d Mr. Byrnes said of the uniforms. \u201cThe fabrication is extremely important. We really did a lot of extensive testing in fabric, by adding a little bit of a stretch.\u201dMaterials that make movement easy were also a top priority for Southwest Airlines, which introduced new uniforms for its more than 42,000 workers this month.\u201cFor a lot of our garments, we transitioned to a ponte fabric,\u201d said Sonya Lacore, Southwest\u2019s vice president for in-flight operations. Ponte, a heavyweight knit, has a slight stretch to it. \u201cIt gives with you. That was a big, big thing,\u201d she said.Uniforms also have to reflect the realities of life on the road, with fabric blends that resist stains and wrinkles and can be laundered, if necessary, in a hotel sink. They also need to keep the wearers comfortable, whether their plane touches down in the summer in Maui or in the winter in Minneapolis.Before giving the new uniforms to employees, the airlines conduct wear tests. The roughly 500 employees in American\u2019s test reported back on details that needed to be changed. For example, Mr. Byrnes said, an initial dress prototype included a back zipper, but flight attendants found it challenging to reach. So the zipper was scuttled in favor of buttons on the front.For its 1,000-employee wear test, Delta solicited feedback via surveys, focus groups, an internal Facebook page and job shadowing, in which members of the design team traveled with flight crews to get a firsthand view of the demands of the job.\u201cWe had about 160-plus changes to the uniform design\u201d as a result of those efforts, Mr. Dimbiloglu said.Pockets \u2014 their number, placement and appearance \u2014 are a huge issue, airline executives say. Another is shirt length: In-flight crew members need their shirts long enough to stay tucked in when they reach into overhead bins.Southwest also had to decide whether the new uniforms would keep or eliminate the shorts that were perhaps the most distinguishing feature in the previous uniform design.\u201cThere was quite a bit of debate about it,\u201d Ms. Lacore said, since so many of the places where Southwest flies are hot year-round. \u201cWe wanted them to be comfortable, and they convinced us shorts are one of the ways they stay cool and comfortable.\u201dComing up with styles that also will be flattering on a wide variety of body types is another challenge for designers.\u201cColor-blocked garments with two or three tones create some interest for the eye and will help lengthen and slim \u2014 it can make you look a little more athletic or sport-inspired,\u201d said Caroline Bartek, a fashion designer and creative director at Cintas, which is working with Southwest on its new uniforms.\u201cI would say another is just having the opportunity to have garments untucked,\u201d she said, adding that more airlines were opting to offer a set of mix-and-match separates. \u201cThe final design element we\u2019re seeing is that there\u2019s no one prescription.\u201dMost of the uniform overhauls include clothes not only for flight attendants and gate agents \u2014 \u201cabove the wing\u201d jobs \u2014 but for the luggage handlers, mechanics and other workers who make up an airline\u2019s \u201cbelow the wing\u201d work force.Below-wing uniforms are more utilitarian, in keeping with the greater physical demands of the job and, as a result, incorporate different features.\u201cWe let them bring tools in the room and lay out a design, like, \u2018I need this tool in this pocket,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lacore said.Even after wear-testing, unexpected issues can crop up. After it rolled out its new uniforms, American faced a number of complaints from workers who reported rashes, respiratory trouble and other health problems after wearing the wool-blend suits.Last week, American announced that while its testing \u201cconfirms that the current uniforms are safe,\u201d it would not renew its contract with its supplier when it expired in 2020. \u201cIn the meantime,\u201d it said in a letter to workers, \u201cwe continue to offer a variety of options, including standard wool, polyester and 100 percent cotton. There is also an off-the-shelf option available by an independent supplier.\u201dAside from fit and function, employee uniforms are an important part of an airline\u2019s brand image.\u201cThere\u2019s just been this aura of glamour and interest associated with uniforms,\u201d said Avi Mannis, senior vice president for marketing at Hawaiian Airlines, which is preparing a new uniform for this year.\u201cUniforms represent a place and a culture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we have a uniform that embodies some of those cultural traditions, that had a cultural narrative associated with it.\u201dTo that end, Hawaiian incorporated lehua flowers and traditional patterns in the prints of the fabrics. \u201cEach element on the print is symbolic,\u201d Mr. Mannis said.Shashank Nigam, chief executive of the consulting firm SimpliFlying, said uniforms were a crucial part of an airline\u2019s brand, especially with the decline in the number of in-person encounters a traveler experiences.\u201cToday more than ever, the uniform is the most important symbol of an airline that a passenger interacts with and sees,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Juicy Tenderloin, a Pesto Swirl", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenFor many, a summer gathering means meat on the grill, in the form of burgers, chops, ribs or sausages. I\u2019m all for those, but sometimes a more elegant type of party is in order, one with a tablecloth, china, real glasses and silverware \u2014 a dinner table moved outdoors.If you\u2019re heading in that direction, consider grilling a beef tenderloin roast with zesty, garlicky pesto swirled inside. Not a whole beef tenderloin, though. I\u2019m talking about a cylindrical center-cut chunk.You\u2019ll need to visit a butcher for that, since it is a somewhat special request, a cut of meat not normally kept at the ready. Ask for a nice 3- to 4-pound roast from the middle of the tenderloin.To achieve the spiral effect, the roast will need to be butterflied into a flat rectangular shape. Of course, you can ask the butcher to do it for you. But it\u2019s really not very difficult to do, and a fun project if you\u2019re up for it. This is not the standard butterfly technique, however. Instead of slicing part way through a fat steak, say, and laying it flat like an open book, here we gradually flatten a larger cut for more surface area.Here\u2019s how: Position the meat on a cutting board so it is perpendicular to the board. With a sharp knife, make a one-inch-deep incision along the length of the roast. Then use a sawing motion as you continue to cut, moving the knife down and to the left; with your fingers, begin to pry open the roast. Continue cutting, flattening the meat as you go. As if by magic, you will quickly produce a large rectangular piece. Congratulate yourself. Don\u2019t worry if it looks a little ragged; it will be pounded with a mallet to an even thickness.The pesto I use has green olives and sharp pecorino in addition to parsley, basil and garlic, adding body, texture and hearty flavor (a few anchovies would also be a nice addition). Smear the pesto over the meat, roll the whole affair like a rug back into a cylindrical shape and tie it securely with twine. You can do this several hours ahead of the meal or even the day before serving it.As the roast cooks over hot coals, the mingled smoke and herbs release the most heavenly aroma. As with all roasts, you must let it rest before slicing. If you wish, let it cool completely.I\u2019ll admit to cooking mine on a stovetop grill and finishing it in the oven one recent rainy day, another perfectly good option.And to Drink ...Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley Billionaires Remaking America\u2019s Schools", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byEducation DisruptedIn San Francisco\u2019s public schools, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, is giving middle school principals $100,000 \u201cinnovation grants\u201d and encouraging them to behave more like start-up founders and less like bureaucrats.In Maryland, Texas, Virginia and other states, Netflix\u2019s chief, Reed Hastings, is championing a popular math-teaching program where Netflix-like algorithms determine which lessons students see.In the space of just a few years, technology giants have begun remaking the very nature of schooling on a vast scale, using some of the same techniques that have made their companies linchpins of the American economy. Through their philanthropy, they are influencing the subjects that schools teach, the classroom tools that teachers choose and fundamental approaches to learning.The involvement by some of the wealthiest and most influential titans of the 21st century amounts to a singular experiment in education, with millions of students serving as de facto beta testers for their ideas. Some tech leaders believe that applying an engineering mind-set can improve just about any system, and that their business acumen qualifies them to rethink American education.But the philanthropic efforts are taking hold so rapidly that there has been little public scrutiny.Tech companies and their founders have been rolling out programs in America\u2019s public schools with relatively few checks and balances, The New York Times found in interviews with more than 100 company executives, government officials, school administrators, researchers, teachers, parents and students.Furthermore, there is only limited research into whether the tech giants\u2019 programs have actually improved students\u2019 educational results.One of the broadest philanthropic initiatives directly benefits the tech industry.Mr. Hastings of Netflix and other tech executives rejected the idea that they wielded significant influence in education. The mere fact that classroom internet access has improved, Mr. Hastings said, has had a much greater impact in schools than anything tech philanthropists have done.\u201cIn our society as a democracy, I think it is healthy that there is a debate about what are the goals of public education,\u201d Mr. Hastings added.Captains of American industry have long used their private wealth to remake public education, with lasting and not always beneficial results.What is different today is that some technology giants have begun pitching their ideas directly to students, teachers and parents \u2014 using social media to rally people behind their ideas. Some companies also cultivate teachers to spread the word about their products.Such strategies help companies and philanthropists alike influence public schools far more quickly than in the past, by creating legions of supporters who can sway legislators and education officials.\u201cWe should be asking a lot more questions about who is behind the curtain,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Mr. Benioff, the billionaire behind Salesforce, had a blunt message for San Francisco\u2019s mayor and its schools superintendent.It was 2013, and the two city officials had approached Mr. Benioff hoping to persuade him to pony up a few million dollars to install Wi-Fi in schools and buy some classroom laptops. But the request seemed too penny-ante to the software mogul.\u201cThat\u2019s when I had to say, \u2018You guys need to think bigger!\u2019\u201d Mr. Benioff recalled in an interview in his San Francisco home. He urged the superintendent to imagine \u201cwhat nirvana would look like\u201d in his schools, if money were no object.With that conversation, Mr. Benioff set in motion a transformation of the relationship between philanthropist and public education. He has emerged as a kind of personal venture capitalist to the city\u2019s public schools \u2014 one intent on remaking a traditional school bureaucracy in Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurial image.Mr. Benioff ultimately pledged $100 million over a decade to the San Francisco Unified School District through his company\u2019s nonprofit arm, Salesforce.org. Unlike conventional benefactors, he is hands-on: School district administrators now submit an annual grant wish list to the Salesforce.org board for review. And Mr. Benioff dispenses not just money, but also management prescriptions.\u201cHe\u2019s almost a public-sector V.C.,\u201d said Richard A. Carranza, who was then the superintendent of San Francisco schools.Mr. Benioff rejected the notion that his approach to education philanthropy was venture-capitalist-like. \u201cWe are not giving them a new religion,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are trying to work with them in a smart way and augment what they are doing.\u201dThe partnership with the district kicked off in 2012 when San Francisco\u2019s mayor, Edwin M. Lee, asked Mr. Benioff to help the city\u2019s middle schools. The mayor wanted to give students a better chance at landing tech jobs. And he wanted Mr. Benioff to pay for it.\u201cI would like to give our kids the opportunity, when they graduate, to see themselves working at those tech companies,\u201d Mr. Lee recalled telling Mr. Benioff.But Mr. Benioff\u2019s \u201cthink bigger\u201d mandate also led to culture clashes. Chief among these: He established a Principal\u2019s Innovation Fund, which awards annual unrestricted grants of $100,000 to the principal at each of the district\u2019s 21 middle and K-8 schools.Administrators subsequently asked principals to select projects that fit with the district\u2019s priorities. Principals have used the grants to start robotics clubs, provide English-tutoring programs for immigrant students and redesign a school library with hangout zones where children can sit with their laptops.Mr. Benioff said he knew that his methods pushed some administrators beyond their comfort zones. \u201cYou\u2019d have the same issue at Salesforce if somebody from the outside came in and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to help you to blah-blah-blah,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBureaucrats would try to stop them.\u201dSo far, Salesforce.org has provided about $20 million to the schools. By hiring additional teachers, schools reduced the average class size across eighth-grade math to 24 students from 33 \u2014 enabling teachers to give more individualized instruction, district officials said.\u201cPeople think school districts are too bureaucratic, can\u2019t be nimble and can\u2019t innovate,\u201d Mr. Carranza said. \u201cWe are proving that this is just not true.\u201dThere are limits to Mr. Benioff\u2019s approach: Most school districts will not be able to secure their own billionaire benefactors. But Mr. Benioff said he intended to keep working with local schools for decades to come.\u201cThis is not just a sea gull strategy where we are dumping a bunch of money and leaving town,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are in the trenches.\u201dThey also share a guardian angel: Mr. Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive.In 2009, he heard about a start-up that used artificial intelligence to adapt math lessons to students. The math program worked a bit like the software Netflix used to customize its video recommendations.\u201cIt is probably fair to say I recognized the power of personalization maybe more than other people, because I had seen it in my own working life,\u201d Mr. Hastings said in an interview at Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles office.There was just one problem: DreamBox Learning was running low on cash. So Mr. Hastings stepped in, donating about $11 million to a nonprofit charter-school fund so it could buy the math platform.Today, more than two million students use the program for supplemental math instruction.DreamBox takes elements from animated video games, with some math lessons populated by aliens that whoosh about and animals that cluck. When students complete a math lesson successfully, they earn points that they can use to unlock virtual rewards.Administrators in some districts said that students so enjoyed the math program that some had begged their parents to let them play DreamBox even during trips to the supermarket. But four parents with children in public schools in Baltimore County, Md., said the program was so stimulating that they had curbed its use at home.\u201cIt really can suck a kid in,\u201d said Brenda Peiffer, a former school counselor, whose son, a third grader, was assigned DreamBox for homework. After noticing that he seemed more interested in spending points to customize his avatar than in actually doing math, she put the kibosh on DreamBox. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing it at home,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect solution for everyone,\u201d she said.And some experienced teachers said it was preposterous to think that algorithms could be better than skilled teachers at adapting to students\u2019 abilities. \u201cWhat you are seeing right now is a heavy push to disrupt and diminish the role of teachers as experts,\u201d said Arienne Adamcikova, a high school teacher in San Mateo, Calif.Mr. Hastings saw it differently.DreamBox Learning tracks a student\u2019s every click, correct answer, hesitation and error \u2014 collecting about 50,000 data points per student per hour \u2014 and uses those details to adjust the math lessons it shows. And it uses data to help teachers pinpoint which math concepts students may be struggling with.Mr. Hastings described DreamBox as a tool teachers could use to gain greater insights into their students, much the way that physicians use medical scans to treat individual patients. \u201cA doctor without an X-ray machine is not as good a doctor,\u201d Mr. Hastings said.Is DreamBox effective?DreamBox is among the minority of digital learning start-ups that have allowed independent academic researchers to examine and publicly report on their data. Still, the platform\u2019s effectiveness is difficult to gauge.Even so, Ms. Woolley-Wilson, DreamBox\u2019s chief executive, described the study as good news, saying it confirmed encouraging reports from teachers. She pointed out that, unlike DreamBox, many other education start-ups lacked research to prove even the most basic assumption: that their apps did not harm students\u2019 educational results.\u201cThat sounds like a low bar,\u201d Ms. Woolley-Wilson said. \u201cBut with the history of education technology, it is not.\u201dMr. Hastings (who is a company director but has no financial interest in the math company) said he was enthusiastic about DreamBox\u2019s potential and predicted wider classroom use for the technology as artificial intelligence improved.Still, he emphasized that he did not view technology generally as a panacea for education. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little cynical and jaundiced about technology,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe tech can help, but it is often oversold.\u201dIf Facebook\u2019s Mr. Zuckerberg has his way, children the world over will soon be teaching themselves \u2014 using software his company helped build.It\u2019s a conception that upends a longstanding teaching dynamic. Now educators are no longer classroom leaders, but helpmates.In public remarks and Facebook posts, Mr. Zuckerberg has described how it works. Students cluster together, working at laptops. They use software to select their own assignments, working at their own pace. And, should they struggle at teaching themselves, teachers are on hand to guide them.\u201cWhen you visit a school like this, it feels like the future \u2014 it feels like a start-up,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told an audience last fall in Peru. \u201cYou get the feeling this is how more of the education system should work.\u201dHe is well on his way to achieving this vision. In 2015, 19 American schools introduced the software that Facebook helped develop. This school year, more than 100 schools use it. Next fall, Mr. Zuckerberg said, he expects that \u201cmany hundreds of more schools will upgrade.\u201dThe effort began a few years ago with visits by Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician who is his wife, to Summit Denali, a middle school in Sunnyvale, Calif. There, classrooms lack walls, and students with laptops often zoom around on caster chairs.Mr. Zuckerberg, she said, admired the software that Summit had created for its schools. He offered Ms. Tavenner a team of Facebook engineers to further develop it and make it available free to schools nationwide.Summit developed its student-directed learning approach after administrators there discovered that their teachers had been so supportive of students, Ms. Tavenner said, that many of its graduates were struggling in college, unprepared to pace themselves or seek help.That is how Summit\u2019s platform came to show students every lesson they will need to complete for the year. They may tackle lessons in any order. At the end of each unit, they take a 10-question multiple-choice test.Not all educators agree. Four former Summit teachers said they found the system problematic. They asked that their names be withheld, saying they feared repercussions for their careers.At Summit, they said, they were required to teach students cognitive skills (like how to construct an argument) while making students responsible for teaching themselves underlying lesson material (like how diverse plants and animals coexist). But some students raced through lessons without actually understanding basic facts, the teachers said, making it difficult to help them structure arguments on specific topics, like climate change.Ms. Tavenner of Summit, however, said that was exactly the point: to make students discover for themselves that they cannot succeed on applied projects without learning the fundamentals.Students think to themselves, \u201c\u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to actually go back and deeply understand it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Tavenner said. \u201cThose are the habits of success that we are trying to instill in kids that simply don\u2019t get instilled in the normal system.\u201dIt can be a steep learning curve.\u201cKids were self-pacing to failure,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.Teachers remedied that by helping students set realistic goals. The school is now happy with the program, she said, and has expanded it to the seventh grade. Even so, Ms. Fisher said, \u201cWe definitely have a concern about the quality of the assessments in the curriculum and whether it actually promotes deeper learning.\u201d\u201cOur hope over the next decade is to help upgrade a majority of these schools to personalized learning and then start working globally as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told the audience. \u201cGiving a billion students a personalized education is a great thing to do.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Making Google the Censor", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe fears and frustrations behind these proposals are understandable. But making private companies curtail user expression in important public forums \u2014 which is what platforms like Twitter and Facebook have become \u2014 is dangerous. The proposed laws would harm free expression and information access for journalists, political dissidents and ordinary users. Policy makers should be candid about these consequences and not pretend that Silicon Valley has silver-bullet technology that can purge the internet of extremist content without taking down important legal speech with it.European politicians tout the proposed laws as curbs on the power of big American internet companies. But the reality is just the opposite. These laws give private companies a role \u2014 deciding what information the public can see and share \u2014 previously held by national courts and legislators. That is a meaningful loss of national sovereignty and democratic control.Moving this responsibility from state to private actors also eliminates key legal protections for internet users. Private-platform owners are not constrained by the First Amendment or human rights law the way the police or courts are. Users most likely have no remedy if companies are heavy-handed or sloppy in erasing speech. Governments that outsource speech control to private companies can effectively achieve censorship by proxy.But violent and extremist material is different. Almost any such image or video is legal in some context. Filters can\u2019t tell the difference between footage used for terrorist recruitment and the same footage used for journalism, political advocacy or human rights efforts. When filters fail to make those distinctions, they will take down information and discussion on topics of vital public importance. Risk-averse companies erring on the side of over-removal for this kind of speech will disproportionately silence Arabic speakers and Islamic religious material.Outraged demands for \u201cplatform responsibility\u201d are a muscular-sounding response to terrorism that shifts public attention from the governments\u2019 duties. But we don\u2019t want an internet where private platforms police every word at the behest of the state. Such power over public discourse would be Orwellian in the hands of any government, be it Ms. May\u2019s, Donald Trump\u2019s or Vladimir Putin\u2019s.Daphne Keller is the director of Intermediary Liability at Stanford Law School\u2019s Center for Internet and Society, and previously was associate general counsel to Google.Advertisement"}

There isn\u2019t.\u201dMs. Asa\u2019s sudden fame led to a meeting last week with President Joko Widodo and a speaking engagement at a prestigious university. She also appeared on numerous news and talk show programs to explain the importance of religious tolerance.But there was a flip side to the fame: Islamic hard-liners reportedly began calling her home in the middle of the night, threatening to kill her. She is now being protected by a local moderate Muslim militia.\u201cThank God there is still a young generation like Afi,\u201d Joko Anwar, a prominent film director, said in a Twitter post, referring to Ms. Asa by her nickname.But even before her meeting with the president was scheduled, reports had begun to emerge that the feel-good story of Ms. Asa was not what it appeared, and that she had plagiarized popular posts from other social media users\u2019 accounts.\u201cIt\u2019s exactly like Ahok who won\u2019t ever admit he\u2019s wrong,\u201d the post said, referring to Mr. Basuki by his nickname.A Facebook account bearing the name Mita Handayani, which Ms. Asa had been accused of plagiarizing from, said on social media that she had no problem with Ms. Asa\u2019s using her writing. Ms. Mita added that she thought Ms. Asa was merely being targeted for her religious tolerance.The lightning rise and potential fall of the East Javanese teenager has led Indonesians to reflect on why they had elevated a small-town high school student to the status of national hero so quickly. And it ignited an online debate in Indonesia about how serious the offense of plagiarism was, and whether it should be forgiven.Pradewi Tri Chatami, 30, a recent college graduate, posted on Facebook that the recent triumph of hard-line Islamic groups in Jakarta meant that progressive Indonesians were looking for anyone willing to stand up for pluralism.\u201cIt\u2019s a scramble to find an icon,\u201d Ms. Pradewi said in a telephone interview. \u201cI liked her because she was a sophisticated young woman who was brave enough to share her thoughts. But to idolize someone is ultimately to sacrifice them.\u201dSocial media is extremely popular among middle-class Indonesians, drawing an estimated 80 million users to sites like Facebook and Twitter in this country of about 250 million.Ross Tapsell, a researcher on the Indonesian media at Australian National University, said middle-class Indonesians regularly made folk heroes out of less-advantaged Indonesians they discovered on social media, only to be disappointed later.But when journalists eventually interviewed the newly legendary satay seller, he said the reason he kept selling his beef after the attack was that if he abandoned his stand it might have been stolen.\u201cHis reaction actually told us about poverty,\u201d Mr. Tapsell said.Similarly, he said, many Indonesians put Ms. Asa \u201con a pedestal\u201d and were disappointed when she turned out to be less perfect than they had imagined.\u201cThe middle class has only themselves to blame for making out this 18-year-old from Banyuwangi something she wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said, referring to Ms. Asa\u2019s hometown.Ms. Asa did not respond to calls or Facebook messages seeking comment.Savic Ali, a progressive Muslim activist who runs websites for Nahdlatul Ulama, the nation\u2019s largest Muslim organization, said that when he met Ms. Asa in Banyuwangi, she had struck him as a fairly typical teenager, one who preferred listening to her headphones over conversation.He said he was impressed that Ms. Asa had the bravery to post the things she did, even if not all the words were necessarily hers originally.\u201cThe majority of people aren\u2019t brave enough to raise their voices even though they actually disagree with the views of hard-liners,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile here\u2019s this teenager who feels no such burden.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "National Politics Hang Over Tuesday\u2019s New Jersey Primary", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byMONTCLAIR, N.J. \u2014 The African-American heritage parade on Saturday here drew to a momentary standstill. Philip D. Murphy, a Democratic candidate for governor, was darting back and forth across the street, responding to endless calls for handshakes, hugs and selfies.Just in front of him was Jim Johnson, another Democratic candidate, who had barely broken a sweat after jogging nearly the entire route, so he could stop for hugs and handshakes as the parade wound through his hometown.\u201cPeople don\u2019t forget when you shake their hands,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, as he stood wearing a Rosa Parks shirt, a singular \u201cNah\u201d quote stretched across the front. He added, \u201cIt was the hugs that slowed us down, it wasn\u2019t the handshakes.\u201dWith New Jersey set to vote on Tuesday in the nation\u2019s first statewide primary election since the 2016 election, the candidates vying to replace Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, were bounding around the state all weekend, holding multiple events each day and making their closing arguments to voters. From festivals to parades to train platforms to strolls along the iconic Jersey Shore boardwalk, the candidates promised bold changes to a state plagued by high taxes, an exodus of jobs, mounting debt, a troubled transportation network and nearly a dozen credit downgrades under Mr. Christie.But amid the final frenzied blitz of political activity, a strong sense of voter apathy still hung over the campaign. Despite the unique position in the political calendar that New Jersey holds and a mobilized progressive wing marching and protesting President Donald J. Trump in the streets week after week, voters have so far not truly embraced the election.Here's what matters \u2014 and a few things that don't \u2014 about six candidates vying to replace Gov. Christie.The relative lack of interest from many voters is injecting a small dose of uncertainty into the seeming inevitability of the two candidates who have maintained wire-to-wire leads in polling, Mr. Murphy among Democrats and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno on the Republican side.\u201cWe\u2019re not taking anything for granted,\u201d Ms. Guadagno said in an interview, as she attended a ribbon-cutting for a deli in Towaco, her first of five campaign events on Saturday. She acknowledged in remarks outside the deli that it was looking like a \u201clow turnout\u201d election and repeatedly reminded those scattered on the sidewalk about Tuesday\u2019s voting.In New Jersey, one of the biggest drivers of voter turnout is the county political operations. Through their endorsements, candidates are offered a robust turnout operation, as well as the coveted county line on voting ballots, which most voters will choose when they do not know much about the candidates and want to support the party line.Mr. Murphy has locked up every county line on the Democratic side, giving him a distinct advantage, especially if relatively few voters turn out for the election.\u201cI think in order to beat the county lines, you have to run an exceptional campaign and you have to really become a cause, a Bernie Sanders-like cause, and that has happened in the past certainly in New Jersey races but it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone has been able to do that this time,\u201d said Michael DuHaime, a former chief strategist for Mr. Christie\u2019s campaign for governor and a partner at a consulting firm.Perhaps sensing the need to chip into Mr. Murphy\u2019s lead, the Democratic primary has been filled with attack ads and accusations.John Wisniewski, a state assemblyman, has spent more than $1 million on advertising in the final days of the campaign and has been criticizing Mr. Murphy on a number of topics, accusing him of ethics violations, questioning his progressive credentials and targeting a top aide\u2019s Facebook page.\u201cI have been pretty straightforward on calling issues from the beginning of the campaign \u2014 it\u2019s part of our message to the people that we will speak plainly,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, as he made his way to his campaign\u2019s tent at the end of the parade in Montclair, where his mother, Dr. Byerte Johnson, was holding down the fort.The same late-campaign rhetoric can be found on the Republican side. Ms. Guadagno focused her comments over the weekend on job growth and her dedication to small businesses \u2014 one of her chief tasks as lieutenant governor is acting as the liaison to the business community \u2014 but also contrasting her tax plan with that of her opponent, Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, accusing him of wanting to raise taxes.Mr. Ciattarelli, who spent most of his time on Saturday in southern New Jersey, has surprised many by offering a spirited challenge to the lieutenant governor, charging around the state with a stump speech concentrated on amending the school funding formula as a way to lower state property taxes, the highest in the nation.A former ambassador, a state senator and a lieutenant governor are all in the race.The long shadow of the 2016 election, as well as the constant drama in Washington, may have soured some on local politics, but the candidates were focusing on the national mood heading into Tuesday.And it seems to be working. As he wrapped up his frenzied handshake blitz at the parade\u2019s end, a woman standing on a stage beckoned him over.\u201cMurphy! Mr. Murphy!\u201d she yelled. Eventually, he heard her and jogged over.\u201cWill you help us fire Trump?\u201d she asked.He pulled back and offered a smile. \u201cOh, God help us. We\u2019re doing everything we can.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Keep Your College Admission Offer: Start With Digital Literacy", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byOn CampusThe jokes were posted in the form of memes, those photographs or images overlaid with captions that you see everywhere on the internet. That young people post offensive memes on Facebook is not news. What\u2019s unique about this situation is that Harvard found out about incoming students who were doing so and retracted their admission, sending a strong message that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.One of the jokes referred to the hypothetical hanging of a \u201cMexican kid\u201d in the school bathroom as \u201cpi\u00f1ata time.\u201d Another, an image of a Pok\u00e9mon lying in bed with an erection, was captioned: \u201cWhen you\u2019re tryna sleep but your neighbor is beating his kids.\u201d Most of the memes could not be printed or explained in this newspaper.This situation is a stark reminder of our collective failing to teach the first generation of digital natives \u2014 those who were born and raised on high-speed internet \u2014 that there are real-life consequences for virtual actions.Since Facebook became widely available, incoming freshman classes have connected with one another in Facebook groups before arriving on campus. Each graduating class usually has its own group. But splinter groups also form, and meme groups with names like \u201cYale Memes for Special Snowflake Teens\u201d or \u201cMIT Memes for Intellectual Beings and Spicy Memelords\u201d are especially popular right now. The group that got the would-be Harvard students in trouble was a private meme group that only students who posted provocative memes could join.You almost have to feel bad for these kids. They don\u2019t realize: \u201cPrivacy\u201d ain\u2019t privacy anymore. It just means your mom might not know about something you did immediately after you did it.A few years ago I started teaching workshops to high school and college students about the importance of maintaining a clean digital reputation. I wanted to ensure that they learned that the things you type, post and share behind a computer screen can still impact your life.I am of the bridge generation that remembers life before social media permeated everything, but cannot imagine life without it now. I was a sophomore at the University of Illinois in 2004, the year \u201cTheFacebook\u201d launched and was made available to college students who went to Ivy League and Big 10 schools. I signed up for the new social network, and never looked back (except shadily) at BlackPlanet or Myspace.When I graduated from college in 2006, I went into marketing and ended up introducing the organizations I worked for to social media. It turned out these platforms we kids were all loitering on could be used for business! It was perfect for my next move. I got a job as a marketing coordinator at a nonprofit that taught other nonprofits how to tell their stories through social media and on the web. My position expanded: I started coaching and teaching social media strategy.A year into my job, I found out from my boss how he\u2019d decided to hire me for the role. He was down to two candidates who were equally qualified but I had the cleaner online reputation, meaning that nothing weird came up when he Googled my name.Today\u2019s young\u2019uns \u2014 would we call them Generation Z? \u2014 have more than just a few years of a digital trail. They were born into the technology age, and all they know is fast internet. This means, of course, that they will never know the trials and tribulations of leaving your computer on overnight so you could download a single song from Kazaa. They probably don\u2019t even know what Kazaa is. But they are in the most danger in terms of their digital reputations: They can be made or broken from the permanent digital record of actions they don\u2019t even fully understand.In my workshops for young adults, the most important thing I emphasize is that anything posted online, no matter how private they think it is, is permanent.Then I tell them how they can avoid pitfalls and big mistakes, while still staying true to themselves. I am in a great position to do that, as I make my living as a cultural critic who doesn\u2019t shy away from speaking up and out. You do not have to be an incredibly sanitized or boring version of yourself online, I tell them. You can still show the most colorful, funny side of who you are, without embarrassing your family\u2019s good name. But if you wouldn\u2019t want something you posted to end up on a jumbotron in Times Square, DO NOT POST IT.With that advice, provocative memes, and that act of keyboard courage it takes to post them, become a little less attractive.Digital literacy couldn\u2019t have helped kids who thought referring to a Mexican child as pi\u00f1ata was funny \u2014 that\u2019s a much deeper issue that falls on the shoulders of their families and communities. Jokes like the ones that were shared in the private group of would-be Harvard students went well beyond provocative and well into the territory of hate speech. But for your average teen, a quick class in the rules of online conduct could mean the difference between a youthful indiscretion kept private and a life derailed by immaturity that became public.Digital media literacy is just as important as financial literacy now: Who we appear to be online can significantly impact earning power. This isn\u2019t just a lesson for young adults. Adults are certainly making these same mistakes. But if we can teach high school and college students these lessons now, we can better prevent them from stumbling. And prevention is always better than treatment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 25 Best Films of the 21st Century So Far.", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "We are now approximately one-sixth of the way through the 21st century, and thousands of movies have already been released. Which means that it\u2019s high time for the sorting \u2013 and the fighting \u2013 to start. As the chief film critics of The Times, we decided to rank, with some help from cinema savants on Facebook, the top 25 movies that are destined to be the classics of the future. While we\u2019re sure almost everyone will agree with our choices, we\u2019re equally sure that those of you who don\u2019t will let us know.The film offers a profound and deeply unsettling vision of the country, but it\u2019s also a testament to one of this nation\u2019s sublime achievements: the movies. The story creeps alive in 1898 with Plainview digging in a hole like a primordial creature, a sequence that invokes the dawn-of-man opener in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d A brilliant two and a half hours later, \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d closes around 1927 by making good on its ominous title (it\u2019s a gusher!) and nodding at \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d a masterwork that ushered in a new American cinematic age.That opening sequence lasts almost 15 minutes before the first line of dialogue is uttered, and it sets the table (or stirs the milkshake) for the many bravura set pieces that follow, like the explosion of the drilling rig midway through. The grandeur of Mr. Anderson\u2019s vision is matched by the precision of his technique. At no moment do you doubt that anything happened exactly how he is showing it, even as he takes abundant liberty with the historical record and his literary source (Upton Sinclair\u2019s novel \u201cOil!\u201d). But you are also aware of his artistic self-confidence, and the way he has marshaled the talents of his cast and collaborators (notably the cinematographer Robert Elswit and the composer Jonny Greenwood) in the service of his ideas.I never tire of thinking about \u201cThere Will Be Blood.\u201d But every time I watch it, I find it outruns all my thoughts. Not many films do that.It\u2019s a creation story about love and labor \u2013 Plainview\u2019s and Mr. Anderson\u2019s \u2013 one tragic, the other glorious. Among everything else that \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d takes on is a question that rests, I think, at the heart of the United States: how could something as astonishing as the movies (or democracy) emerge amid so much horror?Many years later as a young adult I saw \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d and it moved me to tears. I mean, I basically couldn\u2019t stop crying at the beauty and the enormous feat of capturing the innocence of being a child. I immediately chased down everything he had done. The way they describe him as the Disney of the East I think is a tremendous misnomer: Miyazaki\u2019s all his own.In \u201cSpirited Away\u201d you have a girl right at the threshold of becoming a young woman and leaving her childhood behind, figuratively and literally. Chihiro starts the narrative as a child, the way she sits, the way we first meet her sitting on the seat of the car, legs up, it\u2019s completely childish. She evolves from her poise, dress, attitude, emotion and spirituality from being a child to being a young woman and coming into her own, and in that position she has to go through the loss of everything. She loses her parents, she loses her name, she\u2019s called nothing, she\u2019s called Sen, she\u2019s called zero. There\u2019s a beautiful, very melancholic meditation \u2013 the same melancholy that permeates all Miyazaki\u2019s films.Miyazaki has an approach to making monsters that is unique. They are completely new in design, but they feel rooted in ancient lore. They seem to represent primal forces and, in many cases, spirits that are rooted to the earth, to the wind, to the water. They are very elemental.He always looks for grace or power, and he can use power for good guys and bad guys equally, and he can use grace for destructive monsters or beneficial monsters. That\u2019s the beauty of him. He understands that one of the essential things is to not seek anything good because by definition something will then become bad. Do not seek anything beautiful because by definition something then becomes ugly.Of course I have a huge kinship with Miyazaki. The same sense of loss and melancholy and tragedy is what I tried to do in \u201cDevil\u2019s Backbone\u201d or \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth.\u201d There is a moment in which beauty moves you in a way that is impossible to describe. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s a fabrication, it\u2019s that it\u2019s an artistic act and you know nothing you will encounter in the natural world will be that pure. Miyazaki has that power.But Mr. Eastwood has always been most at home in the classic American film genres: the western, the crime flick, the combat picture. And, in this case, the boxing movie, perhaps the most susceptible to sentimentality and clich\u00e9. The glory of \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d is that rather than strain for novelty, it settles into the conventions of the genre with masterly confidence and ease, and discovers deep currents and grace notes of feeling that nobody had noticed before.Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank each won Oscars for their performances. Mr. Freeman plays a former fighter nicknamed Scrap who acts as the confidant and conscience of Mr. Eastwood\u2019s Frankie Dunn. Frankie is a trainer haunted by ghosts and regrets who takes a chance on an ambitious young fighter named Maggie Fitzgerald (Ms. Swank).If for some unfathomable reason you haven\u2019t yet seen \u201cMillion Dollar Baby,\u201d I won\u2019t spoil the plot by saying any more. But if you have seen it, you know that there\u2019s much more to this movie than its plot. The warm, sharp banter among the principal characters never gets old. The images, shot by Mr. Eastwood\u2019s longtime cinematographer, Tom Stern, glow with unexpressed, somber feeling. Fifty years from now, as the end credits scroll on whatever screen viewers are watching on, they will reach the same conclusion my editor did back in 2004. This is what a movie looks like.Zhao Tao, Mr. Jia\u2019s wife and frequent star, plays Xiao Yu, a young receptionist at a sauna. It\u2019s immediately clear that she\u2019s having a rough go of it. She\u2019s in an affair with a married man and his wife not only knows it, but one evening assaults Xiao Yu with the help of two thugs. Like all the sections, this one is largely a slice of brute naturalism spiked with beguilingly surrealistic moments, many involving animals. The overall mood is one of escalating, palpable unease.Xiao Yu\u2019s chapter culminates not long after she\u2019s been beaten and has knocked off work for the day. She carries some water to a small, dimly lit room lined with palm-frond wallpaper. The palm fronds evoke the natural world that keeps creeping and slithering throughout the movie, and also suggests a realm its characters are nearly cut off from. There, all alone, Xiao Yu begins washing blood from her shirt when a man abruptly opens the door, demanding that she give him a massage. She explains that she\u2019s not a masseuse and shuts the door. He returns \u2013 she shoos him off \u2013 and then he returns with a second man.We\u2019ve seen the second guy before; he\u2019s a local thug. He too demands a massage \u2013 \u201cwe can afford you,\u201d he says \u2013 and once again Xiao Yu declines. \u201cI\u2019m not a prostitute,\u201d she says. \u201cGo home to your wives.\u201d She shuts the door, but the second guy bursts in. \u201cI\u2019m having you!\u201d he exclaims, pushing her down hard. She stands; he pushes her down. She stands again; he pushes her down again. She\u2019s strong, stubborn and as unreadable as Clint Eastwood\u2019s Man With No Name. Then the thug hits her head with a stack of bills and keeps hitting her, once, twice, three times, four, 20, 30 \u2013 he keeps hitting her as her cheeks redden. She looks at him silently, and then turns away.A sudden cut to a raised arm with knife clutched in the hand changes the violence, the mood and the realism. Mr. Jia may have taken his inspiration from contemporary China, but here he also borrows from King Hu\u2019s \u201cA Touch of Zen,\u201d a 1971 martial arts classic. All at once, a scene of ugly, recognizably and disturbingly real violence turns into an interlude of stylized violence with sharp editing, exaggerated gestures and images \u2013 a close-up of the knife in a fist \u2013 bordering on the hieroglyphic. One minute, the only red is that coloring Xiao Yu\u2019s flushed cheeks; the next, a man has been sliced open and an ordinary woman has become the hero of her own story.And that\u2019s still true. Mr. Puiu\u2019s film was an early sign of the flowering of Romanian cinema that would bring international acclaim to young auteurs like Cristian Mungiu (\u201c4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\u201d) and Corneliu Porumboiu (\u201cPolice, Adjective\u201d). Like his colleagues (and sometime rivals), Mr. Puiu uses long takes and minimal camera movement to create a sense of lived reality that is absorbing almost to the point of claustrophobia. He zeroes in remorselessly on the petty absurdities and large iniquities that define life in Romania more than a decade after the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu\u2019s Communist dictatorship.But though this is an intensely local experience, it opens up and reverberates far beyond the streets, tenements and emergency rooms of Bucharest. The title might remind you of Willy Loman, which is no accident. Poor Mr. Lazarescu is his own kind of Everyman, caught not in the shiny wheels of midcentury American capitalism but in the rusty gears of Eastern European bureaucracy and the detritus of his own bad decisions. He is imperiled by the arrogance and indifference of the powerful \u2013 the doctors and hospital bureaucrats so entranced by their own authority that they are blind to his suffering.An ambulance driver, played by the great Romanian stage actress Luminita Gheorghiu, becomes Lazarescu\u2019s advocate and ally, the one person able to insist, heroically and in vain, that attention must be paid to this man. This movie is a harrowing and darkly humorous metaphysical fable disguised as a slice-of-life tragedy.The action circulates through the high-rises and busy streets of Taipei, interrupted by a trip to Tokyo. To invoke the clich\u00e9 that the cities themselves are characters in the films would be to understate their significance. The character of modern cities \u2013 spaces of loneliness and intimacy, where the shiny global future rests on a buried bedrock of local tradition \u2013 is among Mr. Yang\u2019s main themes. And few artists in any medium have matched his ability to examine contemporary urban life from all sides. The title of this movie is translated as \u201ca one and a two.\u201d It keeps on going to infinity.Some people responded with top fives or Solomonic hairsplitting (\u201cWall-E\u201d is the best, but \u201cCars\u201d is the most fun.\u201d) Others equivocated and changed their minds. Nearly all of the 14 features released under the Pixar label since 2000 garnered passionate defenses. We found ourselves agreeing with many of them, and zeroing in on exquisite moments from at least a half-dozen films: the wordless story of Carl and Ellie\u2019s marriage in \u201cUp\u201d; the first meeting of Wall-E and Eve; Andy\u2019s farewell at the end of \u201cToy Story 3\u201d; Anton Ego\u2019s review of the titular vermin-prepared dish in in \u201cRatatouille.\u201d And what about \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d? \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d? \u201cMonsters, Inc.\u201d? How could we pick just one?Manohla Dargis asked Mr. Linklater about making the film. Here are edited excerpts from his comments:People would just tout the connection they had to it. \u201cOh, my daughter just went off to college or my son went off to college\u201d or \u201cI just went off to college. I saw your movie and I called my mom and told her that I now realize what she was going through.\u201d We all go through the world trapped in our story, our own point of view. But a film can really enforce those other points of view \u2013 that\u2019s storytelling power.One of the sons (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier) is a businessman living in China with his family. His sister (a wonderfully abrasive Juliette Binoche) is an artist in New York. They and their nostalgic brother (Charles Berling) are saying goodbye not only to the old country house, but also to the idea of France they have cherished and taken for granted. Mr. Assayas, acutely aware of his status as part of the post-1968 generation, brings a sense of history to all of his movies. This one, though, may be his most prescient. Also: mom had excellent taste in stuff.That this violence is also self-annihilating is an anguished truth in \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d which is set in and around Baghdad during the war in Iraq the year after the American invasion. The story tracks three members of an army explosive ordnance disposal squad that disarms roadside bombs. The story\u2019s axis point is the squad\u2019s volatile team leader, Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), whose expertise has morphed into a ghastly mania. He doesn\u2019t just take avoidable risks \u2013 sweat cascading off him, an exasperated James removes his protective bomb suit while trying to disarm an explosive \u2013 he rushes right at them.War has given James a job to do, and he\u2019s very, very good at it. War gives him rank, status, camaraderie (at times begrudging) and, ostensibly, a purpose. War has also destroyed James, though not literally and certainly not in the way most movies teach us when they show the catastrophe of war, with their perfected heroic gestures and narratives of noble sacrifice. James\u2019s death isn\u2019t remotely spectacular or inspiring; it doesn\u2019t arrive with a bullet. It is instead the slowest of living deaths, one that eats away at him with everyday horror that is as unvarying and familiar as the ticking of all those bombs.The French director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut once said, \u201cEvery film about war ends up being pro-war.\u201d I wish he had lived long enough to see \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d a movie that is antiwar not because it offers an easy critique of war but because it reminds us of how human beings need war, how they live for war as intensely as die for it. Ms. Bigelow, who directed from a script by Mark Boal, told me by email that they faced the challenges of making it with as much honesty as they could. \u201cThe Iraq war,\u201d she added, \u201cwas painfully underreported at the time \u2013 I looked at the film as a form of journalism, felt that more information was needed for this highly contested military engagement.\u201dThe academy favored \u201cNo Country,\u201d of course \u2013 the only one of the Coens\u2019 films to nab a best picture statuette \u2013 but much as we admire the dexterity they brought to adapting Cormac McCarthy\u2019s novel, we were more moved and intrigued by the metaphysics of \u201cA Serious Man\u201d and the melancholy of \u201cInside Llewyn Davis.\u201d We vacillated between the two. We asked the Coens themselves to pick a favorite (to no avail). We looked for messages carved into our teeth and encoded in the lyrics of old folk songs.One memorable woman walks through the streets, head uncovered, a long piece of fabric trailing her like a queenly train. She seems regally impervious to the jihadists, who, even as they casually break Shariah law, try to police the locals. Music is forbidden, as are cigarettes and soccer. One young man who defies the ban on the game is sentenced to 20 lashes. But the human imagination isn\u2019t as easy to imprison and in a lyrical scene, boys joyfully play soccer with a make-believe ball as two jihadists on a motorcycle circle the dusty field, momentarily defeated.In time, the story settles on Kidane, a Muslim who lives near Timbuktu with his wife, Satima, and their daughter in a small, peaceful kingdom on the dunes. Many of the family\u2019s neighbors have fled after the jihadist invasion, but the violence seems to have passed over Kidane until one day it comes down on him with a vengeance. During a dispute with a fisherman Kidane fires a gun. He\u2019s brought to trial before a jihadist jury, which mercilessly sets about enacting Shariah law.\u201cTimbuktu\u201d is a tragic movie but not a nihilistic one. Mr. Sissako doesn\u2019t shy away from showing violence, but he never sensationalizes any of the horrors. Instead, he answers those atrocities with visual beauty and moments of everyday joy and pleasure that, as the story unfolds, register as acts of artistic resistance. He also insists on humanizing the jihadists, as when an older man vainly directs a younger one on how to deliver a speech for a propaganda video. (\u201cYour speech is not convincing.\u201d) It\u2019s an extraordinary scene, at once absurd and believable, and a reminder of the truth that it is people, not faceless monsters, who commit these horrors.How did you discover Claire Denis\u2019s films? What specifically draws you to her work? Watching the performances in her movies, you can just feel the freedom she gives her actors. She creates an entire world for them to behave in. And I think having such wide parameters to capture things from means her movies can be built from an enormous amount of incremental details rather than a narrow narrative thrust. Her movies feel like waves building and breaking.What does Isabelle Huppert bring to the character of Maria Vial?She plays a character that seems to live steadfastly in her faith and imagination and yet still feels so human, accessible and raw.Is Huppert our greatest living actress?It\u2019s difficult to think of someone who\u2019s better.And that only multiplied the ambiguity. While nobody was eager to go to bat for \u201cIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\u201d or \u201cThe BFG,\u201d there were fans who embraced the buoyancy of \u201cCatch Me if You Can,\u201d the kineticism of \u201cThe Adventures of Tintin,\u201d the dystopian terror of \u201cMinority Report\u201d and the evil-E.T. action of \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201dMr. Hou\u2019s influence extends far and wide. Among his admirers is Barry Jenkins, whose \u201cMoonlight\u201d won the Academy Award for best picture this year and was partly inspired by \u201cThree Times.\u201d He shared his thoughts with A.O. Scott via email. Here are excerpts:On seeing the film:On Hou Hsiao-hsien\u2019s place in cinema:I\u2019m here at Cannes at the moment, and a phrase I keep hearing is \u201cbeyond cinema.\u201d Hou Hsiao-hsien is beyond cinema. I mean that not in the sense that his formalism is antiquated or de rigueur, but more to accentuate the synesthetic quality of his work. His craft is as evocative as any of the more brawny stylists we revere as auteurs, but the effect it arrives at is much more delicate, elusive by nature.How \u201cThree Times\u201d influenced \u201cMoonlight\u201d:The structure of \u201cThree Times\u201d is the sole impetus for the structure of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d The source material the film originated from was not in triptych form. Beyond that, this idea of a delicate treatment of roiling emotions, of interiority translated through external imagery (and SOUND) rather than interior monologue, these things I kept in heart and head as \u201cMoonlight\u201d evolved into the film that it is.The director Agn\u00e8s Varda \u2013 the \u201cI\u201d of the film\u2019s English title \u2013 counts herself as part of this informal tribe. A genial, inquisitive on-screen presence, she collects images and anecdotes that would otherwise be too easily neglected. The result is a documentary that is difficult to characterize and impossible to forget. Though it can feel charmingly miscellaneous \u2013 a free-associative tour of its maker\u2019s mind and sensibility \u2013 it has an unmistakable coherence and rigor, like a museum exhibit or an art installation.Ms. Varda, the only woman permitted entry into the boys\u2019 club of the French new wave, has migrated to the center of a trans-disciplinary, international artistic tendency \u2013 a counter-tradition of critical and creative thinkers that includes her friend and sometime collaborator Chris Marker, the novelist and art critic John Berger, Patti Smith and other artists who defy the usual categories. \u201cThey call me Granny Punk,\u201d Ms. Varda once told me, and she embodies the defiant, anarchic, do-it-yourself ethos of punk rock, past and present.In true punk spirit, \u201cThe Gleaners and I\u201d doubles as a programmatic aesthetic statement and a protest against the way things are. Collecting, interpreting and juxtaposing heterogeneous objects \u2013 paintings, potatoes, seashells, books \u2013 is the approach to art-making closest to the pulse of life. There is no higher purpose than to appreciate the peculiarity and uniqueness of people, places and moments, and the things we gather around us are symbols of that appreciation. But the tide of commerce renders our experience as disposable as the junk we toss away, leaving us at once glutted with stuff and starved for meaning.That\u2019s certainly true of movies. There are so many of them, and they come and go so quickly that it\u2019s easy to lose sight of how and why they matter. \u201cThe Gleaners and I\u201d is precious because it\u2019s a perfect example of its own argument \u2013 a small thing of nearly incalculable value.Tough questions! And while film scholars may differ, our standards are fairly inclusive. There needs to be a lot of chasing, and a lot of stuff has to blow up. That can happen in outer space, in Gotham, at Hogwarts, on the freeways of Los Angeles or in whatever global capital poor Jason Bourne happens to be running through when his enemies catch sight of him.Do you need to ask why? O.K. fine. Because George Miller is an old-school choreographer of chaos, favoring practical effects over their digital counterparts. Also because the movie drags the snarling, anti-authoritarian, punk-rock wit of the first \u201cMad Max\u201d movies into a new era, updating and conserving in a single gesture. And finally because in Imperator Furiosa, Charlize Theron\u2019s one-handed, buzz-cut, kohl-eyed avenger, the movies that famously didn\u2019t need another hero found the one we all needed.How did you first come to work with Kelly Reichardt?Was there a challenge for you in getting into that character?Kelly is very clear about what she wants. She is a really easy collaborator because she is so precise, so things happen very quickly. You understand the place and the person very quickly because she\u2019s very specific about what she wants. She\u2019s still open. I would shoot her ideas and she would say, \u201cCome back in a week when you\u2019ve honed that thing down from your garish, stupid, big idea to something that I might actually like, Michelle.\u201dI find Kelly\u2019s characters get to maintain a lot of dignity and self-respect because they aren\u2019t always giving themselves away. And I find that kind of tricky. It\u2019s an incredibly fine line to walk. Is anybody going to know me? Is anybody going to understand who I am as this person? Are they going to care? Is there going to be a there, there?And for Kelly\u2019s language, for her sensibility, there is. These characters don\u2019t feel compelled to explain themselves. You have to sort of train your ear and your eye and get to know them slowly. It\u2019s like not sleeping with someone on the first date when you watch her movies. You\u2019re like, let me take a little time to get to know you and absorb you.\u201cWendy and Lucy\u201d came out at the end of 2008, right in the middle of the election campaign and the economic collapse. There\u2019s a powerful sense that while the movie is very much about this one young woman and her situation, it\u2019s also about a lot more than that.All of Kelly\u2019s movies are political, but you would have to maybe have been told that to be aware of it. She\u2019s able to slip it into everything she does, but it\u2019s never didactic or heavy-handed. It\u2019s an essential part of who Kelly is. She\u2019s interested in a lot of genres, but the backbone of it is, how do people get along? How do people get by?Where have you been, my blue-eyed son? Where have you been, my darling young one?I was riding on the Mayflower, when I thought I spied some land. I yelled to Captain A-Rab, I\u2019ll have you understand. Who came running to the deck and said, \u201cBoys, forget the whale. We\u2019re going over yonder! Cut the engine! Raise the sail!\u201dOnce upon a time, you dressed so fine, you threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn\u2019t you?Someone\u2019s got it in for me. They\u2019re spreading stories in the press. Whoever it is I wish they\u2019d cut it out quick. But when they will, I can only guess.With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace, and your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace, and your basement clothes and your hollow face \u2013 Who among them can think he could outguess you?I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes. And for that one moment I could be you. Yeah \u2013 I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes. You\u2019d know what a drag it is to see you.How many roads must a man walk down, before you call him a man?I\u2019m out here a thousand miles from my home. Walking a road other men have gone down. I\u2019m seeing a world of people and things. Of paupers and peasants and princes and kings.Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute. No, I wasn\u2019t very cute to him, was I?You might like to eat caviar. You might like to eat bread. You might be sleeping on a floor. You might be sleeping in a feather bed. But you\u2019re going to have to serve somebody.You know something is happening here but you don\u2019t know what it is. Do you, Mr. Jones?There\u2019s too much confusion. I can\u2019t get no relief.Oh, I\u2019m sailing away my own true love. I\u2019m sailing away in the morning. Is there something I can send you from across the sea, from the place that I\u2019ll be landing?I\u2019ve got to get back into my hotel room. I\u2019ve got me a date with Botticelli\u2019s niece. She promised she\u2019d be there with me, when I paint my masterpiece.It opens with an astonishing sequence that inaugurates a new day, a dawning that \u2013 as blackness filled with whirring and cawing gives way to light \u2013 suggests opening theater curtains. The constant presence of the natural world gives the movie a vaguely documentary feel as does the unforced sincerity of the nonprofessional performers, who primarily speak in Plautdietsch, a German dialect the Mennonites brought with them. At the same time, the dialect, the family\u2019s modest clothes, austerity and piety give them a near-otherworldly quality.Over the course of the movie, Johan and Esther\u2019s marriage badly frays, yet even as it does Mr. Reygadas underscores their intimacy with each other and their children, a sense of togetherness that gradually includes us. Much of what Mr. Reygadas does \u2013 both narratively and visually \u2013 seems intended to draw you close to his characters, to look intently into the faces framed inside his lingering close-ups. Their relative isolation means that we\u2019re often alone with Johan, Esther and their children, which further deepens our connection to them.Looking is critical here. Mr. Reygadas doesn\u2019t provide the usual cinematic signposts: no score to cue tears or speeches. Characters instead act and speak much as people do in life. This palpable realism is deepened by scenes of the family\u2019s ordinary habits. In one ravishing sequence, the family bathes semi-clothed in an outdoor pool surrounded by green foliage, a paradisal interlude that\u2019s disturbed when Esther begins crying. After Johan suggests they swim, Mr. Reygadas narrows in on a blurred image that steadily comes into focus, revealing a wild orchid.Mr. Reygadas wants us to see this orchid and see it deeply, so that we grasp its fragile beauty and, importantly, its impermanence. This reminder of life\u2019s transience connects to two moments that bookend the story: the first, at the start, when someone stops a ticking clock, and the second, near the end, when someone else winds it up again. With the stopped clock, Mr. Reygadas reminds us that there are other rhythms to live by, including the rising and setting sun. He is also suggesting, I think, that there\u2019s something timeless \u2013 eternal \u2013 about the love that fills this movie and leads to its startling, last-minute resurrection.With a few notable exceptions \u2013 the first \u201cBridget Jones\u201d movie; \u201cCrazy, Stupid, Love\u201d and (heaven help us) \u201cLove Actually\u201d \u2013 readers gravitated more to melodrama than rom-com, and favored stories of loss and longing rather than happily ever after. It\u2019s striking how many of the great love stories of our era are really breakup stories, meditations on love\u2019s mutability rather than its permanence. Even the most recent romantic conversation piece, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d is about a relationship that can\u2019t survive the pull of professional ambition and the play of chance (though in that case, the problem may also be the state of heterosexual romance). \u201c(500) Days of Summer,\u201d which several readers mentioned, is also about a romance that doesn\u2019t quite work out. The same is true of \u201cHer\u201d and the French lesbian coming-of-age story, \u201cBlue Is the Warmest Color.\u201dDisappointment is more satisfying than fulfillment. We like movies about great love affairs that never quite happen as well as those that flare up and flame out. \u201cOnce\u201d and \u201cLost in Translation\u201d made strong showings. And it might be that lustrous images of unrequited longing are better than sex.And the winner of our survey \u2013 by critical fiat as well as popular acclaim \u2013 is a movie that combines laughter and melancholy, nostalgia and hope. It\u2019s a movie about how you never forget your first love, unless you have a mad scientist with a fluky homemade gadget to help you out. It\u2019s also about how desire and loss are inseparable, and about how the yearning to clean the slate and start over is just another case of eternal recurrence.Antoine Fuqua, Sofia Coppola, Paul Feig, Denis Villeneuve, Brett Ratner and Alex Gibney share their highly personal lists.Produced by Alicia DeSantis, Stephanie Goodman, Mekado Murphy, Matt Ruby and Rumsey TaylorAn earlier version of this article misidentified a cast member of \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\u201d He is Elijah Wood, not Orlando Bloom.An\u00a0article\u00a0last Sunday about Times film critics\u2019 picks for the 25 best films of the 21st century so far included a quotation from the director Guillermo del Toro that described incorrectly a scene in \u201cPuss in Boots.\u201d The scene was animated by the Japanese anime master Hayao Miyazaki and Otsuka Yasuo, not by Isao Takahata.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ingredient Yotam Ottolenghi Can\u2019t Do Without", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byThere are 10 or so things in my kitchen that I can\u2019t do without. Olive oil and lemons. Red wine vinegar and tomatoes, when they\u2019re in season. Coffee to start the day. Wine, bread, cheese and chocolate to end it. Tahini is there, too, ready to be drizzled on toast or whisked into a sauce or dressing.If I were to lay these things out on my table, tahini might be, to many, the odd one out. For all of the other ingredients, there\u2019s a real range in quality that is widely accepted and understood. It\u2019s the difference between presliced industrial white bread and handmade sourdough; between instant coffee and freshly ground beans; between run-of-the-mill vinegar and one that perfectly balances fruit and acidity. Or think of Sicilian unwaxed lemons, single-origin chocolate and artisanal cheese. We can draw a line between these more rarefied items and their mass-market counterparts.But tahini? That jar sitting at the back of the cupboard, its contents split in two, with a layer of oil sitting on top of packed sesame paste? That jar you reach for to make hummus or baba ghanouj, its packaging timeless, rooted in the health food shop circa 1970?For me, however, and everyone else who grew up in the Middle East, tahini is as loved and revered a staple as olive oil or wine. And, as with oil and wine, the variables for making exceptional tahini are wide and many.Unlike Greek or Cypriot tahini, which I find to be claggy and bitter, tahini from the Middle East is creamy enough to pour over porridge, nutty enough to spread on toast, and smooth enough to eat by the spoon. Its color can range from a light beige to a very deep red, depending on how long the seeds are roasted. It will still separate when it\u2019s left to sit, yes, with the oil rising to the top, but it comes together very smoothly when stirred.Rare is the dish not improved with a drizzle of tahini sauce, made from simply mixing raw tahini with some lemon juice, water, garlic and salt. Grilled meats and fish, roasted root vegetables, a chopped fresh tomato and cucumber salad: All are enriched by it. A Palestinian main course like lamb siniyah makes a star of tahini, which is poured over cooked lamb and baked in the oven to form a thick and rich crust \u2014 an alternative to the mashed potatoes on top of a shepherd\u2019s pie, if you like.Sweet things also welcome the creamy nuttiness of tahini. As well as baking tahini cookies and cakes, I like to make halvah-studded brownies with tahini swirled through the batter before it goes in the oven. Good tahini is also delicious as is, drizzled over ice cream.A few years ago, I visited the Jebrini company, a small mill in East Jerusalem where tahini has been made for 130 years, to see how it is done. The Jebrini family has been there for decades, and the mill is now run by two brothers, making raw tahini just as their father and grandfather did before them. The pride taken in their product, the care with which it is made, the reverence for the source, process and method: It\u2019s not just hipster baristas with their pour-over brewing methods who take their art seriously.It starts with the sourcing of the sesame seed, the best of which is the coveted humera variety from Ethiopia, which has a real richness that other seeds from Mexico and India can lack. From there, it\u2019s all about the way the seeds are hulled and roasted, and then, crucially, the old millstones used to grind them. The basalt millstones at the Jebrini mill, for example, date back 200 years. When tahini is mass-produced, the seeds are not always perfectly peeled (leading to a tahini that is not perfectly smooth), and can be overroasted (which leads to a bitter-tasting tahini) or not roasted at all. If just a few kilograms of tahini are being made each day, however, as at Jebrini, more control can be taken to produce the smoothest, creamiest and least bitter tahini.Getting hold of what I call \u201cproper\u201d tahini \u2014 maybe it needs to be called \u201cartisanal\u201d to gain the kudos it deserves \u2014 outside the Middle East is not as easy as getting hold of either the 1970s style or the Greek or Cypriot varieties, but it is absolutely there to find, for those who want it, in Middle Eastern shops or online. The scale of production at a mill like Jebrini is more for the local market, but look for Al Arz from Israel (which I tend to use), Al Taj from Lebanon or the famous \u201ccamel tahini,\u201d Al-Jamal, from Palestine, with a camel on the label.If what you think of as tahini is not creamy and delicious and nutty enough to eat directly from the jar, then you\u2019re missing a trick.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Think, Just Drink", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byWine SchoolDeliciousness and simplicity can be prized things in a wine. On some occasions, they are all you need and exactly what you want.This may seem like a confusing sentiment for Wine School, which has long taken a stand against the \u201call that matters is what\u2019s in the glass\u201d way of thinking. But the key words here are \u201csome occasions.\u201d It\u2019s our firm belief that every good wine has a time and a place to be the ideal choice.They are the lawn-mower beers of wine, ready to stimulate, energize and invigorate. They provoke physical reactions, and do not leave much room for contemplation.Is that sacrilegious? Only if it\u2019s assumed that wine must be deep, complex and thought-provoking to be praiseworthy. But that\u2019s a narrow view of a wine\u2019s power, or maybe a cramped view of the various roles it can play.Each good wine, regardless of place of origin, style or age, has a moment when it can be the perfect bottle. Part of every wine lover\u2019s education is learning how to identify the occasion and recognize what sort of wine it demands.Of course not. He meant that at certain times, perhaps almost always, the simpler, more easily available bottle is preferable to the rare and precious wine.I mention all this as an act of self-criticism. I should have talked about it earlier, when introducing these thirst-quenching wines, which the English call quaffers and the French, vins de soif. It seemed from many of the comments on this month\u2019s subject that the idea of these wines was not satisfying.I would like to suggest that the problem was not the wines themselves, but the occasion. Drinking them for Wine School created exactly the wrong sort of atmosphere for enjoying these wines.Our way of doing business, in which we drink wines with food in a social setting while paying close attention to the wines and our reactions, did not do these quaffers justice. Why? Because these are the sorts of wines that paradoxically reward inattention.That\u2019s anything but a deficiency.As odd as it may seem, it is difficult to make wine delicious enough to give pleasure but simple enough not to require contemplation. Bottles like these turn wine-drinking into an unconscious activity, which in many ways is an antidote to the self-consciousness that so often governs the American approach to wine.Though we learn about wine by paying attention to it, some moments call for not paying attention to it, just as you can enjoy a meal without analyzing the bread or the meat. I realize now that the questions I asked in introducing these wines created an impossible situation. I essentially told you to examine the wines to determine the qualities that allow you to enjoy them without paying attention to them.I know. It hurts my brain, too.Simplicity itself is not necessarily a virtue. Just as with lawn-mower beers, straightforward wines can run the gamut from insipid to exhilarating. Allow me to extend the beer analogy. When the craft beer movement first gathered momentum, very few brewers wanted to make plain styles like pilsner. That was Budweiser, the enemy. Instead, they turned to the deliciously complex styles that the mass-market brewers had ignored for so long.Eventually, the craft brewers came back to pilsners, learning not only that simple beers were hard to master but also that they could be beautiful in their simplicity.But back to the thirst quenchers. I love drinking these sorts of wines, and adored each of the three wines I recommended: Matthiasson California Tendu 2015, Lapierre Vin de France Raisins Gaulois 2015 and \u00c9ric Texier C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Chat Fou 2014.The grapes were harvested early to maintain freshness, aged in neutral barrels for five months, and bottled without filtering and with no added sulfur dioxide. I found the wine juicy and fruity but not overbearingly so, dry, refreshing and simply delicious.It was a delightful combination, and I didn\u2019t miss a thing.Exactly. They do not have to be the center of attention, though I should say that no wine should ever make you feel guilty.I think that\u2019s an accurate description of these wines. They are just right for those occasions when you don\u2019t feel like paying attention to the depth of the aftertaste.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Cyberattack Was Meant to Paralyze, not Profit, Evidence Shows", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The day started like most for Roman N. Klimenko, an accountant in Kiev who had just settled in at his desk, typing at a computer keyboard and drinking coffee. He was unaware that concealed within his tax preparation software lurked a ticking bomb.Both had the appearance of hacker blackmail assaults known as ransomware attacks: screens of infected computers warn users their data will be destroyed unless ransoms are paid.But in Ukraine\u2019s case, a more sinister motive \u2014 paralysis of the country\u2019s vital computer systems \u2014 may have been at work, cybersecurity experts said on Wednesday. And many Ukrainians cast their suspicions on Russia.Cybersecurity experts based their reasoning partly on having identified the group of Ukrainian users who were initially and improbably targeted: tax accountants.All are required by law to use a tax preparation software such as that made by a Ukrainian company, M.E.Doc. The software that runs on Microsoft Windows-based computers was recently updated. Microsoft issued a statement on Wednesday saying it \u201cnow has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate M.E.Doc updater process.\u201dCybersecurity experts said that whoever launched the assault \u2014 on the eve of a holiday celebrating Ukrainian independence \u2014 must have known that M.E.Doc software, which is integrated into Ukrainian government computers, was their gateway.\u201cYou don\u2019t hit the day before Constitution Day for no reason,\u201d said Craig Williams, the senior technical researcher with the Talos division of Cisco, the American technology company, which helped pinpoint the origin of the Tuesday attack.Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and computer operations at Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, the country\u2019s equivalent to the National Security Agency, said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the money.\u201d\u201cThis attack is about disabling how large companies and governments can operate,\u201d he added. \u201cYou get a double whammy of the initial cyberattack and then organizations being forced to shut down their operations.\u201dFor Mr. Klimenko, the software update seemed to go fine \u2014 until hours later. \u201cThe screen became red,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cA warning appeared, and everything on the hard drive was scrambled.\u201dMr. Klimenko quickly realized he had lost all past-year filings, a catastrophe for an accountant. \u201cNow I cannot confirm that I filed,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t understand what happened.\u201dYet to be determined is the source of the virus. But Russia was seen as the prime suspect because it has been engaged in overt and covert warfare with Ukraine since the 2014 revolution that deposed a Kremlin-friendly government. A Russian role has yet to be proven and may never be. Nevertheless, analysts said on Wednesday that if the attackers\u2019 object was to sow chaos at the highest levels in Ukraine, M.E.Doc provided an ideal way. Its software is not only widely installed at government agencies and banks, but is mandatory at many Ukrainian businesses and government agencies.M.E.Doc said in a statement that it could not confirm whether the virus had been distributed through the update, but that it was \u201ccooperating with Ukraine\u2019s cyberpolice on the investigation.\u201dIn another indication that Ukraine was a prime target, the national police said on Wednesday that more than 1,500 companies had filed complaints or appealed for help because of computer intrusions. That was far more than in other countries, although Russia seemed to be the second-most widely affected.While analysts remained cautious about assigning blame, there was little reticence in official circles in Ukraine, particularly as it became clear that the country was the primary target. The timing was an especially clear sign of political intent, they said.Adding to their suspicions, just a few hours before the computer strike, a Ukrainian military intelligence officer, Maksim Shapoval, was killed by a car bomb in Kiev. It was the latest in a string of assassinations of opponents and critics of Russia in the Ukrainian capital.\u201cWar in cyberspace, seeding fear and horror among millions of personal computer users, and inflicting direct material damage from destabilizing the work of businesses and the state, is just one part of the hybrid war of the Russian empire against Ukraine,\u201d Anton Gerashenko, a member of Parliament, wrote on Facebook. The assassination of Mr. Shapoval is another, he wrote. Mr. Gerashenko called the spread of the virus the \u201cmost massive computer attack in the history of Ukraine.\u201d He said it was only \u201cmasked as an effort to extort money from computer users,\u201d with the real goal economic disruption.The timing of the attack was suspect in another way, coming after a rare stretch of upbeat news in Ukraine. Last week, the European Union waived visa requirements for Ukrainians, at least those few fortunate enough to have the means to travel. That was a euphoric moment for many Ukrainians, some of whom could be seen celebrating with raised fists after gliding through immigration lanes in European airports.President Petro O. Poroshenko met in Washington with President Trump, undermining what politicians here say is an overarching Russian goal of weakening Ukraine by highlighting the incompetence and corruption of the government.The attack also comes in the context of a long-running trade war between Russia and Ukraine, on the sidelines of the actual shooting war in eastern Ukraine between the government and Russian-backed separatists.In recent months, the authorities in Kiev have banned Russian software imports and blocked coal shipments from areas under rebel control. The coal embargo cut off a vital financial lifeline in the east, forcing Russia to take some of the coal.The police have established a computer headquarters with the domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., and Cisco to analyze the attack in hopes of tying it to Russia. Though cybersecurity experts have not linked the malware to any particular state or criminal group, a Russian computer attack targeting Ukraine\u2019s economy would be consistent with the recent economic skirmishing, analysts say.\u201cIf you look at Ukrainian cyberspace, M.E.Doc is an excellent carrier for a virus,\u201d Ivan Lozowy, director of the Institute of Statehood and Democracy, said in a telephone interview. The software is used by businesses large and small, and it can transmit a virus to government computers, where it is designed to file returns. \u201cThe Russians are interested in Ukraine having as many problems as possible,\u201d he said.Mark Scott contributed reporting from Rome, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

She was introduced to them as \u201cBaby Girl.\u201dThe two men quickly took to parenting, and the extra cooking, cleaning and caring that came with it.\u201cSeveral times, I\u2019ve been stopped by men giving me props for taking care of my child,\u201d Mr. Flannagan said on a recent afternoon in Harlem. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how many times it\u2019s happened.\u201dMore than a year into fatherhood, the couple said they hadn\u2019t yet encountered any obstacles that might come with raising a girl.But they do foresee one potential challenge.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about lady parts,\u201d Mr. Flannagan said with a laugh. \u201cI can still teach her, but the only thing I can\u2019t offer her is what it feels like to be a woman.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re able to check all the other boxes,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that a man can\u2019t do that a woman would have done.\u201dSurrounded by friends and family, the couple said, they also are able to offer Avery a stable environment.\u201cWhat it comes down to is making sure that we put our needs second and her needs first,\u201d said Mr. Bugajski.And that part has been easy.\u201cOne day we had her, and then everything changed, and then every day has gotten better,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible,\u201d Mr. Flannagan added. \u201cFatherhood is not for everybody, gay or straight.

I asked my wife if she heard them, too, or if I was hallucinating. I couldn\u2019t believe the man in front of me said them. It wasn\u2019t the message, but the messenger: my father.Who was this impostor? Could it be that this Pakistani-American immigrant, who grills halal lamb chops in boxers and sandals while listening to Sabri Brothers qawwali, had just said this to his almost-3-year-old grandson, Ibrahim?I understand how fatherhood, and grandfatherhood, can profoundly change a man. The joyous burden forces some of us to adjust our career priorities, creates excessive anxiety for tiny people who don\u2019t pay rent and inspires a lifelong goal of trying to become the only man in existence who looks cool driving a Toyota Sienna.But this sentiment from my father was a drastic disruption of a life I had always known.In my 36 years of existence, my parents have never said \u201cI love you\u201d to me or vice versa. We are not an \u201cI love you\u201d family. Years ago, my mother told me \u201cI love you\u201d was for \u201cAmreekans\u201d and \u201cgoras\u201d (white people), which at the time were synonymous, until they realized South Asians and other immigrants had every right to claim the American label as well.On Facebook, I recently asked if other children of immigrants, who are now parents, have witnessed a similar transformation.My old college friend Hooma Multani said some of us were used to a \u201cKlingon-type way of displaying affection\u201d and said her Pakistani father used to pat them on the back really hard instead of dispensing hugs and kisses.\u201cUnconditional love\u201d for some of my immigrant-children friends was as mythical as wearing shoes in the house or talking back to elders. There was always an implicit understanding that love was very conditional, often based on achieving good grades and behaving properly.Many of us grew up with chappal \u2014 sandal \u2014 diplomacy. If you messed up, you would figuratively \u201ceat\u201d the chappal or be threatened with eating the chappal in the near future. Yet here\u2019s this strange man, my father, scolding me on FaceTime for using a firm voice with my son, who was running around naked throwing Lego pieces in the air. \u201cHe is special and very smart,\u201d my father informed me without providing evidence. \u201cYou have to be gentle with him.\u201d If I had thrown a single Lego piece fully clothed, I would have felt diplomacy across my face.When I was growing up, my father did plant big, wet kisses on my cheeks, which I would wipe off with my palms. There were our weekend trips to comic book shops, consistent encouragement for my artistic endeavors, many terms of endearment (\u201cWajoo Baba\u201d \u2014 no one calls me Wajahat in my home) and comparing me to pieces of organ meat in Urdu (it\u2019s a sign of affection).However, there were no \u201cI love yous\u201d or P.T.A. meetings attended.Unlike me, my father didn\u2019t spend two hours with the family on a Thursday night testing a dozen double strollers at Babies \u201cR\u201d Us, after already investing significant time researching different brands and prices. I also have zero memories of my father taking me to hang out with other brown dads wearing their babies in a 360 Baby Carrier at a park on a weekday without any wives present. In fact, if you saw several brown men alone with babies in a playground in the 1980s, you would be excused and applauded for calling the police.My father does notice the difference. He tells me that for his generation it\u2019s a cultural change. When he was young, he said, fathers weren\u2019t expected to sit near their wives or even hold up their kids in public. My grandfather, whom I remember as being affectionate with me, was not \u201cdemonstrative\u201d when my father was growing up. My father doesn\u2019t blame him for his reserve. They were victims of partition, traumatized, forced to migrate to a new country. Even though they were loving, my father said \u201cthey had zero capability\u201d to express their love as we do now.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the words for it in the language,\u201d said my father-in-law, a retired Pakistani-American doctor, meaning there\u2019s no phrase that is the literal equivalent of \u201cI love you\u201d in Urdu or Hindi. He now uses it all the time, not just for his grandchildren, but also with my wife and her siblings. He credits American culture and his kids for helping him learn how to express it.I was thinking about all this recently as I was opening my Ramadan fast with a few friends, all children of immigrants, who are now parents. We were trading stories about how our parents have mellowed with age, softened with our kids and resorted to using Bollywood melodrama when it comes to guilt and discussions of mortality. We realized our parents are old now. Time can\u2019t be taken for granted.None of us had ever told our parents \u201cI love you.\u201d None of us had ever heard it from them.I came home and called my father. I asked him why he never said it. He reasoned you don\u2019t have to say it to show it. Indeed, it\u2019s true, and my privileged life and upbringing was a testament to that.\u201cSometimes people say it so much that it sounds hypocritical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes just words, and words don\u2019t mean anything.\u201dBut some words do have meaning. They don\u2019t have to be hoarded. They don\u2019t need formality. They can and should be given out freely. And it\u2019s a sentiment that makes for a pretty economical gift. I know what I\u2019ll try saying for the first time when I talk to my dad on Father\u2019s Day.Wajahat Ali is a playwright, lawyer and contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Health Care Bill Includes Deep Cuts to Medicaid", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, who for seven years have promised a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, took a major step on Thursday toward that goal, unveiling a bill to make deep cuts in Medicaid and end the law\u2019s mandate that most Americans have health insurance.But the measure landed in rough seas ahead of a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wants next week. Four conservative senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, announced that they would oppose it without changes \u2014 more than enough to bring it down.\u201cIt does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs,\u201d the four wrote in a joint statement.Other Republican senators, like Dean Heller of Nevada and Rob Portman of Ohio, expressed their own qualms, as did AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the Association of American Medical Colleges.But the Senate bill would make subsidies less generous than under current law. It would also lower the annual income limit for receiving subsidies to cover insurance premiums to 350 percent of the poverty level, or about $42,000 for an individual, from 400 percent.Older people could be disproportionately hurt because they pay more for insurance in general. Both chambers\u2019 bills would allow insurers to charge older people five times as much as younger ones; the limit now is three times.The Senate measure, like the House bill, would phase out the extra money that the federal government has provided to states as an incentive to expand eligibility for Medicaid. And like the House bill, it would put the entire Medicaid program on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that now exists.The bill, drafted in secret, is likely to come to the Senate floor next week, and could come to a vote after 20 hours of debate.The premise of the bill, repeated almost daily in some form by its chief author, Mr. McConnell, is that \u201cObamacare is collapsing around us, and the American people are desperately searching for relief.\u201dMr. Trump shares that view, and passage of the Senate bill would move the president much closer to being able to boast about the adoption of a marquee piece of legislation, a feat he has so far been unable to accomplish.Democrats and some insurers say Mr. Trump has sabotaged the Affordable Care Act, in part by threatening to withhold subsidies paid to insurers so they can reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for millions of low-income people.And President Barack Obama, who has been hesitant to speak up on political issues since leaving office, waded into the debate on Thursday, saying the Senate proposal showed a \u201cfundamental meanness.\u201dIn a message to his supporters, Mr. Obama urged people to demand compromise from their lawmakers before senators vote on the Republican bill next week.In the Senate, Democrats are determined to defend a law that has provided coverage to 20 million people and is a pillar of Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. The debate over the repeal bill is shaping up as a titanic political clash, which could have major implications for both parties, affecting their electoral prospects for years to come.A real-time count of every senator\u2019s position.Mr. McConnell faces a great challenge in amassing the votes to win Senate approval of the bill, which Republicans are trying to pass using special budget rules that would allow them to avoid a Democratic filibuster. But with only 52 seats, Mr. McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie.Democrats have assailed Republicans for putting the bill together without a single public hearing or bill-drafting session.Republican leaders still must contend with internal divisions that will be difficult to overcome. Numerous Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid are concerned about how a rollback of the program could affect their constituents, and they face pressure from governors back home.Some Republican senators, like Susan Collins of Maine, said they were waiting for an analysis of the bill to be issued soon by the Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper on Capitol Hill.A comparison of the Senate health care with the Affordable Care Act.Under the Senate bill, the federal government would continue paying crucial subsidies to health insurance companies through 2019, alleviating the uncertainty caused by litigation and by mixed signals from the Trump administration. Without this money, many insurers have said, they will sharply increase premiums or pull out of the marketplaces in many states.The Senate bill would also cap overall federal spending on Medicaid: States would receive a per-beneficiary allotment of money. The federal payments would grow more slowly than under the House bill starting in 2025. Alternatively, states could receive an annual lump sum of federal money for Medicaid in the form of a block grant.State officials and health policy experts predict that many people would be dropped from Medicaid because states would not fill the fiscal hole left by the loss of federal money.\u201cThe Senate bill creates an illusion of being less draconian than the House bill, but is arguably more so\u201d on Medicaid, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.The Senate bill would make it much easier for states to opt out of insurance standards in the Affordable Care Act, including the requirement for insurers to provide certain \u201cessential benefits.\u201dRepublicans said the bill would still guarantee access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. But consumers could be exposed to new medical costs if, for example, insurers did not have to cover certain expensive new drugs or medical procedures.\u201cAn individual with a pre-existing condition could be insured, but the services needed to treat that condition might not be covered because of a waiver,\u201d said Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor of health law at Washington and Lee University.The Senate and House bills would both provide tax credits to help people buy health insurance, but Senate Republicans said they tried to direct more of the assistance to lower-income people. Under the House bill, the tax credits would be based mainly on a person\u2019s age. Under the Senate bill, they would be based on a person\u2019s income and age, as well as local insurance costs.The Senate bill, like the House bill, would cut off federal Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for one year. The money reimburses clinics for birth control, cancer screenings and other preventive care. About half of Planned Parenthood patients are on Medicaid.Also like the House measure, the Senate bill would repeal taxes imposed on high-income people by the Affordable Care Act, including a payroll tax increase that helps finance Medicare.The bill would delay a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance \u2014 the so-called Cadillac tax \u2014 to 2026. It is currently scheduled to take effect in 2020. Employers and labor unions detest the tax and would have nearly a decade to try to kill it.The Senate bill would provide $50 billion to help stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums from 2018 through 2021. The money would be distributed by the federal government to insurance companies that apply.

It\u2019s just over for people who are producing\u201d bad stuff, he said, using a more profane term. (\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d one of his guests shouted.)Those mixing in the hotel\u2019s chic, library-like atmosphere seemed to be latching on to the message that creativity would win the day. Rather than the feeling of impending doom, one marketing executive from Bank of America said it was a thrilling time to be working in the industry, with the shifts in the way ads reach the public forcing innovation.Others echoed that sentiment. While traditional ways of reaching consumers may be changing, it is in fact the \u201cgolden age of marketing,\u201d said Scott Kauffman, chief executive of MDC Partners, which owns agencies like 72andSunny. He was also skeptical of the premise that people loathe ads, saying, \u201cAsk a Harley-Davidson aficionado if they\u2019re annoyed by Harley-Davidson ads.\u201dStill, even those whose contact with the advertising world is mainly fictional can sense the challenges the industry faces. The actor John Slattery, best known for playing the ad executive Roger Sterling in the series \u201cMad Men,\u201d emerged as a surprise guest at the event, courtesy of Ms. Rosenthal. (Mr. Essex, in his book, referred to Roger Sterling to describe his role at Droga5, though he emphasized on Wednesday that the comparison did not extend to any of the character\u2019s more salacious behavior on the show.)Mr. Slattery said he was about halfway through Mr. Essex\u2019s book. Advertising is a difficult business today, he said, with the advent of platforms like Facebook and Google.\u201cHow do you get seen in all the noise?\u201d he asked.Or, as Mr. Essex put it in his book: \u201cWhen traditional advertising was first invented, there were 16 or so waking hours in a day. That baseline hasn\u2019t changed, but the number of things frenetically competing for our attention at any given moment has, we all know, increased exponentially.\u201dReading the book has already paid off for Mr. Slattery. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about ad-blocking, period, and downloaded it,\u201d he said, marveling at the software, of which he is now a fan. When asked whether he watched TV commercials, he shook his head no.When asked whether the 30-second TV commercial was dying, Catharine Hays, who directs the Future of Advertising program at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said that was \u201cthe wrong question.\u201d The right question, she said, is \u201cWhat\u2019s better than the 30-second ad?\u201dAccording to Mr. Essex\u2019s book, airline terminals.\u201cWhat if brands looked to infrastructure as the new official canvas for their commercials?\u201d he wrote. \u201cImagine a Pfizer-branded ferry. An entire airline terminal brought to you by Citibank, rather than filled with random spots and dots.

{"Headline": "California Today: How California Helps the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, a reporter based in the Bay Area.On Friday, the United States recorded its 80th consecutive month of job growth, which is the longest streak on record and has pushed the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent from 10 percent in the depths of the recession. After a long and painful recovery, the nation is nearing full employment \u2014 and California has played an outsize role.Over the last five years, California has outperformed the nation in just about every important economic metric. Yes, the state is big, accounting for about 12 percent of the nation\u2019s population. But its share of economic growth has been even bigger.California accounted for 17 percent of job growth in the United States from 2012 to 2016, and a quarter of the growth in gross domestic product.\u201cWhat these numbers say is that California is crucial to U.S. growth, far beyond what we could expect from our population alone,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.California was hit hard by the housing bust and recession, so it makes sense that the state would have a stronger rebound. But it also shows how the recovery has been guided by what Mr. Levy calls \u201cthe three Ts,\u201d which are technology, trade and tourism.San Francisco and the Silicon Valley have had a yearslong boom, while the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have been at the center of a rebound in container traffic and international trade. Hollywood has done well, too: As cable channels and companies like Netflix and Amazon have ramped up their original programming, Southern California has seen a surge in production jobs.The downside to all this success is that the state now has quite a lot to lose. With a large immigrant population and a huge port complex, California is at a much greater risk of being hurt by President Trump\u2019s muscular immigration policies and desire to curb imports and tear up trade agreements.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The American distance runner Jeffrey Eggleston won the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Marathon in San Diego on Sunday, beating more than 30,000 entrants with a time of 2 hours, 21 minutes and 18 seconds.But he had to the share the spotlight with a petite, 94-year-old grandmother.Harriette Thompson became the oldest woman to officially complete a half marathon, or 13.1 miles.Ms. Thompson, a former concert pianist from North Carolina, crossed the finish line after a run \u2014 more accurately a brisk walk \u2014 of 3 hours, 42 minutes and 56 seconds.She already held the distinction of oldest woman to complete a full marathon, which she did in 2015 at age 92, also at the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Marathon in San Diego.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that people are making such a deal out of this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at how many young people say, \u2018I\u2019m running just because of you.\u2019 And I think, \u2018Oh, good.

{"Headline": "Apple Piles On the Features, and Users Say, \u2018Enough!\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Apple prepares to show off new features for the iPhone and other devices at its developer conference on Monday, the company is grappling with an uncomfortable issue: Many of its existing features are already too complicated for many users to figure out.But the process of finding and installing other apps in Messages is so tricky that most users have no idea they can even do it, developers and analysts say.\u201cWhile we didn\u2019t end up moving forward with it, we\u2019re excited about other ways we\u2019re making delivery faster and more efficient,\u201d Andy Fang, a founder of DoorDash and the company\u2019s chief technology officer, said in a statement.Velapp has just released a video recording app that uses 3-D Touch to help users select the best parts of a video while recording it. But Mr. de Min said that few other developers were using the technology, in part because iPhone users were unaware of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can really see,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand it.\u201dApple, which declined to comment for this article, makes many updates that are popular with users, from changes to the Siri voice assistant to automatically transcribed voice mail messages.At this year\u2019s Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, Calif., the company is expected to introduce improved Mac computers and iPads, software updates for all of its hardware and a voice-activated speaker to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home.With Apple adding fewer major features in recent years, customers have been slower to upgrade their devices.App developers are also pausing in what had been a race to embrace Apple\u2019s latest innovations. Eliran Sapir, chief executive of Apptopia, an analytics firm, said that new apps were being introduced at half the rate they were a year ago.Apple TV apps are hot, he said, but developers are fleeing Apple Watch. \u201cThere is no way to monetize the watch whatsoever,\u201d he said.The slow uptake of apps for Messages and 3-D Touch is evident in the numbers.There are 5,000 regular apps and 30,000 sticker apps for Messages, according to Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Only about 3,600 of the 2.5 million apps in the iOS app store promote their compatibility with 3-D Touch.\u201cYou get your new iPhone and you don\u2019t know that 3-D Touch and apps in Messages even exist,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. Although stickers account for 97 of the top 100 Messages apps, he said, some users are so confused that they post app reviews like, \u201cI downloaded these Disney stickers. How do I use them?\u201dThat is not exactly in line with the simple \u201cit just works\u201d philosophy that Apple built its business on.Apple is not the only major technology company struggling to find the right balance between constant innovation and ease of use. Facebook has changed course several times in its approach to apps and bots within its Messenger app and regularly battles feature overload in its News Feed. Google, whose search box is a paragon of simplicity, famously retreated from an attempt to tie all of its services together with the unwieldy Google Plus social network.Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, which makes apps for companies like JetBlue Airways and Turner, said he would like to see Apple simplify and smooth out some of its current features. He said Messages apps have potential if Apple can figure out how to make it easier for people to find them.Mr. Reubenstein pointed to a feature of Google Photos as an example of the simplicity that people want. He said he backs up his iPhone photos to Google, which uses face recognition to tag people in the images. For Mother\u2019s Day, Google made it so easy to create quick movies from those photos that he made three, for his mother, his mother-in-law and his wife.\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s a discoverability issue,\u201d said Mr. Duncan, who worked part time on Apple\u2019s telephone tech-support team during college and hopes to get a design job there in the future. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know the stickers exist.\u201dHe said he had to teach his friends how to install and use Messages stickers by sending them multiple screenshots.\u201cA lot of people will think it\u2019s their fault, and it\u2019s really the designer\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want apps to be easy to use.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "On a Georgia Island, a Lot of Good Food and Plenty of Nothing", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "U.S. IslandsCumberland Island offers memorable meals, fine fishing, wild horses, empty beaches and a rich history.Supported byJamie Ferguson hiked up a leg of his wet swim trunks.\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d he said.I had never seen a scar from a shark bite before, so I had no way to gauge if the pale patch the size of a paperback on his thigh was indeed not that bad.Mr. Ferguson, 59, got the shark bite doing exactly what we were doing now, which was pulling a wide strip of netting attached to a couple of pieces of wood through the murky Atlantic surf in an attempt to catch dinner.He grew up fishing this wide, empty beach on Cumberland Island, a stretch of land about four miles longer than Manhattan that sits just off the southern curve of Georgia\u2019s 100-mile coastline.A lifetime on Georgia\u2019s largest and wildest barrier island has rewarded him with impressive fishing skills. He has amassed an equally remarkable collection of Indian arrowheads and clay pipes. And man, can he tell stories. He has the recall of a history professor and the frank wit honed by someone who grew up in a famous family.Mr. Ferguson is a descendant of the Carnegies, who once owned almost the entire island. Thomas Carnegie, considered the better-looking and more amiable younger brother of the industrialist Andrew Carnegie, was one of his great-great-grandfathers. The two men made their fortunes from iron and steel. At the turn of the 20th century, they were as rich and powerful as the digital barons are now.Cumberland had a different fate. Andrew Carnegie married late and gave most of his fortune away, building the performance hall in New York that bears his name, along with thousands of public libraries and several universities. Thomas Carnegie was a family man who had nine children. He and his wife, Lucy, invested in Cumberland, building a winter playground so elaborate it took 200 people just to maintain it.When their era faded, more than one developer tried to get a toehold on Cumberland. County officials entertained plans for a bridge. Neither happened.\u201cTo us, it\u2019s still just home,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.Only one, Greyfield, has been turned into an inn. Rooms top out at $635 a night with all meals included. Lately, with a revived kitchen garden and a hotshot young chef named Whitney Otawka, the meals have become one of the best parts of a stay.Without a reservation for one of the inn\u2019s 10 rooms or the six rooms in its cottages, visitors to the island have to take a park service ferry from the small village of St. Mary\u2019s, Ga. Only 300 people a day are allowed to visit, including a small number of adventurous campers who receive permits to pitch a tent on one of five rustic campsites.Of course, if you are one of the Carnegies, you can land a small plane on the meadow that serves as an airstrip. But buzz it first to make sure no wild horses are lingering on the grass.The horses are part of the charm of the place, and also part of the problem. Last year\u2019s census counted 174, a Greyfield naturalist told me. In the morning, they come so close to the inn you\u2019re tempted to ask them to breakfast. Although horses running on a wide, empty beach is a spectacular sight, the animals are damaging the island.They eat the smooth cord grass that pokes up in the marshes and sea oats that protect the dunes. They trample turtle beds.Whether the horses do more damage than the feral pigs on the island remains up for debate. Some say the horses came with Spanish or British settlers. Others connect them to the enslaved Africans who picked Sea Island cotton here. The Confederate cavalry requisitioned them during the Civil War, and the Carnegies bred them with Tennessee walkers and Arabians to improve the stock.Still, they are a lovely aspect of Cumberland Island, where there is plenty to do and nothing to do. Hikers seek solitude. Historians look for stories. I came to eat and to learn about a family that helped save the place from golf courses and condominiums.Before I could eat, I was going to have to fish. Only certain residents and the Park Service are allowed to have vehicles on the island, and I found myself bouncing along in a truck along a soft sand road with the chef and a few Carnegie descendants.We stopped first to poke around for clams, hunting for tiny holes that promised a clam an inch or two under the sand. Mr. Ferguson and a few other men headed over to chop long, thin oysters from the big muddy clumps that grow wild at the tide line. With two big blue baskets full of shellfish in the back of the truck, we headed south to try our luck with a seine net.Fishing this way requires walking into the cold surf until the water hits you about midchest.One person holds a pole attached to a long piece of net fixed with floats at the top and lead weights at the bottom. Someone else stands maybe 150 feet away, holding another pole to which the other end of the net is secured. You jerk up the net at the same time and walk toward the shore, capturing whatever happens to be swimming in front of you.We pulled in some drum and red fish, tossing back the ones too big to legally keep. A little lemon shark went back into the water, too, along with some horseshoe crabs. Then we headed to the Greyfield, where Ms. Otawka, 36, a former \u201cTop Chef\u201d contestant, was to help her crew get dinner ready.I first tasted her food when she was putting out regional Mexican dishes at a restaurant in Athens, Ga., owned by the chef Hugh Acheson. When Mr. Acheson pulled the plug on that place, she bounced around a little, sometimes cooking at pop-ups in Atlanta and other food events.She picked up her first cooking job at a French restaurant in Oakland, Calif., while she was a student at the University of California, Berkeley. She also worked at a tattoo shop there, which helps explain all her ink.Ms. Otawka landed at the Greyfield nearly two years ago, welcomed by Mitty and Mary Ferguson, Jamie\u2019s brother and sister-in-law. The couple manage the inn. They wanted to breathe new life into the food, and Ms. Otawka wanted an adventure.\u201cChefs live such unbalanced lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is all about balance. You get to live in a beautiful place and cook good food. It was a chance and I took it.\u201dLife here can be isolating. Cellphone service is unreliable, the inn isn\u2019t wired for Wi-Fi and a ferry is the only way to and from the island. For company, Ms. Otawka has her husband and her elderly pit bull.Ben Wheatley, 30, is also a chef at the inn. He and Ms. Otawka fell in love cooking at one of Mr. Acheson\u2019s restaurants and married in Mexico late last year. They have dedicated themselves, at least for the moment, to cooking on an island that is right out of a Wes Anderson movie. (He scouted the island as a location for his film \u201cMoonrise Kingdom.\u201d)Greyfield was built in 1900 as a gift to one of Lucy and Thomas Carnegie\u2019s daughters. It has been an inn only since the 1960s, when Jamie\u2019s grandmother realized that their slice of the Carnegie fortune was dwindling while taxes and the cost of Greyfield\u2019s upkeep grew.The grandmother, Lucy Ferguson, had long been a fierce champion of the island. She was a collector of animal bones and Indian artifacts, a protector of the wild horses and a cattle rancher who never made much money from the 500 head she tended.She taught her children and grandchildren how to use grits and Pond\u2019s cold cream to preserve a snakeskin, among other skills. Along with some of the other women from prominent families connected to the island, she helped strike the deal that allowed the family to stay on even after the park service took it over.Her portrait hangs in the mansion\u2019s drawing room, a scarf around her head and a dagger at her side. I slept in her childhood bedroom, a windowpane still bearing her name and the little picture she etched there in 1915.For years, the inn was the kind of place where people had to dress formally for a dinner that was often prime rib, with cr\u00e8me de menthe over ice cream for dessert. Since Ms. Otawka came, things have changed.Boxed lunches are still free to any guests who want to pack one along as they explore the island, but instead of fried chicken, the offering might be poached chicken over snap pea salad dressed up with anchovies and Calabrian peppers. Jacques Pepin, who spends winter vacations nearby, visited the island recently, and Ms. Otawka cooked lunch for him. \u201cHe said I cooked like his grandmother and mother,\u201d she said.Before dinner, guests order a cocktail and mark their purchases on a pad. On the patio, oysters are roasted over a wood fire and tossed into a metal bucket at the end of a table set with oyster knives and saltines. Guests can shuck all they want, dipping warm nuggets of meat into melted butter.At 7:30 on the dot, Christopher Becerra, whom Ms. Otawka talked into moving to the island to expand the wine program and sharpen the front of the house, struck four notes on a set of chimes.We all headed to the dining room, arranging ourselves around the dining table where the Carnegie family had shared their meals. The guest mix was eclectic. We sat with an archivist for Coca-Cola, some newlyweds who had saved up for a honeymoon night and a retired surgeon in his 80s who was having an improbable romance with a younger novelist. \u201cShe\u2019s left of Marx and I\u2019m right of Mussolini,\u201d the surgeon said, reaching for her hand.At another table, a family of four were dressed like Connecticut, the two small boys a Ralph Lauren ad in blue blazers and khakis. Earlier in the evening, one of the future captains of industry had offered to shuck oysters for me at a nickel a shell.By the end of the weekend, we were all camp buddies.\u201cWe have a brilliant spring dinner planned for you,\u201d Mr. Becerra said, launching into the wines he had selected from the inn\u2019s 90-bottle collection. A pinot blanc, he said, had \u201cthis sea breeze quality I just love with the ham.\u201dThe pairings that night cost $37, one of the few additional costs beyond the price of the room.We ate sweet English snap peas and burrata dressed up with pea shoots and Benton\u2019s bacon, and fat Georgia shrimp grilled over oak and piled atop cranberry beans moistened with smoky tomato broth spiked with chilies.Just as a chocolate tart with a swirl of toasted meringue arrived, Mr. Becerra rang his chimes again to announce the first of three nature and history tours scheduled for the next day, a birding outing. It was to begin at 7 a.m., which would get everyone back to the inn in time for breakfast.\u201cIt\u2019s the start of hummingbird season!\u201d he announced cheerfully.I slept past the hummingbirds and got to breakfast at 8:30. Citrus salad was waiting, followed by a frittata with asparagus and spinach that oozed Cheddar. I ate it as well as two slices of apple-wood smoked bacon.The inn sets out fishing poles and bikes with fat tires to navigate the sandy paths to the beach or the ruins of the 50-room mansion Lucy and Thomas Carnegie built. It was largely abandoned by the 1930s, a victim of dwindling family interest, increased taxes and the Depression. Arsonists burned it to the ground in 1959 in what is believed to have been a dispute between poachers and a caretaker that involved a shooting.North of the mansion\u2019s ruins are two dozen chimneys, the remains of cabins that housed enslaved Africans decades before the Carnegies discovered the island.I wandered over to meet Janet Ferguson, Jamie and Middy\u2019s sister and the last of the three Carnegie siblings who all live in houses they built a short walk from the Greyfield.\u201cI was walking on the beach with my dog, Penny,\u201d Ms. Otawka said. \u201cGogo\u2019s truck goes rolling by and she stops and she\u2019s like, \u2018This is my friend Bill.\u2019 And Bill Murray is in the front seat.\u201dGogo offered to drive me to the small wooden First African Baptist Church, which was established in 1893 as part of a settlement designed so that the African-Americans who worked on the island could begin to own land.The Kennedy clan, she said, was just lovely. \u201cTeddy got up and said I cannot believe this place and I know how proud your parents would be that you picked this place to get married,\u201d she said.John called her a few days later from Istanbul, where the newlyweds were honeymooning. The paparazzi were relentless.\u201cWhy the hell did I ever leave Cumberland?\u201d she said he told her.I headed back to Gogo\u2019s place with Ms. Otawka after dinner. The tequila came out, and so did more stories.They talked about a private spaceport Camden County officials want to build just west of Cumberland Island, complained about a zealous new park ranger and worried about a plan to rezone a small slice of the island for private development.But pressure to change the island is nothing new, and neither is their response to it.\u201cWhat we have is more valuable than money,\u201d Jamie Ferguson said.\u201cThe money is gone anyway,\u201d Gogo added. \u201cThis has been handed down to us momentarily to take care of and pass on. What\u2019s wrong with leaving it the way it is?\u201dKim Severson is a food correspondent for The New York Times based in Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venus Williams Faces Wrongful-Death Suit in Crash", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byThe daughter of a man killed in a car crash involving the tennis star Venus Williams has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against her.Williams was crossing an intersection in her Toyota S.U.V. in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., around 1 p.m. on June 9, when, according to a police report, she collided with a car being driven by Linda Barson. Barson\u2019s husband, Jerome, 78, was a passenger in the car, and he died on June 22 from injuries he sustained in the crash.According to the lawsuit, filed on Thursday and obtained by The New York Times, Linda Barson, 68, also sustained injuries, including \u201ca cracked sternum, shattered right arm, broken wrist, hand and fingers.\u201dWilliams, who arrived in London on Wednesday to prepare for her 20th Wimbledon tournament, made her first public comments about the crash with a post on her Facebook page Friday evening.Williams wrote that she was \u201cheartbroken by this accident. My heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends of Jerome Barson and I continue to keep them in my thoughts and prayers.\u201dThe accident happened as Williams\u2019s car was crossing the intersection at about 5 miles per hour and Barson\u2019s car ran into it, the report said.

{"Headline": "Sydney\u2019s New Guard: Five Restaurants Leading the Way", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byCritic's Notebook19 PhotosSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 When I arrived here in April to check out this city\u2019s recent crop of chefs, I knew I wasn\u2019t at the center of the culinary universe. That was more than 400 miles away, in Melbourne.And yet as I made my way around town, eating in restaurants whose chefs were all pretty new to the scene, I saw no black eyes. And if a week here didn\u2019t convince me that I was in the center of the culinary universe, I didn\u2019t mind. The restaurants I liked best had qualities that are more enjoyable than a grasping for universal acclaim. Their service, atmosphere and a lot of the food were professional enough to let you know they took it all seriously, but relaxed enough that you didn\u2019t have to take it quite as seriously yourself.The world may not have its eyes on Sydney at the moment, but the five chefs whose cooking impressed me the most have global origins, cosmopolitan sensibilities, or both.Conspicuously absent from their influences, for the most part, is Asia. That continent\u2019s cuisines, especially Chinese and Vietnamese, are all over the city and in suburbs like Cabramatta. They were a strong influence on the generation of chefs, including Kylie Kwong, Luke Mangan, Neil Perry and David Thompson, who gave Sydney a reputation as a great restaurant town in the 1990s and early 2000s, before Melbourne raised its hand.Of course, a spectacular Chinese, Vietnamese or Korean restaurant may open next month. At the moment, though, Sydney\u2019s newer chefs are tilting toward North America and Europe.Sitting at the chef\u2019s counter of this two-year-old restaurant, with my back to the view of a quiet, narrow block in the Surry Hills neighborhood, I got the full fire show. Grapevine, ironbark and fruit trees like peach and orange were going up in smoke. Periodically somebody would reach into a firebox whose interior looked like a medieval painting of hell and fill a scuttle with coals to set under one of the three stainless-steel grills. These were shiny and modern, in contrast to the sooty wood-burning stove in back, which might have been from another century. Red patches covered the forearms of one cook. He must have been new.Mr. Hastie was at a butcher\u2019s station by the counter, breaking down whole gleaming fish and occasionally retrieving a rack of beef from a hook to slice off a steak on a band saw.From this primal scene emerged cooking of almost incredible finesse. Nothing I ate at Firedoor was charred, and while smoke was a constant presence, what I noticed above all was how precisely the cooks controlled the fire\u2019s temperature.Over a salad of shaved fennel and little cells of finger lime are slices of albacore, seared on one side just long enough to go white. A sea robin fillet was grilled high up over the coals until it was just done, juicy, very lightly smoky.Pipi clams, tossed with threads of red chile and bursting pods of the native succulent karkalla, were piled into a pan that started out directly over the coals and then was quickly raised about two feet above them. A marrow bone was roasted by the coals in the oven until it was on the verge of melting and begging to be mashed into grilled bread with some fermented chile and a few sprigs of peppery salad greens.Bake, the Trinidadian bread that is not baked but fried, is topped with slices of lardo and local abalone instead of the traditional shark bits. There is salted fish in sofrito rice, and while he uses mulloway instead of cod, the taste is pure Puerto Rico.There is griddled roti, otherwise known as \u201cbuss up shut,\u201d in the company of a charcoal-grilled Moreton Bay bug tail. (Bugs are a species of lobster.)Pulling up to the table at Automata, Ester, Firedoor, Fred\u2019s and Momofuku Seiobo.Breadfruit is originally from the South Pacific but was planted all over the Caribbean as cheap food for slaves. Mashed with butter, it is a fixture on tables in Barbadian and other homes. Mr. Carmichael turns it into a song of home, serving a single soft absorbent piece soaked in a butter sauce that\u2019s amplified by more breadfruit \u2014 dried, toasted and fermented.Part of the excitement of Seiobo is that everybody, from high rollers to far-flung restaurant critics, gets a little messy. Some dishes you want to eat with your hands. Others leave you no choice. Upstairs, people may be breaking even at blackjack in a zombie trance, but everybody who has a perch at Seiobo\u2019s tasting counter is wide awake.The dining room, on the ground floor of the Old Clare Hotel, is done in stainless steel, blond wood and concrete with some charcoal lowlights \u2014 a Changian palette. The space is wider than it is deep, with a long communal table taking up most of the floor. Everybody gets the tasting menu, a restrained five courses for a restrained 88 dollars.Mr. Wells folds scraps of modernist technique into his cooking, but they\u2019re invisible. First up was a wonderful little bouquet of rosemary-smoked enoki mushrooms wrapped in what tasted like lardo but was a thin sheet of smoked pig tail. Then came a grilled bug tail and sweet, jellylike persimmon. The tail was minty with dried shiso and salty from oil made with umeboshi, preserved plums. There were just a few flavors, but they echoed and multiplied.Up next was some of the sweetest and least cabbagey cabbage I\u2019ve ever tasted. Mushroom pur\u00e9e was hiding under it, and mushroom butter worked its way into every crevice.The centerpiece of Fred\u2019s dining room is an open kitchen that looks like the set of a cooking show. On either side of a gaping hearth and a smaller wood oven are two marble-topped islands adorned, back in April, with big bowls of peppers, tomatoes, eggplants and herbs. There are chairs at the islands. If this were television, this is where the judges would sit, but at Fred\u2019s the seats go to paying customers.When Ms. Alvarez throws sweet wood-roasted red peppers, pale cucumbers, white anchovies and fluffy fresh cheese together with shards of fattoush, the Mediterranean seems to be on her mind. For sure it was on mine as I ate sweet sand whiting with a rough salsa of parsley leaves and lemon peel spooned over it. Ms. Alvarez already has a name around town for her skill with lamb. She cooks this extraordinary locally raised meat as if it were the reason she moved to Australia.A muscular character dressed in black, Mr. Lindsay stands at the kitchen pass and communicates with his employees by clapping his hands. I never figured out the difference between a single and a double clap, but the people who work at Ester, all of them in aprons, seemed to know.About half the customers were ordering \u00e0 la carte; I went along with the other half and got the set menu for 82 dollars. This brought me more plates than I could count, and I didn\u2019t regret any of them.Sometimes Mr. Lindsay catered to hometown tastes, as in the fine blood sausage mini-sandwich, modeled on the ubiquitous if mostly uncelebrated Australian snack of a sausage link on a slice of white bread. Other times he adopted the visual style of New Nordic chefs, plunking delicious Hasselback potatoes into a little saucer of butter made with smoked whey.As for the kangaroo, it was dried into a sweet jerky, then fried and tossed with macadamia nuts, fried saltbush leaves and muntries, a pickled native berry. The inspiration seemed to be Thai, with local products standing in for pork or beef, peanuts and basil, and it was fantastic. So was a dessert with the unpromising name \u201cthree milks.\u201d Sheep are responsible for the yogurt, cows for the panna cotta and goats for the dulce de leche that are layered one over the other.Do Ester, Firedoor, Automata and Fred\u2019s deserve the global recognition that Seiobo already has? No question. And they might get it, although none of the chefs seem to be overly concerned about that.Apart from Seiobo, these restaurants don\u2019t force anybody to take them seriously by framing the cooking inside expensive tasting menus. They all let you stroll in, eat a couple of delicious things and be on your way, if that\u2019s what you want.Serious food in a casual setting isn\u2019t new to Sydney, but these chefs have brought things down to an even more unassuming pitch.It may be a pitch that doesn\u2019t register with global list compilers. The problem with any effort to boil the world\u2019s food scene down to 50 addresses, or even 100, is that there are just too many good restaurants scattered all over, including Sydney. As problems go, this one isn\u2019t worth complaining about.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Fined Record $2.7 Billion in E.U. Antitrust Ruling", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byGoogle suffered a major blow on Tuesday after European antitrust officials fined the search giant a record $2.7 billion for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals.The penalty, of 2.4 billion euros, highlights the aggressive stance that European officials have taken in regulating many of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, going significantly further than their American counterparts.\u201cIn Europe, companies must compete on the merits regardless if they are European or not,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules.\u201dThe apparent focus on Silicon Valley has prompted accusations from some in the United States that the European Union is unfairly targeting American companies. Officials in the bloc vigorously deny those assertions.In targeting the activities of these digital giants, experts say, European authorities are laying down a marker for more hands-on control of how the digital world operates. And while the $2.7 billion fine announced on Tuesday is tiny compared with Google\u2019s $90 billion in annual revenue, it highlights the region\u2019s willingness to dole out sizable penalties.Shares of Google fell for a second straight day on the news. The stock declined 2.5 percent on Tuesday, a steeper decline than the broader Nasdaq.Europe\u2019s latest efforts to rein in technology companies stem from continuing unease that Silicon Valley has come to dominate how the continent\u2019s 500 million citizens interact online.\u201cEurope is setting the agenda,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like that.\u201dIn her statement on Tuesday, Ms. Vestager said that Google held a dominant position in online search, requiring the company to take extra measures to ensure that its digital services did not crowd out those of rivals.The antitrust decision related to Google\u2019s online shopping service, which the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said had received preferential treatment compared with those of rivals in specialized search results.Analysts say such so-called vertical search products \u2014 also including those for restaurant and business reviews \u2014 represent a fast-growing percentage of Google\u2019s annual revenue. The company does not break out earnings figures for this unit in its financial reports.The search company is facing two separate antitrust charges in Europe related to Android, its popular mobile software, and to some of its advertising products. Google denies the accusations.Google rebuffed the European Union\u2019s claims on Tuesday, saying that its services had helped the region\u2019s digital economy grow. It has also said that significant online competition remains in Europe, including from companies like Amazon and eBay.Despite Google\u2019s denials, the record fine \u2014 the previous high, against Intel in 2009, was \u20ac1.06 billion \u2014 represents a bloody nose for a company that holds a market share of more than 90 percent in online search in Europe.Several other antitrust complaints related to other specialized search results have been filed in Europe against Google, and Ms. Vestager said Tuesday\u2019s announcement could \u201cbe used as a framework\u201d in those investigations.That may eventually lead to further fines if European authorities find wrongdoing. The complaints include many from other American technology companies, including Oracle, News Corporation and Yelp, which have been vocal advocates of large fines against Google.Google has 90 days to respond to the European Commission\u2019s demands, or face penalties of up to 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, its parent company. European officials said on Tuesday that they would regularly monitor the company\u2019s activities to ensure that it was complying with the ruling.Under European rules, the company \u2014 and not the regulator \u2014 must come up with proposals to guarantee that it treats competitors fairly when people make online search queries. The authorities can demand that Google make further changes if they are not satisfied with the initial proposals.Analysts and many of Google\u2019s competitors have called for an independent monitor to oversee the company\u2019s digital services in Europe, which could include oversight of its search algorithms, some of Google\u2019s most important intellectual property. The company is likely to fiercely oppose such a move.Google has other options, including the removal of some of its specialized search services from Europe, or returning them to how they operated before the European Union\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.Whatever the outcome, analysts say they expect a protracted legal battle that will continue for several years as both Google and its rivals fight to define how search services are provided in Europe and elsewhere.\u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a co-founder of Foundem, a British comparison-shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google. \u201cLeft unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Tech Executive\u2019s Latest Start-Up Has Cleats, Jerseys and Goals", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byKINGSTON, N.Y. \u2014 It was the most important game in the brief history of Kingston Stockade F.C. First place was on the line. So was the first real chance to draw 1,000 fans.Two hours before kickoff on a hot Saturday afternoon in early June, Dennis Crowley, the team\u2019s founder, arrived at Dietz Stadium, a high school football field covered with artificial turf.Driven by the kind of disruptive innovation he knows from the tech world, Crowley is making a bold attempt to reimagine professional soccer in the United States. It is a grand vision of hundreds of clubs and multiple divisions, of promotion and relegation that will reward investment and success and punish bad decisions and failure. That is the big picture. On a recent Saturday, however, Crowley\u2019s focus was on only one game.For the early June match, Crowley\u2019s S.U.V. was packed with the uniforms he had washed. A bag of balls. Banners. Posters for postgame autographs. Cash boxes for the ticket booth and the merchandise stand. Envelopes to pay the referees and the pizza delivery guy. Clipboards and rosters for the press box. Walkie-talkies for the volunteer staff members.He removed Tupperware containers stuffed with T-shirts \u2014 rolled by his father and the club\u2019s general manager \u2014 along with other items for sale: Stockade jerseys, Stockade caps, Stockade scarves, Stockade winter hats.\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll sell many winter hats in summer, but we\u2019ll try,\u201d he said with a chuckle.Randy Kim, the general manager, walked up and Crowley said, \u201cWould you be able to go to the CVS across the street and buy cups?\u201dWhen Kim returned, having spent $12.19 on cups and a couple of bucks on a chocolate bar, Crowley said, \u201cGood work; keep the receipt.\u201dThis is how the revolution begins: By turning your car into a rolling warehouse. By learning that water can be dispensed more efficiently from five-gallon jugs than from bottles. By keeping track of every cent spent. And by bringing a technology executive\u2019s aptitude for pioneering start-ups to soccer.Crowley\u2019s idea is that profitable and sustainable soccer teams can succeed, not only in the large markets inhabited at the top professional level by Major League Soccer, but in small communities, too, like Kingston, with a population of 23,000 in the Hudson Valley, 90 miles north of New York City.\u201cI think that\u2019s where M.L.S. is going wrong,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThey are tending to produce a standardized product across the country.\u201dCrowley envisions the obscure N.P.S.L. becoming relevant over the next five or 10 years by expanding from 100 to 500 teams, each drawing at least 1,000 fans a game and attracting at least 5,000 viewers online via live-streaming broadcasts of their matches. (M.L.S. currently has 22 teams, but is in the process of expanding to as many as 28 over the next several years.)If the N.P.S.L. can build a much larger geographic footprint than M.L.S., while attracting an audience about 25 percent the size of M.L.S.\u2019s, Crowley argues, this could lead to enhanced sponsorship deals, live-streaming rights contracts, and shared revenue among the league\u2019s teams.Crowley\u2019s plan also envisions the enticing \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 possibility of promotion and relegation, with teams moving up or down through tiers depending on their performance in a given season.The system is the standard in most of the world\u2019s leagues but anathema to American professional sports, where leagues like the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. operate \u2014 like M.L.S. \u2014 as closed systems. That arrangement was built into M.L.S. at its creation in the mid-1990s, and it most likely enticed the financing that founded and sustained the league.But a closed system also mitigates risks for potential new investors: It is unlikely that a prospective owner of an M.L.S. team would spend several hundred million dollars for a team and a stadium if it risked dropping to a lower division a year later, just as no one would buy the Yankees if they might drop to Class AAA after a single poor season. To advocates of promotion and relegation, that safety stifles innovation.That is why the prospect of advancing in soccer\u2019s pecking order is tantalizing to many fans of lower-division clubs. It is also why, instead of changing the American soccer landscape from the top, Crowley is proposing to do it from the bottom.\u201cPeople say, \u2018It\u2019s cute, you\u2019re doing this thing with soccer,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re working on a start-up and that\u2019s cute until you pose a threat to Google or Facebook and then they take you seriously. I understand the journey, the improbable rise of that. I feel like we\u2019re doing the improbable rise again.\u201dIn these online essays, Crowley has been open about strategies that have worked, and others that have failed. He has offered tips: Jerseys are reusable from one season to the next if the sponsor remains the same. It is better to start summer games at 5 p.m. instead of 2 p.m., so fans don\u2019t have to run for shade and players\u2019 feet won\u2019t blister. And if you cannot serve alcohol at a high school stadium, arrange for a beer tent across the street.Crowley also has made the provocative argument that proximity may matter as much as quality of play in drawing fans to a team.\u201cIn sum, we shouldn\u2019t focus our energy on the idea of entirely disrupting M.L.S.,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut rather on creating a world where it\u2019s possible that a critical mass of soccer fans in the USA care more about a D4 league than M.L.S.\u201dCan his plan succeed?\u201cI love the transparency, putting all the numbers down; it\u2019s really cool what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Stefan Szymanski, a professor of sports management at Michigan and the author of \u201cMoney and Soccer: A Soccernomics Guide.\u201d\u201cCertainly, M.L.S. wants to develop the lower tiers; they want to control every level of the game,\u201d Szymanski said. \u201cThe question is, if this guy develops a nice app and a nice system, would M.L.S. try to buy it up lock, stock and barrel? And would he be willing to sell?\u201dSunil Gulati, an important executive in the founding of M.L.S. and the current president of the United States Soccer Federation, said: \u201cYou never discount anyone who\u2019s proven in one aspect of their career. The idea of a community-based, ground-up effort is certainly something to be followed carefully.\u201dBecause Crowley\u2019s plan is long-term, Gulati added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to evaluate and also hard to succeed against everything else that\u2019s going on in the sport. To the extent that this is a disrupter, that\u2019s great if they\u2019re successful. But we only ever hear about the disrupters that are successful.

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Rift Over Medicaid and Opioids Imperils Senate Health Bill", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A growing rift among Senate Republicans over federal spending on Medicaid and the opioid epidemic is imperiling legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act that Senate leaders are trying to put to a vote by the end of next week.And conservative senators, led by Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are determined to hold the line on federal spending, pitting two Senate factions against each other.Senator John Cornyn of Texas emerged from a contentious closed-door lunch with Republican senators on Tuesday saying that he hoped the Senate would be able to meet the deadline of a vote before July 4. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cfailing that, I\u2019ve always said we need to get it done by\u201d the end of July.The emerging Senate bill, like the one approved narrowly by the House in early May, would end Medicaid as an open-ended entitlement program and replace it with capped payments to states, Republicans said. But starting in 2025, payments to the states would grow more slowly than those envisioned in the House bill.Republican senators from states that have been hit hard by the opioid drug crisis have tried to cushion the Medicaid blow with a separate funding stream of $45 billion over 10 years for substance abuse treatment and prevention costs, now covered by the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.How senators have different priorities on health care.But that, too, is running into opposition from conservatives. They have been tussling over the issue with moderate Republican senators like Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Susan Collins of Maine.Without some opioid funding, Mr. Portman cannot vote for the bill, he said, adding, \u201cAny replacement is going to have to do something to address this opioid crisis that is gripping our country.\u201dRepublicans hold 52 seats in the Senate and can afford to lose only two of their members if they hope to pass the bill, which is opposed by all Democrats and the two independents.While the proposed money for drug abuse treatment is relatively modest compared with spending for other items like Medicaid and premium tax credits, without it, hundreds of thousands of addicts would go without treatment, advocates say. The issue holds outsize political importance for senators like Mr. Portman, who has made advocacy for treatment legislation a calling card with voters at home.\u201cThe opioid issue has been a particular concern of mine and has been for years,\u201d said Mr. Portman, who has been leading the efforts with Senator Capito. \u201cThe reality is we have the worst drug crisis that our country\u2019s ever faced, and it\u2019s being driven by opioids.\u201dSenator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, who serves on a group shaping the final bill, said: \u201cWe need to address the opioid crisis in America. I want us to find a bipartisan solution with adequate funding.\u201dBut Republican leaders would not commit to Mr. Portman\u2019s proposal.The Medicaid and opioid issues are far from the only ones dividing Republican senators, who have been kept largely in the dark about a bill they are supposed to finally see on Thursday. Republican leaders are determined to keep their seven-year promise to unravel President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, but the near unanimity they need on a replacement is proving elusive.The House bill would allow per-capita Medicaid payments to states to grow along with the prices of medical goods and services, starting in 2020, with an extra allowance for older Americans and people with disabilities. Senator Toomey and several other conservatives have been pushing for a slower growth rate, to reflect increases in the overall Consumer Price Index, starting in 2025. Medical prices have historically grown faster than the overall index.Several Republican senators, including Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, have indicated they would like to exempt disabled children from the caps.Senator Collins\u2019s concerns cover almost the entire landscape of Republican problems: the loss of care for Medicaid recipients, the worries of states with especially high health care costs, and money for opioid treatment (8 percent of all births in her state, Maine, were to addicted mothers last year, she said). Then there are her complaints about the process.\u201cFirst, we haven\u2019t seen the bill,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cSecond, it has yet to receive a score from the Congressional Budget Office. And third is the process we are using.\u201dThat process \u2014 an arcane budget procedure that Republicans denounced when Democrats used it to pass just a small part of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 could make some provisions vulnerable to Democratic challenges to the bill. Not knowing which provisions will stay and which could be removed on the Senate floor makes evaluating the substance of the bill that much harder.Republican aides speculated that the restrictions on the growth of Medicaid, among other issues, could be altered later by Senate Republican leaders, in a bid to pick up support from the moderates.A bill this large with so much in flux days before it is to receive a vote on the floor is largely without precedent in the Senate.Senior Republican senators said six weeks ago that they would start afresh in writing a bill to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law, but the legislation they are developing is similar in many respects to the bill passed by the House.The Senate bill would eliminate penalties for people who do not have insurance and larger employers who do not offer it to employees \u2014 eviscerating the individual and employer mandates that were hallmarks of the Affordable Care Act. The Senate bill, like the House measure, would provide billions of dollars to states to help stabilize insurance markets, which Republicans say are tottering in many states.The Senate bill would also allow states to opt out of many federal insurance standards. Republican leaders said they wanted to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but it was not immediately clear how they would do so.Democrats stepped up their protests over the secrecy of the bill-writing process on Tuesday, and some Republicans chimed in. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, was a member of a health care working group formed by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, but even he was vexed by the process.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about federal spending on Medicaid and the opioid epidemic misstated, in some editions, the position of Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, on a proposal to spend $45 billion over 10 years for opioid abuse treatment and prevention costs. Mr. Toomey has not discussed that proposal with its supporters and said he is considering plans to increase funding for substance abuse programs; he has not opposed the $45 billion plan.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The settlement will be paid with insurance money, not taxpayer funds, the statement said.Robert Bennett, a lawyer for the Castile family, said that \u201cno amount of money can ever replace Philando,\u201d but that the settlement should provide some measure of comfort to those angered by his death.\u201cI think this is a way of stopping what could be several years of litigation traveling through the courts and exacerbating the suffering of the family and the community,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cAnd perhaps both can do now the important business of trying to heal.\u201dThe payout comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the criminal justice system\u2019s handling of police shootings. Officer Yanez was one of four police officers to go on trial for a fatal shooting of a black person in recent weeks. All of the shootings were captured on video. Juries acquitted three of the officers and failed to reach a verdict in the fourth case.Mr. Castile\u2019s death inspired protests and outrage starting minutes after he was shot last July 6 on a busy suburban road near the Minnesota state fairgrounds. Diamond Reynolds, Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, streamed the graphic aftermath of the shooting on Facebook and said her boyfriend had been trying to cooperate with Officer Yanez, who had pulled him over for a broken taillight.Officer Yanez testified in court that he believed Mr. Castile matched the description of a robbery suspect, was disobeying his commands and was reaching for a gun.Mr. Castile, who was licensed to carry a gun, had advised Officer Yanez that he had a firearm in the car. Prosecutors said he had done so to put the officer at ease, not to cause alarm. Ms. Reynolds said that Mr. Castile was trying to retrieve his driver\u2019s license, as had been requested by the officer, when he was shot.Officer Yanez was believed to be the first Minnesota officer criminally charged in an on-duty fatal shooting. Protesters have marched repeatedly since his acquittal, including a highway blockade hours after the verdict and an interruption of the gay pride parade in Minneapolis on Sunday. On Twitter, some said the settlement did little to right the situation.Mayor Jerry Faust of St. Anthony did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.videoAdvertisement"}

He is \u2014 or at least was \u2014 Dr. Karadzic. He was trained and practiced as a psychiatrist, even spending some time in the United States. As a fugitive, he was hiding in plain sight as a new age healer who looked like Santa Claus \u2014 the closest he could be to a psychiatrist on the run, specializing in the treatment of sexual problems.What is so distressing is that Karadzic went against the essential ethical principle of medicine: Do no harm. One can say he did all of his harm as a citizen, but he seemed to apply his psychiatric knowledge in the service of terrorism. Moreover, his life and associates indicate the depths to which humans can fall under certain conditions. If a vote were taken, he could probably win a contest for the worst psychiatrist in history.Most physicians and psychiatrists are worthy of trust, but they can occasionally be tempted to go to the dark side, and we need professional policies to monitor and stop such behavior.

{"Headline": "At Don Peppe, Expect a Lot of Everything", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review11 Photos\u201cGet ready for a lot of flavor.\u201dThis was what an old hand with the menu at Don Peppe said as the first plates came to our table. He could have shortened that to \u201cget ready for a lot,\u201d or just \u201cget ready.\u201d Some preparation for the meal to come is definitely in order for the uninitiated, a word that on a typical day applies to nobody at this white-tablecloth red-sauce restaurant in South Ozone Park, Queens.Don Peppe novices need to know that certain items are not welcome on the premises, as listed on a sign on the front door: No Tank Tops, Hats, Strollers, Baby Carriages, Credit Cards.With these exceptions, the dress code is permissive and allows for pantsuits, polo shirts, track jackets, pleated trousers, wide shorts. The manager in charge of the waiting list one recent night \u2014 reservations aren\u2019t taken \u2014 had on a guayabera embroidered with a Yankees logo. Waiters wear white shirts and neckties. Bussers are dressed in black T-shirts with The Original Baked Clams printed on the back, a stirring if undocumented claim.In fact, the original racing d\u00e9cor, which dated back to the 1960s, when Don Peppe moved to Lefferts Boulevard from Brooklyn, was replaced by Italian landscape paintings many years ago as Aqueduct traffic faded. Michael DeLuca Sr., the owner, said the track crowd had started to come back recently, with bigger shares of the purse in their pockets. In their honor, he revived the equestrian motif.It would be a similar error to wait for menus. They are not printed on paper. Everything, the antipasti and pastas, the seafood, meat and desserts, is printed in white on a blackboard. If the sightlines were better, a person with good vision could read it from the other side of Lefferts Boulevard.Sitting in a corner, my guide couldn\u2019t see the menu and didn\u2019t need to. He mentioned about a dozen family-size dishes to the waiter: baked clams, fried peppers, the \u201cspecial salad,\u201d a pound of pasta (the minimum serving), another pound of pasta, veal cutlets and something called shrimp Luciano, which may or may not be named after Lucky Luciano.\u201cYou want linguine with the shrimp Luciano?\u201d the waiter asked.\u201cWhy not?\u201d So that was another pound.I thought my guide had finished, but he was merely pausing for breath. \u201cWe should get the chicken Chinese, just so you can try it,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, and the steak\u2019s not bad either. Let\u2019s get a porterhouse.\u201dAs I was saying, it was a lot, and as he had warned me, a lot of flavor, although another way to put that would be to say a lot of garlic.Garlic chopped to a fine mist and warmed with clam juice and olive oil sloshes under the baked littlenecks, a dozen to an order. Spooned over the almost blackened crust of bread crumbs, this sauce is rich and gentle. It doesn\u2019t bully the freshly shucked clams, whose small size \u2014 inside their shells, many are no bigger than a quarter \u2014 helps distance Don Peppe from legions of other baked-clam artists around the city.Garlic in whole cloves is browned with onions and strips of red peppers in a pan hot enough to scare the peppers out of their skins. Called fried peppers, it\u2019s essentially a three-ingredient dish, five if you count black pepper and olive oil, and the first time you eat it you can\u2019t quite believe how far the flavors take you. One person I ate with insisted that the peppers had to have been laced with sugar.A more likely explanation is that the kitchen makes these dishes and others the way they are supposed to be made, adding a few flourishes of its own. This is a rare thing. Italian-American restaurant cooking is not an endangered species in New York just yet, but enough of its practitioners have closed or slumped into irrelevance to raise concerns about gene pool dilution. Don Peppe is one of the few exemplars where pride and purpose, both essential to this cuisine, remain intact. Mr. DeLuca employs three chefs, all charged with following recipes that in most cases go back more than 100 years, to when the restaurant was founded by a Neapolitan who went by the name Don Peppe. (His full name and the exact date were forgotten many baked clams ago.)Those pounds of pasta are one place where the difference is plain. White clam sauce can be a thin soup with stray eraser tips, or it can be, as it is at Don Peppe, a concentrated broth that sinks deep into the pasta, which sits under a wide swath of chopped fresh clams and parsley. The pomodoro sauce is a thick, profoundly red gravy that doesn\u2019t cast a watery pool on the bottom of the plate. The same sauce, or one close to it, is the bed for shells stuffed with ricotta, topped with mozzarella and run under the broiler long enough to put a crackle on the lips of the shells.The meat sauce is just meat sauce. The marinara, though, is what every jarred sauce on the market wishes it could be.Beginners may need to have a few menu items decoded. Don Peppe special salad: iceberg, tomatoes, salami, provolone and so forth, in a huge bowl. It sounds ordinary but somehow it isn\u2019t. Shrimp Luciano: shrimp in a garlic-butter sauce turned sunset pink by a rumor of tomatoes. It\u2019s great, and there\u2019s no reason not to have it over pasta. Veal Don Peppe: chopped raw tomatoes, red peppers and onions ladled over a breaded cutlet that you could slice with a wooden spoon. Chicken Chinese: cut-up chicken in a tomato sauce reduced to a brownish jam.In several return visits, I noticed regulars eating things not advertised on the menu \u2014 stuffed peppers, a porterhouse, a tomahawk chop with a bone that you could use to prop up a car hood. The beef is better than you might expect but will not give you the false impression that Don Peppe is a steakhouse.The best dessert is probably the cheesecake. The rest are what kids in Bay Ridge and Corona used to want on their birthdays: tortoni, tartufo, spumoni. Of course, the other people at your table will say they have no room for dessert.

{"Headline": "Against Terror, Is London Pride Enough?", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byThis picture has been seized upon with relief and delight because it reflects how Britons would like to see themselves in a crisis: cool, calm, priorities unchanged.\u201cLondon Pride, in a glass,\u201d said one tweeter, punning on the name of a popular brand of ale. \u201cIt\u2019s London Bridge, FFS,\u201d said another, \u201che\u2019s paid \u00a35.50 for that pint.\u201d (About $7 is considered expensive, these days.) \u201cIf beer is left behind, the terrorists win,\u201d said a third.It\u2019s the James Bond spirit writ large. Many people are defiantly hoping that while they may be shaken by the horror, London hasn\u2019t been stirred.This is true, up to a point. The radio and television shows today have been full of callers, politicians and priests claiming that the terrorists won\u2019t divide the country, that Britain stands together, that this violence cannot be blamed on mainstream Islam, that nothing will change our way of life. These are now the familiar reassurances repeated as a mantra after every atrocity.At Paddington Station this morning, in half a dozen conversations, no one admitted to fear. Charlotte Lewis, a tutor whose office is on the high street in Bermondsey where the attacks took place, scoffed at the idea that these events would affect her. She was, she said, annoyed that the disruption had made her train late. But no, she wasn\u2019t scared at all. This was the price of living in a city. She was just back from Rio, where there had been riots; much worse happened elsewhere.A bearded Hungarian tourist with his Korean girlfriend, pulling their suitcases, shrugged the threat off. No, they were not at all frightened; the chances of terror affecting them were minute. Sam, a young banker, was equally philosophical. Keep police funding up and remember that these people were a tiny minority of Muslims. John, a songwriter, said he was just pissed off. If it happened to you, it was bad luck. You were much more likely to die in a car crash. These people were bastards, but what could you do?Cultures live by myths. These create their own reality. Britons may not know much history, but they all know about the spirit of the Blitz, and many lived through the bombing campaigns of the Irish Republican Army of the 1970s and \u201980s. Many will remember that, in 1984, on the day Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and half her cabinet team were blown out of their beds in the early morning by the Brighton bomb, in which five people died, she insisted that the Conservative Party conference should still start as scheduled at 9.30 a.m.Terrorism, she said, would never cripple democracy. The country is proud of that stoicism, and on the whole, wishes to live up to it.And yet. Today, there is a ripple of unease spreading through Britain, after the third brutal and unexpected attack in three months. It is the chilling realization that whatever the antiterror strategy has been so far, it clearly hasn\u2019t worked.However many plots are being foiled, now that anyone with the access to a car or van, a kitchen knife or the internet can choose to kill, some will succeed.This is a bleak and, frankly, unbearable prospect, and it\u2019s concentrating minds. My 25-year-old son says that what terrifies him and his friends is their impotence. If this were indeed the Blitz, they could join up. If it was the \u201970s they could either fight the I.R.A. or lobby for peace talks. But here, they have no idea how to combat this, whom to talk to, how to do anything other than wait for the next atrocity to happen, and then send sympathy and hashtags in the aftermath.Others, seeing that good will and candlelit vigils have their limits, are demanding radical action. On social media and phone-ins, and in private conversations, some people are calling for the immediate internment of the 3,000 suspected radicals on the terrorist watch lists, or their deportation, or for mass aerial bombing of the Islamic States abroad.None of these will be solutions, but everyone is beginning to understand that savagery may become a regular occurrence, rather than an exceptional one \u2014 unless whoever is in government can offer a different and more successful approach.Mrs. May knows just how vulnerable she is on these issues. She is already performing unexpectedly badly in the election campaign, appearing wooden and uneasy in comparison to her Labour challenger. Normally, she and the Tories could count on scoring high for law and order, but Mrs. May is in the uncomfortable position of denouncing counterterror policies for which she herself has been responsible over the past six years (in five years as home secretary and one as prime minister).If that record is seen as lacking, the electorate may count it against her. An unsettled Britain needs something more substantial than jokes about beer.Advertisement"}

Johnson, Chicago\u2019s police superintendent, did not hide his disgust. \u201cWhere are we going, what are we doing, as a society,\u201d he asked later, \u201cthat people will actually look at those crimes taking place and not pick up the phone and dial 911?\u201dAt least two teenagers have been arrested in the attack, but no charges have been brought against any of the online witnesses. It is not clear if they have been identified or if their inaction, however morally obtuse, qualifies as a criminal act where they live. Few states have laws requiring citizens to intervene when they know a crime is taking place, and those statutes usually apply to a narrow set of circumstances.Retro Report, a series of video documentaries examining major news stories of the past and their continued resonance, harks back to the March night in 1964 when a psychopath named Winston Moseley stalked Catherine Genovese, 28, as she headed home from her job as a bar manager. In two separate attacks, he stabbed her at least 14 times and raped her.Later investigations showed that version to have been a gross exaggeration. True, some people ignored the mortally wounded woman\u2019s pleas. But only a few, it turned out, had a clear sense of what was happening, or glimpsed the attacks as they occurred. Many thought the street screams had come from drunks or perhaps quarreling lovers. And two people did in fact phone the police, though not in time to save Ms. Genovese.But the story of 38 people coldly ignoring a murder beneath their windows had a life of its own. It became emblematic of big-city apathy. The terms \u201cbystander effect\u201d and \u201cKitty Genovese syndrome\u201d entered the language.As Retro Report notes, two social psychologists in New York, John M. Darley and Bibb Latan\u00e9, conducted experiments that led them to posit that Ms. Genovese might have survived had there been fewer witnesses. Numbers can inhibit action, they concluded. \u201cYou think that if there are many people who are witness to something that other people certainly already have done something \u2014 why should it be me?\u201d Dr. Latan\u00e9 said.There is an inherent ambiguity in some situations. As with the Genovese murder, people watching events unfold in a forum like Facebook Live may not be sure what they are seeing or hearing: Is that a real crime or a simulation?Still, it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to figure out what the philosopher John Stuart Mill might have thought of all this.Advertisement"}

A picture purportedly of an infected screen at a Cadbury chocolate factory in Tasmania, which included a demand for $300 in Bitcoin in exchange for the recovery of files, was circulating Monday on Twitter. But while Qantas was quick to own its technical flaws, the candy maker kept it vague.When we reached out to the company to ask what was going on, a spokeswoman for Mondelez International, the American company that owns Cadbury, admitted that its systems were down without explicitly confirming that it was a victim of ransomware.It did say it was working quickly to address the global outage.

{"Headline": "For Grieving Parents, Trump Is \u2018Speaking for the Dead\u2019 on Immigration", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byThe families could reel off all the times they had called the media and written to Washington, but after all that trying, they had never heard anyone who mattered say anything like it: Most Mexican immigrants, Donald J. Trump declared in his first campaign speech, were \u201crapists\u201d who were \u201cbringing drugs, bringing crime\u201d across the border.Now he had come to meet them, the families of people killed by undocumented immigrants, and they wanted to tell him he was right.One son had been struck by a truck, another shot just around the corner from home. Different causes of death, but the driver, the gunman, all the perpetrators were the same, the parents said: people who never should have been in the country in the first place.It was a surprise, but no one seemed to mind. Several stepped up to endorse Mr. Trump.\u201cHe\u2019s speaking for the dead,\u201d said Jamiel Shaw Sr., whose teenage son was shot to death by a gang member in Los Angeles in 2008. \u201cHe\u2019s speaking for my son.\u201dMr. Shaw wanted the news media to know that Mr. Trump could have gone further when he called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals.\u201cI would have said they were murderers,\u201d he said.Hailed for bravery, accused of racism, scorned as puppets, these are some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most potent surrogates, the people whose private anguish has formed the emotional cornerstone of his crusade against illegal immigration and clouded the futures of America\u2019s 11 million unauthorized immigrants.Their alliance came down to this: To parents parched for understanding, Mr. Trump was a gulp of hope. The Trump campaign flew them to speak at rallies and at the Republican National Convention, put them up in Trump hotels and kept in touch with regular phone calls and messages. After his victory, Mr. Trump invited at least one to the Inaugural Ball and seated three more with the first lady during his first address to Congress.Then and since, they have defended him on social media and in the press, assuring the world that, with President Trump in office, their children will not have died in vain.This week, the House of Representatives plans to vote on a bill that would intensify penalties for immigrants who re-enter the United States after being deported. The bill is named for a woman fatally shot by a man who illegally crossed the border at least five times.Sabine Durden, the mother of another victim, recalls dropping to her knees and sobbing when she first heard Mr. Trump warn of the dangers of illegal immigration. Then his campaign called.\u201cIt was almost an out-of-body experience after being so deeply hurt and nobody listening and nobody wanting to talk to you about this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like I put on a little Superwoman cape because I knew I was fighting a worthwhile fight.\u201dTo Mr. Trump\u2019s critics, the office and the people it was supposed to represent were little more than pawns in his crude attempts to make monsters out of a largely law-abiding population \u2014 one that research has shown to commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans. But here before the cameras, the secretary, John F. Kelly, was putting his hand over his heart and thanking families.Not until later, she said, did she find out from some of her son\u2019s friends in law enforcement that Mr. Tzun had come to the country illegally from Guatemala, and that he had been convicted twice of driving under the influence. He had been released on bail several weeks before the collision.At his sentencing in 2013, Mr. Tzun blamed God for the crash. Ms. Durden blamed the immigration system.\u201cIf it was an accident, I could deal with it, but this wasn\u2019t an accident, because if that guy wasn\u2019t in the country at 5:45 on July 12, 2012, my son would still be alive,\u201d she said. (Mr. Tzun was deported in 2014.)But nobody overseeing her son\u2019s case seemed willing to view his death that way, she said. \u201cYou feel like you got the runaround,\u201d she said.Ms. Durden, 59, had come to the United States from Germany when she married an American in the Army, eventually becoming a citizen. He was a Democrat, so she was a Democrat. She had never thought much about the immigration debate before Dominic died. Now it was her whole life.Then came Mr. Trump. Whenever she saw him, he greeted her with a \u201cgreat big hug,\u201d she recalled. \u201cDom\u2019s mom,\u201d he called her.\u201cHe would say, \u2018You\u2019ll never be alone again. You\u2019ll never have to fight this alone,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Durden, who went on to speak at three of his rallies.The Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, was out there talking about the need to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. When Ms. Durden heard that, she changed her voter registration to Republican the same day.In a series of recent interviews, the families described a similar trajectory: The death of a loved one. The spasm of realizing that the other driver, or the gunman, was living in the country illegally. The political awakening \u2014 for the Republicans, a hardening toward illegal immigrants; for the Democrats, a quick, grim conversion. The relief, when another \u201cangel mom\u201d or \u201cangel dad\u201d saw them on the news and found them online.Most of all, the fear that their children would diminish into fading news and Facebook tributes, horror stories circulated in the outer boroughs of the American right \u2014 until Mr. Trump thundered into their lives, bearing cameras.\u201cAs time went on and the more angry I got, that\u2019s when I got more active,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is how I deal with my grief.\u201dFor another parent who came to the Beverly Hills meeting, Don Rosenberg, a self-described lifelong liberal from Westlake Village, Calif., it was hard to embrace Mr. Trump, even if he had the right idea about immigration.As he watched Mr. Trump announce his presidential bid on TV, \u201cI\u2019m saying to myself, he\u2019s talking about illegal immigration \u2014 why did it have to be Trump?\u201d said Mr. Rosenberg, 64, whose 25-year-old son died in a motorcycle accident in 2010. He had been struck by a Honduran man in the country illegally. \u201cTo me, an immigration policy isn\u2019t, \u2018Build a wall, Mexico will pay for it.\u2019\u201dStill, by the election, Mr. Rosenberg had come around. He said that he had not voted for either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump, knowing it was not likely to make a difference in California, but that if he had lived in a swing state, he would probably have cast his ballot for Mr. Trump.Here was the paradox of Donald Trump, the unfiltered tycoon who seemed as far away as Fifth Avenue and as close up as the living room TV. Even as a legion of critics warned he was pandering to his fans on the way to betraying them, the alliance he had made with the families felt, to many of them, like an unshakable bond.The thing was, he paid attention. And he never stopped.The other families received regular care from the campaign, too. A Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, would call or text at least once a month, inviting them to speak at rallies or just checking in. Some spoke regularly to Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time, or to Hope Hicks, the campaign\u2019s spokeswoman.A few of the parents also regularly texted with Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime bodyguard and current Oval Office aide. It was Mr. Schiller whom the president sent to hand-deliver a letter to James B. Comey informing him he was no longer director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.As the campaign offered a national audience to more of the parents, however, many of the Remembrance Project\u2019s members abandoned the group, chafing at what several said were its founder\u2019s attempts to dictate what they said and even what they wore. Mr. Trump, they said, had allowed them their own voice.Before going onstage at some events, Mr. Trump would shoo aides away for a private moment with the families.\u201cTo me, I find it much more personal when the president comes up to you and says, \u2018Steve, how are you doing?\u2019\u201d Mr. Ronnebeck said. \u201cHe knows my name. He doesn\u2019t just, you know, speak the whole time. He listens.\u201dFor the Trump campaign, the private cultivation paid off. In public, the families became some of the campaign\u2019s most compelling witnesses.They could be picked out by what they carried, the talismans of absence: the T-shirts printed with photographs of the smiling dead. The commemorative buttons. The ashes held close in a locket.At one rally in Phoenix in August, a hush muted the crowd when Mr. Ronnebeck and other family members approached the microphone, one by one, to speak about a lost son or daughter.\u201cI truly believe that Mr. Trump is going to change things,\u201d Mr. Ronnebeck said, his voice catching.\u201cI\u2019ve met Sarah\u2019s beautiful family,\u201d the nominee said. \u201cBut to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn\u2019t worth protecting.\u201dHe also mentioned the case that, at least on the right, had come to define the dangers of illegal immigration: that of Kathryn Steinle, a 32-year-old woman shot to death on a San Francisco pier in 2015. The suspect was an ex-felon from Mexico who had been deported five times. A few months before Ms. Steinle\u2019s death, the local authorities had released him from jail without notifying federal immigration agents.\u201cMy opponent wants sanctuary cities,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to local governments, including San Francisco, that limit their cooperation with immigration officials. \u201cBut where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?\u201dFor all the heat the Steinle case generated, however, her family kept a distance from the campaign, occasionally breaking their silence to voice discomfort with the way her death had become a political grenade. (Through their lawyer, they declined to comment.)Politics makes public playthings of private lives. As their losses came to eclipse everything else about them, the families became, in Mr. Trump\u2019s telling, living testimonials to all that was broken about the immigration system.Still, those who appeared on the campaign\u2019s behalf said they had never felt like props. Mr. Trump was no more using them, they said, than Mrs. Clinton was using hardworking Hispanic families to humanize the issue.\u201cHe\u2019s never once asked us to speak,\u201d said Michelle Root, 48, Sarah Root\u2019s mother. \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen to speak.\u201dIt looked very different to the other side, of course. People on social media, and even some friends, did not hesitate to let them know that they thought they were being used. Lots of people called them racist. They insisted that they were not, emphasizing that they did not think all undocumented immigrants were bad.For the families, such studies were beside the point. To them, illegal immigration was an epidemic of preventable deaths.The glare of other people\u2019s judgment did get to them sometimes. Mr. Ronnebeck took a break from social media for six weeks, as the anniversary of Grant\u2019s death passed, then the inauguration, then Grant\u2019s birthday.\u201cThere\u2019s people that think I\u2019m a racist and there\u2019s people out there that think I\u2019m the devil,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets to a point where you just can\u2019t do the negative anymore.\u201dNot for long, though. With Mr. Trump in the White House, they could take their message straight to the corridors of power. Some hope the president will revoke Obama-era protections for young undocumented immigrants; others pray to see the wall built.\u201cI think we could email or text or even pick up the phone, for some of them, and call them and have them pass it on,\u201d Ms. Root said of her contacts in the White House. \u201cAnd he would listen. He might not agree, and might not do it, but I know our voice would be heard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One was wounded by gunfire, and one suffered other, minor injuries.The tragedy united Republicans and Democrats in shock and anguish. \u201cFor all the noise and all the fury, we are one family,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday afternoon.Standing at second base, Mr. Scalise was struck once in the left hip, according to witnesses, and collapsed as the shots rang out, one after another, from behind a chain-link fence near the third-base dugout. Witnesses said Mr. Scalise, of Louisiana, \u201carmy crawled\u201d from the infield to the grass as the shooting continued.Doctors operated immediately, but additional surgery is required, the hospital said.Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, made a trip to the hospital on Wednesday night, arriving with two large bouquets of white flowers. The president sat privately with Mr. Scalise, and spoke with his doctors and wife, Jennifer, for about 15 minutes. He also briefly chatted with Capitol Police officers there before returning to the White House.Tim Slater, special agent in charge of the bureau\u2019s Washington field office, said that investigators were \u201cexploring all angles\u201d but that he could not comment on a motive. Asked whether the shooting was an assassination attempt, he said it was \u201ctoo early in the investigation to say one way or another.\u201d\u201cHe was hunting us at that point,\u201d said Representative Mike Bishop, Republican of Michigan, who was standing at home plate when the shooting began.8 PhotosMr. Bishop said the gunman had seemed to be firing a series of two shots at a time, a firearms technique known as \u201cdouble-tapping,\u201d sending off bullets that kicked up the gravel on the baseball field as they struck the ground. \u201cThere was so much gunfire, you couldn\u2019t get up and run,\u201d Mr. Bishop said. \u201cPop, pop, pop, pop \u2014 it\u2019s a sound I\u2019ll never forget.\u201dSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who was among the lawmakers practicing for the annual charity baseball game, which is still scheduled to take place on Thursday, told CNN that \u201cthe field was basically a killing field \u2014 it\u2019s really sick and very sad.\u201dRepresentative Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, who left the practice just before the shooting, said afterward that he had encountered a man in the parking lot \u2014 later identified as the gunman \u2014 who \u201casked me if the team practicing was a Democrat or a Republican team.\u201d\u201cI told him they were Republicans,\u201d the lawmaker recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018O.K., thanks,\u2019 turned around.\u201dThe shooting stunned the capital as it began its workday. Out of caution, Capitol Police officials said they quickly put in place a \u201crobust police presence throughout the Capitol complex,\u201d and the Secret Service added security around the White House.Mr. Ryan addressed his colleagues in the House chamber shortly after noon. \u201cWe do not shed our humanity when we enter this chamber,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, his voice seeming to nearly break at times.As the magnitude of the episode became apparent, House leaders canceled the day\u2019s votes, and Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence canceled speeches.\u201cWe may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation\u2019s capital is here because, above all, they love our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House shortly after the shooting.Mr. Hodgkinson seemed to be a fervent opponent of Mr. Trump. He signed an online petition calling for the president to be impeached, posting it on Facebook with a chilling comment: \u201cIt\u2019s time to destroy Trump & co.\u201dThe F.B.I. said it appeared that Mr. Hodgkinson arrived in the area in March and had been living out of a white van near the field.Mr. Hodgkinson also appeared to have been a fervent fan of Senator Bernie Sanders, according to a Facebook page with references to the Vermont senator. A LinkedIn page for James Hodgkinson had a profile photo showing Mr. Sanders\u2019s famous hair and glasses and the words, \u201cThe Dawn of a New Democracy.\u201dIn a statement Wednesday morning, Mr. Sanders said he had been told the suspect had volunteered for his presidential campaign. He offered his \u201chopes and prayers\u201d for the shooting victims.\u201cI am sickened by this despicable act,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cLet me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society, and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. Real change can only come about through nonviolent action.\u201dOthers who were wounded included Zachary Barth, a member of Representative Roger Williams\u2019s staff, who was struck in the leg by a bullet, and Matt Mika, a former congressional staff member and the director of government relations for the Washington office of Tyson Foods, who was shot twice in the chest.He was in serious condition. Mr. Barth was treated at a hospital and later released.Five people were shot at a morning practice about five miles from the Capitol, the police said.Mr. Williams, of Texas, praised the two officers as \u201cheroes,\u201d saying that their split-second decision to confront the gunman saved many lives.\u201cWe saw two people risk their lives to save others; we saw courage in the face of death,\u201d Mr. Williams said in a news conference Wednesday evening. \u201cThere could have easily been 25 deaths or more today.\u201dMembers of the baseball team began arriving early Wednesday morning at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, which is nestled among a neighborhood dog park, the local Y.M.C.A., a coffee shop and a grocery store.By 7:09 a.m., when the first shots rang out, several dozen lawmakers, members of their staffs and a handful of others \u2014 many wearing red shirts with \u201cRepublicans\u201d on the front \u2014 had been practicing hitting, pitching and catching for more than a half-hour.Then bedlam erupted.With the sound of loud bangs, one after another, people dived for cover, crouching down by the concrete wall of the dugout. Marty Lavor, an Alexandria-based photographer and former House staff member, fell on top of a lawmaker as someone shouted: \u201cStay down, stay down. Get closer to the wall!\u201dMr. Lavor later found a bullet hole in his car.Standing along the first-base sideline, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona crouched near the ground and then helped Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama treat Mr. Barth, the congressional aide, who had been shot in the leg while in center field and had managed to stumble into the dugout. Mr. Brooks said he had used his belt as a tourniquet to help stop the bleeding.\u201cIt seemed like it went forever,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who injured his foot as he jumped into the dugout.Standing near second base, Mr. Scalise had nowhere to hide.Several lawmakers said they saw him go down and then try to pull himself toward the dugout with his hands. Failing to get very far, Mr. Scalise remained in the field while the barrage of bullets continued, according to several lawmakers who said they had been forced to wait until the shooting stopped to reach him.\u201cIf not for the detail who stepped up with basic revolvers, we would\u2019ve all been dead,\u201d Representative Bishop said.At a second news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Slater, the F.B.I. official, said the gunman was shot multiple times in the torso. It is not clear whether Mr. Hodgkinson was shot by Capitol Police officers or those from the Alexandria Police Department.\u201cIt was a combat situation,\u201d said Michael L. Brown, the Alexandria police chief.When the hail of bullets stopped, Mr. Flake and Mr. Brooks made their way to Mr. Scalise, bringing water for him to drink. Mr. Flake told CNN that he had put pressure on Mr. Scalise\u2019s gunshot wound. He said Mr. Scalise never lost consciousness.The gunshots shattered the quiet morning in the residential neighborhood.David Miller, 50, was finishing his coffee when he heard the \u201cpop, pop.\u201d He thought it was from nearby construction until he opened the door of the building and saw people looking for shelter and heard gunfire. \u201cI started hollering for them to come into the building,\u201d he said.Five or six people came inside, at least two people in baseball uniforms and one with a baseball bat. \u201cThey were disheveled,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cemotionally shaken, covered in dirt.\u201dReporting was contributed by Kitty Bennett, Avantika Chilkoti, Helene Cooper, Nicholas Fandos, Jacey Fortin, Christine Hauser, Damon Darlin, Christopher Mele, Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Sarah Kerr and Eric Schmitt.Advertisement"}

How do I know if I\u2019m having a heat stroke?Heat strokes occur when the body\u2019s temperature rises quickly. Signs include confusion, hallucinations, weakness, dizziness and nausea. Skin can be either hot and dry, or cold and clammy.Who\u2019s at risk? \u201cA lot of people think the heat affects people who are working outside or exercising, but actually most of our deaths occur with people who are inside their own home who are not using an air conditioner,\u201d Dr. Toprani said. People age 65 or over are particularly vulnerable, as are those who have a chronic illness, have mental health issues, are homebound, or are substance abusers.How can we prevent heat stroke?What about working, exercising or playing outdoors?Can certain foods help prevent a heat stroke?\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you want to eat ice cream, but that\u2019s not going to be a health or safety measure for you,\u201d Dr. Toprani said. \u201cYou\u2019re not trying to externally cool down your body \u2014 your goal is to make sure your body\u2019s mechanisms can cool itself down,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to drink a lot of water.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Our city has long been at the forefront of musical creativity and innovation \u2014 think Broadway show tunes, hip-hop, jazz, punk rock and salsa, to name a few.A few (free) events this week:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Grim Echoes for Families: An Officer Shoots and a Jury Acquits", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byST. PAUL \u2014 When the verdict came down on Friday \u2014 another police officer found not guilty in the killing of another black man \u2014 a father 700 miles away, in Oklahoma, felt as if he were watching a sickening replay of his own son\u2019s fate. Other families of those killed in previous police shootings, who happened to be gathered in Detroit for a conference this past week, felt reverberations of their own pain.After all of the public scrutiny, nationwide protests and grisly videos of police shootings over the past several years, few officers are criminally charged, and when the rare case is prosecuted, hopes rise that justice will be served. More often than not, officers are not convicted, raising a question: Do divisions widen more between the police and their communities if people view the justice system as having failed than if there had been no prosecution, no deeper look, at all?In many of these cases, questions of guilt do not hinge on who fired the fatal shot, but on what officers were thinking when they pulled the trigger.\u201cAs soon as the officer gets on the stand and subjectively says, \u2018I was fearing for my life,\u2019 many juries are not going to convict at that point,\u201d Mr. Stinson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it over and over again.\u201dWhen Mr. Crutcher\u2019s father, the Rev. Joey Crutcher, 69, heard about Friday\u2019s verdict, he said, his thoughts turned to his son and parallels between the case in Minnesota and his son\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through this time and time again in different cities,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think that police have free rein and they can just do whatever they want and they are going to get off.\u201dMr. Crutcher said the legal process could take a toll on family members who attend court hoping for justice but must watch videos of their loved one dying again and again. \u201cI relived that night during the course of hearings and during the trial,\u201d he said. \u201cThey played over and over again that video where my son was walking with his hands up, and I knew what my son was doing. He was remembering what I told him to do. If you\u2019re stopped by the police, raise your hands and put them on the car.\u201dAdvocates for law enforcement officers said the acquittals were signs of weak cases filed by prosecutors in response to public outcries. Earl Gray, a lawyer for Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who shot Mr. Castile, said the trial against his client had gone forward largely because of political pressure and a flood of attention over a video that Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend had streamed live on Facebook in the moments after the shooting. \u201cA lot of publicity was generated\u201d from the video, Mr. Gray said, \u201cwhich of course caused Ramsey County to charge Officer Yanez.\u201dBut for activists and the 2,000 protesters who gathered in St. Paul on Friday night, the not-guilty verdict was a painful injustice.Mr. Castile\u2019s mother said after the verdict that she had believed her son\u2019s death would be the case to upend the pattern of \u201cnot guilties\u201d and deadlocked juries.The Facebook live video of Mr. Castile\u2019s last, bloody moments after being shot had set off two weeks of protests here over the police\u2019s use of force, and touched off a chorus of demands to prosecute Officer Yanez. When he was charged with manslaughter, legal observers said it appeared to be the first time a Minnesota police officer had been indicted in an on-duty shooting death of a civilian. \u201cThis time we didn\u2019t have a man fleeing from the scene,\u201d said Glenda Hatchett, a lawyer for the Castile family. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a man fighting the police. We had a man who was fully compliant, as his mother taught him.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what more could have been done,\u201d she added.But the jury\u2019s verdict on the fifth day of deliberations after a three-week trial showed how different the same shooting could appear to protesters gathered outside the State Capitol than to 12 people inside a jury room. Prosecutors and Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, said Mr. Castile had been shot as he reached for his identification. But defense lawyers said Officer Yanez believed that Mr. Castile was reaching for his gun. In a dashboard camera recording before the shooting, Mr. Castile \u2014 who was licensed to carry a gun \u2014 can be heard calmly informing Officer Yanez about the weapon.Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, said many officers were paying attention to jury decisions in police trials like Officer Yanez\u2019s. \u201cThis isn\u2019t cause for celebration,\u201d he said. \u201cA man\u2019s dead. An officer\u2019s career is over. And a split-second decision turned into tragedy. But again, I think what\u2019s missed in the conversation is that sometimes cops do get it wrong. But there\u2019s a difference between getting it wrong and acting criminally.\u201dJohn J. Choi, the elected prosecutor of Ramsey County, defended his decision to bring charges and said he recognized that the verdict would disappoint many who, though skeptical, had decided to give the justice system a chance this time. \u201cThere was ample evidence. If the jury wanted to, if they chose to choose those facts, they would have got a conviction,\u201d Mr. Choi said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that it didn\u2019t work out as the Castile family would have liked. But the process, we can\u2019t control it.\u201dMitch Smith reported from St. Paul, Yamiche Alcindor from Washington, and Jack Healy from Denver.

{"Headline": "The Simplest Shortbread You Can Bake", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteMost good cooks have a few go-to dishes they can whip up without a recipe, dependable things to make on autopilot that can be adapted to fit their hunger, the contents of their fridge, or the occasion at hand.This truth doesn\u2019t always extend to bakers, who are often at the mercy of a more complicated formula for their cakes and meringues. Shortbread, however, is one rich and crumbly exception.Consisting of only four ingredients that you probably already have on hand (butter, sugar, flour and salt), and lacking in challenging techniques, shortbread is quick to master and always delightful to serve, especially as a crisp counterpart to all the soft summer fruit that\u2019s just coming into season.What makes shortbread so accessible is the simple ratio of its ingredients: one stick butter to one cup flour, with sugar and salt added to taste.I like my shortbread on the sweeter, saltier side. But feel free to take the sugar and salt down if you want something more restrained.In Scotland, shortbread is often made with a combination of rice flour and wheat flour, which gives it a distinctive brittle crispness. Rice flour has become easier to find in the United States, thanks to a growing demand for gluten-free alternatives to wheat flour. If you can get it and like a pronounced crunch, try substituting it for half a cup of the all-purpose flour. Other flours like whole wheat, buckwheat and cornmeal are also options for changing things up.Classic shortbread generally doesn\u2019t have any other flavorings beyond those of the core ingredients. At its simplest, it tastes of good butter and not much else. So always use the best butter you can get.If you do want to add flavors, you can, as long as you don\u2019t add more than a teaspoon or so of liquid (vanilla, almond extract or rum, for example) to the dough. Anything more than that can make the cookies soft rather than crisp. Dry ingredients like spices, citrus zest and vanilla seeds work better for preserving the brittle crumble of the cookie. You can also add nuts and seeds for texture and flavor.Then bake your shortbread low and slow. It shouldn\u2019t take on much color in the oven, staying pale on top, turning gold at the edges. Once it\u2019s baked and stored airtight, it will maintain its crunch for weeks \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t get devoured first.cookingAdvertisement"}

Central bank officials were quick to point out that Mr. Draghi did not say that he would tighten policy immediately.

{"Headline": "Uber Weighs Leave of Absence for Chief Executive", "Date": "2017-06-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facing accusations that Uber executives turned a blind eye to sexual harassment and other corporate misbehavior, the ride-hailing service\u2019s board moved on Sunday to shake up the company\u2019s leadership, ahead of the release this week of an investigation\u2019s findings on its troubled culture.In addition, a representative for Uber\u2019s board said the directors \u201cunanimously voted\u201d to adopt all of the recommendations made in a report by the former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., who was retained to investigate the company\u2019s culture. One of the recommendations included the departure of a top lieutenant to Mr. Kalanick, Emil Michael, said the people with knowledge of the board\u2019s agenda, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential.The moves would scale back the involvement of Mr. Kalanick and strip him of an ally, a turnabout for a chief executive who had been hailed as an innovator and a role model. The changes would also further destabilize the leadership at Uber, which has upended the transportation industry worldwide, at a time when rivals are trying to capitalize on the company\u2019s woes.The discussions by the nine-member board preceded a report from Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation, scheduled to be released on Tuesday. In recent months, Uber has fired more than 20 employees for infractions including sexual harassment and discrimination.\u201cThis starts at the very top,\u201d said Micah Alpern, a principal at A. T. Kearney, a top management and consulting firm. \u201cThey need to start from scratch to create a new culture entirely.\u201dUber\u2019s current crisis stems from claims in February from a former engineer, Susan Fowler, that she had been routinely sexually harassed when she worked at the company and that the human resources department had done little to help her. An outpouring of other cases followed, and Uber retained at least two law firms \u2014 including Covington & Burling \u2014 to look into the matters.Uber has since faced other problems, including an intellectual property dispute over self-driving car technology with Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google\u2019s parent company. Uber also is dealing with a Justice Department investigation into tools that it used to evade law enforcement personnel in cities where the authorities were trying to shut down its ride-hailing service. Many executives have left the company in recent months.Even so, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s position has for months seemed secure, especially because of how the company is structured. Uber\u2019s board follows a \u201cfounder-friendly\u201d governance structure, made popular in Silicon Valley by Google and Facebook. Seven of Uber\u2019s nine board members hold so-called super-voting shares, allowing them to have a stronger say in the board room. Four director seats are empty.Because Mr. Kalanick and a few allies hold a majority of those shares, his position has been safe \u2014 and would most likely remain so, even if he took a leave.Some Uber board members have expressed support for Mr. Kalanick. Garrett Camp and Ryan Graves, who have been with Uber since its early days, have long believed that Mr. Kalanick\u2019s leadership was necessary to buck an aggressive incumbent taxi industry. Arianna Huffington, the founder of the Huffington Post who is also an Uber board member, has publicly attested to Mr. Kalanick\u2019s willingness to change.J. William Gurley and David Bonderman, two venture capitalists and independent board members who also hold super-voting shares, were worried about the company\u2019s management, the people with knowledge of the matter said. Outside investors were also nervous about the string of scandals and have called board members directly about their concerns.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s executive allies were in a trickier position. One of the recommendations in Mr. Holder\u2019s report was that Mr. Michael, Uber\u2019s senior vice president of business and a close confidant of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s, be asked to leave the company, according to the three people. The firm\u2019s recommendations also include other sweeping changes at the company.Mr. Michael has not resigned, nor has he been asked to do so, according to a person familiar with the matter, but he was evaluating his options.This year, Uber\u2019s general counsel and some board members recommended that Mr. Michael take leave from his position at the company until the results of the Holder report were delivered, according to three people familiar with the matter.Mr. Michael did not respond to a request for comment.Employees and close watchers of the company worry that even the most damning conclusions of the Holder investigation could be ignored.\u201cAny response without complete buy-in from the top is a complete waste of time,\u201d said Stephen Hirschfeld, a partner at the labor law firm Hirschfeld Kraemer who regularly investigates corporate harassment issues. \u201cIt can have an even worse impact on company morale if people already know it\u2019s a total joke.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Popular People Live Longer", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byOpinionI often hear from teenagers that one of their greatest goals is to obtain more Instagram followers than anyone they know. Even some adults appear obsessed with social media, tracking the number of retweets on their Twitter profiles or likes on Facebook. This type of status-seeking might be easily dismissed as juvenile or superficial, but there\u2019s more to it.Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a psychologist at Brigham Young University, consolidated data from 148 investigations published over 28 years on the effects of social relationships, collectively including over 308,000 participants between the ages of 6 and 92 from all over the world. In each study, investigators measured the size of participants\u2019 networks, the number of their friends, whether they lived alone, and the extent to which they participated in social activities. Then they followed each participant for months, years and even decades to track his or her mortality rate.The human body\u2019s sensitivity to popularity may reflect the effects of natural selection over thousands of years. Anthropologists believe that it was humans\u2019 ability to form and comprehend more complex vocal sounds \u2014 the rudiments of language, and the foundation of our identity as a social species \u2014 that enabled us to survive, ultimately outlasting our hominid neighbors like the Neanderthals, Denisovans and Homo floresiensis. As social beings, we protected one another, shared resources and collaborated to gain advantages over other species.George Slavich and Steve Cole, experts in the field of human social genomics at the University of California, Los Angeles, have described our genomic material as being exquisitely \u201csensitive to social rejection.\u201d They study what happens immediately after we\u2019ve been left by a romantic partner, excluded from a social event, rejected by a stranger or even simply told that we may be judged by others we care about. Within 40 minutes, they and other researchers have found, these experiences affect the expression of individual genes, determining which parts of our DNA are turned on or off (called epigenetics). Even imagining that we might lose our connection to the herd, they have found, can change how DNA behaves.This process may affect only a few dozen out of at least 20,000 genes, but even that small number seems significant. According to Professors Slavich and Cole, those affected genes play an important role in our immune systems. Some are linked to the body\u2019s inflammation response, which is critical for healing wounds or fighting bacterial infections. The professors suggest that this cellular-level response to rejection may be nature\u2019s mechanism to help those who were unpopular. Millenniums ago, individuals who had no peers to protect them were vulnerable to injury or attack. Those whose bodies preemptively activated a \u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d response that prepared them to heal from any impending wounds were the most likely to survive.Other genes implicated in reactions to rejection are related to viral protection. Professors Slavich and Cole suggest that ancestral humans who had no peers to defend them no longer had a great need to be protected from viruses \u2014 who would infect them? \u2014 so their bodies conserved energy by reducing their vigilance to infection.Being unfriended on Facebook doesn\u2019t make you more vulnerable to attack by saber-toothed tiger, but our bodies may still be responding as they did 60,000 years ago. Today humans suffer from a wide range of diseases related to chronic inflammation, like cancer, asthma and Alzheimer\u2019s. We\u2019re also very likely to catch the common cold.That\u2019s most likely why our concern for social standing begins so early and persists throughout our lives. Dozens of studies reveal that children\u2019s popularity can be measured reliably by age 3, and it remains remarkably stable not just through the next dozen years of primary and secondary education but also across contexts, as they move from community to community and into adulthood.Anyone who has been to high school will recognize the distinction \u2014 and recall that those high in one category are often low in the other. Research suggests that despite the great temptations to gain status, those who achieve it ultimately experience greater unhappiness and dissatisfaction, while those who are likable have far greater satisfaction and success.We may be built by evolution to care deeply about popularity, but it\u2019s up to us to choose the nature of the relationships we want with our peers.Which means that it wouldn\u2019t kill you to step away from Twitter once in a while.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Across Russia, Protesters Heed Navalny\u2019s Anti-Kremlin Rallying Cry", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 An extraordinary wave of antigovernment protests swept across Russia on Monday, as thousands of demonstrators gathered in more than 100 cities to denounce corruption and political stagnation despite official attempts to stifle the expression of outrage.The recent outpourings of popular discontent, spurred on by Mr. Navalny, have been the biggest antigovernment demonstrations in Russia in years.After witnessing the geographic sweep of the protests on Monday and the enthusiastic resolve of the mostly young participants in the face of a harsh police presence, some analysts came away saying that Russian politics was being reborn.\u201cI think we are seeing the beginning of a youth protest movement,\u201d said Anatoly Golubovsky, a Russian historian surveying the crowd at one corner of Moscow\u2019s Pushkin Square, which erupted in vigorous jeers of \u201cShame\u201d whenever a phalanx of riot police officers rushed into the crowd to drag someone away.Mr. Golubovsky ticked off cities across Russia where protesters had turned out: an estimated 4,000 in Novosibirsk, as well as in Omsk and other large Siberian cities. There were energetic demonstrations in Vladivostok in the Far East, and in large cities in southern Russia like Rostov-on-Don and Krasnodar.\u201cAll these regions were considered to be very conservative and not politicized, very loyal to the power,\u201d he said, referring to the Kremlin. \u201cAnd they turned out to be politicized.\u201d\u201cI cannot remember, and old-timers, as they say, cannot remember, when was the last time in Russia that so many people attended demonstrations in different cities,\u201d said Georgy Alburov, the deputy head of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, started by Mr. Navalny.As the crowd in Moscow surged this way and that to avoid the charging police officers, Mr. Alburov expressed a sense of accomplishment. \u201cWe are very happy that so many people share our views and are ready to go to demonstrations,\u201d he said.The protests were ostensibly focused on government corruption, but other issues, like economic doldrums and the mass demolition of apartments, brought people onto the street. Many participants said they were disgusted at the gradual dismantling of democracy in Russia, and of any semblance of a real opposition.\u201cI came here not because of the corruption,\u201d said Nikita Orlov, 18, a student in international law. \u201cI came here because we have no democracy, our Parliament is not real, our politicians are not real and our mass media is not real.\u201dThose sentiments were not limited to Moscow.In Naberezhnye Chelny, a usually dormant city of 500,000 that lies 600 miles east of Moscow, around 230 people turned out.Officials authorized the rally, but, as in many cities, they relegated the protesters to a long-neglected park in the outskirts where they were practically hidden among the trees and anonymous apartment blocks.Sergei Trokhin, one of the organizers in Naberezhnye Chelny, turned 20 on Monday. Two years ago, he was studying at a local college to become a construction worker, and said he ignored politics. That changed as economic hardships worsened in the town, which, like hundreds of towns across Russia, is heavily dependent on one industry: in this case, a truck factory.\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t get a raise for four years, while prices only grew,\u201d Mr. Trokhin said, adding that the protests were about more than Mr. Navalny, even if the director of his college warned him that the protests would help Mr. Navalny \u201cdestroy Russia.\u201dIn Naberezhnye Chelny, some onlookers expressed skepticism, too. \u201cMr. Navalny is a thief, just like all of them,\u201d said Dmitri Ivanov, 34, a factory manager. \u201cLook at these people,\u201d he said, pointing to the crowd. \u201cThey are just kids. They know nothing. They need to graduate from school first.\u201dMr. Navalny called the rally on Russia Day, a national holiday, to underscore the idea that protesters are patriots, too. The Interior Ministry said that more than seven million people had participated in various celebrations around the country. That would dwarf the protest participation.In Moscow, officials organized historical re-enactments to celebrate Russian achievements from medieval times through World War II. The juxtaposition of the protests and the re-enactments caused some confusion.A wall of sandbags erected across Tverskaya Street in Moscow, by the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, seemed designed to block protesters but turned out to be part of the re-enactments. Walls of riot police officers and police vehicles lining the street were all too real.At one point, men dressed as medieval knights held a sword fight in the middle of a street as chants of \u201cRussia without Putin\u201d erupted from protesters nearby.On Pushkin Square, protesters were being physically carted off while a singer at a free Russia Day concert belted out a Russian version of \u201cThose Were the Days.\u201dMr. Navalny, jailed for 15 days for organizing the March protests, was sentenced to 30 days on similar charges this time after moving the Moscow demonstrations downtown, away from a street approved by the city.Organizers in more than 200 cities filed requests to hold demonstrations on Monday. Around 120 were granted, 50 were rejected, and the fate of the rest was unclear. Some cities tried to play games with the organizers.In an unsubtle hint, the burly Cossacks who gathered in camouflage uniforms or czarist-era outfits put on a display of how to smash eggs with a horsewhip.After gathering nearby to chant against corruption and to wave copies of the Russian Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and assembly, the demonstrators paraded through narrow streets with Russian flags to an esplanade overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\u201cRussia without Putin,\u201d they shouted. One banner said \u201cPower must be changeable,\u201d a reference to tightly controlled elections that mostly consolidate the power of Mr. Putin and his allies.The rally broke up after riot police officers plunged into the crowd and dragged away protesters. At least 11 protesters were detained, according to OVD-Info.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the men in uniform at a protest in Vladivostok, Russia.

{"Headline": "At Cannes, the Great Gusher of Content Comes With Warning Signs", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byMediatorThen, prospectors were chasing the real world currency of crude. Now, they\u2019re after the new currency of the connected world: your attention.As it was in those early days of oil discovery, there was a sense in Cannes last week that happy days were here or just around the corner. It was a week of seaside fireworks; popping magnum corks; private performances by Eddie Vedder, Solange Knowles, and Stevie Nicks; and behind-the-scenes deal making.But, similar to Texas in the early 1900s, there was also an undercurrent of lawlessness. And there was the creeping realization that no one really knows where it\u2019s all going \u2014 how the new digital media innovations will reshape politics, culture and even the world order.The great geyser of our times, of course, is the hand-held connectivity that Steve Jobs tapped with his iPhone, and that Google, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat now so powerfully refine and distribute on their social media platforms.Given that the limit is no longer the number of channels on the television dial but the daily human capacity to consume media, the rush is on to get even better at divining what you want before you even know you want it \u2014 and to make sure it\u2019s available in ample supply.\u201cIt\u2019s chaos,\u201d Shane Smith, the brash co-founder and chief executive of Vice Media, told me Thursday afternoon as he sipped wine on the rocks at his sumptuous seaside villa in Cap d\u2019Antibes, Cannes\u2019 even more exclusive neighbor. \u201cBut in the midst of the chaos there\u2019s never been more content created, more money being made. There\u2019s never been more stuff being sold, and for me on my end, there\u2019s never been more people buying content.\u201dMr. Smith was a coveted dance partner at the festival, which was founded as a celebration of quality advertising but is now overwhelmed by deal making and schmoozing. His young audience \u2014 which lives on its devices \u2014 is the one that advertisers covet.Mr. Smith is known for his promotional acumen, but others reported similar success. And so, in Cannes, you could see the frenzied activity feeding itself, pitching forward into the abyss.The message is clear. Content costs money, and marketers will continue to subsidize it if it allows them to pitch their wares effectively. But people don\u2019t want to spend time watching 30-second ads, not when information moves at the speed of Twitter.But where does that leave messaging for far more complex issues like health care \u2014 a life-or-death subject for millions of Americans \u2014 in the coming political advertising season?Though big Silicon Valley players are working to fix that, it wasn\u2019t a topic they really wanted to elaborate on as they made rounds here.He stuck to more self-congratulatory ground, saying, \u201cIf there\u2019s one word I had to choose to represent Twitter and our force of good in the world,\u201d it was \u201cthe word \u2018open.\u2019\u201dIt was too rich when I tried to approach him afterward and his press representative told me to scram. The transparency evangelist wasn\u2019t taking questions from journalists in Cannes, I was told.Yet there were some signs that our unaccountable yet increasingly powerful social media platforms are coming to terms with the real-world consequences of their algorithmic siren calls.Too often, data is being used to \u201cdistill you to your smallest self,\u201d Spotify\u2019s chief marketer, Seth Farbman, told me. \u201cIf we\u2019re leading people into discovering \u2018new,\u2019 and being comfortable with the unfamiliar, aren\u2019t we training people to be far more accepting and far more open?\u201dBut the air sure seems polluted these days.Toward the end of our meeting, Marc Pritchard, the branding chief for the world\u2019s largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, walked by and concurred. \u201cIt\u2019s fool\u2019s gold,\u201d he said.But I started this column on another commodity, oil, and I\u2019ll end on it, too.Oil fed and enabled the great advancements that came with the rise of the automobile, and made the jet age possible. But then, there were the consequences: highway blight, ozone depletion, climate change.The infoboom is taking place in a new environment \u2014 the cyber environment \u2014 where we\u2019re all spending more time. All the new opportunity it\u2019s bringing will also have consequences. Hopefully we\u2019ll head off the worst of them while we still can.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why France Is Taking a Lesson in Culture From Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byA new start-up incubator in Paris symbolizes France\u2019s tech ambitions, but can the land of the 35-hour workweek overcome its cultural and regulatory barriers to surpass London and other tech hubs? PARIS \u2014 One thousand start-ups in a refurbished train depot as long as the Eiffel Tower lying down. Rooms scattered with Legos and beanbag chairs. Elevated walkways bridging cargo-container offices and open-air desks. Graffitied railway cars transformed into cafes. The vast project in the heart of Paris, Station F, is a symbol of France\u2019s ambitions to be the start-up capital of Europe. Under an arc of glass and curved concrete, it aims to amass the largest group of entrepreneurs, venture capital firms, incubators and accelerators anywhere in the world.The ambitious effort would seem an expensive, even quixotic undertaking for France, a country better known for a 35-hour workweek and rigid labor laws. And plenty of countries are trying to emulate Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem, with varying degrees of success. Mr. Niel sees Station F as a way to help France steal Britain\u2019s crown as Europe\u2019s premier start-up hub. Raised in a gritty suburb of Paris, he is also trying to empower would-be entrepreneurs, especially marginalized youths. And he wants to capitalize on France\u2019s strength as a producer of math and engineering whizzes. \u201cWhen people talk about France, they don\u2019t see it as a small-league player anymore.\u201dTo get into Station F, start-ups had to have a business prototype and a path to growth. A group of 1,000 companies are expected to move into the space by early July. Here are three of them.Artificial intelligenceFood techHigh-tech fabricsTech leaders say France has significant potential. In 2016, French start-ups attracted record levels of investment from business angels, venture capital, growth equity funds and corporate investors \u2014 on par with Israel and in reach of Britain. Back then, the French start-up culture was virtually nonexistent. There was no ecosystem of incubators and funding. He and his co-founders relied on money from family and friends for six years before venture capital funds stepped in.Today, BlaBlaCar is one of four French \u201cunicorns\u201d (start-ups valued over $1 billion), with 45 million users in 22 countries and a global staff of 500. In France, \u201centrepreneurs used to be seen as people with nothing left to lose,\u201d said Mr. Mazzella, sitting in his company\u2019s sleek new headquarters near the Paris Bourse, a couple of floors down from Facebook\u2019s France operations. \u201cNow it\u2019s become acceptable, even desirable, to be a start-up.\u201d Failure is often stigmatized in French society \u2014 so much that the government started a campaign to persuade people that it\u2019s O.K. to take risks. More than three quarters of workers hold so-called jobs for life, and unions protest when businesses demand workplace flexibility. Taxes are high to fund France\u2019s social welfare system, and the 3,400-page labor code introduces new regulatory requirements on companies as they get larger.It is a culture sometimes at odds with entrepreneurial drive. But Mr. Oumnia has struggled to scale up. When he wanted to offer stock options to lure and retain engineers and designers, the French rules were so complex that he dropped the plan. Social\u00a0taxes pushed his employee costs to nearly twice what they would be in the United States.\u00a0The financial infrastructure isn\u2019t fully developed, either. France has around 4,500 angels, investors who take risks on first-stage start-ups, compared with 18,000 in Britain. While more venture capital is flowing into France, the levels still lag Britain, Germany and Israel.\u201cFrance has plenty of talent to create start-ups,\u201d Mr. Oumnia said. \u201cThe problem is to grow them to midsize companies that create jobs in a country where unemployment is high.\u201d \u201cRegulations and taxes have still not evolved enough to allow start-ups to flourish once they get off the ground,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped President Macron would change things. \u201cSo it\u2019s fine to say, let\u2019s create a thousand start-ups. The question is, \u2018Are you creating the environment for them to become champions after?\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe answer is, \u2018Not yet.\u2019\u201d The biggest vote of confidence in Station F is from Facebook.

{"Headline": "A Way to Own Your Social-Media Data", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn the market for social media, by contrast, when one customer uses Facebook over Myspace, it has a direct (and positive) impact on other customers\u2019 preferences for the same social network: I want to be in the social network where my friends are. These markets naturally tend toward a monopoly.Historically, there have been two main government interventions to reduce this risk of monopoly power. The first is price regulation. When railway companies gained excessive market power in the late 1800s, the United States government created the Interstate Commerce Commission and gave it the power to set maximum prices. (In the long run, the remedy turned out to be worse than the disease, but that\u2019s another story.)The second is antitrust. When Standard Oil, in the early 1900s, controlled 90 percent of oil refinery capacity in the United States, the federal government used its antitrust power to break it up into more than 30 smaller companies. A similar breakup was imposed 70 years later on AT&T.Still, there is a problem with traditional antitrust policy when looked at through the lens of network externalities: It focuses only on consumers\u2019 benefits from competition. But consumers love Google and Facebook since they do not pay a dime for their services.What many users do not fully appreciate is that they do pay for these services, in the form of very valuable information. And those who appreciate this cost have no choice: There is no major search engine that does not store our past searches or collect information on our activities, and there is no significant social media platform that does not retain our preferences. That is the cost of using these technologies. Lack of competition also means lack of choice, which is ultimately lack of freedom. But what can be done?For a 21st-century problem, we suggest a 21st-century solution: a reallocation of property rights via legislation to provide more incentives to compete. In fact, the idea is not new. Patent law, for example, attributes the right to an invention to the company a scientist works for, to motivate companies to invest in research and development. Similarly, in the mobile industry, most countries have established that a cellphone number belongs to a customer, not the mobile phone provider. This redefinition of property rights (in jargon called \u201cnumber portability\u201d) makes it easier to switch carriers, fostering competition by other carriers and reducing prices for consumers.The same is possible in the social network space. It is sufficient to reassign to each customer the ownership of all the digital connections that she creates \u2014 what is known as a \u201csocial graph.\u201d If we owned our own social graph, we could sign into a Facebook competitor \u2014 call it MyBook \u2014 and, through that network, instantly reroute all our Facebook friends\u2019 messages to MyBook, as we reroute a phone call.If I can reach my Facebook friends through a different social network and vice versa, I am more likely to try new social networks. Knowing they can attract existing Facebook customers, new social networks will emerge, restoring the benefit of competition.Today Facebook provides developers with application-program interfaces that give them access to its customers\u2019 social graph, Facebook Connect and Graph A.P.I. Facebook controls these gates, retaining the right to cut off any developer who poses a competitive threat. Anticipating this outcome, very few developers invest seriously in creating alternatives, eliminating even the threat of competition.By guaranteeing access to new customers\u2019 data and contacts, a Social Graph Portability Act would reduce the network externality dimension of the existing digital platforms and ensure the benefits of competition.Google and Facebook will no doubt display their enormous lobbying power to kill this idea in its infancy. But they would do so at their own risk. If their monopoly is not curbed by competition, it will eventually be curbed by regulation, and experience suggests that will be worse, not only for consumers, but also for Google and Facebook themselves.As the uproar over United Airlines\u2019 treatment of a passenger it ejected from a flight has shown, people\u2019s tolerance for companies\u2019 market power is running low. A \u201csocial graph to the people\u201d revolution is in the making; Congress better be in front of it or find itself overwhelmed.Luigi Zingales and Guy Rolnik are professors at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Advertisement"}

Also sprays of saltbush, shakes of Davidson plum powder, wattle seeds in many forms, jumbuck, Vegemite, snow crab, emu-egg sabayon and even a precise and witty take on the smashed avocado on toast you can find in nearly every restaurant in this city.A meal at Attica can run to 20 or more courses and last in the neighborhood of three hours. Easily half of that time could be spent learning from the servers what it is you\u2019re actually eating, where it came from and how difficult it is either to prepare or to prepare in a way that makes it delicious.\u201cYou can\u2019t look things like that up anywhere,\u201d Mr. Shewry told me during a discussion of how he develops recipes for the ingredients he finds. \u201cThere is no website. There are no recipes. You really have to work at it, experiment, think.\u201dOn a recent Sunday night at home with his family, though, there was none of this high drama and art going on in the kitchen. Instead, Mr. Shewry, 40, was keen simply to grill a few cheese kranskies on the deck behind his midcentury modern home, then wrap them in white bread with charred onions and a squeeze of ketchup.\u201cA regular Bunnings sizzle,\u201d he called it as he cooked, while his three young children stood beside him, hopping up and down in anticipation.The words come fast in Australia, and to those who have traveled from afar they can be dizzying in their unfamiliarity.It is not just those bunya-bunya nuts harvested from pine cones the size of badgers, or the wattle seeds that come off towering acacia trees. A kransky is a Slovenian-style sausage, similar to a Polish kielbasa, brought to Australia by immigrants and given a new name. You can buy them plain or cheese-filled. Mr. Shewry reckons the better version to be the one with cheese.\u201cThat is all my comfort food,\u201d he said after the kranskies, \u201cwhat I really like to eat.\u201dBut he wanted to be clear: Australian cooking, he said, ought to reflect more than simply the nation\u2019s history of immigration \u2014 the forced transportation of British convicts in the late 18th century, the arrival afterward of Chinese miners looking for gold, and the rush of Europeans in the wake of World War II. It should also celebrate the 50,000 or more years of Aboriginal history that came first, and the ingredients that made that culture possible.\u201cWhat I really, really want to do at the restaurant,\u201d Mr. Shewry said, \u201cis to bridge this immense divide between what immigrants have brought to this country and what was already here.\u201dHere, then, are the cook\u2019s leaves he serves at the start of each meal \u2014 delicate shoots of mustard and sorrel to swipe through house-made sour cream flavored with balsamic and apple. And a pomegranate tree, shaping up heavy with fruit.Here are carrots he will roast over pepper-berry leaves on a pellet grill behind the restaurant until they are dense and sweet and smoky. And there, a plum pine tree that in a few months will yield a fruit that Mr. Shewry needs to serve within three hours of harvest, lest it spoil. It rose beside its mate, tall, with lanceolate leaves and dark purple seed cones.The New York Times is rolling out expanded coverage of Australia and the region.

{"Headline": "Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of Harassment", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byTheir stories came out slowly, even hesitantly, at first. Then in a rush.One female entrepreneur recounted how she had been propositioned by a Silicon Valley venture capitalist while seeking a job with him, which she did not land after rebuffing him. Another showed the increasingly suggestive messages she had received from a start-up investor. And one chief executive described how she had faced numerous sexist comments from an investor while raising money for her online community website.What happened afterward was often just as disturbing, the women told The New York Times. Many times, the investors\u2019 firms and colleagues ignored or played down what had happened when the situations were brought to their attention. Saying anything, the women were warned, might lead to ostracism.Now some of these female entrepreneurs have decided to take that risk. More than two dozen women in the technology start-up industry spoke to The Times in recent days about being sexually harassed. Ten of them named the investors involved, often providing corroborating messages and emails, and pointed to high-profile venture capitalists such as Chris Sacca of Lowercase Capital and Dave McClure of 500 Startups.Most recently, the revelations about Mr. Caldbeck of Binary Capital have triggered an outcry. The investor has been accused of sexually harassing entrepreneurs while he worked at three different venture firms in the past seven years, often in meetings in which the women were presenting their companies to him.The chain of events has emboldened more women to talk publicly about the treatment they said they had endured from tech investors.The women\u2019s experiences help explain why the venture capital and start-up ecosystem \u2014 which underpins the tech industry and has spawned companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 has been so lopsided in terms of gender.Most venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are men, with female entrepreneurs receiving $1.5 billion in funding last year versus $58.2 billion for men, according to the data firm PitchBook. Many of the investors hold outsize power, since entrepreneurs need their money to turn ideas and innovations into a business. And because the venture industry operates with few disclosure requirements, people have kept silent about investors who cross the lines with entrepreneurs.Some of the entrepreneurs who spoke with The Times said they were often touched without permission by investors or advisers.At a mostly male tech gathering in Las Vegas in 2009, Susan Wu, an entrepreneur and investor, said that Mr. Sacca, an investor and former Google executive, touched her face without her consent in a way that made her uncomfortable. Ms. Wu said she was also propositioned by Mr. Caldbeck while fund-raising in 2010 and worked hard to avoid him later when they crossed paths.\u201cThere is such a massive imbalance of power that women in the industry often end up in distressing situations,\u201d Ms. Wu said.After the publication of this article, Mr. Sacca contacted The Times again to amend his original statement, adding: \u201cI dispute Susan\u2019s account from 2009.\u201dMany of the women also said they believed they had limited ability to push back against inappropriate behavior, often because they needed funding, a job or other help.In 2014, Sarah Kunst, 31, an entrepreneur, said she discussed a potential job at 500 Startups, a start-up incubator in San Francisco. During the recruiting process, Mr. McClure, a founder of 500 Startups and an investor, sent her a Facebook message that read in part, \u201cI was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.\u201dMs. Kunst, who now runs a fitness start-up, said she declined Mr. McClure\u2019s advance. When she later discussed the message with one of Mr. McClure\u2019s colleagues, she said 500 Startups ended its conversations with her.500 Startups said Mr. McClure, who did not respond to a request for comment, was no longer in charge of day-to-day operations after an internal investigation.\u201cAfter being made aware of instances of Dave having inappropriate behavior with women in the tech community, we have been making changes internally,\u201d 500 Startups said. \u201cHe recognizes he has made mistakes and has been going through counseling to work on addressing changes in his previous unacceptable behavior.\u201dThey put up with the comments, Ms. Renock said, because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine a world in which that $500,000 wasn\u2019t on the table anymore.\u201d Ms. Renock declined to name the investor. Wethos raised the $500,000 from someone else and is still fund-raising.Wendy Dent, 43, whose company Cinemmerse makes an app for smart watches, said she was sent increasingly flirtatious messages by a start-up adviser, Marc Canter, as she was trying to start her company in 2014. Mr. Canter, who had founded a software company in the 1980s that became known as Macromedia, initially agreed to help her find a co-founder. But over time, his messages became sexual in nature.In one message, reviewed by The Times, he wrote that she was a \u201csorceress casting a spell.\u201d In another, he commented on how she looked in a blue dress and added, \u201cKnow what I\u2019m thinking? Why am I sending you this \u2014 in private?\u201dMr. Canter, in an interview, said that Ms. Dent \u201ccame on strong to me, asking for help\u201d and that she had used her sexuality publicly. He said he disliked her ideas so he behaved the way he did to make her go away.Some entrepreneurs were asked to not speak about the behavior they experienced.At a start-up competition in 2014 in San Francisco, Lisa Curtis, an entrepreneur, pitched her food start-up, Kuli Kuli, and was told her idea had won the most plaudits from the audience, opening the door to possible investment. As she stepped off the stage, an investor named Jose De Dios, said, \u201cOf course you won. You\u2019re a total babe.\u201dMs. Curtis later posted on Facebook about the exchange and got a call from a different investor. He said \u201cthat if I didn\u2019t take down the post, no one in Silicon Valley would give me money again,\u201d she said.

That gave Mr. Caldbeck reason to constantly text her; in those messages, reviewed by The Times, he asked if she was attracted to him and why she would rather be with her boyfriend than him. At times, he groped and kissed her, she said.\u201cI felt like I had to tolerate it because this is the cost of being a nonwhite female founder,\u201d said Ms. Meyer, who is Asian-American.But even after she reached out to a mentor, who alerted one of Binary\u2019s investors, Legacy Venture, to Mr. Caldbeck\u2019s actions, little changed.

{"Headline": "The Man Who Helped Turn Toronto Into a High-Tech Hotbed", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileTORONTO \u2014 As an undergraduate at Cambridge University, Geoffrey Everest Hinton thought a lot about the brain. He wanted to better understand how it worked but was frustrated that no field of study \u2014 from physiology and psychology to physics and chemistry \u2014 offered real answers.So he set about building his own computer models to mimic the brain\u2019s process.\u201cPeople just thought I was crazy,\u201d said Dr. Hinton, now 69, a Google fellow who is also a professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Toronto.He wasn\u2019t. He became one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on artificial intelligence, designing software that imitates how the brain is believed to work. At the same time, Dr. Hinton, who left academia in the United States in part as a personal protest against military funding of research, has helped make Canada a high-tech hotbed.Dictate a text on your smartphone, search for a photo on Google or, in the not too distant future, ride in a self-driving car, and you will be using technology based partly on Dr. Hinton\u2019s ideas.His impact on artificial intelligence research has been so deep that some people in the field talk about the \u201csix degrees of Geoffrey Hinton\u201d the way college students once referred to Kevin Bacon\u2019s uncanny connections to so many Hollywood movies.Dr. Hinton\u2019s students and associates are now leading lights of artificial intelligence research at Apple, Facebook, Google and Uber, and run artificial intelligence programs at the University of Montreal and OpenAI, a nonprofit research company.\u201cI sat down in 2005,\u201d said Dr. Hinton, a tall man, with uncombed silvering hair and hooded eyes the color of the North Sea.Dr. Hinton followed the family tradition by going to Cambridge in the late 1960s. But by the time he finished his undergraduate degree, he realized that no one had a clue how people think.\u201cI got fed up with academia and decided I would rather be a carpenter,\u201d he recalled with evident delight, standing at a high table in Google\u2019s white-on-white cafe here. He was 22 and lasted a year in the trade, although carpentry remains his hobby today.But the approach fell out of favor because computers were not powerful enough then to produce meaningful results. Artificial intelligence research turned instead to using logic to solve problems.As he was having second thoughts about his carpentry skills, Dr. Hinton heard about an artificial intelligence program at the University of Edinburgh and moved there in 1972 to pursue a Ph.D. His adviser favored the logic-based approach, but Dr. Hinton focused on artificial neural networks, which he thought were a better model to simulate human thought.His study didn\u2019t make him very employable in Britain, though. So, Ph.D. in hand, he turned to the United States to work as a postdoctoral researcher in San Diego with a group of cognitive psychologists who were also interested in neural networks.They were soon making significant headway.Dr. Hinton moved in 1982 to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh as a professor, where his work with the algorithm and neural networks allowed computers to produce some \u201cinteresting internal representations,\u201d as he put it.Here\u2019s an example of how the brain produces an internal representation. When you look at a cat \u2014 for some reason cats are a favorite subject of artificial intelligence research \u2014 light waves bouncing off it hit your retina, which converts the light into electrical impulses that travel along the optic nerve to the brain. Those impulses, of course, look nothing like a cat. The brain, however, reconstitutes those impulses into an internal representation of the cat, and if you close your eyes, you can see it in your mind.\u201cIn A.I., the holy grail was how do you generate internal representations,\u201d Dr. Hinton explained.Interesting as those internal representations were from an academic point of view, computers were still too slow to recreate them in a way that mimicked the brain.At that point, Dr. Hinton was becoming disillusioned with the politics of the United States in the Reagan era. He also didn\u2019t like that most artificial intelligence research was funded by the United States military.By 2012, computers had become fast enough to allow him and his researchers to create those internal representations as well as reproduce speech patterns that are part of the translation applications we all use today.The deal made Dr. Hinton a wealthy man.Now he is turning his attention to health care, thinking that artificial intelligence technology could be harnessed to scan lesions for cancer. The combination of the Vector Institute, a surrounding cluster of hospitals and government support, he added, makes Toronto \u201cone of the best places in the world to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Road Rage Is Cited in Killing of Muslim Girl in Virginia", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byThe killing of a Muslim teenager in Virginia whose body was found in a pond on Sunday was most likely a \u201croad rage incident\u201d and not a hate crime, the Fairfax County Police Department said on Monday night.The police said the group of as many as 15 teenagers were walking and riding their bikes \u2014 some in the street and some on the sidewalk \u2014 when Mr. Torres came upon them in his car.An argument erupted between him and one of the teenagers, a boy on a bicycle, and he drove his car onto the curb in a fit of anger, the police said. The statement did not say what the argument was about. The teenagers ran from Mr. Torres, but he soon found them in a parking lot and got out of his car wielding a baseball bat and began to chase them, the police said.\u201cTorres was able to catch Nabra,\u201d the police said in a statement posted online. \u201cHis anger over the encounter led to violence when he hit Nabra with a baseball bat.\u201dAfter he attacked Ms. Hassanen, Mr. Torres took her in his car to a nearby location in Loudoun County, the police said. Her body was found about 11 hours later in a nearby man-made pond. Autopsy results showed that she had sustained blunt force trauma to the upper body, the police said, though they did not specify her cause of death.Mr. Torres was arrested at 5:15 a.m. on Sunday. A police spokeswoman, Officer Tawny Wright, said on Monday that he had lingered in the search area in his car, drawing the attention of an officer who stopped him for a vehicle violation and detained him for questioning. He was charged with murder after the discovery of Ms. Hassanen\u2019s body, the police said.Hate crime charges could still be filed as the investigation progresses, he said earlier on Monday, adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out until I see all of the evidence.\u201dRegardless of the motive, the killing reverberated throughout the Muslim community and beyond. As word of the girl\u2019s death spread, people expressed their grief on social media.Vigils were being organized in Boston; New York; Reston, Va.; and Washington, to take place on Tuesday.Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring had visited the center numerous times when he was a state senator because it was in his district.\u201cThe ADAMS Center has always welcomed me and so many in Northern Virginia like family,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis unspeakable attack feels like an assault on our entire community.

{"Headline": "Embracing What\u2019s Natural", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported by This week we\u2019re turning over the Race/Related newsletter to participants in The New York Times Student Journalism Institute. In pop culture, there are examples of white women using symbols of the black or Latino experience simply to make a fashion statement. But there are far fewer examples of these celebrities using their platform to draw attention to the scrutiny that millions of minorities face for making those same decisions in their everyday lives.While there isn\u2019t anything inherently wrong with exploring, or engaging with \u201cblackness,\u201d it\u2019s almost always exploitative. Why, in a world where little black girls can\u2019t even wear braids to school, should it be O.K. for the Jenners to turn them into a cultural phenomenon?\u201cI think a lot of your identity and how women express themselves, especially for young girls in environments that are very heteronormative, hair is everything. What you can do with your hair and how you present yourself is everything, and it really made me question who I was, and if I was pretty or not because I couldn\u2019t do more stuff with my hair.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done it partly because of the perceived judgment you get when you cut your hair or when you go natural,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019m more willing to do it now than I was maybe five years ago, but I think that has a lot to do with why I\u2019m not natural now. Because its kind of scary, even though it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201dBelow you\u2019ll find an article about the complexity behind natural hair, a topic that is often ignored.She walked into Miss Jessie\u2019s hair salon in Lower Manhattan with a smile on her face, her honey-caramel curls bouncing as she proceeded to the washing station for a wash and go \u2014 a shampoo, some product, a quick blast under the dryer and then a blow dry with a diffuser to fluff out the volume of her ringlets.There were no harmful chemicals used, no taut blow drying, no suppressing the mass of corkscrew curls that were her natural look.For Loretta Rucker, the curly hair style is not just popular and fun. It\u2019s a logical extension of her commitment to do what comes naturally and embrace the curls that had been tucked away for much of her life.\u201cI came up during the \u2018black is beautiful\u2019 era and immediately wanted to be in my natural hair and did that for years,\u201d said Ms. Rucker, who lives in Brooklyn and is the executive director of the African-American Public Radio Consortium. Her natural styles have included, she said, Afros, cornrows and braids.Now, she said, like many other women of color, she\u2019s happy to let her naturally curly hair just \u201cbe.\u201dCelebrities like the singer Solange Knowles, the actress Tracee Ellis Ross and the Broadway star Josh Groban have also been rocking their curls lately. So, it seems, are ordinary New Yorkers, whose curls can be seen swaying along with the motion of subway cars.More salons are offering services for curly-haired customers, and a number of bloggers are promoting the look as a way of self-acceptance and personal comfort.For women of color in particular, it has become a way to shed long-held conventions of what is acceptable for them in a society in which \u201cblack hair\u201d was often seen as unattractive and hairstyles are often interpreted in a harsh political light.It also can carry social and political weight, she said, citing the book \u201cHair Raising: Beauty, Culture, and African-American Women\u201d by Noliwe Rooks (Rutgers University Press, 1996).\u201cHair in 1976 spoke to racial identity politics as well as bonding between African-American women. Its style could lead to acceptance or rejection from certain groups and social classes, and its styling could provide the possibility of a career,\u201d Ms. Rooks wrote.Even today, hair can be a subject of tension between black girls and white authorities. Twin sisters in Malden, Mass., were punished for having braids with extensions, which school officials deemed a distraction from learning. The dress code also banned hair coloring but was not enforced for white students, critics pointed out. The school district eventually reversed itself after the state attorney general said the policy violated state and federal law.\u201cCulturally we need to wake up,\u201d Ms. Rucker said. \u201cIs that so much different from judging people by their skin tone?\u201dThe trend to curly hair is, in part, a reaction to those perceived restrictions. But it\u2019s also part of a movement toward more natural treatment of hair, known as protective styles. Women are avoiding dangerous chemicals that damage their hair and have been frequently used in salons to straighten or otherwise \u201ccontrol\u201d black hair.In early April, Michelle Obama gave a boost to supporters of protective styles when she was photographed with her natural hair \u2014 a departure after eight years as first lady in which her hair was almost always straightened or artificially curled.Certainly, curly was not the style at the predominantly white elementary and middle school that she attended, said Ms. Gilmore, whose heritage is mixed. \u201cI was super-insecure,\u201d she said. \u201cI just never thought I was going to put the straightener down.\u201dBut in 2014 she went natural. Her curly hair, she said, gives her a sense of who she is as a person. \u201cIt\u2019s my individuality, my strength.\u201d\u201cMake sure you\u2019re doing it for you,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t do it because it\u2019s popular, don\u2019t do it because all your friends are doing it. It\u2019s not a trend but a lifestyle.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to tie my hair up; my hair is who I am.\u201dBecause of the popularity of the curly style, many companies are coming out with new products, while salons are learning new techniques.\u201cI would be mistaken if I thought it was a trend,\u201d Miko Branch said of the curly look. \u201cBut it is fun and it is very fashionable. And is it trendy then? Absolutely.\u201dHere are some of the stories that we\u2019re talking about, beyond The Times.Colleges Celebrate Diversity With Separate \u2018Commencements\u2019Immigrants Keep an Iowa Meatpacking Town Alive and GrowingDuring Ramadan, Home Cooks ShineIn Chicago\u2019s Crisis of Violence, Some Signs of HopeDoes \u2018Wrong Mind-Set\u2019 Cause Poverty or Vice Versa?The Artist Sheena Rose Is Reaching Beyond BarbadosMelissa Harris-Perry: How to Save the N.A.A.C.P.

{"Headline": "Advertising on the French Riviera: The Internet Come to Life", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byCANNES, France \u2014 Marketers are used to being the sideshow to the main event, whether it\u2019s ads in a magazine, tents at a music festival or commercials during the Super Bowl. So imagine a conference where marketing is the star and pretty much everyone who attends specializes in attention-getting. Toss in the French Riviera and you have what is known as the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity Awards.The annual Cannes Lions, established in the 1950s to honor the best in marketing, attracts executives from the world\u2019s biggest brands and advertising agencies, as well as the top players from technology, entertainment and media. (It\u2019s unrelated to the city\u2019s famous film festival.) Their presence transformed the beachfront here last week, giving a first-timer like me the sense that I was walking through the internet in real life \u2014 or IRL in web parlance.Stretches of sand were renamed #TwitterBeach, Facebook Beach and Pinterest Pier. The pavement was painted teal, brought to attendees by Waze. Promotions for Shazam, the song-recognition app, and Oath, the newly named tie-up of AOL and Yahoo, dominated the entryways of five-star hotels to somewhat garish effect. Not enough? There was also a Spotify House and an Oracle Deck.When I marveled over the setup to another attendee, he asked, \u201cHave you seen the yachts yet?\u201d I hadn\u2019t. Sure enough, there was a long line of luxurious boats nearby that were festooned with banners for brands like Nielsen, the TV ratings company, and the accounting firm PwC. Music thrummed from them well into the early hours of the morning, and the drinking and dancing seemed to be made safer by the fact that people had to take their shoes off to board.Executives, despite their jam-packed schedules, seemed to be taking full advantage of the weather, donning sundresses, light button-downs and T-shirts with blazers. One said he had conducted a morning meeting during a swim in the Mediterranean Sea. Before the conference, an ad technology company offered me an interview with its chief executive \u2014 while parasailing. (I passed, given that notepads and tape recorders tend not to work in that environment.)Ros\u00e9 seemed like an integral part of the festival. At meals, it was poured alongside water as early as 11 a.m., and served frozen as \u201cfros\u00e9\u201d in the afternoon. Cups of frozen ros\u00e9 slushies were branded with the logos of Facebook and the agency OMD at a beachfront cabana. Nearby, at a villa rented out by the ad agency Ogilvy, a mini refrigerator from Facebook was stocked with \u201cfros\u00e9 sorbet.\u201dWhile interviewing an executive from Dentsu Aegis Network in an open cabana at the end of a long pier with an expanse of blue water on either side, it struck me that this was not a bad setting for networking and negotiations \u2014 even if many of the attendees seemed to be transplanted from New York City at a steep cost. (One executive confessed that his flight from New York to France cost $12,000.)Kristin Lemkau, the chief marketing officer of JPMorgan Chase, attended the festival for the first time and acknowledged how outlandish it seemed. Still, she said, it somehow made sense.\u201cThis is a relationship business,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cIt does come down to the relationships and whether you trust the person you\u2019re dealing with and trust their motives, and it\u2019s kind of hard to build a relationship in a meeting.\u201dShe added: \u201cSo the more you can connect with people outside of a fake PowerPoint media environment, I think it\u2019s actually a good thing. But maybe this is a way for me to wrap my head around why it\u2019s O.K. to be in France on a Tuesday.\u201dDispatch From Cannes, FranceAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Despite Public Outcry, Egypt to Transfer Islands to Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 The fate of Tiran and Sanafir, a pair of small, barren islands in the Red Sea, is one of the most politically sensitive issues facing Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.Yet Mr. Sisi may be about to get his way.On Wednesday, after three days of rowdy and emotional debate, Egypt\u2019s Parliament voted to allow the contentious transfer of the islands to proceed. The decision did not come as a surprise \u2014 Mr. Sisi\u2019s supporters dominate the largely pliant chamber, which is openly manipulated by his security agencies. The decision could yet be blocked in the courts.But it offers a new sign of how Mr. Sisi can impose his will, even in the face of stiff public disapproval, at a time when the political opposition has been crushed and the free press is under renewed assault \u2014 all as Egypt heads into a presidential election next year.The websites may have been censored to pave the way for the parliamentary push on Tiran and Sanafir, one of the few issues where Mr. Sisi has appeared vulnerable in the past year.The decision provoked a storm of criticism from Egyptians who accused Mr. Sisi of trading land for money. Saudi Arabia has pumped at least $25 billion in aid and investment into Egypt since 2014.The Sisi government argued that Egypt has been administering Tiran and Sanafir on behalf of Saudi Arabia since the two countries signed a treaty in 1950. But few Egyptians seem to believe that.In January, there were jubilant celebrations outside a Cairo courthouse when a judge confirmed an order nullifying the transfer. But Mr. Sisi defied that order and put it to a vote in Parliament anyway.During three days of fiery debate this week, members of Parliament yelled, cursed and shoved one another. The lawmaker Nadia Henry banged her fists in frustration; others chanted \u201cEgyptian, Egyptian\u201d in reference to the islands.But in the end, the transfer was approved \u2014 even though some lawmakers claimed that no formal vote had taken place. \u201cThe speaker of Parliament suddenly ended the discussion and announced it had been approved,\u201d Anissa Hassouna, a prominent lawmaker, said.There was little sign, however, of those scenes on the privately owned television stations, which often take their cues from the security agencies. But a flurry of harshly critical comments circulated on social media, some with the hashtag #SisiIsATraitor.\u201cNobody consented to this deal except you,\u201d the opposition lawyer Khaled Ali said on Facebook.The controversy over the islands may not yet be over. Mr. Sisi has clashed with senior judges in recent months, and a bruising confrontation in the courts over the islands remains a possibility.Ahmed Shafik, a former prime minister who lives in exile, told a private television channel that the issue should be put to a national referendum. That seems a remote possibility.The more likely outcome, the lawmaker and writer Osama Sharshar said, is that Mr. Sisi will soon sign the transfer into law.\u201cWe are extremely sad and shocked,\u201d Mr. Sharshar said. \u201cI think Sisi will formalize the transfer soon, and that is why it was rammed through the Parliament.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Montreal Parade, Usually a Point of Pride, Raises Debate About Racism", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byMontreal\u2019s annual F\u00eate Nationale parade is meant to celebrate Quebec\u2019s unique culture in Canada. But the lead float in this year\u2019s parade over the weekend instead prompted a debate about racism in the province.Four young men of color, dressed in beige, walked beside the float to push it forward while white women, dressed in white, danced around them. The float, commemorating the founding of Montreal, featured an open history book emblazoned with the words \u201cIl \u00e9tait une fois,\u201d which translates as \u201cOnce upon a time.\u201d\u201cIf the organizers of the event had a minimum of sensitivity and understanding of social realities for people of color, this mess would never have happened,\u201d a man named R\u00e9 Jean-Pierre wrote.Another commenter, S\u00e9bastien Boudreau, wrote that \u201cthe problem is not that it is people of color pushing the float, but that you associate them right away with slaves, instead of just seeing them as proud citizens participating in the national festival.\u201dA parade organizer, Maxime Laporte, told Radio ICI that the fact that minorities appear subordinate to whites in the float was not intentional but an unfortunate coincidence. \u201cIt was entirely by chance,\u201d he said of the racial juxtaposition, adding that the 2017 parade was more diverse than in any previous year.\u201cThe organizers didn\u2019t have a sense of black history to see right away what this looked like,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. To see it herself as a black Quebecer, she said, was \u201cseeing a representation of what is too often your actual place in society.\u201dMs. Nicolas, whose group is pressing the provincial government to investigate systemic racism, said the fact that the organizers did not notice what she called the float\u2019s blatant symbolism, intentional or not, shows that \u201csystemic racism is alive and well in Canada.\u201dThe young men who pushed the float were members of a local high school sports team who had volunteered to do the job. Mr. Brouillet, whose video had been viewed more than 1.8 million times on Facebook through Tuesday afternoon, said he regretted that the athletes had been dragged into the controversy.In a telephone interview, he said many people in Quebec were \u201cwillfully ignorant\u201d of racism in the province. \u201cIt was a coincidence that could have been averted,\u201d he said of the float.Of all of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories, Quebec stands out for its nationalism, tied to a separatist movement and a centuries-long feud with country\u2019s dominant Anglophone community that dates to the Treaty of Paris in 1763, when France ceded what was then called New France to the British. Slavery was a part of the province\u2019s life for 200 years, as it was elsewhere in Canada, affecting both black and indigenous peoples; it was abolished in most of the British Empire, including Canada, in 1833.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chef\u2019s Quest in India: Win Respect for Its Cooking", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported by11 PhotosShe asked a photographer to stop taking pictures and sent a videographer farther down the dirt path. Ms. Gomez, a chef from Atlanta who had traveled for 22 hours to get to the land where she was born, needed a moment.\u201cI think I had disconnected myself from this place in some way by saying for so long that the U.S. was home,\u201d said Ms. Gomez, 47, who had moved from the Indian state of Kerala to the state of Michigan as a teenager. \u201cThere is still so much a part of me here. I think I had forgotten that.\u201dShe wiped her tears and made her way back toward the cameras, more committed than ever to the work she had set out to do when she landed at Cochin International Airport a few days earlier.Ms. Gomez had come to this land of ports, tea estates and spice gardens not only to reconnect with a part of herself, but also to find new ways to use her camera-ready personality and kitchen chops to lasso Kerala\u2019s beautiful food culture and drag it back to the United States.\u201cI have to remove people from the mentality that all Indian food should be clumped up into nine dishes that are not really Indian dishes,\u201d she said. \u201cNot all Indian food belongs on a buffet line at $4.99. Indian food is 5,000 years of tradition and history, and it belongs right up there with French cuisine.\u201d\u201cI wish I could say to every immigrant cook in America, \u2018Why do you think your food should be any less than any other cuisine that comes from anywhere else in the world?\u2019\u201d Ms. Gomez said.It\u2019s not hard to see why: For one thing, unless that food is served in an upscale setting, with polished service, it doesn\u2019t command the prices or the critical respect afforded European or American cuisines.And even when the restaurant is fancy, the problem persists. Ms. Gomez experienced it at her first restaurant, a fine-dining place in Atlanta she named Cardamom Hill, after the spice-growing region that she was touring last month. Customers would complain that she charged $32 for a complex fish curry with smoked tamarind, even when a fish entree at a well-regarded new Southern restaurant not far away cost the same.\u201cThat makes me see red immediately,\u201d said David Chang, the prolific chef and restaurateur, whose parents immigrated to the United States from South Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst kind of racism, because it\u2019s so readily accepted.\u201dEven though there are some notable Indian chefs cooking in America, integrating the kind of food Ms. Gomez loves won\u2019t come easy, said Mr. Chang, who first met Ms. Gomez last week over fried chicken in Atlanta. \u201cConsidering the time we\u2019re living in, having someone with that color skin from that part of the world makes it a hard sell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not going to happen in one lifetime, and it is going to take relentless media exposure.\u201dThat\u2019s exactly why Ms. Gomez had invited a producer working on a show for PBS; two videographers, who help create her web-based subscription cooking show, \u201cCurry and Cornbread\u201d; and two newspaper journalists to join her in Kerala.The trip was a relentless blur of food and road miles. One day Ms. Gomez was picking out silky pomfret and river mullet to smear with masala, in a makeshift kitchen on the banks of Fort Kochi, and the next she was in a van grinding up a narrow mountain road to Kerala\u2019s vast tea estates, or buying iron knives from a street vendor. By the end, she was happy to order a steak and get an ayurvedic treatment at a seaside hotel.It had been eight years since Ms. Gomez last stepped onto Indian soil. She had come to adopt her son, Ethan, then a 3-year-old living in an orphanage.So much has happened since then. For one thing, she embarked on a cooking career.Ms. Gomez originally wanted to work in the beauty business. When the recession hit the United States in 2008, she had been running a luxe ayurvedic spa in Atlanta, where she had moved with her husband, Bobby Palayam. As her clients finished their massages and facials, she would feed them vegetarian biryanis and coconut-infused stir-fries bright with turmeric and chiles.\u201cYou know that Kerala is in your kitchen when you have coconut oil, curry leaves and mustard seeds sizzling in a chati,\u201d she likes to tell people. \u201cThat\u2019s our trinity.\u201dHer next restaurant was a quiet, stylish Indian patisserie where she served puff-pastry samosas and carrot cakes infused with black pepper. She closed it in February. The reasons weren\u2019t much different.Ms. Gomez learned to cook from her mother, Hazel, and her three aunts, who all lived near one another in a three-household compound in Thiruvananthapuram (she said she preferred the old name, Trivandrum), Kerala\u2019s capital city on the Arabian Sea. It was a dreamy childhood, in a religiously diverse and literate region of India where young people prefer American rock to Bollywood soundtracks.The Portuguese had begun settling there in the 15th century, bringing with them a love of pork and for the chiles that would come to mark Kerala\u2019s food. It\u2019s how her family got its name, and why she grew up a meat-eating Roman Catholic in a state where more than half the population is Hindu.Her father was a civil engineer who helped build bridges for a German company. Her mother never set a table that wasn\u2019t beautiful.Her father was intent on moving the children to America for college. To prepare, she and her older brothers were required to speak only English at home and eat using cutlery instead of the tidy, one-handed finger style many in Kerala use for their curry-soaked red rice and breakfast puttus.\u201cI think he had seen enough of the world that he didn\u2019t want us to come to this country and be outsiders,\u201d she said.When she was 16, her father died of a heart attack. She and her mother moved to Michigan, where her older brothers were already in college. They eventually landed in Queens, where cousins encouraged her mother to cater food for the Kerala diaspora.\u201cI hated it,\u201d Ms. Gomez said. \u201cOur apartment was so small I would literally disinfect the bathtub, and I would have to wash the dishes in there.\u201dBut Ms. Gomez fit seamlessly into New York life, developing the kind of cultural fluidity that has allowed her to adapt Kerala\u2019s food for the uninitiated while satisfying the people from her home state, who lovingly call each other Mallus. \u201cAs much as I love tradition, I am not a traditionalist,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m an innovator.\u201dSometimes innovators need to reconnect with their roots, which is why she got up at 4 a.m. at one point to visit a Kerala catering kitchen that for 100 years has been creating a classic Hindu celebratory meal called a sadhya, served at almost every wedding and holiday gathering in Kerala.The meal, eaten from a banana leaf and centered on rice, can involve two dozen dishes that vary from salty to sour to bitter to sweet. Always there are spicy pickles, sambar and vegetables simmered in coconut milk or saut\u00e9ed with ground coconut and curry leaves. It\u2019s a celebratory feast that Ms. Gomez makes a few times a year.In a wet, torrid kitchen, she watched the cooks, with bare chests and feet, add buckets of spices and vegetables to pots as big as wading pools. In a few hours, they would have lunch ready for 1,500.She talked shop with the owner, Mahadevan Iyer. He wanted to take her to his factory, where he is packaging food for the American market. \u201cWe are interested in exporting delicious Kerala,\u201d he told her.Only hours earlier, the young woman hired to do her hair and makeup had also asked Ms. Gomez for help. She wanted to follow the chef back to America to become her personal assistant.\u201cI knew the direction this was going to go,\u201d Ms. Gomez said. She declined the offers.\u201cCan you imagine what I could do in a place like this?\u201d she asked.But there in the Cardamom Hills, she understood the deeper meaning of the trip. She had found a way to merge her two homes.\u201cI want to leave an America behind where my son can be proud of both his heritages,\u201d she said. \u201cI want him to carry both these places with equal pride, hand in hand.\u201dAnd to Drink ...cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justices Strike Down Law Banning Disparaging Trademarks", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a decision likely to bolster the Washington Redskins\u2019 efforts to protect their trademarks, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the government may not refuse to register potentially offensive names. A law denying protection to disparaging trademarks, the court said, violated the First Amendment.Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer for the team, said the decision \u201cresolves the Redskins\u2019 longstanding dispute with the government.\u201d\u201cThe Supreme Court vindicated the team\u2019s position that the First Amendment blocks the government from denying or canceling a trademark registration based on the government\u2019s opinion,\u201d she said.Four justices said the law could not withstand even the fairly relaxed judicial scrutiny that the Supreme Court applies to commercial speech. Those justices rejected the two government interests that the law was said to advance: protecting disadvantaged groups from demeaning messages and the orderly flow of commerce.Justice Alito added that the law\u2019s disparagement clause was far too broad. \u201cIt is not an anti-discrimination clause; it is a happy-talk clause,\u201d he wrote.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer joined that part of Justice Alito\u2019s opinion.Four other justices would have struck down the law using the more searching First Amendment scrutiny that applies to viewpoint discrimination.\u201cThe danger of viewpoint discrimination,\u201d Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote, \u201cis that the government is attempting to remove certain ideas or perspectives from a broader debate. That danger is all the greater if the ideas or perspectives are ones a particular audience might think offensive, at least at first hearing.\u201d\u201cTo permit viewpoint discrimination in this context is to permit Government censorship,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote.Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion.Justice Neil M. Gorsuch did not participate in the case, which was argued in January, before he joined the court.The competing opinions from the two four-justice blocs will mute the extent to which the decision sets precedent in other contexts.All eight participating justices did agree on some points. They were unanimous in rejecting the argument that federal trademarks are the government\u2019s own speech and thus immune from First Amendment scrutiny of any kind.Justice Alito, writing for eight justices on Monday, said trademarks are different.\u201cIf the federal registration of a trademark makes the mark government speech, the federal government is babbling prodigiously and incoherently,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is saying many unseemly things. It is expressing contradictory views. It is unashamedly endorsing a vast array of commercial products and services. And it is providing Delphic advice to the consuming public.\u201dThe Slants said they did not intend to disparage anyone. Instead, they said, they sought to adopt and reform a disparaging term about Asians, much as some gay people have embraced the term \u201cqueer.\u201dThat was significant, Justice Kennedy wrote. The band wanted, he wrote, \u201cto supplant a racial epithet, using new insights, musical talents, and wry humor to make it a badge of pride.\u201dThe government has applied the law inconsistently when faced with trademarks based on ethnic slurs. It has, for instance, both registered and rejected trademarks for the terms \u201cHeeb,\u201d \u201cDago,\u201d \u201cInjun\u201d and \u201cSquaw.\u201dIn the Redskins case, the trademark office registered the team\u2019s trademarks in 1967, 1974, 1978 and 1990. In 2014, though, it reversed course and canceled six registrations, saying they disparaged Native Americans.The law was challenged by Lester Packingham, a registered sex offender who was convicted of violating it after posting an account of having a traffic ticket dismissed. \u201cGod is good,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.Mr. Packingham, who had pleaded guilty in 2002 to taking indecent liberties with a minor when he was a 21-year-old student, said the law violated the First Amendment.Justice Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, said the internet is transforming American life and has turned into \u201cthe modern public square.\u201d Denying access to it, he wrote, violates the First Amendment.\u201cThe statute here enacts a prohibition unprecedented in the scope of First Amendment speech it burdens,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote. \u201cSocial media allows users to gain access to information and communicate with one another about it on any subject that might come to mind.\u201d\u201cBy prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge,\u201d he wrote.Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan joined Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion. Justice Gorsuch did not participate in the case.In a concurrence, Justice Alito, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, agreed with the result in the case but did not join what he called the \u201cloose rhetoric\u201d in Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion.The North Carolina law was too broad, Justice Alito wrote, but states retain many legal tools to protect children on the internet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gay Lawmaker, Leo Varadkar, Is in Line to Be Ireland\u2019s Prime Minister", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 A gay son of an Indian immigrant is now all but certain to become the next prime minister of Ireland, a country that has rapidly been leaving its conservative Roman Catholic social traditions behind.Leo Varadkar, who was chosen on Friday by the Fine Gael party to be its leader, and therefore the head of the center-right governing coalition, will be the first openly gay taoiseach (as Ireland\u2019s prime minister is called), and, at 38, the youngest. He succeeds Enda Kenny, who is stepping down.Mr. Varadkar\u2019s rapid rise to the country\u2019s highest political office, only 10 years after he entered Parliament, owes much to a willingness to speak his mind, a novelty in the normally cautious world of Irish politics.Though in some ways he is emblematic of Ireland\u2019s transition to a more liberal society, Mr. Varadkar presents himself as conservative on issues like the economy and law and order. As he was campaigning for the party leadership, he used his cabinet position as minister for social protection to start a high-profile campaign against welfare fraud, which was seen as a gesture to appeal to Fine Gael\u2019s right-wing supporters.He also surprised his liberal admirers by reaching out to the party\u2019s anti-abortion faction, saying that Fine Gael \u201cshould be a warm house for those who have socially conservative views.\u201dIn 2015, Mr. Varadkar was widely praised for bravery and honesty when he said publicly that he was gay, the first Irish government minister to do so. At the time, Irish voters were debating a proposed constitutional amendment to permit same-sex marriage, and his stand is credited with bolstering the successful \u201cyes\u201d campaign, making Ireland the first country to legalize gay marriage by popular vote.Mr. Varadkar was born in Dublin in 1979, the son of an Irish Catholic nurse from County Waterford and a Hindu doctor from Mumbai, India. His parents met in England in the 1960s and lived in India for a time before moving to Ireland.Mr. Varadkar trained as a doctor \u2014 a general practitioner \u2014 and became involved in politics while still in medical school. He developed a reputation as an intelligent, hard-working and articulate city councilor in Dublin, won a parliamentary seat in the Dublin West constituency at the age of 28, and rose swiftly in party circles.Though the Fine Gael party and its allies have the largest bloc of seats in Parliament, they do not command a majority. Even so, opposition parties are not expected to block Mr. Varadkar\u2019s formal election as prime minister by the Dail. To do so would prompt a general election, which none of the major parties want right now.Mr. Varadkar clinched the Fine Gael leadership on Friday by defeating his only rival, Simon Coveney, a fellow cabinet minister, in an internal party election. Though Mr. Coveney received more votes from rank-and-file members, Mr. Varadkar had greater support among Fine Gael\u2019s members of Parliament. Under the party\u2019s weighted voting rules, that made Mr. Varadkar the winner.A habit of speaking out on issues outside his ministerial responsibilities has sometimes embroiled Mr. Varadkar in controversy. In 2011, six months after Ireland was pressured into accepting a bailout of 85 billion euros by the European Union (about $122 billion), he claimed (incorrectly, as it turned out) that a second bailout might soon be necessary. His comment caused consternation among colleagues in the government who were trying to persuade the world that Ireland had finally stabilized itself after the banking and housing crash of 2008.Mr. Varadkar was accused of racism in 2008 after he suggested in the Dail that unemployed immigrants should be paid to leave the country. He denied the accusation and said he was talking about a voluntary program, not forced deportation.He is unlikely to enjoy a long political honeymoon. His party\u2019s chief rival, Fianna Fail \u2014 also center-right \u2014 can bring down the government and force a general election whenever it feels the moment is advantageous. It does not seem advantageous now: The two parties are running close in most opinion polls, with, if anything, a narrow lead for Fine Gael.Meanwhile, the government faces a number of serious domestic issues that could blow up into crises, including the troubled public health service; soaring rents and housing prices; anger at rising economic inequality; an interlocking nest of church-and-state questions; and slumping police morale and discipline.Threats by the Trump administration to crack down on American multinational companies that base themselves overseas for tax reasons are also a grave concern for Ireland, which uses low corporate tax rates to entice companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Twitter to process their cash flows through Dublin.By far the biggest menace on the Irish horizon, however, is Britain\u2019s looming withdrawal from the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d which threatens to stir divisions within and between the Republic of Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland, where decades of sectarian struggle largely subsided after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.Brexit will also severely disrupt Ireland\u2019s close business links with Britain, its largest trading partner, by removing Britain from the European single market and customs union while Ireland remains.During the leadership campaign. Mr. Varadkar said he did not plan to appoint a special \u201cminister for Brexit,\u201d suggesting that he intended to deal with the matter himself. If so, he is likely to be consumed by it from his first day in office.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Terror Attacks, Britain Moves to Police the Web", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byLawmakers from across the political spectrum are promoting some of the widest-ranging plans anywhere in the western world to rein in the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter, setting up a likely standoff.On one side are British policy makers and law enforcement officials, who want to crack down on how extremist messaging and communication are spread across the internet. On the other are privacy and freedom of speech groups \u2014 alongside the tech giants themselves \u2014 who say that the government\u2019s proposals go too far.Similar debates are popping up around the world.Now the country\u2019s politicians want to go further.In its electoral manifesto and in speeches by senior politicians, the governing Conservative Party outlined proposals to offer security officials more ways to keep tabs on potential extremists. Theresa May, the prime minister, raised the issue at a recent Group of 7 meeting and in talks with President Emmanuel Macron of France.But if the proposals are pushed through, there will be costs.The Conservatives now rule with a minority in Parliament, and will most likely have to rely on other parties for support. That may necessitate compromise or horse trading.Part of that plan is to demand that companies such as Apple and Facebook allow Britain\u2019s national security agencies access to people\u2019s encrypted messages on services like FaceTime and WhatsApp.These services use so-called end-to-end encryption, meaning that a person\u2019s message is scrambled when it is sent from a device, so that it becomes indecipherable to anyone but its intended recipient.British officials, like their American counterparts, would like to create a digital backdoor to this technology.Yet an opening for intelligence agencies, experts warn, would also allow others, including foreign governments and hacking groups, to potentially gain access to people\u2019s digital messages.It would also most likely induce terrorist groups to move to other forms of encrypted communication, while leaving everyday Britons \u2014 and others traveling in the country \u2014 susceptible to online hacks.\u201cIf the British government asks for a special key like this, what stops other governments from asking for the same access?\u201d said Nigel Smart, a cryptology professor at the University of Bristol. \u201cYou need end-to-end encryption because it stops anyone from listening in.\u201dBritish lawmakers say law enforcement and intelligence agencies need such access to foil potential terrorist plots.But Facebook and others respond that they already provide information on people\u2019s online activities, when required, including the I.P. address \u2014 a pseudo fingerprint for digital devices \u2014 of machines from where messages are sent.And in a letter sent to British politicians in late 2015 \u2014 just as an earlier debate about tech regulation was bubbling to the surface \u2014 Apple made its views clear.\u201cI\u2019d like to see the industry go further and faster in not only removing online terrorist content, but stopping it going up in the first place,\u201d Amber Rudd, the country\u2019s home secretary, said before meeting with tech executives this year. At the time, she called on them to take further steps to counter such extremist material.The British government\u2019s stance has put tech companies in the difficult position of having to determine what should, and should not, be allowed online.Britain\u2019s freedom of expression laws are not as far-reaching as those in the United States, allowing British lawmakers to push for greater control over what is circulated across the web.In recent months, companies like Facebook and Twitter say that they have taken additional steps to remove illegal extremist material from their social networks, and are giving users ways to flag potentially offensive content.Some other European lawmakers have warned that too-strict limits on what can be shared across the web may hamper freedom of speech, a touchy subject for many people who grew up behind the Soviet-era iron curtain.\u201cFor me, freedom of expression is a basic fundamental right,\u201d Andrus Ansip, the digital chief at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said in an interview this year. \u201cNobody wants to see a Ministry of Truth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revisiting My Hong Kong, 20 Years After the British Left", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byPersonal JourneysI knocked and knocked on the door to the artist\u2019s studio, beside the plastic logo of a painter\u2019s palette. It had been so hard to find the address of this musty commercial building on Hong Kong\u2019s Wyndham Street, I was beginning to think it was time to give up on finding my old friend Ng Tak Tung there.In 1997, just a few days after my college graduation, I moved alone to this island in the South China Sea to work at a business magazine. Much had been made of the British handing over control of their colony to the Chinese, which for many marked the symbolic end of an empire and an era. I wanted a little history, a little adventure and a little excitement, and ended up with more of all three than I was prepared to handle.From the deck of a rented junk bobbing off Stanley Beach, I watched teams of men and women furiously paddle their brightly painted dragon boats, the carved wooden heads, teeth bared, jutting from the prows. I reported from a demonstration for the first time, a candlelight vigil in Victoria Park with tens of thousands of participants to honor the democracy protesters slain at Tiananmen Square eight years before.A few weeks after that, I sat in a tiny storefront bar festooned with Christmas lights and watched a television news report showing that, just before dawn, armored personnel carriers brought Chinese troops over the border from Shenzhen. That same weekend, at the red-and-white brick Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club, a giant of a man in muddy black tuxedo pants and an untucked pleated shirt head-butted me because the bar was closed and he couldn\u2019t get a drink.And I had a darts partner from the Chinese island of Hainan, a painter who spoke as little English as I did Hainanese, which is to say none. But Tak Tung and I became unlikely friends at the dive bar across from my office on Hollywood Road, the Globe. He had a knack \u2014 confounding the Britons we defeated \u2014 for missing the easy throws and then hitting the bull\u2019s-eye with improbable consistency.Since our words flew unintelligibly past each other, we communicated by drawing on napkins and beer coasters. We sketched the people we knew. We drew maps, of Hong Kong and China, of the world, of boats and airplanes and the dotted lines that described our respective journeys.The last time Tak Tung and I saw each other, he invited me back to his studio. He picked up the phone (a landline, of course) and dialed a number and handed the receiver to me. A woman was on the other end \u2014 his wife. She said she was in the hospital and that her husband was having a difficult time because of her illness. He wanted me to know it meant a lot to him to have me as a friend.Soon after, I left that part of the world. It was long before Facebook. A lot of people didn\u2019t even have email addresses yet. And when you made a broke, disorderly retreat from a city as I did, you lost touch with most of your friends half a world away.He could have moved back to the mainland, emigrated to the West or, for all I knew, passed away. As a last-ditch effort, I took out a business card and scribbled on the back that I was in town and to please call or write. That is, I added, if he even remembered me. I slid the card under the locked door to his darkened studio and left.So much had happened in the 20 years of Chinese rule \u2014 the SARS epidemic, creeping authoritarianism, the protest movement \u2014 I did not expect to recognize Hong Kong. Looking on Wikipedia before my wife, Rachel, and I left for the trip, I saw that 18 of the 20 tallest buildings in the city had been built since I departed. I could picture the modern skyscrapers as they rose, cloaked in canvas and the city\u2019s traditional bamboo scaffolding.But as we scanned Google Maps for hotels, I pointed out my old apartment on Lyndhurst Terrace, traced my finger along the path I used to take down to the ferry pier. Rachel noted that I remembered the street names from 20 years ago better, in some cases, than those in Crown Heights, where we have lived for three years.Upon our plane\u2019s descent into Hong Kong, I looked out the window onto cargo ships slowly plying through gray-green waters, the shipping containers like so many primary-colored Legos stacked on their decks and could see the dark masses of the outlying islands jutting up from the water. I found it all instantly recognizable.Despite our extreme jet lag, I goaded us into a lengthy walking tour, each memory pushing me a few more steps, and the next sight leading to another memory. I showed Rachel the incense-filled Man Mo Temple and the stone wall trees, banyans whose sprawling gray roots clung to the faces of old retaining walls like dense webs. The rank markets of raw flesh and living sea creatures still defied the advances of sterile supermarkets. And when there was no answer at Tak Tung\u2019s studio, I pushed us onward.We saw Flower Market Street\u2019s profusion of blossoms, including locally grown lilies and chrysanthemums. And we watched proud owners introduce their brightly plumed, squawking parrots at the Yuen Po Bird Garden.This was a far cry from my old routine in Hong Kong. When I first arrived in the city, I discovered that I was working semi-legally at best, dispatched by hydrofoil to the Portuguese colony of Macau (now part of China) when my tourist visa was about to expire for a new stamp upon re-entry. The only room I could afford was hardly bigger than the single wooden-framed futon I slept on; once I put it down, the tiny bed filled the entire floor. My clothes hung on a pressure rod above my head so I could stand up only by pushing my shirts and slacks aside.Instead of a shower there was a hole in the bathroom floor and a spray nozzle attached to the sink. The kitchen consisted of a single burner attached to a propane tank.I did not spend a lot of time on Flower Market Street perusing fresh blossoms. I spent most of my time at the Globe. For anyone raised on back-to-back syndicated episodes of Cheers as I was, the Globe represented an ideal: not just an after-work hangout, but a lifeline in a new city, with a built-in group of friends.One night we decided we didn\u2019t know enough jokes so we required all customers to tell one before they could order a drink. We drew up lists of countries and cities each had visited for fun. Bets were settled with a paperback Guinness book, a dictionary and a complete works of Shakespeare. The darts matches went late into the night, and even when you had to wake him up for his turn, Tak Tung still hit the bull\u2019s-eye.One of my starkest memories was from the night of the handover fireworks display. We had propped open the door to the stairwell of a nearby office tower and expected one of the best unauthorized views in the city.When the time came, we hiked the auxiliary staircase to the roof. But as the fireworks started, all we could see was a flickering halo around a dark rectangular silhouette. The hulking unlit mass of a skyscraper under construction, which had sprung up since the last fireworks display, eclipsed the light show for this political theater piece.I had no recourse or safety net but the bartenders at the Globe, who adopted me. I found myself sleeping on the sofa of a kindly barmaid and her electrician boyfriend. As my financial position deteriorated, my beers were slipped surreptitiously on to the checks of rowdy bankers who were never the wiser.By the time I visited this year, the Globe had shut down on Hollywood Road, but avid patrons had chipped in to reopen it around the corner. The old metal sign from outside had been salvaged and now hung on a wall inside. The signature painting of a map of the world presided over a nook filled with games and books. At the old Globe, meals were made \u2014 or should I say, cheese was melted \u2014 in a toaster oven. The new iteration was a full-on gastro pub with delicate fish and truffle polenta.Short for \u201cSouth of Hollywood Road,\u201d I remembered Soho as a smattering of bars and mostly quiet restaurants near the giant series of escalators that eased the steep commute from the Mid-Levels. Now throngs of young people spilled out of the many locales, a group of young women in colorful wigs even drinking as one sat on a yellow fire hydrant. We had a couple of quick Gweilo Pale Ales at the local craft beer bar 65 Peel before succumbing to jet lag.The next day, to escape the rain, we hopped one of the old trams and coasted along the busy waterfront all the way to North Point, where we watched thousands of maids from Indonesia and the Philippines picnic wherever there was shelter, under bridges and overpasses clogged with their day-off celebrations.At the western end of the subway line in up-and-coming Kennedy Town, I toasted my old bartender friend Scott Wrayton at his new restaurant, Shoreditch. Scott, a small-town English boy, recalled arriving a quarter-century before in a neon city where the clouds shrouded the tops of the skyscrapers from view and thinking he had landed in the movie \u201cBlade Runner.\u201dThe change in the city\u2019s skyline was most evident from the clamorous, ever touristier vantage of Victoria Peak. I.M. Pei\u2019s Bank of China Tower, once a dominant feature on the island with its twin masts and white triangular patterns, was now easily lost among the many Goliaths that stood shoulder to shoulder in Central.We had just finished eating egg tarts at Tai Cheong Bakery, as I puzzled over which fancy boutique had moved into the ground floor of my once-grimy old apartment house, when I received a WhatsApp message. \u201cHi Nick, I\u2019m Tak Tung! So excited to see your name card! Are you in HK now?\u201dI arrived at his studio to find the door propped open. Wooden frames were stacked against the wall, along with a few brightly painted pink and blue canvases of flowers. Ng Tak Tung had round, black-framed glasses I didn\u2019t remember and a white goatee now covered his chin. Despite the 20 years that had passed, he was instantly recognizable to me.His assistant translated for us as we spoke and occasionally had questions of her own. \u201cHow did you talk to each other when you don\u2019t speak Chinese?\u201d she asked. I explained that we would draw on whatever we could find. As she related what I had said, he flipped through the books excitedly and pointed to reproductions of his sketches on the backs of beer coasters and scraps of paper, two nude women, a fish biting a finger, a scrawny youth who looked a little familiar.I joked about how he was so good at hitting the bull\u2019s-eye and he squeezed one eye shut and mimed holding a rifle. His aim was so good because he had been a crack shot in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, including during skirmishes on the border with Vietnam.His story began to pour forth, more complicated than I ever could have guessed. He came from a family of property owners and they had a difficult time during the Cultural Revolution. After military service he went to art school at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts, where he met his wife, and followed her to Hong Kong.Was his wife sick in those days, I asked, testing my memories; in the hospital even? Yes, she was. Did she speak English? Yes, she did.As part of his artistic transformation, Ng Chung had abandoned his realist training and thrown himself into neo-Expressionism, sinking into Lan Kwai Fong\u2019s dissolute bar scene like Toulouse-Lautrec into Montmartre. \u201cHe started off from this foreign place, discerned the feeling of alienation everywhere he went, and comprehended what loneliness and helplessness meant,\u201d as one of the essays in the book put it.Like me, he had only just moved to the city at the time. More than I understood then, our friendship sprang from a shared loneliness that neither of us had been able to articulate. He changed his name, he told me, to change his luck, to start fresh. He had found success \u2014 his paintings now belonged to the collections of major museums and he lived on the Peak, the aspirational address high above the city.In the years after I left, the stories I told about this place were always fun and lighthearted, the dragon-boat races, Chinese dice games, Cantopop karaoke. Then I found an old leather-bound journal I had kept and was dumbfounded at the misery. Down and out wasn\u2019t fun, getting rocked by a financial crisis didn\u2019t feel like a roller coaster, losing your first job out of school, getting evicted and spending all your savings just to survive was romantic only in retrospect.The city was too big, too expensive and too tough for me. What made it tolerable and, through the hazy tint of memory, a wonderful time, were the friends I made. Ng Chung led me down a back staircase, to a bar where they knew him as well as they used to know us at the Globe.

It was Harvard\u2019s first commencement for black graduate students, and many of the speakers talked about a different, more personal kind of struggle, the struggle to be black at Harvard.\u201cWe have endured the constant questioning of our legitimacy and our capacity, and yet here we are,\u201d Duwain Pinder, a master\u2019s degree candidate in business and public policy, told the cheering crowd of several hundred people in a keynote speech.From events once cobbled together on shoestring budgets and hidden in back rooms, alternative commencements like the one held at Harvard have become more mainstream, more openly embraced by universities and more common than ever before.Some of the ceremonies have also taken on a sharper edge, with speakers adding an activist overlay to the more traditional sentiments about proud families and bright futures.After Columbia\u2019s ceremony, Lizzette Delgadillo said she spoke about the pain of \u201cimpostor syndrome \u2014 feeling alone when it feels like everybody else on campus just knows what to do and you don\u2019t,\u201d and of how important it was to have the support of other first-generation students.Ms. Delgadillo, who graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in biomedical engineering, had lobbied for the event for three years, as a member of a group called the First-Generation Low-Income Partnership.\u201cThe current political climate definitely pushed this initiative to come to fruition,\u201d said Ms. Delgadillo, the daughter of Mexican immigrants living in Los Angeles.Participants say the ceremonies are a way of celebrating their shared experience as a group, and not a rejection of official college graduations, which they also attend. Depending on one\u2019s point of view, the ceremonies may also be reinforcing an image of the 21st-century campus as an incubator for identity politics.But events like black commencements, he continued, serve only to \u201camplify\u201d racial differences. \u201cCollege is the place where we should be teaching and preaching the view that you\u2019re an individual, and choose your associates to be based on other factors rather than skin color,\u201d he said.\u201cThink about it,\u201d Mr. Connerly added. \u201cThese kids went to Harvard, and they less than anyone in our society should worry about feeling welcome and finding comfort zones. They don\u2019t need that.\u201dThe alternative ceremonies at Harvard had printed programs, and incorporated the pageantry, ritual and solemnity of traditional commencements, though without the diplomas, which were reserved for the official university commencement.A few hours after the new \u201cHarvard University Black Commencement\u201d for the graduate schools, including the prestigious law, divinity, business, government and medical schools, about 120 students attended the third annual \u201cLatinx\u201d commencement. In the cavernous basement of a science building, where an animal skeleton dangled overhead and Latin music played, students received stoles with the words \u201cClase Del 2017\u201d woven into them, while siblings devoured chocolate cupcakes.Black undergraduates held a separate event that night amid the polished pews and Greek columns of Memorial Church, Harvard\u2019s spiritual center and the backdrop for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s address.While Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s speech was broadcast live and received thousands of complimentary comments on Facebook, the black ceremony was relatively small and more intimate, and seemed invisible to scores of classmates noshing on sliders and beer at a white tent nearby, part of the broader commencement week revelry.The ceremony was open to all students, though virtually everyone who attended was black, and not all black students attended.About 80 black graduates formed a procession to organ music, received kente-cloth stoles, listened to a classmate play Bach on cello and sang \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing.\u201d\u201cFor me, the black community is a home away from home,\u201d Olivia Castor, a student speaker from Spring Valley, N.Y., who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in social studies and African-American studies, said exuberantly.\u201cIt\u2019s where I spent most of my time, where I found my closest friends and, more importantly, where I\u2019ve learned the most important lessons during my time here,\u201d she went on. \u201cSo thank you, thank you for being beautiful, brilliant and blackety-black-black.\u201dBrandon M. Terry, the faculty speaker, joked that Harvard College\u2019s black graduation had become more mainstream since he graduated in 2005.\u201cThis setup already has us beat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in one of the old Harvard buildings across campus. We had no air-conditioning, and some folding chairs on the stage.\u201dProfessor Terry suggested that the mood was different as well.\u201cYou were teenagers, like Michael Brown when he was subjected to the Sophoclean indignity of being shot dead and left in the blazing sun. Your world was shaped in indelible ways by these deaths and others like them, and many of you courageously took to join one of the largest protest movements in decades to try to wrest some semblance of justice from these tragedies.\u201dBut like all the speakers, he spoke reverently of Harvard as an institution, saying: \u201cThe dramatic privileges that you have and will continue to benefit from in virtue of your association with this university are only worth the social cost if they are to benefit people worse off than you.\u201dBhekinkosi Sibanda, a first-generation Harvard student from Zimbabwe, said he had been ambivalent at first about participating in the black graduation.\u201cIn an attempt at inclusivity, we don\u2019t want to end up introducing exclusivity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to end up where this black commencement overshadows the entire commencement of the school. You don\u2019t want to blow away the glory.\u201dThen Mr. Sibanda remembered how a professor had asked if he wanted to drop a class, when all he wanted was help. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be able to take this time for solidarity and identity,\u201d he said, \u201cto celebrate what we\u2019ve achieved.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "Eureka? Yes, Eureka!", "Date": "2017-06-10", "News": "Supported byGray MatterIn the commencement address he delivered at Harvard last month, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, warned the graduating students not to trust the story of innovation that Hollywood promotes \u2014 namely, \u201cthe idea of a single eureka moment\u201d in which a lone thinker has a groundbreaking epiphany. He characterized this idea as \u201ca dangerous lie\u201d that discourages real creativity.\u201cYou know what else movies get wrong about innovation?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg added. \u201cNo one writes math formulas on glass. That\u2019s not a thing.\u201dOne day in 1843, for instance, the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton was strolling along the Royal Canal in Dublin when he had a sudden insight. As he later described it, \u201can electric circuit seemed to close; and a spark flashed forth.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s epiphany concerned so-called complex numbers. His idea, which took the form of a mathematical equation, would become (and remains today) an important tool for engineers and physicists. Hamilton immediately chiseled the equation on a stone bridge spanning the canal.As this anecdote suggests, the eureka moment is not \u201ca dangerous lie.\u201d On the contrary, it is a real and benevolent force of innovation and progress.Many advancements have resulted from a single bolt of understanding. Other examples include the geneticist Barbara McClintock\u2019s comprehension of translocation of genetic material; Paul McCartney\u2019s hearing the melody of \u201cYesterday\u201d in his head as he awoke one morning; the pharmacologist Otto Loewi\u2019s realization about how nerve cells communicate with one another; and the Buddha\u2019s insight into the nature of human suffering.Though eureka-style insights appear suddenly in your awareness, it\u2019s important to stress that they don\u2019t come into existence from nothing. They usually consist of new connections between things that you already know. Your ability to make new connections is limited \u2014 or empowered \u2014 by the amount of knowledge you have. So if your goal is to be struck by new ideas, you first have to do the relevant homework in whatever field you hope to be innovative.It\u2019s also worth noting that although creative insight and analytical thinking are distinct modes of thought, they complement each other. Some eureka moments present insights that are in need of more systematic elaboration before they can be implemented. It may take several insights, each followed by analytical work, to produce, refine and assemble all the ideas necessary to complete a complex project.With respect to Mr. Zuckerberg (whose speech was otherwise uplifting and laudable), the idea of the eureka moment isn\u2019t oppressive. It\u2019s liberating. To know that a great idea can pop into your head at any moment is a thrilling \u2014 and in the face of frustration, sustaining \u2014 thought.Write that on glass or chisel it in stone. Better yet, post it on Facebook.John Kounios is a professor of psychology at Drexel University and an author of \u201cThe Eureka Factor: Aha Moments, Creative Insight, and the Brain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Friend Says Trump Is Considering Firing Mueller as Special Counsel", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A longtime friend of President Trump said on Monday that Mr. Trump was considering whether to fire Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating possible ties between the president\u2019s campaign and Russian officials.The startling assertion comes as some of Mr. Trump\u2019s conservative allies, who initially praised Mr. Mueller\u2019s selection as special counsel, have begun trying to attack his credibility.\u201cI think he\u2019s weighing that option,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said.His comments appeared to take the White House by surprise.\u201cMr. Ruddy never spoke to the president regarding this issue,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said in a statement hours later. \u201cWith respect to this subject, only the president or his attorneys are authorized to comment.\u201dAllies of the president cast doubt on the idea that Mr. Trump would take such a drastic step, and White House officials said Mr. Ruddy had not met directly with the president while he was there.Mr. Trump has been known, in moments of frustration and stress, to vent threats of action to members of his inner circle. In the past, some of those private expressions of anger have been made public by friends and associates, only to generate speculation about moves that never take place \u2014 including a senior staff shake-up that has yet to happen.Such moments sometimes reflect the deep division among Mr. Trump\u2019s White House advisers about the best course for the president to take in the face of political or legal adversity.Under Justice Department rules, Mr. Trump would seemingly have to order Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to rescind department regulations protecting a special counsel from being fired for no good reason, and then to fire Mr. Mueller. If Mr. Rosenstein refused, Mr. Trump could fire him, too \u2014 a series of events that would recall the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d during Watergate, when President Richard M. Nixon sought to dismiss a special prosecutor, Archibald Cox.White House officials referred questions to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, as they have recently on all matters relating to the Russia investigation. A spokesman for Mr. Kasowitz declined to comment.\u201cRepublicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair,\u201d Mr. Gingrich tweeted after praising Mr. Mueller\u2019s integrity in recent weeks. Apparently referring to Federal Election Commission reports, he added: \u201cLook who he is hiring. check fec reports. Time to rethink.\u201dThe idea that the investigation is illegitimate and politically motivated has been gaining currency on the political right for months. Conservative writers, radio hosts and cable personalities \u2014 emboldened by the president himself, who has called it a witch hunt \u2014 have repeatedly sought to discredit the inquiry, its investigators, the mainstream news accounts of it, and the lawmakers on Capitol Hill who are demanding more answers.Initially, Mr. Comey was the subject of much of their derision. Now they have moved on to Mr. Mueller, whom they are attacking as too compromised and conflicted to lead an independent inquiry.Mr. Ruddy said the president was weighing whether to dismiss Mr. Mueller because of concerns about conflicts of interest. He said those concerns included the interview for the F.B.I. post and connections between Mr. Mueller\u2019s law firm and White House officials.\u201cThere are some real conflicts. He comes from a law firm that represents members of the Trump family,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said. \u201cI know for a fact that he was under consideration and that the president did talk with him in the days before he was named special counsel. I think there\u2019s a conflict there.\u201dHe also said that he believed it would be \u201ca very significant mistake\u201d for Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Mueller, but emphasized that he was concerned about what he described as conflicts.The criticism of Mr. Mueller has intensified in recent days, spreading from Trump surrogates like Mr. Gingrich to powerful media personalities like Rush Limbaugh. On his radio program last week, Mr. Limbaugh endorsed the suggestion that Mr. Trump fire Mr. Mueller.Mark Levin, another prominent radio host, has also called for Mr. Mueller\u2019s firing. \u201cMueller must step aside,\u201d he wrote on Facebook over the weekend.Much of the criticism has focused on whether Mr. Mueller is too close to Mr. Comey. The two became friends after working closely together during the Bush administration.Democrats accused Republicans on Monday of beginning a campaign to smear Mr. Mueller\u2019s reputation as he engages in a broad investigation that could include whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by pressuring Mr. Comey to end parts of the inquiry and then by firing him.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, scoffed at the idea that the president might fire Mr. Mueller.The independent counsel statute, passed after Watergate, allowed the appointment of a prosecutor who would look into high-level executive branch wrongdoing and answer to a panel of judges, and who could not be fired by the president, as Mr. Nixon sought to do.Both Republicans and Democrats came to dislike the statute, which they saw as permitting prosecutors to run amok in the Iran-contra and Whitewater investigations during the Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton administrations. Congress let it lapse when it expired in 1999.It would take a two-thirds supermajority in both chambers of Congress to overcome Mr. Trump\u2019s likely veto of any similar legislation. It is far from clear that Mr. Schiff\u2019s proposal could command such support.Matt Apuzzo, Charlie Savage and Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Big Tech Stocks Build Market Euphoria, and Jitters", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byFacebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google.In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes \u2014 Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain \u2014 as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies.But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded.\u201cThere is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. \u201cNo one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.\u201dDespite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks.Other markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election.The stock market, however, remains the main attraction.Late in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end.According to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion \u2014 a consequence of investors\u2019 buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value.As is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment.The push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership.Through these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks \u2014 an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented.It is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market.\u201cIn terms of magnitude, we have not seen this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist.In Mr. Paulsen\u2019s view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period.So when Facebook\u2019s net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon\u2019s sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice.\u201cYou have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cSo yes, you can see how valuations would get extended.\u201dStock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today\u2019s technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era.Still, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce?For example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year \u2014 with more than half that amount from Apple, the world\u2019s richest company.Of course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business.Amazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard.Still, it is not today\u2019s earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow\u2019s, the argument goes.Surprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it.Bill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Mr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google\u2019s cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered.\u201cI have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cYet that is how the market is pricing it.\u201dAnother well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position.While skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division.\u201cAmazon is more fully valued than when we bought it,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages.\u201dAs these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns.That is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures. For a manager not to match the share of an Apple or an Amazon in a benchmark would result in an actively managed fund trailing its index and its peers.And as investors pour billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds \u2014 a record $314 billion in the last year \u2014 no active manager can afford to lag the competition for too long.So be it a mutual fund, hedge fund, sovereign wealth fund or family office, the strategy has been consistent \u2014 put aside any fears, and stay invested.\u201cIt\u2019s like you are riding a missile that you know could explode at any moment beneath you,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo. He has warned in his reports that some of these stocks have entered a stage of mania. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have no choice but to be sucked into the trade.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Convicted in Killing of Boris Nemtsov, Russian Opposition Leader", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byMr. Nemtsov, 55, was gunned down on the evening of Feb. 27, 2015, as he walked across a bridge outside the Kremlin\u2019s crimson walls after dining with his girlfriend in a restaurant on Red Square.The shooting, days before Mr. Nemtsov was to lead a rally to protest the war in Ukraine, ended his two-decade career as a champion of democratic reforms, beginning after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991.Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s family has stopped short of directly accusing the Kremlin, but they made it clear that they did not think the trial of the five men would get to the heart of who was responsible.According to prosecutors, the gunman, Zaur Dadayev, fired six shots, killing Mr. Nemtsov, before fleeing in a car with his two accomplices, Anzor Gubashev and Beslan Shavanov. Three other accomplices \u2014 Shadid Gubashev, Temirlan Eskerkhanov and Khamzat Bakhayev \u2014 helped carry out the murder by organizing surveillance on Mr. Nemtsov for more than four months before the murder, prosecutors said. (Mr. Shavanov blew himself up with a hand grenade while in detention and was not part of the trial.)Prosecutors asserted that the men carried out the murder after Ruslan Mukhudinov \u2014 the driver for a prominent Chechen military officer \u2014 promised to pay them $250,000 for it. But the prosecutors have not explained why the driver would have the money, much less the motivation, to have Mr. Nemtsov killed.Mr. Mukhudinov has fled to the United Arab Emirates, and investigators never questioned his boss, Ruslan Geremeyev, deputy head of one of the main military regiments in Chechnya. (He failed to show up for questioning, and when investigators then visited his home in Chechnya, no one answered the door, officials said.)Why Mr. Kadyrov would have wanted Mr. Nemtsov dead is not clear: Some have hypothesized that he might have wanted to test the limits of his powers, by showing his independence from, or even trying to embarrass, Mr. Putin; others say he might have wanted to help out his patron, Mr. Putin, by ridding him of a critic even though the killing embarrassed the Kremlin.\u201cThe main thing,\u201d said Vadim Prokhorov, a lawyer representing Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s family, is that neither those who ordered or arranged for the murder have been found.\u201cWe will insist that Mr. Kadyrov\u2019s closest entourage is involved in the murder,\u201d he said after the verdict, according to Mediazona, a news website that followed the trial closely.Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, said after the verdict that the investigation into who ordered the crime would continue, the news agency Interfax reported.Prosecutors will make sentencing recommendations next week. Lawyers for the five convicted men said they would appeal the verdict.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Outcry Over EpiPen Prices Hasn\u2019t Made Them Lower", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byAdventures in CapitalismA few weeks ago, after some particularly incompetent parenting on my part (nuts in the dessert, a rushed trip to an emergency room after my child\u2019s allergic reaction), I visited the local pharmacy to fill an EpiPen prescription.You might recall EpiPen as last year\u2019s poster child for out-of-control drug prices. Though this simple medical device contains only about $1 of the drug epinephrine, the company that sells it, Mylan, earned the public\u2019s enmity and lawmakers\u2019 scrutiny after ratcheting up prices to $609 a box.So I was surprised when my pharmacist informed me, months after those floggings and apologies had faded from the headlines, that I would still need to pay $609 for a box of two EpiPens.Didn\u2019t we solve this problem?Over the last several weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with 10 former high-ranking executives at Mylan who told me that they weren\u2019t surprised EpiPen prices were still high. Nor were many startled by last week\u2019s developments.Mylan, they said, is an example of a firm that has thrived by learning to absorb, and then ignore, opprobrium. The company has an effective monopoly on a lifesaving product, which has allowed its leaders to see public outrage as a tax they must pay, and then move on.Mylan has been called out again and again over the years \u2014 by the company\u2019s own employees, regulators, patients, politicians and the press \u2014 and hasn\u2019t changed, even as revenue has skyrocketed, hitting $11 billion last year. The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve.Which means this time, if we\u2019re hoping for a different outcome, something more needs to be done.To understand Mylan\u2019s culture, consider a series of conversations that began inside the company in 2014. A group of midlevel executives was concerned about the soaring price of EpiPens, which had more than doubled in the previous four years; there were rumors that even more aggressive hikes were planned. (Former executives who related this and other anecdotes requested anonymity because they had nondisclosure agreements or feared retaliation. Aspects of their accounts were disputed by Mylan.)In meetings, the executives began warning Mylan\u2019s top leaders that the price increases seemed like unethical profiteering at the expense of sick children and adults, according to people who participated in the conversations. Over the next 16 months, those internal warnings were repeatedly aired. At one gathering, executives shared their concerns with Mylan\u2019s chairman, Robert Coury.Mr. Coury replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment.When the executives conveyed their anxieties to other leaders, including the chief executive, Heather Bresch, these, too, were brushed off, they told me.But Mylan is a prime example of how easy it is for leaders to say one thing publicly and act differently in private. When we talk about consumer or employee activism, we tend to focus on firms like United Airlines, which quickly apologized and changed its policies after a video emerged of a passenger being dragged off a plane.However, in many other cases, outrage is ineffective. Mylan\u2019s behavior persists because it is hard, and often tedious, for employees and the public to continue complaining \u2014 particularly when bosses disagree, or when some newer outrage appears on our Facebook feed.Before the birthday advertisement aired, the ad went through multiple internal review processes. Mylan executives told Ms. Bresch that the commercial was improper. One employee went so far as to send an internal email saying the advertisement would increase the frequency of allergic reactions, according to a person who saw the correspondence.Ms. Bresch disagreed. She said it was better to act boldly, according to a former executive who participated in that conversation.When I approached Mylan about these and other anecdotes, the company disputed employees\u2019 accounts. In a statement, it wrote that \u201cany allegations of disregard for consumers who need these lifesaving drugs, government officials, regulators or any other of our valued stakeholders are patently false and wholly inconsistent with the company\u2019s culture, mission and track record of delivering access to medicine.\u201dMr. Coury declined to be interviewed, but Ms. Bresch sat down with me last month at Mylan\u2019s Manhattan offices. She said that Mylan was \u201ca pretty rare and unconventional company,\u201d and that it was focused on delivering low-cost drugs. A broken health care system, she said, is responsible for the inefficiencies and high prices that plague consumers.She added that Mylan had responded promptly when the Food and Drug Administration criticized the company\u2019s advertisement in 2012, and that the EpiPen had become more expensive because Mylan had invested in public awareness and improving the device.\u201cLook at what we\u2019ve built, and what we deliver day-in and day-out,\u201d Ms. Bresch told me, \u201cand at the center of all of that is the patient.\u201dIn our interview, Ms. Bresch said there was nothing in Mylan\u2019s culture she would change. The company also said it had found no evidence of price-fixing or antitrust behavior, that the government overcharges had resulted from an innocent disagreement over regulatory interpretations and that Mylan\u2019s compensation policies were appropriate.\u201cWe are a for-profit business, and we have a commitment to shareholders,\u201d Ms. Bresch told me. \u201cBut I think if there\u2019s any company out there that has demonstrated you can do good and do well, we\u2019re one of the few.\u201d For instance, Ms. Bresch noted that Mylan had recently released a generic version of EpiPen.When I asked my pharmacist for the generic EpiPen, he told me that I would have to wait 90 minutes, until he could get my doctor on the phone to authorize the substitution. Then, he charged me $370 for the generics.Mylan points out there are online coupons for EpiPen customers. In fact, the company says that since it came under attack in August, nearly 90 percent of EpiPen buyers have paid less than $100 per box because of insurance, discounts or coupons.But for parents in urgent need of an EpiPen, or for patients who are poor, are not internet savvy or have high insurance deductibles \u2014 which are increasingly common \u2014 those programs can mean little. The most vulnerable often end up paying the highest prices, which is troubling when you consider that 15 million Americans have food allergies.But hope springs eternal. With the recent criticisms coming on the heels of last year\u2019s controversies, Mylan will have to change, right?In the meantime, I still believe \u2014 perhaps foolishly \u2014 that sustained attention might create change. And so, as long as Mylan flouts the norms of good corporate behavior, it seems worth continuing to scrutinize what the company is doing, and questioning why EpiPens cost so much.Advertisement"}

No restroom is available for customers. However bright and cheerful, it is not a place to linger.And yet I wanted to. Almost every dish comes with a story, along with a banana leaf tucked inside the bowl. Beef tongue lies half-hidden in a froth of cold-smoked mushroom stock scented by anise and thyme, a homage to a Filipino recipe for ox tongue and Campbell\u2019s cream of mushroom soup.The chef, Aniceto Re\u00f1a Jr. (known as J. R.), sees this as less a legacy of imperialism than as a sly co-opting of Western ingredients. \u201cThe Americans brought soup,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Filipinos poured it over tongue.\u201dThe dish Bicol Express is named after the overnight train from Manila to southeastern Luzon, where the Filipino palate turns to coconut milk and uncompromising chiles. At Tama, pork belly is cooked sous-vide for the best part of a day, then bronzed a la plancha, cut and arrayed like fallen monoliths over a sauce that\u2019s nearly curry, with curative whiffs of galangal and lemongrass and, as weaponry, Thai bird chiles and bagoong alamang (fermented krill).Nothing is taken for granted. Not lumpia Shanghai, spring rolls as skinny as cheroots, the ground pork inside flecked with deliquescing fat. Not rice, which might be flipped in a wok with runoff from adobo until it\u2019s velvety and carnal, or boiled with pandan, whose flavor is so delicate that it registers as a distant memory of a freshly mowed lawn. Not even banana ketchup, which Filipino restaurants tend to serve, nostalgically, from a bottle of Jufran (the indigenous Heinz); here it\u2019s homemade, from chipotle-infused cane vinegar and bananas caramelized in coconut sugar.Mr. Re\u00f1a butchers whole chickens in Tama\u2019s minimal kitchen, reserving thighs for adobo and chopping white meat down to popcorn-size nuggets, which are doused with patis (Filipino fish sauce), dusted with cornstarch and fried until burnished and perfect. They come stuffed in red Chinese takeout bags with \u201cChinese food\u201d crossed out and rewritten as \u201cPinoy pood\u201d \u2014 joking slang for \u201cFilipino food.\u201dI wasn\u2019t as keen on a version of lumpia with a limp, doughy crepe around pickled green papaya and Cameo apples; it cried out for salt.

And the service aims higher. The man working the cash register delivered each dish to my table with a scholarly description of how it was made.

{"Headline": "Dissecting Marissa Mayer\u2019s $900,000-a-Week Yahoo Paycheck", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byIt will also conclude the remarkable five-year run of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who was paid nearly a quarter of a billion dollars \u2014 a generous sum even by Silicon Valley\u2019s lofty standards \u2014 while presiding over the company\u2019s continued decline.The company ended up so weakened that its board had little choice but to sell.\u201cEveryone acknowledges that it was a difficult situation to come into,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research who has studied Yahoo for years. \u201cBut the company was not run well under her tenure.\u201dSo why did Ms. Mayer receive more than $900,000 a week? The answer, like so many things about Yahoo, is surprisingly complicated. It is rooted partly in the never-lose structure of modern executive compensation packages, but also in two farsighted investments made long ago by one of Yahoo\u2019s founders, Jerry Yang.Ms. Mayer\u2019s pay was mostly in stock and stock options, and she reaped the rewards alongside the other stockholders.\u201cThe only sign you can point to when evaluating a company over a long period of time is how shareholders have done in the exchange,\u201d said David Wise, who heads North American sales at Korn Ferry Hay Group, a firm that advises companies on executive pay packages. \u201cOver the last five years, Yahoo shareholders couldn\u2019t have done a lot better than this.\u201dMore than most chief executives, Ms. Mayer was working for those shareholders.She was essentially hired by one hedge-fund manager, Daniel S. Loeb, who got her predecessor fired and won three seats on Yahoo\u2019s board in 2012. Mr. Loeb was particularly interested in finding a way to unlock the value of Yahoo\u2019s stake in Alibaba, which was already shaping up to be one of China\u2019s leading internet companies. He pushed the board to recruit a star like Ms. Mayer to get people excited about a company that had been stumbling for years.When Ms. Mayer\u2019s early efforts to turn around Yahoo\u2019s business and spin off the Alibaba shares failed to bear fruit, another hedge fund manager, Jeffrey C. Smith of Starboard Value, led a campaign to push for her ouster. Mr. Smith eventually garnered four board seats so he could keep the pressure on.Yahoo declined to comment for this article, citing this coming Thursday\u2019s shareholder vote to approve the Verizon deal. Ms. Mayer and the board chairman, Maynard Webb, who approved her pay packages, also declined interview requests. So did Mr. Smith.\u201cShe was an attractive, high-visibility C.E.O. trying to bring some excitement and glamour to Yahoo,\u201d said Martha Josephson, a senior partner at the recruiting firm Egon Zehnder, who helped Ms. Mayer find several of her top executives. \u201cAs hard as the job was, she didn\u2019t get a break. If she were an ugly man, she\u2019d be a hero.\u201dOn July 16, 2012, the day she was hired, Yahoo\u2019s share price was $15.65. On Friday, it closed at $50.60. The stock\u2019s performance has topped other venerable tech companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco Systems, and matched the gains of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Yahoo\u2019s most direct competitor.As Yahoo shareholders profited, so did Ms. Mayer. By the time the deal closes, she will have made about $239 million, based on Friday\u2019s share price, according to calculations by Equilar, a provider of executive compensation data.To lure Ms. Mayer from Google and compensate her for options she forfeited there, Yahoo\u2019s board offered her a lucrative employment agreement. She initially received restricted stock worth $35 million and stock options worth $21 million, based on 2012 stock prices for Yahoo, along with a cash salary and bonus. Although she gave up a portion of those stock grants after failing to meet performance targets, the rise in Yahoo\u2019s share price more than offset the losses. She received further stock grants in later years, adding to her overall compensation.Yet most of Ms. Mayer\u2019s paycheck ultimately came from the gains in Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments, over which she had little control. Thanks to an investment made in 2005, Yahoo had a 24 percent stake in Alibaba, which today is China\u2019s leading e-commerce company.When Alibaba first sold shares to the public in 2014, Yahoo sold 140 million shares in the offering. It hung on to 384 million shares, which are now worth about $48 billion.Yahoo also owns about 36 percent of Yahoo Japan, now worth about $9 billion, that it received as part of a deal struck in 1996, shortly after Yahoo was founded.The surging value of those investments \u2014 not any brilliant business moves by Ms. Mayer \u2014 is why Yahoo\u2019s shares went up. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone coming into an oil company, and all of a sudden oil prices go up and the stock goes up,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, the director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cWas the return based on what she did?\u201dStill, managing those investments was a key reason that Yahoo\u2019s board hired Ms. Mayer. Mr. Loeb had accused Yahoo\u2019s previous leaders of mishandling both their core business and the Alibaba relationship. When he and two allies gained seats on the board in 2012, they wanted a new chief executive who would fix both problems.Ms. Mayer delegated the Alibaba issue, hiring an experienced dealmaker, Jacqueline Reses, to be the company\u2019s principal liaison to Alibaba and its leaders, Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai. Ms. Reses helped the Chinese company navigate its initial public offering. She also renegotiated an agreement, struck just before Ms. Mayer arrived, that would have forced Yahoo to sell an additional 122 million shares in the offering. Those extra shares are now worth $15 billion.Ms. Mayer, meanwhile, focused on turning around Yahoo\u2019s internet business. It had missed the mobile revolution and was experiencing steady declines in its display and search advertising. There, her record is decidedly mixed.Yahoo had no real strategy for reaching customers on mobile devices when she arrived \u2014 a sure route to obsolescence as smartphones became the principal internet device for most people.Through a combination of acquisitions and hiring, she vastly expanded Yahoo\u2019s mobile team, which initially produced some buzzy hits like the Yahoo Weather app and Yahoo News Digest, along with more prosaic updates of core Yahoo features like fantasy sports and email. Yet Ms. Mayer largely failed in her quest to make Yahoo a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for more users in online video, search and messaging.Yahoo did acquire advertising technology and built a new ad system from scratch, but marketers never embraced it.Yahoo\u2019s board recognized Ms. Mayer\u2019s failure to meet business targets and docked her bonuses and stock awards in four of the five years she was in charge. But under terms of her original employment agreement, it also granted her new shares annually, easing the sting.Given those missteps, was Ms. Mayer overpaid?\u201cFor the existing amount of compensation, could Yahoo shareholders have done better?\u201d Mr. Wieser of Pivotal Research said. \u201cOr for the same outcome, could they have paid less? Ultimately it\u2019s a hard question to answer.\u201dPeter Monaco, who was a vice president for engineering at Yahoo for three years before leaving for Facebook last September, said Ms. Mayer does not get enough credit for transforming Yahoo\u2019s culture. \u201cShe eliminated the dead wood, drove out the politics, put in place compensation policies that rewarded high achievers and energized people to create great products again,\u201d he said.Arguably, Yahoo was unfixable. The company\u2019s DNA and technology were built around its original identity as a web portal \u2014 a powerful position in the early 2000s but increasingly outmoded in the mobile era, as apps and phone platforms like iOS and Android became the gateways to the internet.\u201cGiven the hand she was dealt, I doubt anyone could have done a better job transforming the culture and making Yahoo healthy again,\u201d Mr. Monaco said.Unlike Kilimanjaro, though, the Yahoo challenge proved insurmountable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Texts as Lures, Government Spyware Targets Mexican Journalists and Their Families", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s most prominent human rights lawyers, journalists and anti-corruption activists have been targeted by advanced spyware sold to the Mexican government on the condition that it be used only to investigate criminals and terrorists.Since 2011, at least three Mexican federal agencies have purchased about $80 million worth of spyware created by an Israeli cyberarms manufacturer. The software, known as Pegasus, infiltrates smartphones to monitor every detail of a person\u2019s cellular life \u2014 calls, texts, email, contacts and calendars. It can even use the microphone and camera on phones for surveillance, turning a target\u2019s smartphone into a personal bug.The company that makes the software, the NSO Group, says it sells the tool exclusively to governments, with an explicit agreement that it be used only to battle terrorists or the drug cartels and criminal groups that have long kidnapped and killed Mexicans.But according to dozens of messages examined by The New York Times and independent forensic analysts, the software has been used against some of the government\u2019s most outspoken critics and their families, in what many view as an unprecedented effort to thwart the fight against the corruption infecting every limb of Mexican society.It is highly unlikely that the government received judicial approval to hack the phones, according to several former Mexican intelligence officials. Instead, they said, illegal surveillance is standard practice.\u201cMexican security agencies wouldn\u2019t ask for a court order, because they know they wouldn\u2019t get one,\u201d said Eduardo Guerrero, a former analyst at the Center for Investigation and National Security, Mexico\u2019s intelligence agency and one of the government agencies that use the Pegasus spyware. \u201cI mean, how could a judge authorize surveillance of someone dedicated to the protection of human rights?\u201d\u201cThere, of course, is no basis for that intervention, but that is besides the point,\u201d he added. \u201cNo one in Mexico ever asks for permission to do so.\u201dThe hacking attempts were highly personalized, striking critics with messages designed to inspire fear \u2014 and get them to click on a link that would provide unfettered access to their cellphones.Carmen Aristegui, one of Mexico\u2019s most famous journalists, was targeted by a spyware operator posing as the United States Embassy in Mexico, instructing her to click on a link to resolve an issue with her visa. The wife of Mr. Pardinas, the anti-corruption activist, was targeted with a message claiming to offer proof that he was having an extramarital affair.For others, imminent danger was the entry point, like a message warning that a truck filled with armed men was parked outside Mr. Pardinas\u2019s home.The Mexican government acknowledges gathering intelligence against legitimate suspects in accordance with the law. \u201cAs in any democratic government, to combat crime and threats against national security the Mexican government carries out intelligence operations,\u201d it said in a statement.But the government \u201ccategorically denies that any of its members engages in surveillance or communications operations against defenders of human rights, journalists, anti-corruption activists or any other person without prior judicial authorization.\u201dStill, there is no ironclad proof that the Mexican government is responsible. The Pegasus software does not leave behind the hacker\u2019s individual fingerprints. Even the software maker, the NSO Group, says it cannot determine who, exactly, is behind specific hacking attempts.But cyberexperts can verify when the software has been used on a target\u2019s phone, leaving them with few doubts that the Mexican government, or some rogue actor within it, was involved.\u201cThis is pretty much as good as it gets,\u201d said Bill Marczak, another senior researcher at Citizen Lab, who confirmed the presence of NSO code on several phones belonging to Mexican journalists and activists.Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that cybercriminals somehow got their hands on the software, the NSO Group says, because the technology can be used only by the government agency where it is installed.The company is part of a growing number of digital spying businesses that operate in a loosely regulated space. The market has picked up in recent years, particularly as companies like Apple and Facebook start encrypting their customers\u2019 communications, making it harder for government agencies to conduct surveillance.Before selling to governments, the NSO Group says, it vets their human rights records. But once the company licenses the software and installs its hardware inside intelligence and law enforcement agencies, the company says, it has no way of knowing how its spy tools are used \u2014 or whom they are used against.Even when the NSO Group learns that its software has been abused, there is only so much it can do, the company says, arguing that it cannot simply march into intelligence agencies, remove its hardware and take back its spyware.\u201cWhen you\u2019re selling AK-47s, you can\u2019t control how they\u2019ll be used once they leave the loading docks,\u201d said Kevin Mahaffey, chief technology officer at Lookout, a mobile security company.Rather, the NSO Group relies on its customers to cooperate in a review, then turns over the findings to the appropriate governmental authority \u2014 in effect, leaving governments to police themselves.Typically, the company\u2019s only recourse is to slowly cut off a government\u2019s access to the spy tools over the course of months, or even years, by ceasing to provide new software patches, features and updates. But in the case of Mexico, the NSO Group has not condemned or even acknowledged any abuse, despite repeated evidence that its spy tools have been deployed against ordinary citizens and their families.Journalists, human rights defenders and anti-corruption campaigners have long faced enormous risks in Mexico. For decades, they have been followed, harassed, threatened and even killed for their work, occupational hazards more common in authoritarian states than in countries in good standing with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as Mexico is.But when President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto came into office in 2012, promising to lift Mexico to its rightful place on the world stage, there was an inkling of hope that the nation\u2019s democracy was coming into its own.His party passed a list of badly needed changes, taking aim at the failing education system and moving to enhance the transparency of Mexico\u2019s bureaucracy. Competition in some core industries, like telecommunications, has increased.But by 2014, much of the early promise of the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration was dashed by the crises subsuming it, including the mysterious disappearance of 43 teaching students after a clash with the police, and accusations that the president and his wife got a special deal on a multimillion-dollar home from a government contractor.The scandals have left an enduring mark on the president\u2019s reputation. After a stunning rise built on a perfectly crafted image \u2014 a young, energetic president working across party lines, the embodiment of a new Mexico \u2014 Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was suddenly recast as an out-of-touch, corrupt politician with abysmal approval ratings.In no small part, that fall was thanks to the Mexican journalists who broke news of the scandals, as well as the lawyers and activists who refused to let the country forget about them.\u201cYou have to remember this was a government that went from setting the agenda to being entirely reactive,\u201d said Carlos Loret de Mola, a news anchor for Televisa who has some of the best sources inside the Mexican government.Mr. Loret de Mola, who received at least eight messages laced with NSO software, added, \u201cThey looked at journalists and thought, \u2018They are bringing these things out and embarrassing us, so it\u2019s better if we spy on them.\u2019\u201dPerhaps no journalist in Mexico has done as much to damage the reputation of the president than Carmen Aristegui. And few have paid as dearly for it.The story reached a worldwide audience and forced the president\u2019s wife to surrender the house, presenting the Mexican government with the sort of ethical quandary that in a different country might result in a congressional inquiry or the appointment of an independent prosecutor.Instead, the president was cleared of wrongdoing by a prosecutor who had worked closely with his campaign team, while Ms. Aristegui lost her job. That moment marked the beginning of a sustained campaign of harassment and defamation against her: lawsuits, break-ins at her offices, threats to her safety and the monitoring of her movements.\u201cIt\u2019s been about getting revenge for the piece,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no other way to see it.\u201dSo when she began receiving text messages in 2015 from unknown numbers, instructing her to click on a link, she was suspicious. One message asked for her help in locating a missing child. Another alerted her to sudden charge on her credit card. And she received a text message purportedly from the American Embassy about a problem with her visa. Impersonating an American government official is a possible violation of United States law.When the messages failed to entice her to click on the links and inadvertently download the software, they grew increasingly strident, including one warning that she could be imprisoned. Several came from the same phone number, leaving a record of the spyware operator\u2019s sloppiness.Still, the spyware operators pressed on. Starting as early as March, they began targeting Ms. Aristegui\u2019s then-16-year-old son, Emilio, who was living in the United States at the time. Some of the texts were similar to the ones she had received. Others were made-up headlines about Ms. Aristegui, sent from what appeared to be a news agency.\u201cThe only reason they could be going after my son is in the hopes of finding something against me, to damage me,\u201d she said.Ms. Aristegui is the embodiment of the hope \u2014 and the crushing limitations \u2014 for a free media in Mexico. Though she was fired over what her employer called internal disagreements, she continued publishing on her own, eventually drawing enough of an audience to sustain a team of reporters.But the work has taken its toll. In one lawsuit, filed by the president of her former employer, a judge cited Ms. Aristegui last November for her \u201cexcessive use of freedom of speech.\u201dAnd her offices were broken into last November. So brazen were the assailants that they didn\u2019t bother wearing masks. Nor did they steal much \u2014 one computer, a watch and a bag hanging from the back of a chair. Their faces and fingerprints were captured on cameras in the office. Still, no one has been caught.The threats, harassment, even the spying, all of it she channels into work.\u201cFor me, I have opted to believe that my public work is what will best protect me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe great challenge for journalists and citizens is that the fear serve us, and not conquer us.\u201dIt was Dec. 21, 2015, and Mr. Pardinas was at the beach with his family, trying to enjoy the start of his Christmas vacation. But his phone kept buzzing, at first with calls from lawyers, and then with an odd text message.It had been a long few months in an even longer campaign: to pass an unprecedented law forcing Mexico\u2019s public servants to disclose their financial conflicts of interest.He followed it up with media interviews, poking fun at the Mexican government\u2019s embarrassing response to corruption. He joked that it probably spent more money on coffee and cookies than on the office in charge of prosecuting graft.The study, the interviews, a seemingly endless gantlet of meetings with politicians \u2014 it all laid the groundwork for the new law, which Mr. Pardinas, a private citizen directing a public policy group, was helping to write.So even as Christmas approached and his family relaxed in the coastal town of Puerto Vallarta, Mr. Pardinas was busily consulting lawyers on the final draft, which he had just over a month to submit.And then a message: \u201cMy father died at dawn, we are devastated, I\u2019m sending you the details of the wake, I hope you can come.\u201d Attached was a link.Mr. Pardinas thought it odd that whoever had sent such a personal text was not even among the contacts in his phone. He showed his wife the message, and decided to ignore it.Things only picked up from there, both on his proposed law and the odd messages. The government roundly ignored his bill, until he and others gathered more than 630,000 signatures supporting it.Mr. Pardinas\u2019s tone grew bolder. He told one radio host that \u201cfor the government of Mexico, anti-corruption measures are like garlic to a vampire.\u201dThen came another text message. This one appeared to be from the news outlet Uno TV, which sends daily news headlines to cellphone users across the country. The headline struck him: \u201cThe History of Corruption Within the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.\u201d It was particularly alarming because that was his organization.He declined once more to click on the link, suspecting foul play. More text messages came, including the next day. Only this time, having failed with Mr. Pardinas, they tried his wife.The message, sent from the same news headline service, said that leaked videos showed Mr. Pardinas having sexual relations with a member of his staff. It was also sent to a colleague.Mr. Pardinas called his wife, telling her that she appeared to be part of a broader harassment effort. \u201cOh, it\u2019s these people again,\u201d she responded.The campaign to pass the law continued, and the bill made it through Congress relatively unscathed. But the Senate decided to add an extra provision: Everyone who worked for a company that received government money would also have to disclose their interests and assets. That meant the bill would cover more than 30 million people.The president vetoed the bill, saying it needed more discussion, essentially kicking the can down the road.Mr. Pardinas continued his broadsides in interviews, naming obstructive lawmakers and well-connected companies that benefited from government money. Few activists go so far as to name names in interviews, but Mr. Pardinas, who holds a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics, plowed ahead anyway.The initiative seemed doomed. Yet another message arrived, on Aug. 1, this one laced with menace: \u201cListen, outside of your house is a truck with two armed guys, I took their photo look at them and be careful.\u201dMr. Pardinas, who was at work when this message came, once again declined to take the bait. But he did call his wife, again, asking her to look out their window to see if there was a truck parked outside. There was not.\u201cBy the end, my wife had Olympic-style training in this hacking stuff,\u201d Mr. Pardinas said.Mario E. Patr\u00f3n was on edge. The conference table was packed with fellow human rights defenders, including the United Nations commissioner for human rights in Mexico. Everyone was there to discuss the bombshell expected to drop.The government would be accused of negligence, incompetence, even malfeasance in its handling of the case. Like others in the room, Mr. Patr\u00f3n, whose organization represents the parents of the missing students, was wondering how the government would respond.His phone buzzed and he glanced at the screen. \u201cTHE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO GETS OUT IN FRONT OF THE GIEI,\u201d the text message read, using the acronym for the international panel. It seemed like the news he had been waiting for.He showed the message to his colleague, then clicked on the link. But instead of an article or a news release, it simply redirected him to a blank page. Confused, he left the meeting and raced to his office to begin making calls to see what the government had in store.And like that, he fell into their trap.In addition to Mr. Patr\u00f3n, two other lawyers for the group were targeted with the software: Santiago Aguirre, the primary lawyer representing the families of the missing students, and Stephanie E. Brewer, a Harvard-educated American lawyer who has worked for the group since 2007.\u201cWe have always suspected they spied on us and listened to us,\u201d Mr. Patr\u00f3n said. \u201cBut to have evidence that we are victims of actual surveillance \u2014 it confirms that we are under threat. And that the government is willing to use illegal measures to try and stop us.\u201dWhile pursuing the case, the group unearthed a memorandum ordering the soldiers to kill suspected cartel members, strengthening the argument that the events did not unfold as a firefight, as the military claimed, but were instead extrajudicial executions carried out by the soldiers.From the very beginning, the case was an uphill battle. Arrested on trumped-up charges, some of the women spent more time in prison than the officers who raped them.Finding no recourse in Mexico, Ms. Brewer and others appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a regional body outside the Mexican judicial system, to review the case. And they waited \u2014 for nearly seven years.Finally, in 2015, the commission found in favor of the women, ordering the government to investigate the case all the way up the chain of command, a directive that would include Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Ultimately, the case was sent to the Inter-American Court, an independent judiciary with jurisdiction over Mexico, a major blow to the nation\u2019s presidency.One evening Ms. Brewer was at home, getting ready for bed when a text message arrived. The date practically coincided with the 10-year anniversary of the assaults on the women, an eerie bookend to their decade-long struggle for justice.On her phone was a provocative question, a taunt even, asking whether anyone defended the soldiers and members of Mexico\u2019s navy who also suffered abuse.\u201cAnd you guys that do human rights against this, what about the dignity of them \u2026\u201d The message contained a link, presumably to a news story or a tip.Intrigued, Ms. Brewer clicked on it. She was directed to a broken link, a telltale sign of the malware.\u201cIt\u2019s just part of defending human rights in Mexico,\u201d she said. \u201cIt comes with the territory.\u201dAzam Ahmed reported from Mexico City, and Nicole Perlroth from Boulder, Colo.

{"Headline": "The Secret to a Great Potluck? It\u2019s Not the Food", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe most elaborate potluck I ever went to was my own wedding, to which each guest brought a dish in lieu of gifts. We feasted on truffled pea soup and caviar tea sandwiches.At the other end of the potluck spectrum was my daughter\u2019s second-grade graduation breakfast, a festive hodgepodge of child-made scones, store-bought red velvet doughnuts and boxes of hot coffee.Both parties were total successes, with a perfect mix of dishes appropriate to the occasion. That\u2019s because they had the most important potluck ingredient in common: a strong organizer.Advice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.The secret of a great potluck isn\u2019t good cooking. It\u2019s careful planning.A potluck host is like a choreographer whose role is to create a dance rather than a mosh pit, distributing the burden of the cooking so no one has to work too hard and giving guests a chance to shine by allowing them to show off their very best dishes. The host is also in charge of the flow of the meal, keeping track of what everyone is bringing to make sure there\u2019s an interesting selection without any duplicated dishes.Ms. Thielen grew up in northern Minnesota, where potlucks were pretty much the only parties people gave. Her strategy is to make the central meat dish, then assign the rest of the meal according to people\u2019s strengths, asking her friend with the clay oven to bring his homemade bread, the friend with the vegetable garden to bring pickled asparagus.\u201cI\u2019ve learned the hard way that a hands-off approach can result in four kinds of cucumber salad,\u201d she said.\u201cAs a host you do want to do some planning, but you don\u2019t want to give in to your inner control freak,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen your guests can see what everyone else is bringing, they\u2019ll self-edit and you won\u2019t get six platters of deviled eggs \u2014 at least you probably won\u2019t.\u201dOne thing hosts do not have to worry about is facilitating conversation among strangers. The very nature of the format gives guests an easy icebreaker: the food itself, who made what and how you got it there. Deviled eggs always have a back story.As for being a good potluck guest? Ms. Donnelly recommends that you think about logistics before signing up for your dish.Will you go to the party from home, where you can pull a warm casserole from the oven? Or will you be at work, and need to make your dish the night before? If that\u2019s the case, a grain salad or cheesecake bars hold up well when made in advance.I usually volunteer to bring a fluffy salad made with hardy greens (baby kale, mature spinach, radicchio) that can hold up well for a few hours, and I dress it right before serving. It\u2019s colorful, light and goes with almost everything. It\u2019s also one of the less glamorous things you could make, so it often gets overlooked by cooks seeking a more stunning presentation. But it\u2019s always gone when the party is over.No matter what you bring, it\u2019s best to garnish your offering in situ, especially those grain or potato salads, which can get a little dull sitting in the fridge.\u201cA squeeze of lemon, some olive oil and some fresh herbs right before serving really takes things up notch,\u201d Ms. Donnelly said.I like the two-quart Ball jars for carrying watermelon lemonade or iced tea to a party, since you can seal the tops, then use a small ladle to serve.If all goes smoothly, guests get to linger over a varied and delicious spread, and hosts are left to enjoy the fact that they are giving a party and did not have to cook everything themselves.Ms. Cyd advises hosts to reinvest all that saved prep time in the other details that make a party memorable. For her, that means picking flowers for the table. For me, I might actually get a chance to take a shower before guests arrive. Always take a moment for yourself, she said: \u201cIt will make you happy.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Cold Brew Changed the Coffee Business", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported bySummer officially starts this year on June 21, but that\u2019s only the solstice, the day when the sun reaches its highest position in the sky. Down on street level, summer really begins on the first humid, sun-streaked day, when even the thought of sipping a hot cup of coffee is too much to bear. It\u2019s as if, just as birds know instinctively when to migrate, we wake up one bright morning and agree that it\u2019s iced coffee season.That change can happen overnight. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get caught and run out by 9 a.m.,\u201d he said.There\u2019s no way to rush cold brew. If you\u2019re running a coffee shop, you need to anticipate demand. Every year, that demand is increasing: The United States is becoming a cold-brew nation.In the past, coffee sales lagged during the summer and rose sharply during the holiday season. But cold brew now drives a surge in demand during warmer months, too, far more so than other iced coffee drinks. Coffee sales spike when the mercury rises. Cold brew is also attracting an entirely new audience for coffee: millennials, many of whom are making it their drink of choice.Cold brew was still a relatively niche market until 2015, when Starbucks introduced the drink in a number of stores; it is now available at every one of its more than 13,000 locations in the United States, 800 of which also offer nitro. It\u2019s a coffee with both mass-market appeal and indie credibility. Today, you can find cold brew at a coffee shop where everything is meticulously crafted by hand, and at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.The drink\u2019s range is expanding even more rapidly when you count canned, bottled and packaged coffees, called \u201cready to drink\u201d within the industry. You can get that New Orleans-style iced coffee in a school-lunch-size milk carton, or that nitro cold brew in what looks like a beer can. Ready-to-drink, which has long been available in Whole Foods and other upscale markets, is now appearing everywhere. As of last month, you could find bottles of Slingshot Coffee, made by a small-batch company in Raleigh, N.C., at nearly 250 Target stores in the South.What is cold brew? Essentially, it is a preparation. You steep coffee grounds in room-temperature water (which isn\u2019t \u201ccold,\u201d strictly speaking) for six to 20 hours (depending on the recipe) to make a concentrate that can be diluted with water and served over ice. By giving up heat, you have to add time.Cold brew is more than a slowed-down version of hot coffee; it\u2019s a noticeably different product. Hot water will bring out the acids in coffee, a characteristic that professional tasters call \u201cbrightness.\u201d Cold water doesn\u2019t but still gets the full range of mouthfeel and sweetness. The absence of acidity in cold brew is even more pronounced when compared with the iced coffee from the dark ages (of a few years ago), when it was almost always made with hot coffee that was chilled in the refrigerator. When hot coffee cools, even more acids develop, many of them unpleasantly harsh.Perhaps more important for the everyday drinker, cold brew is a perfect companion for milk. Rather than battling the aggressive acids in chilled hot coffee, the dairy tastes full and rich. Cold brew \u201cis a sweet, round coffee milkshake without the sugar,\u201d said Andrew Linnemann, a vice president on the Starbucks global coffee team. \u201cEspecially if you add a splash of milk.\u201dBut cold brew has a poor reputation in some coffee circles. According to those critics, cold brew\u2019s selling point \u2014 its absence of acidity \u2014 is a flaw. The best coffees in the world, the ones grown at high altitudes, command higher prices specifically because of their complex acidity: Brightness is a virtue. Why give up one of the defining characteristics of a great coffee?In addition, detractors say, the long exposure to air during the steeping process can leave cold-brewed coffees tasting flat and oxidized. Some coffee shops treat cold brew as a dumping ground for lesser coffees \u2014 old beans that are losing their flavor or uninteresting beans that couldn\u2019t stand up to conventional brewing.Ms. Ramos wasn\u2019t always convinced by cold brew. Her conversion began when she was a competitive barista vying for a national championship, and she started experimenting with the process. \u201cI often describe it as a \u2018yellow\u2019 flavor, weird, underextracted,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to challenge myself: Is cold brew actually a good thing, but it\u2019s not been made well?\u201dShe has since developed an exacting procedure for making cold-brew concentrate at All Day. The essential structure is the same as other recipes \u2014 coffee, water and time \u2014 but she details how long the beans should rest after roasting (21 to 28 days), how to agitate the coffee grounds in the water (with a wide spoon for five minutes), and which filter to use (the paper filter bags manufactured by Toddy).During Miami\u2019s nine-month summer, it\u2019s her best seller \u2014 remarkable for a town that loves its cafecito-style espresso. \u201cFrom a logistical standpoint, we can get cold brew out the door in 10 seconds,\u201d Ms. Ramos said. \u201cIf you want a coffee and you want it quick, cold brew is the answer.\u201dProvided she made enough the night before.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Portland Killings Dredge Up Legacy of Racist Laws in Oregon", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The fatal stabbing of two good Samaritans who intervened when a man on a commuter train shouted slurs at two women \u2014 both African-American, one in Muslim dress \u2014 has reawakened bitter memories of this state\u2019s past and revived a debate over what people here call the \u201ctwo Oregons,\u201d where islands of tolerance abut places awash in frustration and rage.\u201cOregon hasn\u2019t resolved its history,\u201d said Dani Ledezma, the interim executive director of the Coalition of Communities of Color, a group based in Portland. And the harsh language and tone of national politics, she said, are now exacerbating old wounds. \u201cThe xenophobia, the racism, the caustic narrative that has been fomented at the national level are also having an impact here and adding to that legacy here in Oregon,\u201d she said.By the 1970s, groups like the Aryan Nations had arrived, spinning out the idea of a mythic Cascadia where the old flames of racial purity would be kept alive and multiculturalism kept at bay. Anarchists dug in, too, and still have a deep presence, regularly turning out \u2014 black-shirted and usually masked \u2014 to denounce and often clash with the police.While many Americans may think first of the South as the region where the burden of racial strife weighs heaviest on the nation\u2019s soul and psyche, recent events in Portland serve as a reminder that old battlefields are everywhere.\u201cThe lid is off,\u201d said Detective Elizabeth Wareing, the bias crimes coordinator at the Seattle Police Department. She added that alcohol, drugs and mental illness often played a role in the interactions she investigates.But she and other experts said that at the same time, there is less and less evidence that any extremist group \u2014 old or new \u2014 is shaping the messages that are being expressed. Free-form self-radicalization, picking this or that from the heaping smorgasbord of hate on the nation\u2019s plate, is becoming the norm.\u201cHe was all over the map,\u201d said Randy Blazak, the chairman of the Oregon Coalition Against Hate Crime, a partnership of community groups and government. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really a flow chart that fits how people like Jeremy Christian come about,\u201d said Mr. Blazak, who is also a professor of criminology at the University of Oregon.On Sunday, thousands of demonstrators gathered in downtown Portland, some for a long-planned rally by supporters of President Trump, and many more for a counterdemonstration.Fearing violent clashes, Portland police officers were supported by the Oregon State Police, county sheriff deputies and federal agents. Tensions ran high through the afternoon, and at least 14 people were arrested as the opposing camps jeered and chanted at one another across a street barrier. Officers confiscated numerous weapons, including sticks, knives and bricks. But the two groups were kept separate, and mostly dispersed peacefully when their rallies ended.At a moment in which many immigrants and Muslims feel uneasy, here and across the nation, and racial slurs spew across social media, the attack on the train has put a broader discussion of race in the Pacific Northwest back on the agenda. Of the nation\u2019s 30 largest cities, Portland remains the whitest, according to the Census Bureau, with 72.2 percent of its population classified as non-Hispanic white. Seattle is not far behind, at 66.3 percent white.\u201cIt\u2019s economic, it\u2019s criminal justice, it\u2019s segregation,\u201d said Ms. Ledezma, of the Coalition of Communities of Color, describing the legacy of racism in Oregon. \u201cIf you look at the housing patterns, there is this lasting legacy of disparity that\u2019s been essentially baked in.\u201dThe short explanation, said many people in law enforcement and civil rights groups who track hate crimes, is a collapse of inhibition. More open hate speech in politics, street demonstrations and social media, they said, loosens the floodgates, diminishing the sense of impropriety or social taboo.\u201cThe nature of radicalization is changing,\u201d said Oren Segal, the director of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, a national civil rights group. \u201cPeople are borrowing, picking and choosing elements of various extremist ideologies and tactics and movements or what have you, and creating their own sort of worldview.\u201dInternational terrorist groups also use social media and other digital tools to influence and recruit followers, but the stark difference with what some scholars have called \u201cpostmodern hate,\u201d is that there is no unifying philosophy to draw from.The geography has shifted, too, he said: The rise of the alt-right \u2014 the racist fringe movement with online roots \u2014 has destabilized the old extremist groups that once flourished in the Pacific Northwest by disavowing the idea that geography matters at all.\u201cTheir message has been, \u2018Why do we have to settle for one region?\u2019\u201d Professor Levin said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dilemma for Uber and Rival: Egypt\u2019s Demand for Data on Riders", "Date": "2017-06-10", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 As Uber sought this year to expand in Egypt, one of the most competitive ride-sharing markets, its executives faced a troubling request from Egyptian ministers: Could they provide access to heaven?\u201cHeaven\u201d is Uber\u2019s term for an internal software that provides live data about customers, drivers and journeys \u2014 in effect, it tracks any Uber ride across a giant digital map.That software would be a powerful tool in the hands of Egypt\u2019s security services, which, under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, have ramped up spying on citizens as part of an effort to stifle dissent and entrench Mr. Sisi in power.Already reeling from accusations of overly aggressive business practices in the United States, Uber rejected the Egyptian demand. But its chief competitor in the Middle East \u2014 the Dubai-based Careem, which operates in 55 cities, has similar tracking software and serves three million Egyptians \u2014 took a closer look, according to three ride-sharing executives.In a meeting with Careem\u2019s chief executive, Mudassir Sheikha, Egyptian military intelligence offered preferential treatment in return for access to the company\u2019s customer and driver data. That proposal ultimately went nowhere, Careem says, but it did lay bare the Egyptian government\u2019s intentions, which might soon be law with or without the consent of Careem or Uber.A bill soon to go before Egypt\u2019s Parliament would require the ride-sharing services to place their server computers inside Egypt and to link their data to \u201crelevant bodies\u201d in government \u2014 a recipe, some worry, for intrusive and sweeping surveillance.The security services can already track Egyptians through their cellphones. But ride-share spying speaks volumes about Mr. Sisi\u2019s ambitions for electronic surveillance, at a time when his government has already imprisoned citizens for social media posts, has hacked activists using fake emails and has blocked encrypted messaging applications \u2014 all as the country heads toward a presidential election next year.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a legitimate reason for having this kind of extensive data on people\u2019s movements, unless it\u2019s part of a broader surveillance effort,\u201d said Claire Lauterbach of Privacy International, a research and advocacy group in London. \u201cAnd given Egypt\u2019s human rights record, that\u2019s not a very positive sign.\u201dBut much of Egypt\u2019s surveillance power seems directed at young and technologically adept Egyptians \u2014 the same demographic group behind the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak.Khaled Atraby, a 28-year-old student, was arrested, beaten, Tasered and interrogated at length about his Facebook page last November, he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey wanted to know why I posted sympathetic comments about people who had disappeared into custody,\u201d Mr. Atraby said.A few days after that conversation, the police arrested Mr. Atraby a second time, also in relation to a Facebook post.But the recent talks with Uber and Careem are a new departure for Mr. Sisi\u2019s surveillance drive.Both companies already voluntarily share customer data with law enforcement officials in many countries, usually on a case-by-case basis in response to a legal request. But experts say that access to \u201cheaven\u201d or a similar system could give Egyptian security agencies much wider abilities \u2014 to track multiple people from the same group, or analyze a customer\u2019s trip history or travel patterns.Still, Egypt is a market that ride-sharing companies cannot ignore. After a failed attempt to gain a foothold in China, Uber has turned to South America, other parts of Asia and, importantly, the Middle East for growth.Egypt, with 92 million people and low rates of car ownership, is a prize target. Cairo has become Uber\u2019s third-largest city by number of rides, after London and Paris, in the region that spans Europe and the Middle East.Competition with Careem is fierce: A four-mile journey across Cairo now costs less than $1.Uber confirmed through a spokesman that the subject of data-sharing came up with Egyptian ministers during recent consultations about the new law. But live data-sharing was out of the question. \u201cWe do not and have never provided any government with real-time access to riders\u2019 data, and we\u2019ll always fight to protect their privacy,\u201d said the spokesman, Matt Kallman.The calculation was different at Careem, which some call the Uber of the Middle East. With a $350 million investment led by the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten in December, Careem\u2019s market value exceeds $1 billion. The market in Egypt represents about half of its business.The first hint of Careem\u2019s approach came in October when Wael Fakharany, then its Egypt manager, suggested in a television interview that he might share company data with the Interior Ministry. Weeks later, Mr. Fakharany held the first of two meetings at the military intelligence headquarters in Cairo\u2019s Nasr City neighborhood, with a view to a possible arrangement.According to a ride-sharing official with direct knowledge of that meeting, Gen. Alaa Atwa of the Egyptian military offered a deal. A military-controlled company, MSA Dahab, would take a 5 percent stake in Careem\u2019s Egypt subsidiary and host its servers. In return, MSA Dahab would help Careem \u201cin negotiations with government authorities.\u201d Careem\u2019s chief, Mr. Sheikha, attended the second meeting on Jan. 19.\u201cThe general said, \u2018Information is power, and we need it,\u2019\u201d the official said. In support of his account he provided an internal Careem memo outlining terms of the proposed venture. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution from Egyptian security forces.In an interview, Mr. Sheikha did not dispute that the military meeting had taken place but described it as part of regular corporate lobbying. \u201cMilitary intelligence is a relevant stakeholder in this topic because government wants to ensure the service is being run in a secure manner,\u201d he said.Mr. Sheikha denied that Careem had ever been asked to provide real-time information. \u201cI am hearing this from you now,\u201d he said.A spokesman for military intelligence declined to respond to questions, as did Mr. Fakharany, who left Careem in February.Both ride-sharing companies are lobbying the government to amend the draft law that is currently under legal review. Uber argues that the vaguely worded provision on data-sharing could deter foreign investment in Egypt.The draft law is unlikely to meet much resistance in Parliament, which is stuffed with Mr. Sisi\u2019s supporters and influenced by the intelligence agencies. If it does pass in its current form, it could leave both companies a stark choice: comply with regulations that invade customer privacy, or leave a lucrative market to competitors.Mike Isaac contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Nour Youssef from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Bep Ga in Chinatown, It All Begins With Chicken", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byHungry City10 PhotosThe sign is blank. On either side, the awnings are in Chinese, yellow characters on red and red on yellow, but above Bep Ga, there is only a rectangle of ballerina pink, so pale in the noon sun, it\u2019s almost white.Peer at it long enough, and outlines of old letters start to manifest under the paint: \u201cBubble Tea, Vietnamese Sandwich, Rice Roll, Dumpling.\u201d Trucks unload along this block of tenements overlooking the skinny island of Sara D. Roosevelt Park in Chinatown, leaving buckets of dishwashing powder and boxes of eggs on the curb. But inside Bep Ga, it is pink and quiet.The restaurant, all two tables of it, opened in March. It follows Bep, which started out in 2009 as a Mondays-only pop-up at a coffee shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and now runs five nights a week. Where Bep (which means kitchen) serves a small number of Vietnamese classics, Bep Ga is wholly devoted to chicken (ga). \u201cI like how in Vietnam, you want one dish, you go to one place,\u201d said the chef An Nguyen Xuan, who works the stoves at both spots, Bep Ga by day and Bep by night.A Frenchman, Mr. Xuan spent years in finance before becoming a chef. His parents \u2014 his father is from Thanh Hoa in northern Vietnam, his mother from the city then known as Saigon \u2014 settled in Paris, home to the largest population of Vietnamese in the West, in the late 1960s.Every dish at Bep Ga begins with chicken poached in a hot bath of ginger (\u201clots of ginger, the grandmothers say,\u201d Mr. Xuan said), then slipped in the steamer. The poaching liquid becomes the base for pho, loaded with the rest of the chicken (head, feet), spices that blur the line between flavor and fragrance, and enough fish sauce to give it a satisfying undertone of murk.In intensity, pho ga cannot rival pho bo, which is made with roasted beef bones, demands longer simmering and is, at its best, deeply animal. Set that expectation aside: Mr. Xuan\u2019s version is restorative, light in body and frank in flavor, testifying to the use of the more obscure chicken parts. The noodles are supple, the herbs bountiful, cilantro alongside more emphatic culantro. A hard-boiled quail egg discloses a yolk as heavy as cream. On the side come corners of lime, tiny wheels of Thai bad chiles with clinging seeds and Thai basil, to be creased between the fingers before tossing in.Mr. Xuan\u2019s aunt taught him to make com ga Hoi An, a relative of Hainanese chicken rice, with more herbs and heat. Here, it is a sprawl of turmeric-tinged rice \u2014 cooked in pho broth with kaffir lime leaves for brightness and a spoonful of chicken fat \u201cfor shine,\u201d Mr. Xuan said \u2014 and delicate chicken under whorls of pickled red onions, crispy garlic shards and rau ram leaves with their sunny tang. This is pretty, but the alchemy lies in the humble saucer of nuoc cham, chunky with garlic and ginger. It\u2019s meant to be poured over the rice; I mourned the last drop.The two remaining dishes are salads: pho ga kho, essentially pho with the broth on the side, the noodles and chicken veiled in a sauce in which soy is subjugate to fish sauce and ground ginger, and goi ga, shredded cabbage attended by more rau ram and cilantro, nuoc cham and a squeeze of lime that lets in a little pulp. Both are subdued, but refreshing.All may be chased with cafe sua da, coffee black as coal churned with condensed milk until it tastes of smoke and chocolate, and soda chanh, lime and seltzer with a preserved, shriveled plum sinking to the bottom, leaking salt.The space, once a bakery selling banh mi, has its original floor tiles, studded with pebbles. Diners sit on the kind of faded red plastic stools found everywhere in Chinatown. Vines creep down from above. When the door is open, the breeze catches paper napkins and makes them fly.Under the register, a shelf is lined with bottles of fish sauce (\u201cour salt,\u201d Mr. Xuan said) and muoi chanh ot, a potent blend of lime, salt, chile and sugar, made in Nha Trang, on the coast of southern Vietnam. It\u2019s not to be used recklessly; Mr. Xuan said that he would daub a little on the side to eat with rice. But he offers it because Americans \u201cwill put sauce with anything,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially hot sauce.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of a salad at Bep Ga. It is pho ga kho, not pho ga ko.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran Bans Zumba, and Its Fans Fume", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 To those Iranians shaking their hips and backsides to Latin American music during Zumba exercise classes, Iran\u2019s Muslim clerics \u2014 and an American company \u2014 have the same message: Stop it. It\u2019s illegal.The country\u2019s Zumba fans, however, are refusing to back down.Iran has undergone a health revolution in recent years, with gyms and fitness clubs opening in many neighborhoods. Men lift weights to become buff; women sweat in aerobic classes to stay lean.As in many countries, Zumba, an aerobics dance class, has attracted a wide following here, especially among women who gather a couple times a week to work out to upbeat tracks by singers like Ricky Martin and Shakira and lose weight in the process.\u201cIt\u2019s fun. It\u2019s positive,\u201d said Sunny Nafisi, 33, a Zumba instructor who works in an upscale Tehran gym. But recent days haven\u2019t been fun or positive at all, Ms. Nafisi admitted.An edict issued this month by the head of the Sports for All Federation, a government institution promoting sports and a healthy lifestyle, effectively banned Zumba classes for being contrary to Islamic precepts.Ever since, Ms. Nafisi\u2019s phone has been buzzing with messages from depressed Zumba aficionados who feared their fitness parties, as some describe the classes, were canceled.\u201cIt is as if they have legalized alcohol \u2014 everyone is talking about it,\u201d Ms. Nafisi said, referring to the liquor ban in the country. Even her mother-in-law called from California to ask if this was the end of Zumba in Iran.\u201cOf course not,\u201d Ms. Nafisi fumed. \u201cZumba will not be stopped.\u201dComing together for fitness dancing is just one of many examples of the tensions between Iran\u2019s changing middle-class society and those ruling the country.Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran\u2019s Shiite Muslim clerics have codified into law hundreds of lifestyle regulations, meant to keep their flock on the right path. In their world, things like drinking alcohol, mixing between men and women, and dancing can lead to committing sins. Sins can undermine families, the cornerstone of life in Iran, so it has been decided that these temptations, and many others, are illegal, as an extra push to make sure they do not happen.But they do happen, because enforcement can go only so far in a society completely changed over the last 40 years. While prosecutions can result in fines or even caning, they are not common, and on Tuesday, thousands of men and women danced in the streets to celebrate the Iranian national soccer team\u2019s earning of a spot in the World Cup.Today, many Iranians shrug off most of these sins, saying it should be up to individuals to decide if they commit any.In practice, this means that popular but proscribed activities, including Zumba dancing, are often tolerated if they take place semi-hidden or under a different name.\u201cI taught Zumba for years here,\u201d Ms. Nafisi said. \u201cBut instead of calling it Zumba, I called it \u2018exercise to music\u2019 so no one would notice.\u201dOther names used for the classes have included \u201cbody rhythm,\u201d \u201cadvanced aerobics\u201d and \u201cMumba.\u201dThen, in a sequence of events not uncommon in Iran, another Zumba instructor started calling her classes by their real name four years ago. When the authorities did not react, many other instructors, including Ms. Nafisi, swiftly followed.\u201cSuddenly it became free,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe they just stopped caring.\u201d\u201cConsidering that activities such as Zumba, performance of rhythmic movements and dancing in any form and under any title lacks legal credibility, I request that you issue an order to ban such movements,\u201d Mr. Ara wrote in a letter to a provincial official, which was published by the semiofficial Islamic Students News Agency. Given Mr. Ara\u2019s position, the letter was seen as amounting to a nationwide ban.\u201cSuddenly someone comes and says this or that is not allowed,\u201d said Sepideh Heydari, 33, a nail specialist who has been taking Zumba classes for the last two years.\u201cI like it because it\u2019s fun. I become happy, and my spirit is uplifted when I dance,\u201d Ms. Heydari said. \u201cThat is probably exactly why they disapprove of it.\u201dIt took several phone calls to wake up Hossein Ghayyoumi, a clergyman and supporter of the moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, from his midday sleep during the fasting month of Ramadan. Zumba was not something he had been familiar with, he admitted, but when he heard of the ban, Mr. Ghayyoumi sat down behind his computer and watched some videos showing it.\u201cIn all honesty, I couldn\u2019t help myself from moving in my chair,\u201d said the cleric, 66, who suffers from chronic arthritis. \u201cThis seems like good exercise from someone like me. As a human being I immediately connected to the rhythmic movement. But as a cleric I am taught that dancing and music is pleasure-seeking and therefore haram, or unlawful.\u201dEven jobs related to dancing and music are unlawful, he said, like cutting wood to make an instrument.Mr. Ghayyoumi said that some lower-ranking clerics had tried to change this mind-set, by trying to find some justification for at least listening to music, but that they had hit a brick wall with the older clergy.\u201cThey were unable to change the mainstream clerical ideas on this matter,\u201d he said.Some American companies interpret sanctions on Iran rigidly, and Ms. Nafisi received a letter saying that only if she moved to a different country would she get her instructor\u2019s permit back. The company did reimburse some of the fees she had paid for training in Dubai.\u201cZumba is illegal in Iran because of sanctions,\u201d Ms. Nafisi said she had been told. \u201cI told them what about Iran playing soccer with the U.S. team? But they never answered me.\u201dShe will go ahead with her scheduled Zumba classes in Tehran anyway, Ms. Nafisi insisted, no matter what clerics or lawyers would say.\u201cI have 40 students \u2014 they want to work out,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll just rename the class.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Holberton, a Two-Year Tech School, Emphasizes Diversity", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Like many computer science students, Max Johnson spends his days learning new programming languages, working with mentors and meeting with technology company recruiters. But that\u2019s where the similarities end between him and a student at Stanford or Caltech.Mr. Johnson, 33, is part of an experimental two-year program called the Holberton School that aims to create a diverse group of engineers and place them in the industry\u2019s top technology companies.Like many Holberton students, Mr. Johnson did not major in math or computer science in college. He attended Saint Augustine\u2019s University on a basketball scholarship and studied psychology. He is African-American in an overwhelmingly white industry and lives in his car because he cannot afford to pay rent in San Francisco. If he had to pay tuition up front, he would not be able to go to school.\u201cWe want to remove any barrier to a high-quality education,\u201d said Sylvain Kalache, one of the Holberton School founders. \u201cNo matter your age, gender, ethnicity or past professional life, you can come.\u201dWith just 103 admitted students, some of whom have only a high school degree, Holberton is still small. But it has already helped some of its students get jobs at Apple, NASA and LinkedIn, even though they have not yet graduated. And it is challenging the long-held wisdom around what types of people are best suited to work in the technology industry.Dora Korpar, 25, recently accepted a job offer from Scality, which stores data for other companies. She will work while completing her last nine months at Holberton. She declined to give her exact salary but said she\u2019d earn four times as much as she did at her last job: a checkout clerk at a Trader Joe\u2019s in Minnesota.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do after college, and then I heard about working in the tech industry from a friend,\u201d said Ms. Karpor, who graduated from Macalester College in St. Paul with a degree in biology. \u201cI thought, if he can do it, I can, too.\u201dBefore starting Holberton, Mr. Kalache and his fellow software engineer Julien Barbier noticed that they rarely encountered engineers who looked like Mr. Johnson and Ms. Korpar. They attributed the industry\u2019s struggle to find skilled programmers and its inability to build a more-diverse work force to the fact that companies recruited from a handful of elite universities. Those schools did not attract and train a particularly diverse set of computer science majors.In Silicon Valley fashion, the pair decided that they could help solve the problem by starting a company. Mr. Kalache, 28, left his job at LinkedIn, the online professional network, and Mr. Barbier, 36, resigned from Docker, a company that makes tools for software developers, to build the school in 2015.Holberton, which is named after the computer programming pioneer Betty Holberton, has raised more than $4 million from investors including Trinity Ventures, the French venture firm Daphni and the former Yahoo chief executive Jerry Yang. The pop singer Ne-Yo invested this year and joined the board of trustees, pledging to help enroll more minority students. There is no upfront payment to attend, but graduates who make more than $40,000 a year pay 17 percent of their gross salaries to Holberton for three years.Holberton\u2019s founders, both from France, attribute the diversity numbers to the school\u2019s admissions process. An online exam tests for the three qualities that the school screens for: problem-solving skills, collaborativeness and perseverance when challenges become harder.Other people have learned to code through online classes offered by schools like Coursera, based in Mountain View, Calif., and Udacity, which also had its beginnings in Silicon Valley.These alternative learning programs are gaining ground with big tech companies that had recruited primarily from schools like Stanford, Caltech and M.I.T. LinkedIn is one company that has decided to look further afield for software engineering candidates. \u201cWe got rid of the university requirement,\u201d said Shalini Agarwal, who oversees LinkedIn\u2019s Reach program, an apprenticeship for people who need to refresh their coding skills. The company also works with Holberton.Mr. Kalache and Mr. Barbier wanted to replicate a tech company workplace environment, rather than teach just one or two skills like at a boot camp. The two men decided against having traditional teachers.They structured the classroom around problems that the students would solve in small teams, like writing a piece of an operating system using a specific set of tools. They would inevitably have to research the problem and ask people for help, just as they would if they were confronted by a new problem at work.The men also asked the school\u2019s 120 volunteer mentors, professional engineers and tech executives, to help create the curriculum. Tammy Butow, a site reliability manager at Dropbox, wanted students to learn to review one another\u2019s code, a common practice at tech companies. Holberton worked that into the collaborative process of the program. She also suggested that the school break students\u2019 projects, so the students must troubleshoot and fix them.A Holberton intern at Dropbox worked on a project that made the company\u2019s storage product more reliable. Impressed by the school\u2019s results, the company has created a pilot apprentice program to help employees like the Holberton students more easily transition into the work force.\u201cThe main thing we\u2019re learning is how to learn,\u201d said Ms. Korpar.\u201cI was attracted to Holberton because my school is also about social justice and teaching populations that are frozen out of the information age, meaning people of color, women and people who are not wealthy,\u201d said Vito Ferrante, a director of educational technology at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory in San Francisco and an adjunct professor in the education department at the University of San Francisco.\u201cThere are challenges for this model in that Holberton is fighting the traditional higher education model, which will be difficult to dismantle at best,\u201d Mr. Ferrante said. \u201cBut Holberton\u2019s model, where teachers are guides, is becoming more common. More and more schools are understanding that teaching is really about teaching critical thinking, especially in the information age, which moves very quickly.\u201dThe Holberton School is in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District, not far from huge companies like LinkedIn and Google. There is a modest sitting area filled with photos of students that leads to a large, bright room with long tables and rows of computers. Men and women, spanning many ages, socio-economic groups and races, group together to discuss their projects. They mingle with guests and show the visitors what they\u2019re working on.Each day one student gives a five-minute presentation on any topic, so that he or she can become more comfortable speaking in public. Students sometimes speak at tech industry conferences and are encouraged to write at least one technical blog post a week.\u201cSoft skills are important,\u201d said Mr. Barbier. \u201cWe know engineers who haven\u2019t had great careers because they can\u2019t present their ideas well or sell their point of view or talk to their managers.\u201dAs much as they prepare students to work collaboratively and solve problems, Holberton\u2019s founders also push them to think about the culture of tech companies, which is sometimes negative. They know that the students won\u2019t be protected by the school after they graduate and enter the working world.\u201cAround the time the Uber scandals began, Julien and Sylvain pushed us to think about them,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThey wanted us to understand what can happen in a workplace.\u201dAfter Mr. Johnson graduated from college, he bounced from one low-paying job to another for about a decade. Over the past couple of years, he considered learning to code, but was financially constrained. \u201cI had limited funds,\u201d he said.He read about Holberton on a message board and finished the entire application in just a few days. \u201cIt felt like now or never.\u201d Since being accepted, he has visited Facebook, seen the Google campus and met an employee at the Department of Homeland Security.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot of humility here,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThat it\u2019s O.K. to be wrong. That it\u2019s O.K. to ask for help. And that I need to be patient with other people. All of this wouldn\u2019t have happened to me if I weren\u2019t at school.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before the Gunfire in Virginia, a Volatile Home Life in Illinois", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byBELLEVILLE, Ill. \u2014 Signs of a deeply disturbed family life kept surfacing from the well-kept house with the pale sun awning and the pretty flowerpots off a gravel road here.But here in Belleville, a quaint little city where flags fly on Main Street and the movie theater marquee is set off in lights, Mr. Hodgkinson, 66, who was killed when Capitol Police officers returned his fire, was known to some friends and neighbors as a volatile figure.\u201cIs it shocking?\u201d asked Doug Knepper, whose son is married to one of Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s foster daughters. \u201cNo, because the man did not seem 100 percent stable to me.\u201dNo one can truly know what motivates a man to drive halfway across the country, live out of his car \u2014 as Mr. Hodgkinson apparently did \u2014 and attempt a mass killing of members of Congress. In the days since the shooting, much has been made of Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s strong political views \u2014 he was an ardent supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s bid for the 2016 presidential nomination, and he railed against President Trump and Republicans in Washington on his Facebook page and in letters to the editor of the local newspaper.But another aspect of his personality may have also presaged the shooting: his troubled home life.Mass shooters are usually socially isolated, experts say, and channel their sense of grievance into a rage at a particular group of people. Some latch onto a political cause as a way of justifying their violence. And their attacks are often carefully planned and premeditated. In that sense, Mr. Hodgkinson also fits a pattern.But for all his complaining about Republicans, he had little to do with Democratic politics here.\u201cNever heard his name, ever, ever, ever,\u201d said Patty A. Sprague, the St. Clair County auditor, who has been in elective office for more than a decade. \u201cWe knew our volunteers, and he was not a part of it at all.\u201dA onetime high school wrestler who worked for years in construction and then ran his own home inspection business, Mr. Hodgkinson spent much of his adult life here in Belleville, a Southern Illinois community of just over 40,000 people not far from St. Louis. He lived with his wife of nearly 30 years, Suzanne, in the home with the sun awning and flowerpots, which this past week were sprouting pink flowers, on a street with a pleasant name: Rolling Hills Lane.Cindi Clements, 59, who has known the Hodgkinsons for more than 20 years, said Mr. Hodgkinson had long been \u201cBilly Goat Gruff\u201d and was known for his \u201cabruptness,\u201d qualities that could be endearing or maddening, depending on the audience. He was known to show up at dinner parties and turn around and leave if the meal was not ready. She said Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s political views had taken an \u201cextreme, fanatic\u201d turn in 2016; while \u201clife moved on for other people,\u201d she said, the election had \u201cnever ended for him.\u201dThe Hodgkinsons had no biological children, friends say, but they were licensed as foster parents for much of the time between 1990 and 2003. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, citing privacy rules, declined to comment on their performance. Ms. Clements said they had taken in foster children because they could not have their own.\u201cThey were loving,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were not blood, but they would host Christmas for all of my family.\u201d\u201cIt was a little unorthodox, but he made it happen,\u201d the article said.But there were other, much darker moments.Experts caution that many children arrive in foster homes with deep-rooted problems that cannot be attributed to those who care for them. Even so, the Hodgkinsons\u2019 home life was chaotic.In 2002, court records show, the Hodgkinsons became legal guardians of their grandniece, Cathy Lynn Putman, just as she turned 13. She had been in the Illinois foster care system since at least 1995. In a 2003 annual report the couple made to the state about her, they called her a \u201cminor and low functioning mentally,\u201d and said she needed \u201cadult supervision at this time.\u201dBy April 1, 2006, according to police records and interviews, the young woman was seeking refuge with the Hodgkinsons\u2019 next-door neighbor. On that day, her friend Aimee Moreland called her boyfriend, Joel Fernandez, to the Hodgkinson home and said Mr. Hodgkinson had been beating Ms. Putman.According to a police report, Mr. Hodgkinson had forced his way into the neighbor\u2019s house, screaming for the young woman. When she hid in a bedroom and locked the door, Mr. Hodgkinson broke into the room and dragged her by her hair, the report said.Later, as Ms. Putman got into Ms. Moreland\u2019s Honda Civic, Mr. Hodgkinson opened the car door, turned off the ignition, slashed her seatbelt with a pocketknife and ultimately tried to choke his grandniece, the police said. When Mr. Fernandez tried to step in, he said, Mr. Hodgkinson came at him with a shotgun and hit him in the head with the butt of his gun.Mr. Hodgkinson was charged with two misdemeanor counts of battery and with damaging a motor vehicle. He pleaded not guilty and the case was eventually dismissed, records show, because the victims did not appear in court. A judge eventually gave custody of Ms. Putman to the next-door neighbor; in their final report to the state, the Hodgkinsons described the arrangement as \u201cquite stressful and uncomfortable\u201d for them.During a court hearing in November 2006, The Belleville News-Democrat reported, Ms. Putman told a judge that Mr. Hodgkinson had hit her in the face for not mowing the lawn correctly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mark a time\u201d when Mr. Hodgkinson \u201cstarted hitting me,\u201d she told the judge.Ms. Putman, by this time known as Cathy Rainbolt, died of a drug overdose in 2015; she was 25. In a paid death notice in the local paper, her adoptive mother, Nicki Friedeck, lamented her very difficult life \u2014 and the foster care system. \u201cCathy\u2019s story is her own. A tragedy. Her life was mixed with suffering and laughter,\u201d Ms. Friedeck wrote. \u201cFoster care is not supposed to be belittling. The child is not supposed to be your free worker bee.\u201dIt was not clear whether she was referring to the Hodgkinsons or another set of foster parents.By that time, though, some who knew Mr. Hodgkinson were convinced that something was not quite right about him. Mr. Knepper and his wife, Vicki, first met Mr. Hodgkinson in 2014, when their son Matthew became engaged to another of the Hodgkinsons\u2019 foster daughters, Tasha. Ms. Knepper described Mr. Hodgkinson as \u201cvery aloof,\u201d and uninterested in the children he had helped to raise.\u201cWhen Sue talked about the kids, it was always \u2018I wanted it,\u2019 it was never \u2018we,\u2019\u201d Ms. Knepper said. More recently, she said, Ms. Hodgkinson had confided in the Kneppers that she wanted a divorce.In March of this year, Mr. Hodgkinson abruptly left Belleville for Washington, telling friends he was going to the capital to protest and demand tax reform. His wife, Suzanne \u2014 now his widow \u2014 held a brief news conference on Thursday outside their home, where she said she thought her husband had gone to Washington to \u201cwork on taxes.\u201dBut she also suggested that his home life might have factored into his decision to leave.Tasha had separated from her husband and moved back into the house on Rolling Hills Lane, bringing her 2-year-old son with her.

{"Headline": "In Advertising Paradise, Reality Is Just a Conversation Away", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingCANNES, France \u2014 The top hitters in media and advertising descended on the beaches of southern France last week, lounging on yachts and sipping wine and frozen ros\u00e9 slushies as the sun sparkled on the cerulean water of the French Riviera. They networked and cut deals at parties in chic hotels \u2014 the type where rooms cost $500 a night.But even in paradise, it did not take long for conversations at the annual industry conference to inevitably turn to the frustrations of the advertising world.\u201cI\u2019m hypersensitive right now,\u201d said Kathleen Hall, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for global advertising and media. \u201cAs a marketer you always think about risk, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily the first thought. I think now you have to be much more sensitive to the idea of risk and how anything might be construed as a political statement or endorsement or issue-based support.\u201d\u201cThe answer, and I think they agree, is just to raise the bar on monetization,\u201d she said.Ms. Hall said that in today\u2019s polarized media environment, people were \u201cjudging and assuming your values are represented by your media placement.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kind of obsessed,\u201d she said, \u201cwith what\u2019s the right balance between people\u2019s freedom of choice, the media\u2019s freedom of expression and our freedom to reach.\u201dHoopla aside, several advertisers said they were taking a harder line with such platforms, though they were eager to continue working with them. Google and Facebook, in particular, are trying to assuage advertisers\u2019 concerns around objectionable content.\u201cThey\u2019ve sort of got away with trying to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re an open-source technology; it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s them,\u2019\u201d Jerry Buhlmann, the chief executive of Dentsu Aegis Network, said about objectionable content online. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting away with it anymore. They\u2019re too big, they\u2019re making too much money, they employ too many people, and it\u2019s too important politically.\u201dOthers are more concerned with creating standards for determining how effectively ads reach people online and being able to compare metrics across platforms \u2014 basically, what a Facebook video view is worth versus an ad viewed on Snapchat.\u201cWhen digital media was a small part of overall advertising, I think we were learning and developing,\u201d said Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever. \u201cBut now it\u2019s starting to become the biggest part of advertising, and I think in that context, we need to make the industry more efficient.\u201dStill, while marketers are more outspoken, the giant online advertising platforms continue to reign supreme \u2014 and attract hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing.\u201cThe duopoly continues,\u201d said Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s biggest ad group, referring to Google and Facebook. \u201cThere\u2019s been all these challenges \u2014 consumer brand safety, what I call political brand safety with terrorist-type stuff, fake news, fraud, transparency. But I don\u2019t think that anything has happened as yet that we\u2019ve seen of great significance in terms of altering the patterns of spend.\u201dWhile Mr. Sorrell likened the timing of the Publicis announcement to a dinner guest\u2019s insulting the host midway through a meal, he noted in an interview that his firm had sent 500 people to Cannes this year, down from 1,000 last year.Advertisers are eyeing ways to work with Amazon, as well as how they can take advantage of the Amazon Echo, particularly as Google and Apple follow the company\u2019s lead in selling voice-activated devices for the home.\u201cWe\u2019re working with Amazon as a retail partner \u2014 which we have a big booming business with them \u2014 and we\u2019re working with them as a media partner,\u201d said Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble. He said Procter & Gamble was moving money there.\u201cI really believe voice is going to be big,\u201d Mr. Weed said. \u201cBrands, of course, are known by their visual representation, but brands don\u2019t have a voice, and I think we\u2019re going to have to think about what is the tone of voice for different brands and how to engage with it.\u201dMs. Lemkau of JPMorgan Chase pointed to Amazon\u2019s data, the millions of verified Chase cardholders who are spending on the site, its media and content arm, its ad serving platform and the potential for marketing through packaging.\u201cI think they will be the biggest presence here potentially one day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you think of alternatives to the big two, they have a really compelling case.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And immigration experts say the administration has not taken steps it could have \u2014 even while the latest ban is tied up in the courts \u2014 to achieve the restriction\u2019s stated goal: to tighten the vetting of people trying to get into the United States.\u201cPresident Trump is more interested in trying to win a rhetorical victory,\u201d said Gregory Z. Chen, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cThe question is really, what steps have they taken to make sure that vetting can happen effectively, rather than clinging to a ban that has suffered terrible losses in the courts?\u201dBut critics say the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies have always had \u2014 and continue to have \u2014 plenty of authority to evaluate threats from any country and impose tougher vetting on visa applicants.\u201cThe manner in which they have been pursuing the legal case undercuts the argument for the urgency of the executive order,\u201d said Anthony Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued over the travel bans.But as the rules for admitting people from the six countries covered by the latest travel ban have remained almost entirely unchanged, officials have blamed a ruling by a federal judge who, in blocking the revised order, also prohibited the government from evaluating the risks of letting people enter from the affected countries.In a legal brief on March 17, government lawyers asked the judge, Derrick K. Watson of United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, if he had meant to stop them from proceeding with the vetting review. In a reply two days later, the judge said yes.\u201cI can tell you right now that because of the injunction that I am not fully confident we are doing all that we can to weed out potential wrongdoers from these locations,\u201d John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary, told lawmakers during a hearing on Tuesday.\u201cBottom line,\u201d Mr. Kelly said, \u201cI have been enjoined from doing these things that I know would make America safe.\u201dCritics note that the administration faced no such judicial restrictions after the first travel ban order was issued, and that it could have completed the 30-day review of vetting procedures for the seven countries that had been called for in that initial order. Officials said they began the review but did not finish it.\u201cFrom the beginning, the administration has said the travel ban has been about the effective vetting of people coming to this country,\u201d said Leon E. Panetta, who served as defense secretary and C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama. \u201cThey should stop with this attack on the courts with the silly ban and get on with doing a thorough assessment of the vetting process, if that\u2019s the purpose.\u201dSome counterterrorism experts said the government never needed a 90-day travel \u201cpause\u201d to examine vetting systems, because it already had a number of effective programs intended to prevent criminals and national security threats from entering the country.\u201cWe have gotten much more robust since 9/11 in our vetting of individuals seeking to come here,\u201d said John C. Cohen, a counterterrorism coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security under Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush.The department has nearly 2,000 people in about 80 countries working to combat international terrorism, including running screening programs that target high-risk travelers.Unarmed, plainclothes customs officers in the Immigration Advisory Program discreetly help airline and foreign security employees with reviews of passenger reservation and ticketing data on flights bound for the United States. These officers also help foreign countries examine documents for fraud and provide training for airline and foreign security personnel.Under a separate visa security program, Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents are stationed at diplomatic posts around the world to help State Department officials prevent ineligible applicants from receiving visas. These agents investigate applicants, examine documents submitted with applications and conduct interviews.The State Department also has counterterrorism personnel who investigate visa and passport fraud and screen visa applicants for ties to terrorism, drug smuggling and human trafficking.Still, in his remarks to the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday, Mr. Kelly said that the process of determining which people might be a threat was more difficult for those from the countries included in the president\u2019s executive order.\u201cThese are countries that are either unable or unwilling to help us validate the identities and backgrounds of persons within their borders,\u201d Mr. Kelly told the lawmakers. He complained about the public debate over whether Mr. Trump had ordered a \u201cban\u201d on travel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Companies Like Uber Get Away With Bad Behavior", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorUBER has raised more money than any other tech start-up in history. It has achieved the highest valuation by far, almost $70 billion.It has also undoubtedly lost more money, in less time, than any other young tech company. In 2016, it reportedly lost $2.8 billion, excluding separate, colossal losses in China, which it exited that year. Amazon, even in its darkest, loss-accumulating early years, was a piker compared with Uber.If Uber\u2019s investors have the stomach for these losses, that would seem to be their business, not that of the rest of us. Except Silicon Valley is viewed by many people around the world as not just the hotbed of technical innovation, but also as the place to see the most highly evolved business practices, the models most worthy of emulating.Unfortunately, Uber has the unenviable distinction of being the one Valley company that should be emulated only on Opposite Day. No other company can come close to matching it in lawsuit headaches and embarrassing expos\u00e9s chronicling maltreatment of its employees, contractor drivers and competitors, and deceiving local law enforcement, tax collection and other government agencies.Her account brought so much unwanted attention to the company that the board commissioned two outside attorneys, Eric Holder, the former United States attorney general, and Tammy Albarr\u00e1n, both partners at the law firm Covington & Burling, to undertake an investigation of the company\u2019s workplace practices and offer remedies.The report was publicly released on Tuesday and it turns out to be a searing indictment of just about every way the company has managed its own employees. Its more than 40 specific recommendations go well beyond prescribing more training for everyone. It spells out concrete ways that complaints like Ms. Fowler\u2019s should be systematically recorded, tracked and addressed.For all its candor and specificity \u2014 rare qualities in corporate America \u2014 the report doesn\u2019t directly address the sources of Uber\u2019s misbehavior: its longtime chief executive, Travis Kalanick, and his chief enabler, the endlessly forgiving board of directors that is controlled by Mr. Kalanick and his cronies.The Holder-Albarr\u00e1n report recommends that the company consider eliminating its official \u201ccore values\u201d like \u201cAlways Be Hustlin\u2019,\u201d \u201cPrincipled Confrontation\u201d and \u201cLet Builders Build,\u201d principles that \u201chave been used to justify poor behavior.\u201d Students of Uber\u2019s history can easily match particular recommendations to particular scandals, such as the sections related to \u201calcohol consumption during core work hours\u201d or \u201cconsumption of nonprescription-controlled substances.\u201d It also said that workplace rules governing sexual harassment and other prohibited behavior should extend to offsite conferences and meetings. \u201cIt should not be necessary to draft separate policies for these events,\u201d it added dryly.The requested repudiation of the company\u2019s cultural values would be a repudiation of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s cultural values. The entire mess that Uber is in is, ultimately, his doing.But the report treated Mr. Kalanick with kid gloves, recommending only that a chief operating officer be appointed to take on some of his responsibilities. Also on Tuesday, Mr. Kalanick announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence, attending to mourning the recent death of his mother in a boating accident. In an email message that he sent to employees, he spoke of the need to create an \u201cUber 2.0.\u201d He went on: \u201cIf we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0.\u201dConsider all that this presumes: that he is so invaluable that he can step aside \u2014 apparently no single person will be in charge during his absence \u2014 and work on self-improvement and then, his spot at the top held for him, return. He acts like the company belongs to him.It\u2019s behavior that is, unfortunately, all too typical in Silicon Valley, encouraged by weak boards, investors who compete among themselves to be the most \u201cfounder friendly\u201d and dual-class stock structures, similar to those at Google and Facebook, that give founders\u2019 shares 10 times the voting rights as ordinary shares.It\u2019s not as though these problems were news to the board. Mitch and Freada Kapor, longtime and respected Silicon Valley investors, spoke out publicly in February about disturbing revelations like Ms. Fowler\u2019s. The Kapors, who have been investors in Uber since 2010, when it was just a speck of start-up dust, pointed out a pattern they had seen in the Valley: \u201cInvestors in high growth, financially successful companies rarely, if ever, call out inexcusable behavior from founders or C-suite executives.\u201dThe new report received by Uber may banish the phrase \u201cAlways Be Hustlin\u2019.\u201d But the person who created the hustlin\u2019 culture that has trampled the interests of so many people, that needed 40-plus separate structural reprimands from its attorneys, will be permitted to get back on his throne. The supine board has left untouched its bedrock conviction: As long as the company keeps growing, the founder can be forgiven almost anything.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "MASS MoCA: It\u2019s a Site for All Eyes", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewBut more personally: Wandering MASS MoCA\u2019s wide corridors and spacious galleries can feel like revisiting your old high school when classes aren\u2019t in session. The stillness is eerie, the empty spaces luxuriant and seemingly all yours. A big difference is that while your old high school inevitably seems smaller than remembered, MASS MoCA almost always feels mind-bogglingly large.Especially now, having just expanded its gallery space to 250,000 square feet. But, conveniently, it does this while closing a circle: For the first time, you can start your peregrinations from the entrance, meander along at least one route through its clutch of buildings and return to where you started without backtracking.The structure that makes MASS MoCA\u2019s strands of galleries a single necklace is Building 6, a former factory that not only transforms circulation but also gives the museum a new sense of wholeness and substance. The new addition is being inaugurated with long-term installations by the artists Jenny Holzer, Laurie Anderson and most notably the air-and-space magician James Turrell.His light-centered environments have never been seen in such number; there are nine, with at least one from each decade of Mr. Turrell\u2019s career. Happily, his most recent work is among his best, an elliptical mandala of colored light that resembles a dematerialized version of the vacuum-formed plastic wall pieces that Craig Kauffman, Mr. Turrell\u2019s fellow light-and-spacer, started making in the 1960s.Don\u2019t bother with strict math, but Building 6 is the latest of more than a dozen structures MASS MoCA has repurposed for art in this imposing compound of handsome buildings that form the heart of North Adams. Its rehabilitation makes it one of the country\u2019s largest noncollecting museums of contemporary art. Nearly all buildings devote most of their space to display or event spaces. The exceptions are two structures that were part of the initial conversion, which opened in 1999 and primarily house two theaters; the lobby; a gift shop; and Kidspace for children, a self-contained floor generously stocked with art materials.The idea of using the empty factory complex for cultural purposes occurred to the mayor of North Adams, John Barrett III, in conversation with Thomas Krens, a former director of the Williams College Museum of Art, who was looking for space for long-term displays to show large artworks by major artists. But Mr. Krens left in 1988 to become director of the Guggenheim in New York, and the project fell to Joseph C. Thompson, Mr. Krens\u2019s colleague at Williams, who became MASS MoCA\u2019s founding director and has been there since, shepherding his institution through thin and not so thin.MASS MoCA is the anti-Dia. Its mission seems to be to appeal to everyone, both the entry-level art lover and the sophisticated one. Nearly every visitor can usually find something to like, perhaps to love, and probably something to dislike, too.In a time when populism is suspect in many quarters, MASS MoCA gives it a good name. It is a place where it is possible to progress from novice to art enthusiast. This is usually considered the task of museums that have encyclopedic collections. But MASS MoCA, under Mr. Thompson, has managed it, out of principle or necessity.The show with the widest appeal may be the three large installation pieces in \u201cUntil\u201d by the Chicagoan Nick Cave in Building 5 \u2014 an open, column-free football-field-size space that remains MASS MoCA\u2019s grandest. Mr. Cave has pushed beyond his well-known over-the-top assemblage-like \u201cSoundsuits,\u201d and branched out emphatically. \u201cKinetic Spinner Forest\u201d is a veritable rain forest of 12,000 eye-dazzling spinners suspended from 1,500 thin cables. \u201cCrystal Cloudscape\u201d nestles a large garden of good and evil, especially racial evil, in an enormous hanging chandelier (and visited by ladder), and \u201cBeaded Cliff Wall\u201d is a cavern made of beaded netting.Mr. Thompson\u2019s single best idea was to modify the Krens model: mixing in long-term exhibitions of extended loans with the mostly 10-month-long shows it had started out with. This move was made in spectacular fashion in 2008. That was when it opened the refurbished Building 7 with a 25-year exhibition of 105 in-situ wall drawings by Sol LeWitt, an influential Minimalist-Conceptualist who doesn\u2019t figure as prominently in the Dia power grid as others. It remains one of the jewels in Mass MoCA\u2019s crown.Building 6 expands upon the LeWitt template. The Turrell show, on view for 25 years, is a triumph. The shows devoted to Ms. Holzer\u2019s and Ms. Anderson\u2019s work, which have 15-year terms, will be periodically changed and updated by the artists, which is good, because they can stand improvement. Still, Ms. Holzer\u2019s way with language, morality and history \u2014 alternately poetic and withering, and expressed in incised stone benches or on silk-screen paintings of redacted government documents concerning the dark side of recent wars \u2014 has a renewed and tragic force in the current political climate.The best thing in Ms. Anderson\u2019s show is \u201cThe Chalkroom,\u201d a gallery covered in raw, white-on-black graffiti that expands into a haunting multichambered journey if you use its virtual reality component; her indelible voice on audio serves as the guide. It establishes Ms. Anderson as one of the artists VR was invented for. On the other hand, in a series of large charcoal drawings from 2011, in a murky figurative style redolent of bad \u201970s art, she is decidedly out of her element.Made of all manner of found materials and objects \u2014 metal pipe, coconuts, steel barrels, rebar \u2014 these drums, xylophones and banjoes in sometimes giant sizes are marvelous sculptural objects, and most are available for visitors to play. Avant-garde in appearance and sound, they reflect Schonbeck\u2019s view that everyone is a musician and anything can make music.Those instruments seem to be the epitome of MASS MoCA\u2019s inclusive, multimedia, egalitarian ethic.An earlier version of this review misstated the given name of an artist. She is Tanja Hollander, not Tracy.An art review on Friday about the contemporary art museum MASS MoCA, which recently expanded its gallery space, misstated the frequency of a residency by the band Wilco at the museum, where popular music events are also held. It is a one-week residency every other summer, not a biannual three-week residency. And an accompanying picture caption misidentified the title of a work by the artist Anselm Kiefer. It is \u201cVelimir Chlebnikov,\u201d not \u201cHall Art Foundation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Conglomerates Didn\u2019t Die. They Look Like Amazon.", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byDealBookThe conglomerate was supposed to be dead, a relic of a bygone era of corporate America. Investors, we have been repeatedly told, want smaller, nimbler, more focused companies.And yet there is Amazon.Amazon is just one of these new-economy conglomerates. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is another. Facebook is quickly becoming a conglomerate, too.That is very likely true of today\u2019s tech-enabled conglomerates, too, which are spending, and often losing, tens of billions of dollars annually on all sorts of projects and acquisitions that may or may not turn out to be successful. But investors are seemingly willing to give these new behemoths a free pass in the name of growth and innovation \u2014 until they aren\u2019t.If there is any lesson from the last breed of industrial conglomerates, it is that there is a natural life cycle to most of them.The model begins like this: A company that is successful in one area turns itself into a conglomerate by using its free cash flow to finance the development or acquisition of businesses in other areas \u2014 at first, ones that are similar to their current business, and later often ones that are farther afield. And then the company does this again and again.When such an economic machine works, it works extraordinarily well. But when any one of the major levers in the machine breaks or even stalls, the entire enterprise comes under pressure. Shareholders start complaining that the sum of the parts would be worth more separately than together.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cYou look at companies that got really big in the world, the record is not very good,\u201d Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway \u2014 the world\u2019s largest conglomerate \u2014 told investors several years ago.His business partner, Warren Buffett, stunned shareholders this year when he suggested that he expected shares of Berkshire to rise immediately after his death because of speculation that the company would be broken up and thus would be worth more. (He and Mr. Munger both believe that Berkshire is better off intact, but Mr. Buffett thinks investors\u2019 knee-jerk reaction will be to believe the opposite.)When it comes to Amazon (or Alphabet, or any of the new conglomerates), the question is whether there is something fundamentally different about these businesses given their grounding in digital information \u2014 especially as they expand into complex brick-and-mortar operations like upscale supermarkets.In an age of big data and artificial intelligence, are businesses that look disparate really similar? And can one company\u2019s leadership really oversee so many different businesses? When does it become too big to manage?Google\u2019s own internal list of top-10 principles seems to include an anti-conglomerate provision: \u201cIt\u2019s best to do one thing really, really well.\u201dLeaving aside the question of whether that maxim may have been more suitable to the Google of a decade ago, it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped the company from jumping into all sorts of businesses outside its flagship search and advertising business. Some of these businesses \u2014 which include Android, YouTube, Waze, Nest Labs, self-driving cars and internet distribution \u2014 have been more successful than others. Most of these were brought under the Google umbrella through acquisition, evidence of how the company has used the enormous proceeds of its advertising business to subsidize its entrance into all sorts of other enterprises.Facebook, too, is expanding its offerings through acquisition, buying Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR. And for now, there are no obvious signs that looking after a wider array of businesses is weakening the management at Alphabet, Facebook or, for that matter, Amazon.\u201cThe economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote. \u201cUnder these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational \u2014 even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.\u201dEven more provocatively, she contends that Amazon\u2019s role as both a distributor and cloud provider for many of its competitors gives it an unfair advantage. \u201cThis dual role also enables a platform to exploit information collected on companies using its services to undermine them as competitors,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote.Amazon has thus far been left alone by regulators because it has helped reduce prices of most products. It is not a natural monopoly. \u201cCan prices ever be \u2018too low\u2019?\u201d the Federal Trade Commission asks on its website. \u201cThe short answer is yes, but not very often.\u201dThat may be true. But in Amazon\u2019s case, it has the potential to become so dominant in so many areas that its impact could be more than simply lowering prices for consumers; it could put large companies out of business.Were that to happen, this new breed of Silicon Valley conglomerates may become more powerful \u2014 and resilient \u2014 than the 20th-century conglomerates of yore.If Amazon were to use its acquisition of Whole Foods, along with the profits from its other businesses, to lower prices so much that it put out of business a company like Walmart, with its 1.5 million United States employees, would that be a good outcome? Or is that just a natural part of capitalism?The view of Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is clear. The man who is assembling the 21st century\u2019s most fearsome new conglomerate once explained his view of competition this way: \u201cYour margin is my opportunity.\u201dAn earlier version of this column incorrectly included a distinction awarded to Michael C.

{"Headline": "Pakistan, in a First, Sentences Man to Death Over Blasphemy on Social Media", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 An antiterrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced a Shiite man to death for committing blasphemy in posts on social media. The man, Taimoor Raza, 30, was found guilty of making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad, his wives and others on Facebook and WhatsApp.Mr. Raza was sentenced to death on Saturday by Judge Bashir Ahmed in Punjab Province. It was the first time anyone has been given the death penalty for blasphemy on social media in Pakistan. Mr. Raza can appeal the sentence.Blasphemy remains a highly contentious issue in Pakistan, where mere allegations of the offense can lead to violence and killings by vigilante mobs. Critics contend that the country\u2019s blasphemy law has been used to settle personal disputes and has worsened interfaith relations.Counterterrorism officials arrested Mr. Raza at a bus station in Bahawalpur in April 2016. He was accused of having blasphemous content on his mobile phone, and officials said he had been showing the content to people at the bus station when he was arrested. Muhammad Shafique Qureshi, the prosecutor in the case, said that the court had found Mr. Raza guilty of blasphemy and that he had used Facebook and WhatsApp to spread the content.\u201cThe forensic report of his mobile phone showed that he had committed blasphemy in at least 3,000 posts,\u201d Mr. Qureshi said. The police also said that at the time of arrest, 20,000 Iranian rials, or about 60 cents, was recovered from Mr. Raza.Mr. Qureshi said that during police interrogations, Mr. Raza confessed to being a member of a banned Shiite group, Sipah-e-Muhammad. The organization was engaged in a deadly retaliatory campaign of violence against radical Sunni groups before being outlawed in 2001 along with the Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.Mr. Raza was initially charged under a section of the penal code that punishes derogatory remarks about other religious personalities for up to two years. Later, during the course of the investigations, he was charged under a law that focuses specifically on derogatory acts against the Prophet Muhammad, which carries a death penalty.Mr. Raza\u2019s sentence comes amid a widening crackdown against blasphemous content on social media, especially Facebook and Twitter. This year, the country\u2019s interior minister asked Facebook to identify people suspected of committing blasphemy so that they could be prosecuted.Critics say the government\u2019s move has spread fear and intimidation, leading to vigilante justice and violence.A subsequent investigation concluded that the blasphemy allegations against Mr. Khan were baseless and that his murder was premeditated. The killing prompted nationwide outrage and renewed criticism from human rights groups about the country\u2019s blasphemy law.Advertisement"}

A Data Trove About \u2018Everything.\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byYour phone, in all likelihood, knows more about you than your doctor. Your credit card company knows your likes and dislikes better than your closest friend. Google knows your thoughts, and even completes your sentences. Your telephone service provider knows where you are at all times. Facebook, for many, knows more than the rest combined.For all of Silicon Valley\u2019s cheerleading of \u201cbig data,\u201d Mr. Glimcher said it had yet to be used to effectively solve some of society\u2019s most vexing problems.This fall, Mr. Glimcher and his team will start recruiting 10,000 New Yorkers willing to open up their lives to researchers for the next two decades, if not longer.Researchers will follow every aspect of their lives, virtually all the time, to try to answer fundamental questions about why we make the decisions we make and how they affect our lives.The hope is that in the vast streams of data \u2014 around 250 gigabytes of information on each subject every year, the equivalent of a computer hard drive \u2014 patterns will emerge that will help improve public health, education and decision making.The method of following a group of people over a long period of time to study health has proved effective in the past, most notably in a study that began in 1948 by tracking 5,209 adults from Framingham, Mass., which is now in its third generation. That project was designed to study cardiovascular health, and much of what we know about heart disease and the effects of things like diet and exercise is derived from its findings.Mr. Glimcher and his team hope to collect information on subjects as varied as the genome and social interactions. They will collate some 50,000 data points, including medical records, credit card information, GPS tracking and education records. They will also conduct physical examinations, including taking blood and urine samples.But the first challenge will be getting people to sign up.One of the flaws in the current collection of big data, Mr. Glimcher said, is that it misses large swaths of the population. Simply put, it skews to the wealthier and the healthier. For instance, if one looked at Google Traffic, it might seem that the South Bronx had the best roads with the fewest problems. However, Mr. Glimcher said, that is probably not the result of fewer potholes, but rather fewer people with smartphones.\u201cSo how do we get a data set that covers everything?\u201d he asked.The researchers decided to randomly target families in 150 census blocks in New York City, and their research suggests that they will have a 40 percent success rate in getting people to participate. Even with a 10 percent success rate, Mr. Glimcher said, they will get the people they need.But unlike cellphone and social media companies, Mr. Glimcher said, the Human Project wants to be sure everyone knows exactly what he or she is signing up for.\u201cThe way the industry has gone has been an embarrassment, if not a crime,\u201d Mr. Glimcher said.For instance, he said, many of the people he and his team have spoken to have no idea that they are being geo-tracked all the time, or that when they go to a hospital they often sign forms that allow their health information to be sold to big health care companies.\u201cOur subjects have to understand what they are getting into,\u201d he said.Unfortunately, he said, to keep the sample randomized, they cannot take volunteers at this point but are considering setting up a \u201ccitizen scientist\u201d cohort in the future.So far, Mr. Glimcher said, it is not the data that comes from the phone or other technology that gives people the most pause. It is the data collected from something much more basic: feces.One of the Human Project\u2019s goals is to study the microbiome and the millions of bacteria in the gut. The best way to find information on the subject is in stool samples. But that requires some explaining.The dozens of recruiters who will fan out across the city are being trained to handle that topic and many others. They will also have to convince people that all of this information will be kept safe.In fact, a big part of the $15 million start-up budget is being spent on security.A special data center is being built at the new campus of New York University in Brooklyn, where the Human Project will be based.Mr. Glimcher said a company that had a lot of experience working with \u201cthree-letter organizations\u201d would be building the center.It will be as secure as the information kept by Chase Bank, he added.However, unlike at a bank, the data needs to be available to researchers from a variety of disciplines, so a system of security zones will be in place.In the \u201cgreen zone,\u201d all activity will be monitored, but access to secure information will be limited.To look at the actual data, people will have to enter the \u201cyellow zone\u201d using a thumbprint and a non-clonable ID card for entry. Outside researchers can request a mini-data set, which will not include any identifying information.The crown jewels will be kept in the \u201cred zone.\u201dTo enter this area, people will have to pass through what is known as a \u201cman trap,\u201d essentially an antechamber between two sets of doors. There they will have to provide a thumbprint and an ID and will be scanned via video to ensure they are alone. Finally, those seeking access will have to enter a code proving that they are not under duress.The data is also largely protected from subpoena power, Mr. Glimcher said.When the project is fully staffed, dozens of researchers will be analyzing the data. By 2020, Mr. Glimcher and his team hope to have enough data to start making some interesting findings.And as the years pass, they hope to create what will essentially become an atlas for the entire human experience.Advertisement"}

As one of his few Asian friends, I told him it was hurtful. He apologized and took it down. Reporting friends to their bosses is a big deal. And suppose you did so. The logic of your complaint suggests that he should be fired to protect his students, but wouldn\u2019t that be an overreaction? Your own \u2014 quite justified \u2014 reaction makes it unlikely he\u2019ll do something like this again. You\u2019ve done what you needed to do.Several floors in my building are being renovated. Work often goes on at night and on the weekend. The workers don\u2019t speak much English, and when I\u2019ve asked them to be quiet, they\u2019ve stopped their work. As for whether they are being mistreated, we can assume that their status (if undocumented) makes them vulnerable to accepting low wages and poor working conditions and that, nevertheless, they wouldn\u2019t think you were doing them a favor by reporting them. If you don\u2019t want to harm these workers, then, you probably shouldn\u2019t file a report with the immigration authorities. They may be breaking the law, but the penalties for their discovery in this era of federal enforcement would be severe, and you\u2019d be partly responsible for those penalties.One thing you can do is complain to the building\u2019s managers. Management isn\u2019t likely to care greatly about the status of the workers, but under pressure it might be brought to take the work permits seriously. The other thing you can do is contact your city\u2019s buildings department, which is in charge of enforcing the permits. The workers aren\u2019t the issue here; the bosses arranging for after-hours construction need to be brought in line.At my gym, I am confronted daily with a couple who appear comfortable perpetrating fraud, flouting laws and taking advantage of the system. They were arrested for fraudulently claiming Medicaid benefits. They use a handicapped-parking tag to park in convenient spots, while running into the gym and taking strenuous group exercise classes. They are overt and shameless in this behavior. If it makes you feel better, you could tell them what you think of them \u2014 but truly shameless people aren\u2019t going to be affected by that. To restore the moral balance, you could print out articles about their suspected offenses and leave them by their gym lockers. Or you could try filming them parking with the handicapped tag. (Isn\u2019t this what cellphone cameras are for?) Sending the results to the police might inconvenience them, though the cops may well think they have larger crimes to deal with, like the one for which these people have actually been charged. But these forms of harassment will make people think that you\u2019re the one who has a problem.The best solution is to take a few deep breaths whenever you see them, ignore their boastful chatter and hope for the day when you read in the paper that they\u2019ve been sentenced.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Comey Testimony a Prism for Viewing American Politics", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byIn bars, V.F.W. halls, offices and living rooms, Americans were riveted by the testimony of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, a moment of high drama about the conduct of President Trump, the workings of American democracy and the threats of Russian involvement in the presidential election.For some the proceedings were seen through the prism of the partisan divide. For others, they were less about Democrats and Republicans than about a dystopian sense that American governance has veered off the rails. Here are four accounts from around the country.DENVER \u2014 The televisions at the Park Tavern in a leafy neighborhood near the Colorado State Capitol are usually tuned to sports, but on Thursday morning, it was wall-to-wall Comey as breakfast regulars sipped late-morning beers and aired their frustration and disgust with a political scandal that had dimmed their views of the president.\u201cHe\u2019s causing his own demise,\u201d said Chad Cunningham, 45, an Air Force veteran who has voted for Republicans and Democrats but sat out the last presidential election. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing anything for this country except embarrassing us.\u201dMr. Cunningham said the former F.B.I. director seemed honest and forthright, a man with little to hide and little reason to lie. To him, Mr. Comey\u2019s steady, detailed delivery made Mr. Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-phone Twitter habit seem especially intemperate and cavalier. He said he would be perfectly happy if Vice President Mike Pence took over for Mr. Trump.\u201cBecause this is not working,\u201d he said.As the testimony unfolded on the TV screens, Michael O\u2019Brien, 55, a retired teacher, hunched over his tablet, earbuds inserted, because he said the livestream from PBS was arriving just a few seconds earlier than the cable news feed.\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to miss something,\u201d he said.Mr. O\u2019Brien had nothing kind to say about Mr. Trump or Republican politicians and commentators who have defended him and his campaign during the Russia investigation. He said he was disturbed by Russian hacking and interference in the last election, and was shocked more people were not equally outraged.Mr. O\u2019Brien and the woman sitting next to him at the bar, Sherry Wing, often argue politics. When he criticized the president, Ms. Wing would often respond that the country needed to come together after a divisive election and give him time to grow into the office. She said she still believed that to an extent, but as the testimony played overhead, she was developing another view.\u201cHe\u2019s just a spoiled rotten baby,\u201d Ms. Wing said. \u201cLet\u2019s move forward. What are you going to do to make this country better?\u201dMs. Wing, a registered Republican who tends bar at an American Legion post, voted independent last November out of distaste for both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton. She said she was not much fazed by political corruption (as old as America) or the revelations of Russian meddling into the election (a distraction).But Ms. Wing was dismayed by what she believed the investigation had revealed about Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament and character.\u201cWhat the hell does this have to do with anything?\u201d Ms. Wing said. \u201cBring back our jobs. Bring back our dignity.\u201d JACK HEALYGROVETOWN, Ga. \u2014 The water tower here includes a rendering of an American flag and, just above Grovetown\u2019s name, \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d Soldiers from Fort Gordon fill restaurants, gas stations and retail shops.But though it was easy to find a television beaming out Mr. Comey\u2019s remarks, many people found other things to focus on.\u201cI think a lot of people have run with one little bit, and now it\u2019s a big mess,\u201d said Deborah Barnes, 61, who has run Hairy\u2019s Barber Shop for about 18 years. \u201cI would argue a lot of people \u2014 just regular Joes \u2014 see it the same way, and that\u2019s why they elected Donald Trump.\u201dMs. Barnes, dressed in a black barber\u2019s smock with \u201cDebbie\u201d embroidered in red, had the hearing on in her shop. About an hour into Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony, her customers had paid little attention, she said.\u201cI don\u2019t even think that anybody noticed it being on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just interested in getting a haircut.\u201dAlthough Ms. Barnes said she was paying some attention to the day\u2019s proceedings, she said she viewed the hearing as unlikely to settle any of the questions that have dogged Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201cIt is a big mess,\u201d said Ms. Barnes, who does not use Twitter and said she was a sparing user of Facebook. \u201cIn my opinion, some of the senators are just out to get anything.\u201dShe added, \u201cWhether you\u2019re Democrat or Republican, your president is your damn president.\u201dIn nearby Augusta, Santria Swinton, 32, was watching the hearing as she cleaned at a hotel where the asking rate for a room on Thursday night was $97. As she moved among rooms on the fourth floor, she was switching televisions to CNN so she could listen to Mr. Comey.\u201cI just want to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said as she paused for a moment at the door of Room 409, the white comforter on its bed already adjusted, just so. \u201cI\u2019m just taking it all in. I\u2019m just nosy.\u201dAt the Harlem, Ga., Huddle House, across the street from a mural of Laurel and Hardy, the Comey hearing was playing on one television and ESPN on another. But neither appeared to be getting much attention.A family sat in a booth closest to the television where Fox News was playing.\u201cI just think it\u2019s propaganda,\u201d Erin Mallory, 39, said as she stood behind the counter and a child screamed from elsewhere in the restaurant.Ms. Mallory said she would catch up on Mr. Comey\u2019s comments later.\u201cI think it\u2019s just more noise,\u201d she said. ALAN BLINDERCHICAGO \u2014 In a quiet back room of a bakery here, three friends gathered Thursday to sip coffee, watch CNN and analyze every syllable Mr. Comey said about a president they loathe.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to see the highlights,\u201d said Chris Stone, 40, who took the day off from his job in advertising to watch the hearing. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see the spin afterwards. I really was looking for the direct conversations.\u201dA couple of hours in, Mr. Stone said he heard enough to conclude that Mr. Trump \u2014 a man he described as \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d \u2014 had tried to manipulate Mr. Comey.\u201cI think this is just the tip of the spear in terms of this investigation,\u201d Mr. Stone said.Seated next to him, Tari Toppe, 42, said she thought there was \u201cpossibly\u201d enough information now to pursue impeachment of Mr. Trump.\u201cI was kind of hoping they would get enough out of this to look into obstruction of justice,\u201d said Ms. Toppe, a massage therapist and stay-at-home mother.Their friend, Kira Kurka, 43, was enjoying a carrot cake muffin and paying close attention for any evidence that Mr. Trump may have colluded with Russia. When Mr. Comey dodged a question on that topic, Ms. Kurka responded with displeasure. \u201cCome on, give an answer,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201dBut even Mr. Comey\u2019s nonanswer spoke volumes, Ms. Kurka said. \u201cHe has something, he just can\u2019t say, it\u2019s something that has to be in a closed-door session, because it\u2019s something big that could maybe lead to impeachment,\u201d speculated Ms. Kurka, a photographer who said she was procrastinating on work in order to watch the hearing.Mr. Stone, Ms. Toppe and Ms. Kurka all voted for Mrs. Clinton in last year\u2019s presidential election, and all expressed fears about the state of American democracy under Mr. Trump.But the three friends agreed that Mr. Comey\u2019s public testimony was a positive step, a sign that investigators were taking the Russia issue seriously and that wrongdoers might be held accountable.They credited senators from both parties who asked tough questions. They scoffed as Republicans kept mentioning Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server.Mr. Stone said the hearing had been \u201ca good thing for transparency, for the American people.\u201d And he said patience was needed as the investigation continued to unfold.\u201cHopefully,\u201d Mr. Stone said, \u201cAmericans aren\u2019t expecting that this is going to be a quick conclusion.\u201d MITCH SMITHPHOENIX \u2014 A burlesque dancer, a former Army ranger and a Home Depot sales clerk sat around the dark-mahogany bar at Ole Brass Rail on Thursday morning, having a drink at the end of a shift, or filling their stomachs at the start of a workday. The 18 television sets on the walls customarily show Diamondbacks or Cardinals games. But not Thursday morning.Mr. Comey was testifying before Congress, so the bartender, Kathie Larsyn, tuned in to ABC and put up the volume, figuring everyone wanted to hear what Mr. Comey had to say.At the bar, located on a busy corner between a check-cashing center and a Mexican restaurant, the political persuasions vary, but many regulars are united by their distaste for politics these days. The dancer, Kitty Victorian, voted for Hillary Clinton. The ranger, Abel Candelaria, voted for Donald Trump. The salesman, Terry Gaines, did not bother to cast a ballot last November.In this slice of Arizona, a state that last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996, the debate around the bar on Thursday was not about red or blue ideology, or about who was right \u2014 Mr. Comey or Mr. Trump. There was only sporadic interest in what was being said and instead a dismissive sense about politics in general.\u201cThe whole thing is a circus,\u201d said Mr. Gaines, 64, referring to the senators, who are \u201cbeholden to their constituents,\u201d and Mr. Comey, \u201cwho probably has his own agenda.\u201d Then, he returned to his plate of hash browns and scrambled eggs.The only time when everyone seemed to be paying attention was when Senator John McCain of Arizona asked Mr. Comey about his investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails.\u201cAren\u2019t we talking about Russia?\u201d Ms. Larsyn asked, her eyes trained on the screen.In the bar, at least, the conversation veered toward Russia and whether it interfered in the elections, which \u201cpretty much everyone agrees is pretty crazy,\u201d Ms. Larsyn said.Mr. Gaines recalled the weekly duck-and-cover in school when he was a child and the fear that he and everyone had of a nuclear attack by the former Soviet Union.\u201cNow, they say Russia influenced the elections for president of the United States,\u201d he said, shaking his head.Don Cross, 82, who was sipping a Budweiser, is a registered Republican who voted for Mrs. Clinton \u201cbecause the alternative was terrible.\u201d Nothing since the election has made him feel better about politics.These days, \u201cI\u2019m a skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust any of these people on TV. I don\u2019t trust their motives.\u201d FERNANDA SANTOSAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a Home Depot sales clerk in Phoenix.

As the second quarter ends this week, 2017 has so far been a banner year, with major indexes hitting records.But as the bull market rolls on, some see storm clouds on the horizon. \u201cValuations are high and it\u2019s one of the longest and largest bull markets in history,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cBull markets don\u2019t last forever. So the question is, when will the music stop?\u201dInvestors \u201care on a knife\u2019s edge,\u201d said Michael J. Kelly, global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments. With many still scarred by the financial crisis, \u201cthey see a potential disaster around every corner.\u201dThis month the so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which have led the market\u2019s rally \u2014 faced a sudden downdraft, which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times to come. Those jitters were on display Thursday, as tech shares led a sell-off that put a dent in the major indexes.And then there\u2019s Mr. Trump himself, whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential to rattle markets.So I asked some prominent investors and market analysts whether they were pulling back from stocks, and how they viewed these latest developments.There\u2019s no question that these market darlings, which together have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the market\u2019s gains, are expensive, and getting more so. Price-to-earnings ratios range from 38 (Facebook) to 184 (Amazon). Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes. They show up not only in so-called growth funds, but also in value and low-volatility funds. Should they embark on a sustained plunge, a bear market could quickly follow.The tremor in June was \u201ca warning shot across the bow,\u201d said Bill Smead, the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. The Faang stocks \u201care showing all the classic signs of being overcooked,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat magazine hasn\u2019t had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover? There\u2019s no question this can end very badly. But the market can stay irrational for a very long time. My sense is that there\u2019s one big blowout rally left in these stocks.\u201dMr. Stack noted that the Faang stocks had brief sell-offs last June and October, only to rebound. Still, he said, \u201cthe Faang stocks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due to the amount of money that flowed into them and the high expectations that have driven them higher.\u201dBut like Mr. Smead, he doesn\u2019t expect that to be imminent. \u201cWe\u2019re not buying them, but we\u2019re not necessarily saying sell,\u201d Mr. Stack said. He urged investors to rebalance portfolios that have become too heavily weighted in these stocks.Everyone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market, but that may still be years away.\u201cHistorically it\u2019s difficult to find a bear market that wasn\u2019t triggered to some extent by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as they\u2019re going to will have a significant impact. What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced to raise rates faster than everyone anticipates. The Fed has prepared investors for one more rate hike this year. That\u2019s where the potential surprise could come. If we see two or three by year\u2019s end, we\u2019re going to see definite headwinds and maybe a market top of some significance.\u201dMr. Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room to maneuver before stocks start to be affected. \u201cWe just had a once-in-70-year crisis that left very long scars. Businesses basically didn\u2019t invest for eight years. In tightening, the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate. But we\u2019re just getting to the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and we\u2019re seeing more normal economic activity.\u201dMr. Kelly said bull markets typically last another three to four years after such a point in the economic cycle, and can even go another eight or nine. \u201cBull markets die from excess, not old age,\u201d he said.Mr. Smead agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re getting closer to normal rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be difficult for the stock market when it happens. People will be less willing to be adventurous. But that\u2019s still years away.\u201dOver at InvesTech Research, \u201cwe\u2019re still quite bullish,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe\u2019re not increasing cash reserves. We are rebalancing towards more defensive and out-of-favor sectors, like consumer staples and health care.\u201d\u201cThe risks don\u2019t lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cFor political mayhem to upset the economic apple cart, it has to irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level. So far we don\u2019t see that happening. Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16-year highs, and C.E.O. confidence in April was the highest since 2004.\u201dNor have investors given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver business-friendly corporate tax reform and a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code, despite the president\u2019s troubles.At the same time, \u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t be looking to the market for vindication,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a Trump rally. He\u2019s basically riding on the Obama years. \u201cHis bottom line: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to politics, and that\u2019s been a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Can\u2019t Return to Syria. But Canada Doesn\u2019t Want Me.", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTORONTO \u2014 I arrived in Canada from Syria 10 years ago as an international student, and like every young dreamer, I was excited about my goals: perfect my English, land a starter job, move up quickly and find the love of my life \u2014 all in this land where I didn\u2019t know a soul.I kept my focus razor sharp on the future and didn\u2019t dwell on the cushy life I had left behind in Syria. By 23, I had held a high-paying managerial position at Syriatel, one of Syria\u2019s largest tech companies, and was living it up with lifelong friends in the scenic seaside town of Latakia.In Toronto, my life was very different. My first job was the night shift at Naz\u2019s Falafel House in the entertainment district. I cleaned washrooms and mopped floors after the weekend partygoers left. For months, I slept four hours a day, six days a week so that I could have enough time for school and for exploring the streets of the city I was quickly falling in love with.Living in Toronto, I became well acquainted with the connotations of the words \u201cimmigrant\u201d (hard luck, resourceful, ambitious) and \u201crefugee\u201d (resource-sucking, burdensome, maybe dangerous). I wanted to succeed on equal footing with those who made this country great.After attaining a couple of postgraduate degrees in business, I landed a job as a financial adviser at a major bank in Toronto. Life in Canada was starting to look so good that I applied for permanent residency in 2010.Then something happened, not in Canada but back home: a civil uprising for freedom and dignity in Syria. Like thousands of young activists across Syria, I published posts online expressing my support for the revolution.Almost immediately, the threats came in. Many people from Latakia, my city, were directly related to the regime and became vehement regime supporters. The revolution was turning old friends into enemies.One day I got a call and the voice on the other end said, \u201cDon\u2019t dare come back to Syria.\u201d The threats escalated after I published a note on Facebook to build awareness about the oppression of the Assad regime.In 2012, Immigration Canada rejected my application for permanent residency: I had come up two points short in its system. Voicing my opinions about the revolution robbed me of the option to return home. But Canada didn\u2019t want me, either.I felt like an abandoned child, stuck between a new home that didn\u2019t think I was good enough to stay and an old home that no longer welcomed my return.Out of options, I applied for political asylum in Canada and became a refugee claimant. I was among the small number of Syrians seeking refuge in Canada but not through the well-known private and government sponsorship programs, because we were already here.I wasn\u2019t one of the desperate refugees who made a perilous trip across the sea; I was already here. I didn\u2019t get a handshake from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the airport or other public displays of support, nor did I have a sponsor group to support my resettlement. Instead, I faced court hearings, lawyer meetings and endless delays for many reasons, some reasonable and some frustratingly unreasonable.Most of all, I never wanted to tell the people I met that I was a refugee. I didn\u2019t want to say out loud that this country had not yet accepted me. I tried to justify hiding the truth about my status. I told myself if people know I\u2019m a refugee, they may respond to me with sympathy. A refugee is a creature that needs help. Or they may respond to me with fear or hatred. A refugee is a security threat or an economic liability.Instead, I began my lovesick devotion to proving myself worthy of being a Canadian. I wooed my new home, helping others, spearheading nonprofits. I co-founded organizations like Refugee Career Jumpstart Project and the Syrian-Canadian Foundation. I helped hundreds of newcomers learn English, find homes, get jobs. As a community leader, I promoted Canada\u2019s refugees programs in meetings with government representatives from Sweden, Italy and the Middle East.And for this I paid a dear price. I lost some people who were those closest to me. I recall the hundreds of conversations with loved ones in which all I could talk about was my work. I lived in the future and lost the beautiful moments that could have been.And still, I hid my own refugee status, even from the people I had helped. Then one day, I came across a book, \u201cFlight and Freedom,\u201d that helped shift my perspective. The book tells 30 stories of Canadian refugees who overcame long odds and sometimes great cruelty in their journeys. The traits the book described \u2014 resilience, resourcefulness, courage \u2014 were the same ones I could see in the refugees I worked with, a group I didn\u2019t want to admit I belonged to.It saddened me how pathetic I had been in hiding my own status.It has been 10 years since I set foot in this country and four since I requested refuge. After years of separation from my family, I watched my mom and sisters arrive at Toronto Pearson Airport through private sponsorship and receive their permanent residency papers, while I still have no idea what my future will hold.But I should not have had to try so hard to prove my worth. Refugees should not have to give up so much in an attempt to be accepted. Society may proliferate the stigma of being a refugee, and allow all the ugly stereotypes to flourish. But I\u2019m at fault for fearing the label and am working hard to prove it wrong.I have done what I can to love this country, but I am no longer willing to neglect the other parts of my life that also deserve my love. And with equal conviction, I am no longer willing to hide from the truth. My name is Mustafa Alio, I am a refugee and I am proud.Mustafa Alio is the co-founder of the Refugee Career Jumpstart Project in Toronto.Advertisement"}

Post-surgery, Martha\u2019s eyes remained red and droopy, and she can\u2019t see out of one of them.Yet despite her hardships and imperfections, Martha was an endearing \u201cgentle giant,\u201d Mrs. Zindler said. At night, Martha snores so loudly that she isn\u2019t allowed to sleep in Mrs. Zindler\u2019s bedroom. When Martha is not asleep \u2014 as she is most of the day \u2014 she playfully bosses around the other dogs Mrs. Zindler fosters.\u201cThe first time I saw her, I had to laugh,\u201d said Janet Palma, a Dogwood board member. \u201cHer huge feet, the baggy skin on her legs, the floppy skin over her eyes. She\u2019s just darling.\u201dShortly after her rescue, Martha found a suitor in Ms. Burkard, who reached out to Dogwood via Facebook. Two of her St. Bernards had died, and her third, Blue, needed a friend.She told Mrs. Zindler that she could offer Martha 11 acres at her family\u2019s home, where Martha could befriend Blue, explore the banks of a lake and rest underneath apricot and cherry trees.\u201cShe\u2019s going to fit right in,\u201d Ms. Burkard thought. Mrs. Zindler agreed, and the adoption was set to go.Then, last week, Mrs. Zindler called Ms. Burkard. The local fair was having a \u201cWorld\u2019s Ugliest Dog\u201d contest, and although the two women found the dog gorgeous, they thought maybe Martha\u2019s endearing imperfections could make her a winner. The contest, Mrs. Zindler said, promotes the adoption of dogs that often get left on the streets or in shelters.For the competition on Friday, Martha slowly climbed onto the stage, plopped down and napped. She snored while the crowd cheered, and the judges named her the World\u2019s Ugliest Dog.\u201cDoes Martha know she\u2019s that ugly?\u201d an announcer said.\u201cNo,\u201d Mrs. Zindler said. \u201cMartha thinks she\u2019s beautiful.

Poroshenko, the Ukrainian president, called it the collapse of the \u201cpaper curtain.\u201dMore than 20,000 Ukrainians have already seized on the rule change, some stepping out of airports at their destinations pumping their fists to celebrate putting the bureaucratic headache of visas behind them. On peak days, Ukraine\u2019s border service says, about 5,000 of its citizens leave for the European countries.They are not permitted to work, and can be required to show a return ticket. Still, the change is a rare bright spot for Ukraine, a country mired in war with Russia, plagued by economic woes and struggling to gain a sympathetic hearing from the Trump administration, which has sought closer ties with Moscow.\u201cIt was all quite quick and comfortable,\u201d Timofey Matskevich, a small-business owner, said of transiting with his wife, Daria, through an airport serving Barcelona.\u201cThey asked no questions, they stamped our passports and said, \u2018Welcome to Spain,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Matskevich said in an online chat from the apartment where he was staying, which he said had a marvelous view of the beach and the Mediterranean beyond.\u201cIt\u2019s a change in mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have more freedom to go somewhere, to see things. For the mentality of the country to change, to get rid of the Soviet legacy, you need to see other parts of the world.\u201dWhile the visa waiver for Ukrainians is the largest shift of the kind for former Soviet countries, most of Ukraine\u2019s 45 million people cannot afford to go on vacation abroad. Citizens of Georgia and Moldova already qualified for short-term visa-free travel to most of Western Europe, and those of the Baltic countries, which are members of the European Union, can come and go as they please.Mr. Poroshenko celebrated the change by opening a symbolic \u201cdoor to Europe\u201d that had been set up on a stage at a border crossing with Slovakia. To help illustrate what lay to the west, the door was surrounded by walls depicting the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum in Rome, Dutch windmills and other European tourist sights.Mr. Poroshenko called the visa waiver \u201ca final exit of our country from the Russian Empire,\u201d and he joked that \u201cthe words \u2018Back in the U.S.S.R.\u2019 would be heard only listening to The Beatles.\u201dThe European Union has kept pressing the government in Kiev to adhere to European norms, not only on technical matters such as agricultural standards but also by curbing corruption, to little effect.In newspapers, disheartened Ukrainians read daily about members of Parliament or finance officials lining their pockets with public money.The visa-rule change allowed Mr. Poroshenko to claim credit for one popular achievement of Ukraine\u2019s shift toward the West, in the hopes more substantive measures will follow, said Kadri Liik, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cIt greatly empowers the forces in society that push reforms,\u201d she said.\u201cVisa-free travel is the first thing people received from the Association Agreement,\u201d Mr. Matskevich said. \u201cIt\u2019s a step by our country into the normal world, into normal society.\u201dThe opening went smoothly, with a few exceptions. A woman who had no passport for her 8-year-old son tried to smuggle him over a land border with Poland in a suitcase.

{"Headline": "Aid Coordinator in Yemen Had Secret Job Overseeing U.S. Commando Shipments", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byThe former hostage, Scott Darden, was the Yemen country director for Transoceanic Development, a New Orleans-based logistics company that specializes in transporting cargo to the world\u2019s most dangerous hot spots. It belongs to a small group of firms that provide humanitarian aid to famine-stricken women and children at the same time that they help set up safe houses and supply networks for the military\u2019s secret kill-or-capture commando units.Mr. Darden\u2019s work offers a rare look into the shadowy world of military contractors that operate in lawless war zones like Yemen, Somalia and Libya. But arrangements like the one Transoceanic had with Special Operations forces can cast suspicion over aid workers, potentially putting them in harm\u2019s way, and can jeopardize humanitarian efforts in countries that depend on relief organizations.\u201cThe bottom line is there aren\u2019t a lot of companies willing and able to provide those kind of necessary services in a place like Yemen,\u201d said Gerald M. Feierstein, a former ambassador to Yemen who in 2015 was the State Department\u2019s second-ranking diplomat for Middle East policy, but who said he was not aware of Mr. Darden\u2019s relationship with the military. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have people pounding down the doors for those contracts.\u201dSix former and current United States officials confirmed the military\u2019s secret contract with Transoceanic, describing only its broad contours and only on the condition of anonymity because the details are highly classified. Spokesmen for the Pentagon and the military\u2019s Special Operations and Central Commands, as well as Transoceanic, declined to respond to written questions, citing the matter\u2019s classification. The Pentagon also refused to disclose details of the vetting that contractors undergo before they work with Special Operations forces overseas. Mr. Darden refused to answer questions about his ordeal or relationship with the American military.This secretiveness has prompted some lawmakers to call for greater scrutiny of the military\u2019s clandestine units. \u201cThere is not enough oversight, certainly from Congress,\u201d said Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, who is a former Marine officer and served four tours in Iraq.It is not uncommon for the Pentagon or American spy agencies to rely on Americans such as Mr. Darden, 47, a Florida-born Muslim convert who speaks fluent Arabic, to ferry supplies and money around the world. As the head of Transoceanic\u2019s operations in Yemen, Mr. Darden oversaw several dozen employees and offices in Sana, the capital, as well as in Aden and Hodeidah, two of the country\u2019s most important ports.But why Mr. Darden, a bespectacled, heavyset man before he was detained, risked venturing into to the maelstrom in Yemen was unclear.By late 2014, chaos gripped the country. Houthi rebels allied with army units loyal to a former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, had seized the capital and sent the government into exile. The Houthis have been fighting for control of the country against groups at least nominally loyal to the current president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is backed by Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies.As Yemen hurtled toward civil war, the United States shut down its embassy in February 2015 and evacuated its personnel in Sana because of safety concerns, hampering the American government\u2019s efforts to conduct intelligence and counterterrorism operations in the country.As Yemen became increasingly dangerous for foreigners, Mr. Darden, who split time between Yemen and Dubai, where his wife and young son lived, arranged the next month to fly to Sana. He had begun working for Transoceanic in November 2014, just a few months earlier.Special Operations officials warned Mr. Darden not to go to Yemen, as did Sam Farran, a security expert working for Transoceanic and a former Marine who had worked at the United States Embassy in Yemen. His wife, Diana Loesch, said she did not understand why her husband had to rush back; Mr. Darden said his company needed him there.But days after arriving, a panicked Mr. Darden called Mr. Farran, who had him taken to a safe house tucked away in one of the city\u2019s warrens.\u201cHe was scared,\u201d Mr. Farran recalled in an interview. Unlike many in his field, Mr. Darden had no previous military or law enforcement experience.Hours later, on March 27, Houthi fighters raided the villa and detained Mr. Darden and Mr. Farran on suspicion of being spies. They were among a handful of Americans swept up by the rebels as Yemen unraveled in 2015. One, John Hamen, an Army veteran from Virginia, was tortured and killed.For months, Mr. Darden endured beatings and interrogations.After word leaked on Facebook in September 2015 that Mr. Darden was being held captive in Yemen, a spokesman for Transoceanic issued a statement saying Mr. Darden \u201cwas in Yemen coordinating the warehousing and delivery of humanitarian aid as part of his job in international logistics.\u201d No mention was made of his secret work with the military.Later that month, after the men had been in captivity almost six months, prison guards knocked on Mr. Farran\u2019s cell, asking for his shirt and shoe sizes. The brought him out of his cell and forced him to sit in a hallway, he said, where Mr. Darden joined him. They had been separated and saw each other only once during their imprisonment, Mr. Farran said.\u201cHe looked pretty shabby,\u201d Mr. Farran recalled. The men hugged and started crying.The guards shaved the beards of the two men and brought them clothes. Mr. Farran recalled that guards started videotaping Mr. Darden, but he does not know what Mr. Darden said.They left the prison and headed to the airport in Sana, where they boarded a Boeing 737 sent by the sultan of Oman, who served as a go-between to gain the Americans\u2019 release. On the flight to Oman, Mr. Darden confided to his friend that he regretted what he had told the Houthis. Mr. Farran tried to comfort him by reminding Mr. Darden that he had been coerced. But, Mr. Farran said, Mr. Darden never told him about a relationship with the American military or why he had rushed back to Yemen.Yemen has been one of the most active conflict zones for Special Operations forces in the post-Sept. 11 era. It is where the United States is battling hardened Qaeda fighters and where a member of the Navy\u2019s SEAL Team Six died in January in the first commando raid approved by President Trump.At the time Mr. Darden was captured, about 125 Special Operations advisers had been working closely with Yemeni military and counterterrorism forces. Those advisers and other clandestine operators relied on companies like Transoceanic for much of their logistical support.The company says it delivers \u201cvital cargo worldwide on time and intact for humanitarian relief, defense and peacekeeping missions, and reconstruction projects.\u201d According to Transoceanic, the \u201cworld\u2019s leading N.G.O.s, relief organizations, and governments rely on it.\u201dMr. Darden also handled contracts with Unicef and the International Committee of the Red Cross, according to his LinkedIn profile and people familiar with his work in Yemen.Anna K. Nelson, a spokeswoman for the I.C.R.C., said it was unaware of Mr. Darden\u2019s relationship with the American military. Transoceanic had a six-month contract with the Red Cross that began in June 2014, according to Ms. Nelson.\u201cTransoceanic\u2019s role was strictly related to the processing of standard paperwork,\u201d she said. Transoceanic helped the Red Cross clear customs, serving as a middleman between the relief organization and Yemeni government ministries.Najwa Mekki, a spokeswoman for Unicef, said the organization had contracted with Transoceanic through September 2016 \u201cto provide warehousing services in Yemen,\u201d but was not aware that the company was also helping supply the military.\u201cWe would not enter into contracts that would create risks for Unicef operations or our personnel,\u201d Ms. Mekki said in a statement.Using the cover of humanitarian aid is fraught with serious risks, and the consequences can be deadly. In 2011, the news media revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency had hired a Pakistani doctor to run a vaccination campaign to obtain the DNA of Osama bin Laden. Afterward, health workers in Pakistan were attacked, and the C.I.A. said it would no longer use vaccine programs as cover.Mr. Darden was born in Miami and grew up in Atlanta, later attending Georgia State University. Raised Catholic, Mr. Darden studied Arabic in Saudi Arabia in the late 1980s and early 1990s and eventually converted to Islam, his wife said.He briefly worked at an Apple store in Charlotte, N.C., a decade ago, but starting with a job at Maersk, a transport and logistics company, in Kuwait, he developed deep ties to the world of military logistics and has traveled widely, including to Iraq and Afghanistan, Ms. Loesch said.According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr. Darden worked for Wilhelmsen Ships Service from 2010 to 2012, when he oversaw the return of more than 40,000 American troops leaving Iraq through the ports of Aqaba, Jordan, and Umm Qasr, Iraq.Mr. Darden had a quiet homecoming \u2014 no public welcome, no interviews. After reuniting with his wife and son in Oman, where the F.B.I. interviewed him \u2014 agents familiar with the case will not say what he told the agency \u2014 Mr. Darden spent time in Atlanta with his mother.Ms. Loesch said her husband has talked little about what happened inside the Houthi prison. He never told her about his relationship with the military, she said, and withdrew after his abduction. \u201cHe was not really present,\u201d she said a recent interview.In April, after 15 years of marriage, Ms. Loesch said, she and her husband separated. He lives in Dubai with their son, now 11, works for a company called PAE as a logistics manager and travels extensively, she said.\u201cScott is a man of many secrets,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Cuomo of New York and Chris Christie of New Jersey, who control them.

Last year there were 28 assaults on workers for the entire year.\u201cWe get frustrated, too,\u201d said a subway train operator of 16 years who would only give his first name, Michael, speaking in the break room for transit workers at the Coney Island terminal. \u201cWe want to get off the train more quickly than they do.\u201dThe job is different now, he said. \u201cI used to have some satisfaction in it, but that\u2019s changed,\u201d he said. He takes the subway to work, and he said he was careful that his uniform did not show under his jacket so as not to invite complaints.The conductor who called himself \u201cMother\u201d said people brought their problems from home to the subway station. \u201cThey bum-rush the conductor,\u201d he said. Whenever he is confronted by a crowd of angry passengers, he tells them: \u201cGet one representative, come to me. I\u2019ll tell you, and you tell them.\u201dStation agents face crowds of frustrated riders who turn to them for refunds, called block tickets, when trains are severely delayed or rerouted.\u201cThey curse,\u201d one station agent said during a break at her station in Brownsville, Brooklyn. \u201cBanging on the glass.

You should have been here five minutes ago.\u201d She and several other transit employees said they had come to believe that the system\u2019s management would side with passengers in any complaint against them.\u201c\u2018The customer is always right,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut sometimes they\u2019re not.\u201dMr. Whichard, the union official, shared some recent Facebook messages he had received from members.\u201cBrother it took every fiber of my being and the clerk I worked with for me not to lose my job today,\u201d one read. \u201cA customer spat in my face this morning because he was upset that his card was expired.\u201d The worker continued: \u201cThe clerk held me back and that\u2019s the only reason and God saved me from exploding.\u201dMost assaults are on conductors in their cars with the window open, when they speak to passengers on the platform or as the train pulls away. \u201cWe had a conductor hit by a pear,\u201d said Lt. Renee Thompson, a member of the Police Department\u2019s transit bureau. \u201cWe had an attempted assault where someone tried to punch a conductor and missed.\u201d In a separate incident, another conductor was struck by a water bottle.Sgt. Paul Grattan, who is also with the transit bureau, said, \u201cThey\u2019re completely defenseless.\u201dOn New Jersey Transit, conductors walk the length of crowded trains to collect fares, in close quarters with passengers who have become so conditioned to lateness, as one conductor said, that they refer to a train that\u2019s 15 minutes late as \u201con time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gotten that bad,\u201d he said. \u201cMorale is down, the worst I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d He gets home late, he said, just like his passengers. \u201cI coach lacrosse,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to call my wife \u2014 \u2018Bring my stuff. I\u2019ll meet you at the field.\u2019 You miss dinner. You miss kids\u2019 games.\u201d But he is quick to add: \u201cI get paid for that. You don\u2019t.\u201dAnother conductor, with more than 15 years\u2019 experience on the Morris and Essex line, said: \u201cPeople are at their breaking point. It\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t yell at me. I\u2019m just trying to get you home.\u2019 I can\u2019t blame half of them. I really can\u2019t. I\u2019m getting paid to do what I do. Those people paid to be here.\u201dA subway conductor across the river with 12 years in the system shrugged and expressed a similar sentiment.\u201cThis is the job that we signed up for,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Not to rain on his parade, but linen or cotton would be a far savvier \u2014 not to mention, socially sanctioned \u2014 choice, particularly as summer begins to heat up. Certainly it is the preferred fabric for fashionable castaways in the city who must face the challenge of dressing appropriately for the office or crowded subway commute without dissolving into a puddle of sweat. Lightweight linen and cotton offer maximum breathability while keeping one covered \u2014 and, being natural, have added appeal to eco-minded shoppers. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that so many new and under-the-radar labels have chosen to work almost exclusive with these materials. Here are five that are sure to become your new warm-weather go-tos.On her honeymoon in Portugal, Kee Edwards found herself dreaming of a kind of easy-to-wear dress she could wear to the beach over a swimsuit and out to dinner immediately afterward. When she returned to Brooklyn, she set about creating a line of what she called \u201cgreat feminine clothes that breathe in feel-good fabrics, produced in the most ethically possibly ways.\u201d The company carefully selects its fabrics, working in organic cottons and other natural fibers, many hand-loomed. Ms. Edwards makes a point to support small farms abroad as well as the New York City garment industry. \u201cSummer is the season of freedom, love, and light,\u201d she said by email. \u201cLoup Charmant pieces are made to evoke these same feelings.\u201dNikki Chasin is on a roll. Since starting her namesake label in 2014, the 27-year-old Ms. Chasin has won over the industry as well as celebrities like Miley Cyrus, thanks to her signature unfussy sportswear and resort-worthy styles. This summer she will keep the good times going with a linen capsule collection, which reimagines her feminine dresses and easy-to-wear jumpsuits in the breathable fabric.After years of traveling the globe in the role of managing international sales for Oscar de la Renta and, later, Carolina Herrera, Marina Cortbawi had already honed her fashion sensibility when she decided to start her own label, Merlette. It aims to address a niche Ms. Cortbawi felt was being underserved: seasonless pieces for a women with, she said, \u201ccharacter and a global perspective regardless of her age.\u201d To that end, she chose to work predominantly in fine cotton lawn. \u201cIt feels so good on the skin and can be layered in cooler weather,\u201d she said by email. \u201cIt travels well and can be worn all year.\u201dThough its wares are stocked at fashion retail powerhouses like Anthropologie and Need Supply, the Barcelona label Paloma Wool is about more than just clothing. It was envisioned by Paloma Lanna Santaolalla as a project that explores ideas about getting dressed through photography, art and \u2014 yes \u2014 apparel. That cross-pollination gives a quirky, artsy feel to her simply-cut designs, many of which feature hand-drawn illustrations in collaboration with the artist Tana Latorre. This season the styles come rendered almost entirely in linen.Working out of her home studio in M\u00e9rida Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico, where temperatures often rise above 100 degrees, Gabriella Zamora finds breezy staples to be a necessity. And her Golondrina designs, all of which are produced in M\u00e9rida, supply precisely that. Steeped in her Mexican-Cuban heritage, the designs are cut from Mexican cotton, available undyed or white, in roomy, often adjustable shapes, for a modern Grecian goddess vibe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fringe Groups Revel as Protests Turn Violent", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byKyle Chapman expected he might find a fight. And he did \u2014 with a teenage girl.The girl was waving an anti-fascist placard last week at a protest against Shariah law in Midtown Manhattan when a scuffle broke out and she knocked an older woman to the ground.\u201cAssaulting our people?\u201d Mr. Chapman shouted as he reached across the barricades and ripped her sign apart. \u201cYour days are numbered, Commie!\u201d he called after her as the police escorted her away. \u201cThe American people are rising up against you!\u201dAs the founder of a group of right-wing vigilantes called the Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights, Mr. Chapman, a 6-foot-2, 240-pound commercial diver, is part of a growing movement that experts on political extremism say has injected a new element of violence into street demonstrations across the country.Part fight club, part Western-pride fraternity, the Alt-Knights and similar groups recruit battalions of mainly young white men for one-off confrontations with their ideological enemies \u2014 the black-clad left-wing militants who disrupted President Trump\u2019s inauguration and have protested against the appearances of conservative speakers on college campuses.Law enforcement has taken notice. At the protest last week at the City University of New York, which had been heavily promoted on social media, throngs of police officers lined the sidewalk before it began. In Portland, the police said they were mobilizing a robust presence because of what they have seen online. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a street fight, like a rumble, the way it\u2019s being advertised,\u201d said Sgt. Pete Simpson, a spokesman.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of organized violence on the part of the left against the right, so we have to organize,\u201d Mr. Chapman said. \u201cThe purpose is to have a peaceful event. But if people are attacked, you have to be ready and willing to defend yourself and your right-wing brothers and sisters.\u201dThis form of aggression is something researchers say they have not seen on such a scale before on the far right, where the chosen method of provocation for groups like neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan is to demand the use of public space for rallies where they can spew racist and offensive language that is nonetheless protected as free speech.\u201cThese are new people to us,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, the Intelligence Project director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist movements.Typically, the far-right groups they study will demonstrate but avoid confrontation, acting in a \u201cdefensive crouch,\u201d she added.\u201cBut saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to show up and we\u2019re intending to get in fights,\u2019 that\u2019s a new thing,\u201d Ms. Beirich said.The groups openly post on Facebook and Twitter to spout Islamophobic and anti-immigrant speech, recruit new members and mobilize followers to go to demonstrations where violence might erupt, taking advantage of the porous standards that social media companies set for offensive and violent speech.The internet commerce businesses PayPal and GoFundMe recently blocked Mr. Chapman from accepting money from supporters. He also said he has been barred twice from Facebook, though only temporarily. But his Facebook account, which has about 33,000 followers, remains a source of Islamophobic posts and calls for others to join him at events where clashes are likely.In Berkeley in April, Mr. McInnes and a gang of Proud Boys gathered after Ms. Coulter, the conservative commentator, pulled out of an appearance over security concerns.The use of ironic, juvenile antics is something commonly seen on the fringes of the right because it allows a veneer of deniability, experts said. \u201cIt gives them an out, a gray area where they can make this safe space to say what they want,\u201d said Carla Hill, a researcher for the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism.\u201cIt was a very violent environment,\u201d Mr. Chapman said. \u201cYou\u2019d go down to the boardwalk, you\u2019d drink and get in a fight, and that would be a great Friday or Saturday night.\u201dMr. Chapman voted last year for Mr. Trump and now refers to himself as an \u201cAmerican nationalist.\u201d During the campaign, he watched from the sidelines as scuffles erupted at Mr. Trump\u2019s events, but could not take part because at that point, he was on parole from a federal weapons charge \u2014 one of his three felony arrests.By then he was off parole, and on March 4, he attended a Trump rally in a public park in Berkeley, carrying his closet dowel and clad in ersatz armor: a baseball helmet, a gas mask, ski goggles, shin pads, a wooden shield. When Mr. Chapman clubbed a demonstrator over the head, he earned his nickname and became a hero to the \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell\u201d right after his arrest.That was when he became acquainted with Mr. McInnes, who reached out to tell him that a Proud Boy in Berkeley had created a fund to pay his bail. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Mr. McInnes said. \u201cI wanted to make him president of the Proud Boys, but it makes more sense that he runs the Alt-Knights.\u201dAside from his encounter with the teenage girl, Mr. Chapman remained fight-free last week at the Shariah law protest. He mostly roamed the crowd, snapping selfies with his fans, followed by a flock of acolytes, some of whom, in homage to him, were dressed in pads and helmets, and carried heavy sticks.Later that day, Mr. McInnes gave a party in an unmarked bar on Lexington Avenue. There were Alt-Knights, Proud Boys, bikers in leather vests and young guys with the American flag around their necks. Though the crowd was mostly white men, there were women, a few black people and Latinos. After three or four hours, a rowdy mood set in.\u201cI have a question!\u201d Mr. Chapman shouted at one point, commanding the attention of the room. \u201cWhat do we stand for?\u201d\u201cFreedom!\u201d people yelled.\u201cAnd what do we bleed for?\u201d Mr. Chapman shouted.\u201cFreedom!\u201d they yelled again.He suddenly grabbed the man beside him.\u201cAre you ready to bleed?\u201d Mr. Chapman shouted at the man.\u201cI\u2019m ready to bleed!\u201d he yelled.An earlier version of the headline for this article referred incompletely to the makeup of the Proud Boys, a group of conservative nationalists who have organized vigilante squads at street demonstrations. As the article correctly notes, while most members who are recruited are white, there are also small numbers of nonwhites in the group. It is not a rule that all members be white.Kirk Johnson contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Use Berries in Abundance", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byMy relationship with berries follows the same arc as so many relationships: ignorance, discovery, infatuation, growth, complacency and, then, happy coexistence.Stage 1 \u2014 blissful ignorance \u2014 sees me growing up thinking that raspberries came in a bottle of an overly sweet cordial that you\u2019d dilute with water and drink after school. It was called mitz pettel (\u201craspberry juice\u201d) and had never seen a fresh raspberry in its life.Mine was by no means a fruit-deprived childhood. I grew up in Israel, surrounded by an abundance of the tree-grown sorts: fresh figs, pomegranates, lemons and dates. Apart from a glut of late-winter strawberries, though, fresh forest berries \u2014 the small fruits, like raspberries, blackberries and blueberries, born on bushes and low plants \u2014 were just not around. The hot Middle Eastern climate didn\u2019t allow it.Stages 2 and 3 \u2014 discovery and infatuation \u2014 hit me hard during what I rather grandly called the \u201cEuropean Tour.\u201d The reality was delightfully ungrand: It was 1986 and my best schoolmate and I landed in West Germany, bought two old bikes and proceeded to cycle through the Netherlands and Belgium, to Paris.It took us a month and, along the way, I fell in love with berries. Coming from a land of tree-borne fruit, I couldn\u2019t get enough of the delicious reality of low-lying bushes and plants offering up more fresh berries than I could possibly consume. Our paths were paved with gold, our fingers stained with purple and I was (metaphorically, thank goodness, given my position on the bike) head over heels.Stage 4 was growth and learning, when I was working in my first professional kitchen at Launceston Place in London, under the tutelage of the chef Rowley Leigh. He was showing me how to make a summer pudding, and just as he had inverted the berry-filled and wine-soaked bread onto a platter to serve, he inverted everything I had thought about berries until then. For me, they were to be treated with a degree of reverence and restraint; I\u2019d grown up seeing them placed, individually, on top of the rare g\u00e2teau in a few cafes in Tel Aviv.Here, however, Rowley was doing with berries what Middle Eastern cooks do with herbs: using them in absolute abundance. They were not things you would use to garnish or finish off a dish. They were the very building blocks of the dish itself.Once I fully understood the brilliant power of giving berries the leading role in a dessert, I just rolled along with it. In fact, I possibly went a bit overboard, creating my own berry-filled, berry-topped, berry-dotted, berry-coated, berry-everything set of puddings: white chocolate mousse with crushed frozen berries inspired by Stars restaurant in San Francisco; baked cheesecake with a light biscuit base like the ones I had growing up, now swirled through with a thick blackberry coulis; pies and turnovers stuffed to the brim with stone fruits or apples, alongside blackberries, raspberries or blueberries; and countless ice creams, parfaits, sorbets and semifreddos, all delightfully cold, sharply sweet and berry bright.By the time I mastered berries, I also knew I wanted to become a pastry chef, so I got a job at a London chain of patisseries, Maison Blanc. Alas, rather than learning the fine art of French cake making as I thought I would, I found myself on a production line throwing raspberries onto individual cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re-filled tarts. Within a very short time, my love affair with berries had entered the posthoneymoon phase: complacency. This was not what the catalog had promised at all. Complacency did not feel right, though, so I hopped off that particular conveyor belt and moved forward.The years that followed had a moderating effect. They brought with them a slightly more measured, less intoxicated approach. When I set up my own shop window at Ottolenghi in Notting Hill, raspberry-swirled meringues soon became part of our signature look, alongside many other fruity delights.My relationship with berries has since kept on moving toward that happy stage of balanced coexistence. The berries are still there, of course, used in all sorts of ways in all sorts of dishes: blitzed to make a pur\u00e9e for icing or buttercream; kept whole in a batter, as with the blueberry cake here, or slightly crushed so the juices start to bleed; hiding inside of a roulade, waiting to be revealed; or sitting royally as they do in this pistachio tart.The figs, dates, lemons and pomegranates are just as much there as well, splashing their color through all that I bake, the fruits of my childhood and the fruits of my first trip away from home. It feels as though the arc has come full circle and I\u2019m allowed the best of all worlds.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Uber and Airbnb Became Poster Children for the Disruption Economy", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byNonfictionDuring the week of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in January 2009, three young would-be entrepreneurs \u2014 Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk \u2014 crashed on air mattresses in unfurnished rooms they had rented in a rundown house in Washington. They spent some of their days at a Metro station handing out fliers that urged strangers to offer rooms for rent, and in the evenings they fielded angry email complaints from a woman who had rented space in the basement. Despite the difficulties they faced that week, the huge demand for accommodations from people who had flocked to the inauguration convinced the group that the business they were hoping to create, which they called AirBed & Breakfast, would succeed if they persisted.Also in town for the festivities were two other hustling San Francisco startup jockeys, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp. They had used a website to find more comfortable accommodations, but on Inauguration Day they couldn\u2019t get a cab and had to sprint miles in the wicked cold to get to the mall on time. Camp had been trying to convince Kalanick to join him in a startup that would allow people to summon a car with the push of a button on an iPhone. The cab problems they had in Washington, which were similar to what they experienced in Paris a few months earlier, helped persuade him that the company, then called UberCab, had potential.At certain moments in history, a confluence of technological and social advances creates the opportunity for a new field of innovation. That was happening at the beginning of 2009. A few months earlier, a reluctant Steve Jobs had been persuaded by his colleagues to allow other companies to develop apps for the iPhone. That happened just as Google Maps and GPS and other tools were enabling more wondrous mobile-based services. In addition, cloud services such as Amazon\u2019s allowed startups to store and process large amounts of data without building their own infrastructure. The explosive growth of Facebook had encouraged people to create trusted identities and share things online. And as the 2008 financial crisis receded, the overcaffeinated venture capitalists of Silicon Valley became frenzied in the pursuit of new potential unicorns.The result was the blossoming of a type of economic activity with many kludgy labels \u2014 the \u201csharing\u201d or \u201cgig\u201d or \u201con-demand\u201d economy \u2014 that do not quite capture its disruptive and transformative nature. What companies such as Airbnb and Uber have done in the past decade is take the peer-to-peer sharing of digital content that flourished online, through sites like Napster and YouTube and Facebook, and apply it to our physical world, including cars and rooms and scores of other goods, tasks and services.Three new fast-paced narrative books written by seasoned business journalists (all of whom I have known since my days in the magazine world) detail the personal, financial and social aspects of the rise of these companies. \u201cWild Ride,\u201d by Adam Lashinsky, executive editor of Fortune, is a crisp and lively look at both the good and bad aspects of the rise of Uber and its C.E.O., Kalanick. His Fortune colleague Leigh Gallagher has similarly produced a colorful account of Airbnb and its C.E.O., Brian Chesky, \u201cThe Airbnb Story.\u201d And Brad Stone of Bloomberg News has intertwined the two tales in \u201cThe Upstarts,\u201d a richly researched and highly readable narrative that provides additional layers of insight by weaving in contrasting stories of competing companies that failed.As happens on all of history\u2019s uncharted frontiers, the pioneers of the sharing economy have displayed an energizing mix of idealism and recklessness. Airbnb\u2019s founders came from a background of arts and design, rather than coding and engineering, which offered, contrary to the preaching of STEM education apostles, an advantage in a new economy built on connecting humans to other humans. As a child, Chesky used to visit the Norman Rockwell Museum near his home and spent hours sketching . \u201cOn a family trip to Florence one year,\u201d Gallagher reports, \u201che stood in front of the statue of David for eight hours, meticulously drawing it.\u201d Gebbia studied the violin, played jazz piano and originally planned to be a painter. They met at the Rhode Island School of Design, and they started their company when a big design conference came to San Francisco and there was a shortage of hotel rooms.Both managed sports teams while at R.I.S.D., and their tale illustrates the importance of team formation in innovation. Each brought different skills to their collaboration: Chesky evolved into a manager and chief executive, and Gebbia focused on product design. To complete the team, they brought in Gebbia\u2019s friend Blecharczyk, a computer science geek from Harvard who had started a software company when he was an undergraduate. \u201cNo one of us alone could have done this,\u201d Gebbia said. \u201cTwo of us alone couldn\u2019t have done this. But the combination of what Nate brings, what Brian brings, what I bring, put that together, and I think that\u2019s how we\u2019ve persevered through all the challenges.\u201dThat perseverance \u2014 indeed an insane persistence \u2014 was another component of their success. Having come up with a wacky marketing idea of repackaging breakfast cereal during the 2008 conventions in boxes featuring Obama or John McCain, they lived on the leftover cereal during the subsequent lean year of struggling to keep the company going. They used their scarce resources to fly to New York on weekends to watch how the early adopters were using Airbnb and offering to photograph for free the apartments that were listed on their site.In the case of Uber, both co-founders were already somewhat successful serial entrepreneurs. The idea for an on-demand car service originated with Camp, but Kalanick shaped it. He was a maestro of collaborative brainstorming. Like Steve Jobs, he firmly believed that collaboration happened best when people got together in the flesh, and he turned his San Francisco apartment into a gathering place he called the Jam Pad. \u201cIt was a kind of entrepreneurial safe house, a place where like-minded obsessives could gather in front of a whiteboard and debate the intricacies of building internet companies,\u201d Stone writes.At first neither he nor Camp wanted to run Uber, so they set out to add a manager to their team. Kalanick sent out a tweet, \u201clooking 4 entrepreneurial product mgr.\u201d A 27-year-old midlevel product manager for General Electric in Chicago sent back the most lucrative Twitter reply in history: \u201cemail me :) graves.ryan@gmail.com.\u201d Graves was hired, and the stock he got is now worth more than $1.5 billion.Collaboration, however, can only go so far. It is also necessary to have an intense, driven leader with the visionary brilliance and obstinacy of a Steve Jobs. After finally signing up full-time as C.E.O. in 2010 and edging Ryan Graves down a notch, Kalanick became that.Kalanick focused on beating back regulators, from San Francisco to Paris, who insisted that if Uber cars were going to function like taxis they had to adhere to the rules and licensing requirements that cabbies faced. He fought with a righteousness mixed with self-interest that caused most city officials to think of him as arrogant (or another word that begins with \u201ca\u201d). It was a classic case of technological disruption where there is merit to both sides: It was unfair to medallion taxi owners to allow a competitor that did not have to play by the same rules, and yet for years city officials had become so beholden to and intimidated by the taxi industry that the medallion and licensing system had become a way to protect the interests of the owners rather than of passengers.With his scorched-earth approach to rules, Kalanick not only won battles for Uber but also for a techno-libertarianism that was contemptuous of most government attempts to regulate disruptive innovation. \u201cUber\u2019s lawyers and lobbyists, who had begged him, unsuccessfully, to seek compromise and testify with humility, began to whisper in reverent tones about a new political dictate that contravened all their old assumptions. Travis\u2019s Law,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cIt went something like this: Our product is so superior to the status quo that if we give people the opportunity to see it or try it, in any place in the world where government has to be at least somewhat responsive to the people, they will demand it and defend its right to exist.\u201d He was right.Only once did Kalanick show caution. In 2012, Uber was still using only professional drivers, mainly in town cars. A competitor started a service named Lyft that allowed drivers to use their personal cars, sometimes festooned with a playful pink mustache. Kalanick, uncharacteristically, argued to regulators that this should be illegal. But when he saw Lyft gaining traction, he reversed himself and responded with a ride-sharing service called UberX that quickly became dominant.A good litmus test to determine a person\u2019s basic ideological outlook is to ask about Uber\u2019s use of surge pricing. To some, it is a sensible way to match supply and demand by encouraging more drivers to come out and some consumers to find other transportation during periods of peak demand. Hotels and airlines use variable pricing all the time. To others it smacked of gouging, especially when there were huge spikes in prices during Superstorm Sandy and a hostage crisis in Sydney. Some of the problems could have been avoided with a bit more sensitivity \u2014 Uber would have been wise to kick in its own financial incentives for drivers during a major crisis \u2014 but that was not an instinct that came naturally to Kalanick. \u201cAnyone who whined about surge pricing, in his eyes, was too thick to understand the laws of supply and demand,\u201d Lashinsky writes. The hard-driving testosterone-fueled culture of Uber eventually caused problems. Earlier this month, the board approved top management changes, which included having Kalanick take an indefinite leave of absence, after an independent investigation found a culture of sexism and disrespect pervaded the company.Chesky has been more sensitive to public concerns, but the complex issues raised by Airbnb are as challenging, especially in places where the service is dominated not by easygoing millennials renting out a spare bedroom but instead by developers who buy up multiple houses and apartments to convert into short-term rentals. That can destroy residential neighborhoods and decimate the supply of affordable housing. To his credit, Chesky has tried to deal with these issues as well as the problem of racial discrimination that had infected the service. I watched in admiration earlier this year as Airbnb and my hometown, New Orleans, painstakingly negotiated a complex agreement, with enforcement and taxing mechanisms, specifying the number of days per year each type of place could be rented on Airbnb, with distinctions made by neighborhood and by whether a place was owner-occupied.The benefits that Airbnb and Uber pioneered go beyond convenience. They allow people to make human connections in an era that has become much more institutionalized in the decades since family-run bed-and-breakfasts began being replaced by standardized hotel chains. Stepping into someone\u2019s personal car or apartment forges a bond of trust and, in Gallagher\u2019s words, \u201cyields a little vote of confidence in our fellow humanity.\u201d A disconnected society becomes slightly more connected, not just digitally but also physically.Stone saw this firsthand while covering Chesky on a visit to Paris in November 2015 when the terrorist attack that killed 130 people occurred. \u201cI Ubered home that night to my Airbnb, near the Cath\u00e9drale Notre Dame de Paris,\u201d he writes. \u201cOnce back, I received a frantic phone call from my worried host, Ivan, whom I had never met in person (he was out of town and had left me the keys) but who wanted to make sure I was O.K. The next morning, he emailed: \u2018I was relieved to hear you yesterday on the phone. I hope you are well today despite the critical times in Paris.\u2019 He invited me to stay for as long as necessary until the travel situation in the city returned to normal.\u201dUber and Airbnb, as embodied by their young billionaire leaders, represent, to their supporters, a radical expansion of freedom and a liberating empowerment of individuals to supply services as they please, without government interference. They have provided workers with added flexibility and sources of income, and they have created a new economy based on trust and earned reputations. Consumers rate their drivers and hosts, and they in turn rate us. When it works well it encourages all involved to be a bit nicer and restores the bonds of trust that have been fraying in our society.But as Stone points out, \u201cUber and Airbnb have also come to represent, at least to some, the overweening hubris of the techno-elite. Critics blame them for everything from destroying the basic rules of employment, exacerbating traffic and ruining peaceful neighborhoods to bringing unrestrained capitalism into liberal cities.\u201d On a deeper level, this new economy is disrupting not only old industries but also the entire concept of work. Instead of having \u201ca job,\u201d a growing number of people will, by desire or necessity, support themselves by juggling on-demand gigs. That presents an issue that goes well beyond the need for new regulations; it will require whole new ways to think about pensions, health care, benefits, sick leave, disability and retirement savings.A review on the cover this weekend about four books on the rise of Uber and other transformative start-ups includes outdated information about Travis Kalanick, one of Uber\u2019s founders. After the section had gone to press, Mr. Kalanick resigned as the company\u2019s chief executive; he is no longer merely on an indefinite leave of absence from that position. In addition, an accompanying picture caption also includes the outdated reference.Advertisement"}

Not these writers and performers, who are using the warmer months to take some risks, test themselves and expand their talents onstage.\u201cThat\u2019s because I have a selective memory,\u201d Mr. Hall joked in a recent phone interview. A bit more sincerely, he added: \u201cThose regrets that I do have are, exclusively, not doing plays that I wish I had done. So now I decided to say yes when people ask me to do them.\u201dThe play casts Mr. Hall and Lindsay Crouse as doctors reflecting on a pharmaceutical trial in which its two research volunteers have fallen in love. The production, which runs through July 8, brought Mr. Hall to the seaside city of Gloucester, Mass., to work with his co-stars and the play\u2019s director, Sam Weisman, a frequent collaborator. \u201cWhenever we were on a soundstage together and something would go wrong,\u201d Mr. Hall said, \u201cwe\u2019d look at each other and go, \u2018It won\u2019t be like this when we go back to the theater.\u2019 So we\u2019re testing that premise.\u201dMr. Hall has continued to act on shows like \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\u201d and to direct episodes of Ms. Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s HBO satire, \u201cVeep.\u201d Still, he said that an occasional gig outside the geographical boundaries and critical pressures of the entertainment industry was a crucial change of pace.When he is working on a TV assignment, Mr. Hall said: \u201cYou have to run, an awful lot, on instinct. Even on \u2018Veep,\u2019 it\u2019s not like you get weeks of rehearsal to break out what\u2019s going on in the scenes.\u201dWith \u201cThe Effect,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to sit down and have a discussion about something for more than four minutes, and not look at your watch and go, \u2018Oh my God, I just spent $40,000 of HBO\u2019s money.\u2019\u201dGiven how much theater he did at Northwestern University (where the Practical Theater Company was created as Attack Theater) and in the years after, Mr. Hall said it was bittersweet to have drifted away from the stage and then returned to it. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my DNA,\u201d he said. \u201cTo step back into it, it\u2019s both brand new and nostalgic at the same time. That\u2019s exactly what I hoped it would be.\u201d\u201cWhen I go to see theater, I\u2019m consumed with professional jealousy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think that indicates, on some deeper, psychological level, that I would like to continue to do this.\u201d\u201cI saw the film in the first week of rehearsal and thought: That. I\u2019m gonna do that onstage,\u201d read an email from the actress Lenne Klingaman, who now stars as Hamlet at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival in Boulder. \u201cNo questioning of Wonder Woman\u2019s ability or gender equivalency, just pure human potential.\u201dThat\u2019s not all: Ms. Klingaman isn\u2019t just playing the tormented prince, er, princess in Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy. As part of the festival\u2019s repertory programming this summer, she\u2019s also portraying a female Hamlet in a revival of Tom Stoppard\u2019s \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.\u201d That\u2019s two Hamlets for one woman, a heavy lift for any actor (of any gender).To portray a Hamlet who\u2019s \u201cmy lady,\u201d not \u201cmy lord,\u201d Ms. Klingaman wears gowns that fall on the cusp of the Edwardian-Victorian era. Adding a same-sex curveball, Ophelia remains female.The role has also forced her to internalize the many contradictions of a powerful woman \u201cbehaving badly.\u201d\u201cA woman is very rarely allowed to be hilarious, witty, intellectually crisp and incisive with words, and then in the next scene plotting someone\u2019s murder,\u201d she said. \u201cAsking of a woman the kind of \u2014 I\u2019m still finding words for it \u2014 vulnerability and interiority that\u2019s demanded of those soliloquies, and asking the audience to come on this ride as a woman, is terrifying, but also freeing.\u201dCarolyn Howarth, the show\u2019s director, said in rehearsal that it felt \u201chealing\u201d to see Ms. Klingaman \u201cexpress things that we feel but rarely get to see\u201d as women.\u201cWatching her step into the shoes of this human who expresses rage and grief and revenge and sadness and love and who can be funny and sassy and still likable \u2014 that range may be completely elusive for a female to get to play,\u201d she said.What wasn\u2019t a big deal for Ms. Klingaman was fighting. A black belt at 10, she grew up doing taekwondo and found that the physicality for the sword fight between Hamlet and Laertes returned easily.\u201cAs a woman trained in self-defense and coming back to it after years, it\u2019s a powerful thing to know your force and believe in it,\u201d she said.As if her plate weren\u2019t full enough, Ms. Klingaman is also planning a fall wedding to Mark Christine, an actor and musical director. It seems that challenging gender norms isn\u2019t just her nighttime job.\u201cThe wedding industry is a very froufrou, very feminine world,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cThe ads I get at all times of the day on Facebook \u2014 the internet thinks everything in my life is geared toward marriage.\u201dThe night after Stewart Tucker Lundy\u2019s first rehearsal, he went home and announced to his wife: \u201cWow, I am in way over my head.\u201d He added, \u201cBut in a good way.\u201dMr. Lundy, who has lived with quadriplegia and used a wheelchair since a diving accident in 1982, said, \u201cI had my own preconceptions about this. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that I thought it was going to be kind of a hug fest. No way. It\u2019s work.\u201dRegan Linton, the co-director of \u201cAnnie\u201d (as well as the artistic director and acting executive director of Phamaly), said that casting someone who uses a wheelchair in the role of F.D.R. was important to her.\u201cThis is our only president to serve with a visible physical disability, and he\u2019s a huge figure,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was important to represent him authentically.\u201dA friend of a friend asked Mr. Lundy to read for the part, but it took a little convincing from his wife to give it a shot.\u201cHe has no acting experience, but he has a presence in the community and the world,\u201d Ms. Linton said. \u201cThat was really more important to me than experience, the charisma and overall presence when he rolls into a room. He shows up.\u201dMr. Lundy won\u2019t be the only new face in this \u201cAnnie.\u201d Many of the kids playing orphans are acting in a large-scale production for the first time. And two dogs with disabilities will make their debuts. Daisy, who plays Sandy, Annie\u2019s lovable mutt, is an amputee. Sonny, who plays \u201cthe 2nd dog,\u201d lost his eyes because of glaucoma.But he\u2019s loving it. \u201cI\u2019m like one of those people who found a new religion and wants to preach about it all the time,\u201d Mr. Lundy said. \u201cI\u2019ve got the Phamaly religion. I want to tell everyone about it.\u201dSo in March, when Mr. Moore visited New York from Los Angeles, he went out with Mr. Dinelaris. \u201cHe took me to the Players Club, where he always likes to drink,\u201d Mr. Moore, 35, said from California. \u201cWhich is funny, because there\u2019s a huge sequence that takes place at the Players Club in my last novel, which he doesn\u2019t know. I\u2019d actually never been before.\u201dBut as he explained to Mr. Dinelaris, he found himself in a creative quandary. The projects he had been working on before he was sidelined no longer interested him. He needed, he said, \u201ca different set of inspirations.\u201dThus Mr. Moore\u2019s coming debut as a playwright with \u201cAcolyte,\u201d directed by Mr. Dinelaris and running on the festival\u2019s Series A, July 21 to Sept. 1 at 59E59 Theaters. A brainy 30-minute drama rooted in 20th-century history, it\u2019s about the writer Ayn Rand at midlife, playing philosophical mind games to get the latest thing she wants: a hot young man who is a devotee of hers, as is his wife. Rand\u2019s own husband doesn\u2019t mind the proposed liaison, as long as it makes her happy.\u201cShe\u2019s a controversial figure, and she should be,\u201d said Mr. Moore, who never had a youthful Rand phase, and read her novels only after Anne Conover Heller\u2019s biography \u201cAyn Rand and the World She Made\u201d sparked his fascination. \u201cShe was a very successful screenwriter before then becoming a Broadway playwright before then becoming one of the best-selling novelists of a generation. And this is all in her second language.\u201dPlunging into a third medium himself was both scary and exciting, and it required him to abandon the tricks he knows for camouflaging weak spots in fiction and film, which don\u2019t work in theater. \u201cWriting for the stage, I felt very exposed,\u201d he said.Because the point of the exercise for him was to write \u201cthe most playlike play\u201d possible, Mr. Moore doesn\u2019t foresee adapting \u201cAcolyte\u201d for the screen. But it just might be the start of something bigger, he said: a two-act play, with the second act taking place 10 years later \u2014 \u201cthe same two couples in the same room, as this arrangement is coming to an end.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included a subheading that misspelled the given name of the actress who plays Hamlet at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival. She is Lenne Klingaman, not Laura.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chef\u2019s Mexican Fantasia at Empell\u00f3n in Midtown", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Empell\u00f3n is the flashiest, fanciest and newest of Alex Stupak\u2019s three restaurants, and the one that provides the fullest expression of his dreamscape vision of Mexican food. He doesn\u2019t reproduce or translate the cuisine; he builds a fantasy version of it, coupling deep technical skills with imagination to create a slightly unreal version of reality, the way the best animated movies do.Dessert lends itself to fantasies better than other kinds of cooking, a fact that Mr. Stupak and his pastry chef, Justin Binnie, have exploited to the hilt.One of the desserts is a frozen parfait that looks like half an avocado on a snowy bed of ice. The illusion is almost perfect, with tones of green that fade from the near black of the peel to a grassy pale color in the divot where the pit should go. The mimicry isn\u2019t just visual. The parfait is as creamy and smooth as the flesh of an avocado left on the counter for four days. But of course it\u2019s sweeter and tastes of butterfat, so it\u2019s a relief when the ice crystals melt on your tongue into a bright limeade. Under the ice is yogurt infused with eucalyptus. Although making all this can\u2019t possibly be simple, the flavors are, and they\u2019re wonderfully balanced.Advice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.\u201cStrawberries for the table\u201d is a plate of seven one-bite sweets with different permutations of the fruit. One is a raw, red berry. Its leaves have been replaced by shiso, it\u2019s been stuffed with yuzu jelly, and it\u2019s electrifying. Another is a birch-flavored marshmallow dusted with powdered, dried strawberries. Eating all seven took me about four minutes (including pauses for such penetrating insights as \u201cWow!\u201d) and completely restored my faith in the power of a good pastry chef to amplify and extend the themes that started with vegetables and meat.Maybe it\u2019s the competition from Cosme, which takes a much less formalist approach to high-end Mexican cooking. Maybe Mr. Stupak has more empathy for his customers now. Maybe setting up shop in a big, two-level space in Midtown in March triggered a dormant crowd-pleasing gene. Whatever the cause, the food he is cooking at Empell\u00f3n wants to be liked.There\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019re supposed to knock back the oyster shooter in tomato-and-orange-flavored water with drops of ketchup oil floating on the surface. A distillation of the flavors in a Mexican seafood cocktail, the shooter disappears in one fast gulp.Another seafood cocktail is made from poached lobster and curls and spears of cucumber jutting out of a lovely lobster cream that functions like a party dip. Served in a vase like a flower arrangement \u2014 there are even some purple star-shaped blossoms scattered around \u2014 it\u2019s as striking as anything at Empell\u00f3n Cocina, but the relaxed generosity feels new.There\u2019s a wild salad of yellow beets under a snow pile of green-chile granita and coconut crema. And there\u2019s a tart heap of salmon tartare chopped with gooseberries; it\u2019s dotted with crema and a gooseberry-pasilla chile salsa.One dish puts young red-leaf lettuces spritzed with lime and salted water next to what looks like the icing on a birthday cake: It\u2019s salsa verde creamed with butter, spread smooth and ringed with crema in tiny piped rosettes. If there is anyone who hasn\u2019t yet figured out that butter makes salads better, spreading this salsa verde icing on lettuce leaves should be persuasive.Larger courses don\u2019t have built-in structural barriers to sharing, as some dishes at Empell\u00f3n Cocina did. Roasted sea bream is served whole under pickled onions, thin wheels of tomatillo and miniature salsa-verde-soaked chilaquiles. Short-rib confit pulls apart into rich purplish hunks that you eat with a version of picadillo in which every ingredient tastes more delicious than it\u2019s supposed to.Pork belly slices attached to ribbons of crunchy skin come inside a kind of taco bowl made from a single, plate-size chicharr\u00f3n. You can crack the chicharr\u00f3n and use the shards as chips, or you can fold it into a warm tortilla with watermelon radishes, sliced chiles and some habanero salsa that gives the pork the get-up-and-go it needs.In one section of the menu, Empell\u00f3n\u2019s desire to please does not quite translate into actual pleasure: the tacos. I used to think Mr. Stupak did not know what tacos are. He\u2019s been serving them for so long, though, that now I suspect he just wants them to be something else.He seems to have the idea that because people love tacos, he can fill them with weird things \u2014 curled tendrils of octopus on spicy peanut butter, or dense and dry falafel balls with grasshopper hummus \u2014 as an invitation to the rest of the menu.Yes, anything can be turned into a taco, but perhaps not everything should. The best taco I had at Empell\u00f3n, not counting the corn ice cream, was one I made from the peppers and onions sizzling on an iron plate on which a server had briefly seared a Wagyu steak. This is a great, witty take on fajitas, although the joke would be funnier if it didn\u2019t cost $125.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Said to Face $1.2 Billion Antitrust Fine, but Battle With Europe Looms", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byEuropean Union officials are expected to issue a record fine of at least 1.1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, against Google as soon as Tuesday for breaking the region\u2019s tough competition rules.Yet the hefty penalty and its timing, which were confirmed by two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity, are likely to be quickly overshadowed by a more complex problem: How should Google comply with the decision to rein in its power?That dilemma will now take center stage as the tech giant fights doggedly to protect its crown jewel \u2014 its closely guarded search algorithm \u2014 from the prying eyes of regulators and, possibly, its competitors.Potentially heavy-handed intervention may raise the hackles of Google and other companies in the American tech world, which could claim that, once again, Europe is unfairly targeting companies from the United States. The region\u2019s officials deny such accusations.No matter the final outcome, analysts warn that jockeying for greater regulatory control over Google\u2019s services in Europe will drag on for months, if not years, as the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, tries to turn its expected antitrust decision against Google into a reality.\u201cThe issue they\u2019re facing is, how does the European Commission solve the underlying problem\u201d of Google\u2019s suspected antitrust abuse, said Christian Bergqvist, an associate professor of competition law at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. \u201cIt will be very difficult to structure any remedy.\u201dHow Google responds to these demands will be left to the company, which must provide the region\u2019s authorities with potential technical solutions to counter its perceived antitrust abuse. Officials can ask for more changes if they are not satisfied with Google\u2019s initial proposals.Experts and some of the company\u2019s competitors claim that any changes would most likely require greater oversight of Google\u2019s products, including a potential independent monitor over its search services (and, potentially, its algorithms) in Europe to guarantee that it continues to comply with the antitrust ruling.A spokeswoman for the European Commission declined to comment on the potential announcement.\u201cWe believe strongly that our innovations in online shopping have been good for shoppers, retailers and competition,\u201d Al Verney, a company spokesman, said in a statement.The coming announcement against Google represents a watershed moment for the search giant, which holds more than 90 percent of the market in online search across Europe. Still, the potential fine represents a mere fraction of the company\u2019s $90.3 billion in revenue in 2016.Other American tech companies, including Apple, Facebook and Amazon, also remain under investigation by European officials for a variety of antitrust, tax and privacy reasons. And while the companies deny any wrongdoing, the continued focus, and potential hefty fines, have given European authorities an increasingly large say over how much of the internet is regulated. That position comes despite European tech companies mostly failing to keep pace with their American counterparts.\u201cEurope has been more aggressive in enforcement against monopolies than the U.S.,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIn Europe, we\u2019re more threatened by the dominance of big companies.\u201dAs Google and its foes prepare for battle over how the search giant should comply with Europe\u2019s upcoming antitrust decision, much attention will focus on lessons from a previous failed attempt to settle the online shopping case in 2014.Analysts and Google\u2019s rivals stressed that any new proposal must go further than these previous efforts, which included placing competitors\u2019 ads online alongside Google\u2019s own digital advertising.To ensure the company complies, one remedy may include the regular monitoring of Google\u2019s action by an outside group. The company, however, also has the option of removing some of its specialized search results altogether, or returning them to what they looked like before Europe\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.\u201cAll that the complainants are asking for is that Google restores the level playing field,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a founder of Foundem, a British comparison shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google.For Michael Weber, director of Hot Maps, a German digital mapping company, the conclusion to Europe\u2019s antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s online shopping service cannot come soon enough.\u201cI can\u2019t image life without being a complainant against Google, it\u2019s been going on for such a long time,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who first filed his claim in 2011. \u201cIt has become something like a marriage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter to Live-Stream Women\u2019s Hockey", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byAs a full-time professional working in cybersecurity and technology research, Anya Battaglino is well versed in tracking the latest online trends.So far, the data has been encouraging. For the first streamed game, between the Phoenix Mercury and the Dallas Wings on May 14, 1.1 million unique viewers tuned in on Twitter. According to a W.N.B.A. spokeswoman, subsequent games on Twitter are averaging nearly one million unique viewers a game.So when Battaglino found out last week that the fledgling women\u2019s hockey league was close to reaching a similar agreement for Twitter to broadcast its weekly games, she recognized an opportunity for growth for the league, which begins its third season in October.\u201cI get the press release, jumped out of my seat, slammed my hands on my desk and said no way,\u201d Battaglino said. \u201cI was literally freaking out.\u201dThe league has also held some appeal for major media broadcasters. Before Twitter, ABC News live-streamed the Isobel Cup, the league\u2019s championship game, in March. During the 2015 season, New England Sports Network, which has the same owners as the Boston Red Sox, also streamed games.\u201cWe are thrilled to feature more live professional women\u2019s sports on Twitter by collaborating with the N.W.H.L.,\u201d Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement. \u201cFans around the world will now be able to view live the fast-paced, exciting action on the ice on the same platform where the conversation about hockey is happening.\u201dThe deal includes 16 regular-season games, the 2018 All-Star Game and two exhibition games where league players will compete against the Russian women\u2019s national team. Currently, the league has franchises representing New York, Boston, Connecticut and Buffalo.\u201cIt\u2019s a landmark partnership for the N.W.H.L.,\u201d said Dani Rylan, the league\u2019s commissioner and founder. \u201cWe believe it will lead to other opportunities because of the increased exposure.\u201dOnline streaming is a growing market for professional sports leagues. Last year, the N.F.L. streamed Thursday-night football games on Twitter; this year they will move to Amazon.com. Recently, Facebook has streamed games for the N.B.A. Development League and Major League Soccer.The N.W.H.L.\u2019s deal with Twitter is for one year, although Rylan said she hoped it was the beginning of a long partnership. The W.N.B.A. agreement was for three years, and Twitter paid that league an undisclosed guaranteed sum for the right to stream 20 regular-season games this summer.The women\u2019s hockey league did not release financial details, but it said it would collaborate with Twitter on marketing and promotion of the league and broadcasts, and that the live-streamed games \u201cwill also include advertising packages with TV-style ad spots.\u201d\u201cThis is a big first step that is about visibility and growing the game and the league,\u201d Rylan said, adding that it could be a steppingstone to a network deal. \u201cThe idea that anyone can watch us from anywhere, at a time when we have just four franchises but expect to grow in the coming years, is very exciting for us.\u201dAlthough both leagues will be without top American and Canadian stars who will be training for the Olympics, a wider platform on Twitter could help cultivate popularity for formerly lesser-known players.\u201cIt\u2019s saying to a huge audience, at least experience us,\u201d Battaglino said. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiential sport. You can\u2019t just look at box scores and say, \u20181-0, cool.\u2019 You watch five minutes of our game, and you\u2019re captivated. If what we haven\u2019t done in the past isn\u2019t groundbreaking enough, I think this is shattering the glass ceiling that people have put on women\u2019s hockey.\u201dThe list of games to be available exclusively on NWHL.twitter.com or twitter.com/NWHL, will be announced in September. All other N.W.H.L. games will remain available for streaming on the league\u2019s website.Advertisement"}

Congress in my lifetime.\u201d The bill, he explained in an email, provides a mechanism for poor Americans to move from Medicaid coverage into the private market, a goal he has long championed as a way of equalizing insurance coverage across income groups.States would continue to receive extra funding for Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to more poor adults, but only temporarily. After several years, states wishing to cover that population would be expected to pay a much greater share of the bill, even as they adjust to leaner federal funding for other Medicaid beneficiaries \u2014 disabled children, nursing home residents \u2014 who are more vulnerable.High-income earners would get substantial tax cuts on payroll and investment income. Subsidies for those low-income Americans who buy their own insurance would decline compared with current law. Low-income Americans who currently buy their own insurance would also lose federal help in paying their deductibles and co-payments.The bill does offer insurance subsidies to poor Americans who live in states that don\u2019t offer them Medicaid coverage, a group without good insurance options under Obamacare. But the high-deductible plans that would become the norm might continue to leave care out of their financial reach even if they do buy insurance.The battle over resources played into the public debate. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said the bill was needed to \u201cbring help to the families who have been struggling with Obamacare.\u201d In a Facebook post, President Barack Obama, without mentioning the taxes that made his program possible, condemned the Senate bill as \u201ca massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\u201dIn another expression of Republican principles, the bill would make it much easier for states to set their own rules for insurance regulation, a return to the norm before Obamacare.Under the bill, states would be able to apply for waivers that would let them eliminate consumer protection regulations, like rules that require all health plans to cover a basic package of benefits or that prevent insurance plans from limiting how much care they will cover in a given year.A real-time count of every senator\u2019s position.States could get rid of the online marketplaces that help consumers compare similar health plans, and make a variety of other changes to the health insurance system. The standards for approval are quite permissive. Not every state would choose to eliminate such rules, of course. But several might.\u201cYou can eliminate all those financial protections,\u201d said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan. \u201cThat would be huge.\u201dAmericans with pre-existing conditions would continue to enjoy protection from discrimination: In contrast with the House health bill, insurers would not be allowed to charge higher prices to customers with a history of illness, even in states that wish to loosen insurance regulations.But patients with serious illnesses may still face skimpier, less useful coverage. States may waive benefit requirements and allow insurers to charge customers more. Someone seriously ill who buys a plan that does not cover prescription drugs, for example, may not find it very valuable.There are features that would tend to drive down the sticker price of insurance, a crucial concern of many Republican lawmakers, who have criticized high prices under Obamacare. Plans that cover fewer benefits and come with higher deductibles would cost less than more comprehensive coverage.But because federal subsidies would also decline, only a fraction of people buying their own insurance would enjoy the benefits of lower prices. Many middle-income Americans would be expected to pay a larger share of their income to purchase health insurance that covers a smaller share of their care.The bill also includes substantial funds to help protect insurers from losses caused by unusually expensive patients, a measure designed to lure into the market those insurance carriers that have grown skittish by losses in the early years of Obamacare. But it removes a policy dear to the insurance industry \u2014 if no one else. Without an individual mandate with penalties for Americans who remain uninsured, healthier customers may choose to opt out of the market until they need medical care, increasing costs for those who stay in.The reforms are unlikely to drive down out-of-pocket spending, another perennial complaint of the bill\u2019s authors, and a central critique by President Trump of the current system. He often likes to say that Obamacare plans come with deductibles so high that they are unusable. Subsidies under the bill would help middle-income consumers buy insurance that pays 58 percent of the average patient\u2019s medical costs, down from 70 percent under Obamacare; it would also remove a different type of subsidy designed to lower deductibles further for Americans earning less than around $30,000 a year.Out-of-pocket spending is the top concern of most voters. The insurance they would buy under the bill might seem cheap at first, but it wouldn\u2019t be if they ended up paying more in deductibles.Mr. McConnell was constrained by political considerations and the peculiar rules of the legislative mechanism that he chose to avoid a Democratic filibuster. Despite those limits, he managed to produce a bill that reflects some bedrock conservative values. But the bill also shows some jagged seams. It may not fix many of Obamacare\u2019s problems \u2014 high premiums, high deductibles, declining competition \u2014 that he has railed against in promoting the new bill\u2019s passage.Advertisement"}

He has said he will not testify, but his spokesman said Friday that may change.They were the sort of thing that he might offer a woman to put her in a receptive mood for sex.\u201cThe same,\u201d he said in the testimony from a 2005 lawsuit, \u201cas a person would say have a drink.\u201dBut prosecutors cast Mr. Cosby\u2019s use of the drug, a powerful nervous system depressant, in a darker light, reading out his words from the old deposition to suggest he actually secured them to incapacitate the women he might meet.The prosecutors contend Mr. Cosby used quaaludes, or some similar drug, one night in 2004 to disable Ms. Constand, a former employee of Temple University whom Mr. Cosby is charged with sexually assaulting on a couch at his home near here.Ms. Constand testified in court earlier in the week that the pills Mr. Cosby gave her put her \u201cunderwater,\u201d slipping in and out of consciousness and unable to prevent his sexual advances. She said she couldn\u2019t move her arms or legs or tell him to stop.\u201cI was frozen,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted it to stop.\u201dShe said he had indicated they were herbal pills.Mr. Cosby said in his deposition that the three pills he gave her were Benadryl, though he never told her what they were, and that the sex was consensual. He said he considered Benadryl a sleeping aid, one that he frequently used himselfAs to the quaaludes that he acknowledged having given to other women decades earlier, he said in the deposition that he never gave them to anyone who was unwilling or unsuspecting. His lawyers say that prosecutors are ignoring that quaaludes were once a popular recreational drug known for their capacity to create sexual arousal \u2014 \u201cdisco biscuits,\u201d his lawyers labeled them in court papers years ago \u2014 and not a date rape drug.Mr. Cosby described obtaining seven prescriptions for quaaludes from a Los Angeles doctor he named as Leroy Amar, now dead.\u201cThere were times I wanted to have them just in case,\u201d Mr. Cosby said.And the effect on one woman he gave quaaludes to, Mr. Cosby said, was to become \u201cwhat we called in those days \u2018high.\u2019\u201dThe woman was identified only as Therese in the part of the deposition read in court.But Mr. Cosby has admitted giving quaaludes to a woman called Therese Serignese before having sex with her backstage in Las Vegas in the 1970s. Ms. Serignese is now one of several women suing Mr. Cosby. She sat in court for the testimony Friday.Mr. Cosby gave the deposition testimony, which has become a powerful element of his criminal trial in the Montgomery County Courthouse, during four sessions in late 2005 and early 2006. Then, he was answering questions in a civil lawsuit accusing him of assault, brought by Ms. Constand, after prosecutors declined to bring charges in 2005. Prosecutors last year revisited that decision when they saw in his testimony that Mr. Cosby had acknowledged the use of the drugs.The Montgomery County District Attorney\u2019s office rested its case Friday, and the defense will begin producing its witnesses on Monday.One of the final prosecution witnesses Friday was Dr. Veronique Valliere, an expert on the behavior of sexual assault victims, who testified that they often try to continue as normal or delay coming forward and can easily forget things about the assault.The prosecution introduced Dr. Valliere to try to counter defense arguments that Ms. Constand didn\u2019t come forward to police for nearly a year, and maintained contact with Mr. Cosby for several months after the night in question.\u201cIt\u2019s typical, we carry on,\u201d Dr. Valliere said. \u201cVictims want to forget about it and pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201dHe said Dr. Valliere had posted comments on Facebook that showed she was biased. The prosecution\u2019s final witness, Timothy P. Rohrig, a forensic toxicologist, testified that the symptoms described by Ms. Constand \u2013 sleepiness, dry mouth, poor muscle coordination \u2013 were consistent with Benadryl or quaaludes, which are both drugs that act on the central nervous system. He said the recommended standard dose of Benadryl was a single tablet; Mr. Cosby says he gave Ms. Constand the equivalent of one and a half doses.As they presented their case in the first week of the trial, prosecutors brought witnesses including Ms. Constand and another woman, Kelly Johnson, who said she had been drugged and assaulted by Mr. Cosby.It\u2019s still unclear whether Mr. Cosby himself will testify. His spokesman would not rule it out on Friday. \u201cNothing is ever off the table in a trial of this magnitude,\u201d the spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, told reporters outside the courthouse.\u201cYou have to look at all your options,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a ballgame, things change and players are taken out and sometimes the star player plays and sometimes he doesn\u2019t.\u201dThat is a change from Mr. Cosby\u2019s earlier announcement that he would not testify.Advertisement"}

But the raids also targeted two people accused of left-wing extremist content, as well as one person accused of making threats or harassment based on someone\u2019s sexual orientation.\u201cThe still high incidence of punishable hate posting shows a need for police action,\u201d Holger M\u00fcnch, president of the Federal Criminal Police Office, said in a statement. \u201cOur free society must not allow a climate of fear, threat, criminal violence and violence either on the street or on the internet.\u201dThe raids come as Germans are debating the draft of a new social media law aimed at cracking down on hate speech, a measure that an array of experts said was unconstitutional at a parliamentary hearing on Monday.Under German law, social media users are subject to a range of punishments for posting illegal material, including a prison sentence of up to five years for inciting racial hatred.Under the draft statute, networks must offer a readily available complaint process for posts that may amount to threats, hate speech, defamation, or incitement to commit a crime, among other offenses.Social media outlets would have 24 hours to delete \u201cobviously criminal content\u201d and a week to decide on more ambiguous cases. The law, approved by Germany\u2019s cabinet in April, would be enforced with fines of up to $53 million.According to a recent government study, Facebook deleted just 39 percent of illegal hate speech within 24 hours in January and February, despite signing a code of conduct in 2015 pledging to meet this standard. Twitter deleted just 1 percent.\u201cWe are disappointed by the results,\u201d Klaus Gorny, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement this year regarding the study. \u201cWe have clear rules against hate speech and work hard to keep it off our platform.\u201dBut even as Mr. Maas and his allies advocate parliamentary approval, eight of 10 experts who testified at a parliamentary hearing on Monday said the law would not withstand constitutional scrutiny.Bernd Holznagel, a professor at the University of M\u00fcnster and one of the participating experts, pointed to two constitutional violations related to freedom of speech: the statute gives companies incentives to remove content, and it lacks a procedure for users to appeal removals.\u201cOur constitutional court will not allow such a statute,\u201d Mr. Holznagel said. \u201cI think they would crush it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe statute sets up incentives to take out content if there is any doubt, so there is an incentive to erase speech, and that cannot be upheld.\u201cThe second point is the other side of the coin, because if there is just an incentive to remove, what about the rights of the speaker who posts the content?\u201d he added.Other experts expressed concerns that the law would vest private companies with too much policing responsibility.Christian Mihr, another panelist and managing director of Reporters Without Borders, said the law would unwisely transfer authority from Germany\u2019s justice system to companies like Facebook and Twitter.According to Mr. Mihr, Germany\u2019s current instruments for persecuting hate speech, as demonstrated by Tuesday\u2019s raids, are working. \u201cThe raid shows that we don\u2019t need this law because we have already instruments for persecuting such crimes,\u201d he said.An earlier version of the headline for this article misstated the actions taken by the German authorities. They raided the homes of 36 people; they did not arrest 36 people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thrilling and Joyless? The Polarity of Sweet Riesling", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byWine SchoolWell, this didn\u2019t go quite as I had expected.In my mind, it seemed easy. The beauty of sweet German sp\u00e4tlese rieslings was so apparent to me that perhaps I lost my perspective. I imagined that all I had to do to entice people to fall in love with these wines was to get them to try them.Instead, I learned yet again, and possibly not for the last time, a fundamental truth: In matters of taste, never assume that people will see things as you do.I absorbed a second truth as well: Sweet rieslings, no matter how balanced and gorgeous, will always be polarizing.They were: Carl Loewen Mosel Laurentiuslay, D\u00f6nnhoff Nahe Oberh\u00e4user Br\u00fccke, and Joh. Jos. Pr\u00fcm Mosel Bernkasteler Badstube.These are wonderful wines, with a place in the world. Still, the sweet German style is contentious, especially in Germany, where many people would just as soon forget it and drink dry rieslings.It\u2019s unfortunate that people have to object to one style or the other. Why not embrace both? Each has a role to play, particularly when the wines are as supremely good as these.One of the things that I like best about sweet sp\u00e4tleses is that they force you to question what sweetness even means. Let\u2019s look at the Loewen, the least expensive of these wines at $26 and the least renowned in the company of Pr\u00fcm and D\u00f6nnhoff, two of the most venerated names in riesling.It smelled like peaches, with an underlying hint of wet slate. In a cooler vintage, this mineral aroma might have been more apparent, but in warm 2015 it played a secondary role. The wine tasted like a ripe, sweet peach. But you were not left with a cloying feeling.Instead, the sweetness was curtailed by an acidity that left the mouth feeling dry and refreshed, with a lasting sensation of that underlying stoniness. Was it sweet? Yes. But it seemed dry as well. This is brilliant balance.The Pr\u00fcm, which was more restrained and less exuberant than the Loewen, illustrated this sp\u00e4tlese phenomenon just as well. It was more delicate and even more precise in its focus, with greater tension between the sweet elements and the acidity. The flavors are apricot and lime rather than peach, indicating grapes that were slightly less ripe when picked. The minerality was there, too, both in the sensation of wet rocks and the touch of salinity.Indeed, the D\u00f6nnhoff was more generous and voluminous. Like the Loewen, the wine reminded me of biting into a ripe peach, but not the neat Loewen peach. Rather it was a juicy fruit that bursts over your face and drips down your chin. The wine was pure pleasure.I thought these wines each went wonderfully with crab cakes, and I believe they are versatile with a range of foods. Many readers agreed with me.Some readers liked the wines well enough, but not with food.Personally, I can\u2019t imagine drinking these wines without food, though if you were going to pick one sort of wine to drink on an empty stomach, it could be these because they are so low in alcohol. The sweetness is obtained by halting fermentation before the yeast consumes all the sugar in the grape juice, so sweet sp\u00e4tleses are almost always under 10 percent alcohol. These were just 8 to 8.5 percent.While I was a bit surprised that the response was not universal love for these wines, I\u2019m happy that most of the unenthralled readers at least tried the wines rather than dismissing them out of hand. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, as long as it has been arrived at honestly.I forgot that a core mission for Wine School is to encourage people to try wines, not necessarily to like them. Opening oneself to reconsidering firm opinions is another mission. So revisiting sweet rieslings someday is a possibility.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "WhatsApp, Crowds and Power in India", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMUMBAI, INDIA \u2014 One evening last month, a WhatsApp message urged villagers in the Indian state of Jharkhand to watch out for a group of men wearing black clothes, prowling across villages, kidnapping children. The rumors traveled across a region that is home to India\u2019s impoverished indigenous tribes living on subsistence agriculture and manual labor.The villagers trusted the authenticity of the WhatsApp message, which included morbid photographs of mutilated children, and forwarded it energetically. That belief quickly morphed into panic, suspicion of outsiders and the lethal rage of a crowd seeking violent release.On May 17, Sheikh Haleem, a 28-year-old businessman from Haldipokhar village in East Singhbhum, who ran a workshop that fixed old cars, set out to meet his brother-in-law in Shobhapur, a village about 10 miles away. He traveled in a small Tata Indica car with three of his business associates: 25-year-old Sheikh Sajjad, 26-year-old Sheikh Siraj and 35-year-old Sheikh Naeem.A few miles into the journey, Mr. Haleem and his companions reached Gadu, a small tribal village. Overwhelmed by the child-kidnapper rumors, the villagers had set up a makeshift check post on the road. An S.U.V. ahead of Mr. Haleem\u2019s car sped contemptuously through the check post. Villagers threw bricks at it. Mr. Haleem sped after the vehicle. Villagers sent out WhatsApp messages alleging that child kidnappers had fled toward Shobhapur village in a Tata Indica car.Several hundred villagers had surrounded Mr. Haleem\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s house by the morning. The mob set Mr. Haleem\u2019s car on fire and threatened to burn down the house unless Mr. Haleem and his companions were handed over.The mob grew to about 1,000 people by 6:30 a.m. A small group of policemen tried to pacify them. Mr. Haleem\u2019s brother, who came looking for him, couldn\u2019t find him but saw Mr. Naeem on his knees, covered in blood, begging for mercy with that very Indian gesture of joining your fingers and palms.The policemen watched until the mob was done and carried Mr. Naeem to a nearby hospital, where he died. Police found the broken and burned bodies of Mr. Sajjad and Mr. Siraj in a neighboring village later in the day. Mr. Haleem\u2019s corpse was found the day after.Within hours of Mr. Naeem\u2019s murder, three more men \u2014 the brothers Vikas and Gautam Varma, and their friend Gangesh Gupta \u2014 were killed by another mob agitated by rumors of child kidnappers. Two of them had been trying to buy some land to set up a business. \u201cOne event set off the other event,\u201d R. K. Mallick, a senior police officer, said.The gifts of free usage and anonymity have made WhatsApp the most popular tool to spread both outlandish stories and politically motivated rumors. On an ordinary Indian morning, messages on the app can include the rumor of a popular mango drink being laced with H.I.V.-positive blood, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization\u2019s rating of Narendra Modi as the best prime minister in the world or Julian Assange describing him as an incorruptible leader.WhatsApp forwards are deftly tailored toward target audiences. Last year, the Indian middle class debated for weeks whether new 2000 rupee bills introduced by the Indian government after demonetization featured a chip that could be used to track the bills. There was no chip, but the rumor lived for a while.Nationalist rage, often with sectarian overtones, dominates the world of India\u2019s WhatsApp messages. One of the most popular WhatsApp hoaxes of this year featured the purported beheading of two Indian soldiers by Pakistani soldiers with a chain saw and a knife. India\u2019s national song played in the background.Another popular WhatsApp message blamed the writer Arundhati Roy\u2019s Christian heritage for her critical writings about Indian politics. The proof was believed to lie in Ms. Roy\u2019s shrewd ploy to hide her Christian self by not using her full name: Suzanna Arundhati Roy.During the three years of Mr. Modi\u2019s government, there has been a distinct rise in majoritarian politics and an attendant increase in prejudice and violence against minorities and dissenters. WhatsApp has been turned into the primary messenger of prejudice, delivering relentless virtual fuel to keep the embers of modern hatreds alive.Alia Allana is a writer with Fountain Ink magazine based in Mumbai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chicken-Roasting Method All Good Cooks Know", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteEveryone\u2019s looking for the perfect roast chicken, yet spatchcocking still seems like a secret of those in the know. Suffice it to say, it\u2019s a skill worth learning, and not just because spatchcocking is a fun word to bandy about with authority.Also \u2014 and less amusingly \u2014 known as butterflying, spatchcocking is the method of cutting out the chicken\u2019s backbone, opening the bird up and pressing down on it so its breastbone cracks and flattens. Once it\u2019s spatchcocked, a chicken roasts more quickly and evenly than an intact bird, eliminating that pesky problem of overcooked breasts and undercooked thighs. You can also use a hotter oven, which leads to crisper skin.Some especially keen spatchcockers will also carve out the keel bone in the center of the bird\u2019s sternum to get an even flatter bird. Others don\u2019t bother removing the backbone entirely, preferring instead to cut along just one side to open the bird.I take the easiest path, leaving in both the keel bone and the backbone. (A bonus: Gnawing on the roasted backbone is delicious.) But feel free to remove one or both if it suits you.You can season a spatchcocked chicken any way you\u2019d season a regular roast chicken. Do this at least an hour or so in advance if you can, so the flesh can absorb the salt all the way to the bone. Even better, season it the day before and let it rest overnight, uncovered, in the refrigerator so the skin can dry out and then crisp up even more in the oven.In this recipe, I rub the chicken down with salt, a mix of spices, and a touch of dark brown sugar. The sugar doesn\u2019t add much sweetness, but it does balance out the heat of the chile and dry mustard powder, and also helps brown and caramelize the skin. Make sure your spices are fresh, especially the mustard powder, which goes stale quickly. If it doesn\u2019t burn your tongue when you taste it, buy a new jar.With all those spices smeared onto it, the bird itself has a lot of flavor, and it is so inherently juicy you don\u2019t need a sauce \u2014 secret or otherwise.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kick This Rock: Climate Change and Our Common Reality", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported byThe StoneThe exchange between Johnson and Berkeley is no mere historical curiosity. Our current political climate echoes their debate, and in a way that might seem initially to support Berkeley\u2019s view. Johnson\u2019s point rests on the assumption that we do share certain experiences. But at least when it comes to political matters \u2014 and almost everything seems political now \u2014 it can seem as if we no longer do so. I\u2019m talking, of course, about the depressingly familiar litany of polarization: We now disagree not just over things like whether God exists or if abortion is morally permissible, but over the size of crowds, basic budget math, the safety of vaccines, Russia\u2019s involvement in hacking the Democratic National Committee \u2014 and whether the fact that the climate is changing is something to worry about.The causes of those divisions are complex, but one is surely the increasing personalization of our online lives. Almost everything we encounter on the internet \u2014 from our Facebook newsfeed to the ads you see when reading this article \u2014 is personalized to fit our interests. That\u2019s wonderfully convenient. But it also speeds up polarization by feeding into the basic human susceptibility to confirmation bias. (\u201cI\u2019m right; everybody says so.\u201d) The result is the now familiar feeling that the left and right are really living in distinct realities. It is as if there is no point of reference, no rock to kick because our information bubbles \u2014 our epistemic worlds \u2014 are constructed to fit our political bias.But here\u2019s the thing. The world outside our personal matrices has a way of getting our attention. That\u2019s why we do all agree that sick children denied health care suffer, that opioids are addictive, that adults need jobs to put food on their tables. That\u2019s a lesson we would do well to heed. Reality finds a way. And that, fundamentally, is why, to cite the most telling recent example, leaving the Paris climate change accord is foolish. Even if we continue to bury our heads in the sand or put our fingers in our ears, the planet\u2019s climate has altered. And those changes will eventually burst our bubbles whether we like it or not.Many philosophical truths are so obvious that we sometimes take them for granted; we look right past them, so to speak. That\u2019s Johnson\u2019s point. We need to start reconnecting with the obvious truth that we do live in a common reality. That\u2019s as important politically as it is metaphysically. Democracies don\u2019t work if we don\u2019t acknowledge that we all live in the same world, facing the same problems \u2014 even if we disagree over how to solve them. Without a common reality, we would have nothing with which to engage. Forget that, and we\u2019ll still end up engaging with it, whether we like it or not. Because sometimes, the rock kicks back.Advertisement"}

He was fired on Wednesday after evidence emerged that he had possibly become entangled in the commercial dealings of an Iranian-born aviation titan who was a key source for some of his stories.Karen Miller Pensiero, who oversees newsroom standards, is leading the review.The Associated Press contacted the newspaper on Monday about documents that appeared to connect Mr. Solomon and Mr. Azima. That day, Paul Beckett, The Journal\u2019s Washington bureau chief, was summoned to the company\u2019s New York headquarters, where he met with top editors on Tuesday about The A.P.\u2019s impending story.Early Wednesday, employees in The Journal\u2019s D.C. bureau sensed that Mr. Solomon, 49, was in some trouble. Around 3 p.m. Mr. Beckett sent an email calling for a staff meeting. The meeting was brief. Mr. Beckett told the employees that he wanted them to hear from him that Mr. Solomon had been fired and that The A.P. was going to publish a story that would raise some questions about him.\u201cI clearly made mistakes in my reporting and entered into a world I didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Mr. Solomon said in a statement to The A.P. \u201cI never entered into any business with Farhad Azima, nor did I ever intend to. But I understand why the emails and the conversations I had with Mr. Azima may look like I was involved in some seriously troubling activities.\u201dThe Journal said on Wednesday that Mr. Solomon had \u201cforfeited our trust.\u201d The company declined to comment further Thursday.

As of Thursday night, some staff members said, no memo or explanation of the firing had been sent to the newsroom as a whole.The son of a prominent diplomat, Mr. Solomon, who worked at The Journal for 23 years, commanded respect in Washington because of his foreign-affairs scoops about North Korea, Iran and other Middle East countries.But his closeness with some of his sources made some colleagues uncomfortable. During United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York, Mr. Azima often invited journalists to join him for drinks and dinner. Mr. Azima also appeared in Vienna in 2015 during negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal. In each setting, Mr. Solomon was a fixture at the bar and restaurant table with Mr. Azima, according to other journalists who attended and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the meetings.In Washington, Mr. Solomon sometimes bragged about afternoons spent on Mr. Azima\u2019s yacht and showed pictures around the newsroom of himself and his young son in sun-washed locales with the businessman, according to people who worked in the bureau who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In recent months, cryptic blogs surfaced that promised to reveal fraud between Mr. Azima and Mr. Solomon. There was no indication who was behind the sites, and no evidence emerged until The A.P. made The Journal aware of the documents it had obtained.An earlier version of this article referred incompletely to communications within the Journal newsroom about Jay Solomon\u2019s departure. While no staffwide memo or other communication had been issued by Thursday night, the firing was discussed at the Thursday morning news meeting attended by top editors, bureau chiefs and other staff members.Michael M.

Not to do so is na\u00efve and ridiculously self-blinding in a way that avoids reality.What I abhor is ideological exploitation that reduces these acts to a political sport and uses them as weapons to silence political opponents and their \u201crhetoric,\u201d rather than viewing them as American tragedies that we can work together to prevent through honest appraisal and courageous action. Every shooting in this country is a tragedy, and they happen with disturbing frequency here.This country has a violent culture, is full of guns, and our federal lawmakers \u2014 mostly Republicans, it must be said, because there isn\u2019t any real equivalency \u2014 are loath to even moderately regulate gun access.Pretending that America\u2019s gun violence is a function of collective political rhetoric rather than the nexus of personal mental defect and easy access to weapons is a way of dodging, well, the bullet.So, here I must take a stand in defense of rhetoric. While rhetoric should never promote violence, it needn\u2019t be timid.At the top, the responses were pitch perfect, but the political debate isn\u2019t confined to the top. It trickles down into the cesspool of social media, which has grown exponentially since Giffords was shot. At that time, Facebook had only about a third of its current number of users, Twitter had about a fifth of its current users, Instagram was just three months old, and Snapchat didn\u2019t exist.On social media, where anonymity provides cover for vitriol, violent threats are a regular feature.It is true that political rhetoric can set a tone that greases the skids for a small number of people who are prone to violence to act on those impulses. We have just gone through a political cycle where that was on full display.But some rhetoric is necessary and real. I believe Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress are attempting to do very serious harm to the country and its most vulnerable citizens, and I will never stop saying so in the strongest terms I can summon. For many people, this isn\u2019t an abstract policy debate between partisans. For them, these debates \u2014 about repealing the Affordable Care Act, for example \u2014 are about life and death. But that has nothing to do with the promotion of physical violence; it has everything to do with protecting this country from administrative and legislative violence.We have to object stridently to proposals that will hurt people, and not be chilled by a deranged man with a gun. Violence is abhorrent and self-defeating, but vociferous resistance to national damage has nothing to do with that violence and must continue unabated.You can, as I do, have sympathy for the victims of yesterday\u2019s shooting and condemn the shooter, while at the same time raging, nonviolently of course, against an agenda that places other Americans in very real danger.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba Predicts Strong Sales in a Sign of Strength From China", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byThe Alibaba Group signaled on Thursday that for all the global worries about China\u2019s rising debt and bloated state industries, its economy still enjoys a strong pillar of support: online shoppers.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said Thursday during an investor conference that it expected revenue for its current fiscal year to grow at a much higher rate than analysts had forecast. It cited expectations for growing sales volumes on its online marketplaces and, even more strongly, surging demand by merchants for its digital ad space.China\u2019s digital growth will not last forever, though, and even Alibaba\u2019s numbers show that China\u2019s online world cannot counter the laws of diminishing returns. Still, the ranks of China\u2019s online shoppers grew nearly 13 percent last year to a considerable 467 million, according to official statistics, showing the already vast market is still growing.During a speech at the conference, Alibaba\u2019s chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said that the company expected revenue for the year that will end next March to grow between 45 percent and 49 percent. That is slightly down from the 56 percent growth the company registered in fiscal year 2017, which ended in March. Still, it nonetheless shows the company is expecting to keep growing at a fast pace in the coming year.Although Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, it does not directly sell the goods on its websites. Instead, it provides marketplaces where anyone from small village dwellers to big global brands can set up online shops and sell to Chinese customers. To reach those customers, Alibaba also offers online advertising space.That space is looking increasingly valuable.During her speech, Ms. Wu said the company got about 60 percent of its revenue from its Alimama advertising platform, which works as an auction site on which Alibaba\u2019s many vendors can bid for advertising space on its sites. On that platform the price for ads has been rising as a result of market forces, Ms. Wu said.At times in the past, Alibaba\u2019s merchants, many of which are small businesses that duke it out with other small sellers on the company\u2019s Taobao marketplace, have complained about increases in what the company would charge for promotions. Such criticism even led to several protests at the company\u2019s offices.Still, the pricing of online ad space in China has long lagged behind what it can cost in more developed markets in Europe and the United States. Alibaba\u2019s high revenue growth target shows that gap may be starting to close, which is good news for a company that is in essence an advertising company.\u201cWe\u2019re not holding a gun to merchants\u2019 heads to make revenue grow,\u201d Ms. Wu said.\u201cIt\u2019s all determined by merchants,\u201d she said. \u201cThey bid for every single click.\u201dThe big revenue growth target is important because investors have been concerned about the slowdown in the total value of the merchandise Alibaba sells on its online platforms. That figure, which Alibaba calls gross merchandise value, grew 22 percent in 2017, a figure smaller than what the company had posted in recent years.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump\u2019s son, Donald Jr., echoed the question posed in the Senate that Mr. Comey had tried to answer, and defenders of Mr. Trump suggested he should no more be believed than women who level charges of sexual harassment:Sexual harassment and assault often provoke debates about credibility, fairness and bias.

{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Is a Disappointment? Not in the World of Video Gamers", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Before the end of this year, people will be able to play the popular open-world action game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in virtual reality. They will also be able to get their hands on virtual-reality versions of the first-person shooter game Doom, the post-apocalyptic game Fallout, and independent titles like Sisters, a horror game that explores virtual reality in an episodic format.This flood of video game titles is an important marker for virtual reality. Even as the hype over the technology has outrun its actual adoption, the video gaming industry has continued to pour money and resources into embracing virtual reality, cementing its development and advancement \u2014 at least in the near term.\u201cThe dream of virtual reality was born in our industry when we created the first virtual worlds,\u201d said Michael D. Gallagher, president and chief executive of the Entertainment Software Association, a trade group for video game companies. \u201cIt's only natural our industry\u2019s passionate and creative innovators, who share that dream, would lead the way in the development of virtual reality.\u201d\u201cThese things end up being more complex than you think upfront,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said at the time. \u201cIf anything, we may have to invest even more money to get to the goals we had than we had thought upfront.\u201dAt E3, independent game developers also showcased half a dozen virtual-reality titles, such as Virtual Virtual Reality, an absurdist black comedy from the studio Tender Claws that plays with ideas of tourism, travel and authority; and SnowVR, a dreamlike game made by two Tehran-born artists who were unable to attend E3 because of travel restrictions.The appeal of virtual reality in gaming has long been clear. Pete Hines, vice president of public relations and marketing at Bethesda Softworks, which makes the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, said first-person shooter games and open-world role-playing games were best suited to the virtual-reality experience because they provided players with a great sense of immersion.\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at a screen on which something is displayed; all you see is the screen \u2014 you\u2019re in it,\u201d Mr. Hines said.What has changed now is that many of the early games with virtual reality are shifting to a more experimental phase. Some of the first titles with virtual reality \u201cwere more like showcases for V.R. technology, but we\u2019re moving past that phase,\u201d said Richard Marks, head of Sony\u2019s PlayStation Magic Lab, part of the company\u2019s research and development group.Now developers are trying out new technologies and ways to apply virtual reality, like artificial intelligence, voice recognition and \u201cco-presence,\u201d essentially a multiplayer experience in virtual reality that allows two or more players to play together, he said.One recent example of this is Sony\u2019s multiplayer shooter game Starblood Arena, which combines traditional multiplayer gaming with the immersion of virtual reality. The game lets players match up in an online arena and engage in combat in a range of modes, from a free-for-all death match to team-based play, where players can join forces to defend a particular objective.Virtual reality still faces hurdles in gaming. The industry is still working out how to deal with the nausea that some people feel after they put on an immersive virtual-reality headset, for example.\u201cThere are lots of fundamental issues V.R. hasn\u2019t worked out, such as nausea or how our body actually moves and reacts,\u201d said Mattie Brice, an associate director at IndieCade, an international festival highlighting the work of innovative independent game developers. \u201cV.R. has to figure out what\u2019s unique about it besides being immersive, a consumer product buzzword for every advancement since games went 3-D.\u201dOther game developers said there was not yet enough demand for virtual reality from consumers to allow more video game studios to focus solely on virtual-reality content.\u201cWhat needs to happen is for the early visionaries to stay the course, the investors to continue subsidizing the first wave of content until the economics are in place, and the platforms to continue maturing their hardware to bring in more consumers,\u201d said Ray Davis, chief executive and a founder of Drifter Entertainment, a Seattle start-up that is working on a virtual-reality multiplayer sci-fi shooter game called Gunheart. \u201cAll we need right now is a healthy dose of patience.\u201dStill, the video game industry\u2019s continued effort in pushing virtual reality\u2019s boundaries is leading other industries \u2014 particularly other parts of the entertainment business \u2014 to take notice.Baobab Studios, a California-based virtual-reality animation studio, aims to combine elements of animation and video games to create interactive stories. The studio\u2019s coming project, Rainbow Crow, an animated virtual-reality series based on a Native American folk tale and developed in partnership with John Legend, who also stars in it, allows players to interact with the storybooklike environment.For example, in one scene, players can use virtual-reality controllers to \u201cpaint\u201d the surrounding environment, turning it from fall to winter. Waving one\u2019s arms up and down causes it to snow.\u201cIt took many years for gaming to advance, just like it took decades for film to figure out its language of cuts, pans and zooms,\u201d said Maureen Fan, chief executive and a founder of Baobab Studios. \u201cGames are often about being someone else or escaping to another reality. Therefore, V.R. intersects directly with gaming. We are at the very beginning of creating this industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The First Amendment bars the government from discriminating among speakers based on their viewpoints. In this case, the Trademark Office did that by blocking only registrations for trademarks it determined to have negative connotations. The free-speech clause doesn\u2019t apply to the government\u2019s own speech, but registered trademarks can\u2019t be put in that category \u2014 otherwise the government would have to argue that it endorses each of the more than two million trademarks it has already registered.One of those people was Lester Gerard Packingham, who was prosecuted under the law after he posted a Facebook message in 2010 giving thanks for the dismissal of a parking ticket. Mr. Packingham had been convicted eight years earlier for having sex with a minor. The state did not argue that he had used Facebook or any other site to seek out sex with minors or for any illegal activity at all; the fact that he\u2019d visited a prohibited site as a registered sex offender was enough to convict him.The justices rightly reversed the State Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding that conviction. States have a compelling interest in protecting children from sexual abuse, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his opinion for the majority, but the law went far beyond what was needed to achieve that goal \u2014 barring access to \u201cwhat for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.\u201dThe case comes from Wisconsin, where Republicans won control of the state government in 2010, just in time to draw new maps following the decennial census. They were extremely efficient: In 2012, Republican assembly candidates received less than half the statewide vote and yet won 60 of 99 assembly seats. They took even more seats in 2014, while winning just a bare majority of the vote.The court has agreed that partisan gerrymandering could in theory become so extreme that it violates the Constitution, but it has never settled on who should make that determination or on what standards to use.In the meantime, because the court voted to stay the lower-court decision ordering Wisconsin to redraw its district lines before the 2018 elections, the state\u2019s Republican-friendly maps are likely to remain for at least one more cycle. The stay also raises doubts about whether a majority believes the court should ever resolve partisan gerrymandering claims. If not, voters will remain at the mercy of self-interested politicians, with no help in sight.Advertisement"}

The bodies of 10 people have been found, military officials said.The navy and air force had mobilized ships and planes to search for the aircraft in the area near the base, about 350 miles south of the country\u2019s commercial capital, Yangon, the office of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said in a statement. The plane, a Chinese-made Y-8, was en route from the base to Yangon when it disappeared.The weather in the area was bad, residents said, with pounding rain typical of the monsoon season that is now enveloping Myanmar.The death toll from the crash is likely to be the worst of any air disaster in Myanmar, a country that has a spotty air safety record.Before Wednesday, Myanmar had had 17 air crashes since 1988, most of them involving small passenger craft, according to The Daily Eleven, a privately owned newspaper. Last year, a Beechcraft trainer plane for the air force crashed near the capital, Naypyidaw, killing five people.In the 17 crashes, 105 people were killed, the newspaper reported, citing the Aviation Safety Network.As the navy and air force searched the waters, fishing boats spotted bodies floating about 30 miles offshore, said Kyaw Thet, chairman of the Dawei Fishing Association.The missing plane had logged 809 flying hours, a statement on the military\u2019s Facebook page said. The Y-8 is commonly used for transport, reconnaissance, and search and rescue. It has four propellers and is modeled on a Russian prototype from the late 1950s, according to a description in the Chinese state news media.The Chinese state-run company that sold the aircraft to Myanmar last year, China National Aero-Technology Import and Export, said in a statement on Thursday that it would provide \u201cfull support\u201d in an investigation into the crash.The safety record in China of the Y-8 \u201chas been excellent,\u201d said Gary Li, associate director of APCO Worldwide in Beijing and a former security analyst for the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\u201cAccident rates in the Chinese Y-8 fleets are very, very low,\u201d he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the engine maintenance was like after it arrived in 2016\u201d in Myanmar, Mr. Li said. \u201cThat is the primary reason for the downing of many older aircraft.\u201dGeneral Min Aung Hlaing was quoted as saying that the spending was needed to keep up with other countries in the region.Saw Nang contributed reporting from Yangon, and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eggplant Favorites, Rooted in Sicily", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenIt\u2019s hard to imagine Sicilian cooking without eggplant. You find it in every market, in every restaurant and certainly in every home kitchen. Having recently visited Sicily, I remember each eggplant binge fondly \u2014 and there were many.It is always fascinating to see how cuisines and cultures collide. Sicily has been fought over and ruled by many peoples over the last 2,500 years, starting with the ancient Greeks. Each conquering group introduced ingredients from its home turf, adding layers to an ever-evolving local cuisine: The Greeks planted grapes and olives, the Romans contributed wheat.But it wasn\u2019t until the early Middle Ages, under Byzantine and Muslim rule, that eggplant became part of the everyday Sicilian diet. Eggplant, originally cultivated in South Asia, had long been a staple of Arabic cookery; now it is popular throughout most of the Mediterranean. The Spanish introduced tomatoes and peppers from the New World, two other ingredients that now lie at the heart of Sicilian cooking.Sicilian cuisine today is varied, with beloved regional recipes and all manner of extravagant food for feast days, as well as incredible fish and shellfish from the coastline. But a recurring theme in daily cooking is the use of a few inexpensive, common ingredients: olive oil, eggplant, tomato and pasta, usually with a pinch of peperoncino, crushed hot red pepper. These are down-home, primal flavors, emblematic of so-called cucina povera, in which simple and delicious meals are made on the cheap.Eggplant often stands in for meat. Slices dipped in bread crumbs and pan-fried in olive oil replace lamb chops, or are rolled with cheese to make involtini. Eggplant salads, eggplant pickles, eggplant-heavy pasta dishes, stewed eggplant, stuffed eggplant, grilled eggplant \u2014 you find all these and more in Sicily.Three of the most famous eggplant dishes are pasta alla Norma, eggplant caponata and eggplant parmigiana. For each, there are countless variations, sometimes vastly different one from the other. Here I offer my own take, inspired by my travels.Eggplant caponata is of Arabic origin, presumably, since it is stewed in oil, sweetened with sugar and spiked with vinegar. A kind of savory preserve, it is often made in quantity and stored in jars for use throughout the year. This one has capers and green olives, but other versions contain raisins and pine nuts; I know a cook who includes a pinch of saffron. Some cooks add a lot of tomatoes, but I prefer just a touch of tomato paste. The seasoning is sweet, sour and salty, like a good pickle. Wait to taste it a day or two after it is prepared, so the flavors can fully meld. Serve caponata on little toasts as an appetizer or to accompany a meal \u2014 or as a picnic lunch with a loaf of crusty bread.Eggplant parmigiana is often blanketed in tomato sauce, which makes this tomato-free version, which I learned from a Sicilian cook in a small town outside Palermo, rather unusual. She makes it by layering thinly sliced eggplant with tuma (a fresh curd cheese), caciocavallo, pecorino and Parmesan; I use fresh ricotta and smoked mozzarella for a similar effect. It is a bit like a lasagna without pasta. A dozen anchovy fillets are scattered on top. Those anchovies, melted into the crisp bread-crumb-and-cheese topping, provide a sharp contrast to the sweetness of the eggplant. I like to serve it at room temperature, with a tomato salad alongside.These dishes taste best with spanking-fresh eggplant. Seize the moment at the market.And to Drink ...cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Nurse Pleads Guilty to Killing 8 Patients at Ontario Nursing Homes", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byA former nurse pleaded guilty on Thursday to killing eight patients at Ontario nursing homes in what news reports said was among the worst string of serial killings in Canadian history.The former nurse, Elizabeth Tracey Mae Wettlaufer, 49, admitted to injecting a total of 14 people with insulin for no medical reason from 2007 to 2014. Eight of those injections proved fatal and six other people were seriously injured.The eight patients who died ranged in age from 75 to 96. Seven of them lived at a nursing home in Woodstock, a farming and manufacturing city of 37,000, where Ms. Wettlaufer worked until 2014. The eighth patient died about an hour\u2019s drive away, at a home in London, Ontario, that had briefly employed Ms. Wettlaufer.Some of the victims had dementia, news reports said.\u201cMs. Wettlaufer got that \u2018red surging feeling\u2019 \u2014 and God telling her, \u2018This is the one,\u2019\u201d the prosecutors told the court, according to The A.P.She told the court on Thursday that she was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when performing the injections.\u201cYes, your honor,\u201d she replied.Emails and a phone call to officials with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada on Thursday night were not returned. Efforts to contact a lawyer for Ms. Wettlaufer were also unsuccessful.She is scheduled to be sentenced in late June, CBC News said.Ms. Wettlaufer studied nursing at Conestoga College in Kitchener, Ontario, and religious counseling at London Baptist Bible College. She began working as a nurse in 1995.Ms. Wettlaufer\u2019s posts on social media combined with public records suggest that she encountered adversity thereafter, and may have struggled to find steady employment.Ms. Wettlaufer separated from her husband not long before she began working at the Woodstock nursing home, owned by Caressant Care. The company said she left in 2014, and Ms. Wettlaufer told the police she was fired, according to the CBC News report.In a Facebook post about a year after the police said the final murder took place, Ms. Wettlaufer suggested that she had experienced problems with alcohol.The conditions included a strict curfew, a promise that she continue mental health treatment and abstain from alcohol and a pledge that she stay out of hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities.She was also specifically barred from possessing insulin.\u201cI just had a sense after my marriage broke up that God was going to use me for something,\u201d Ms. Wettlaufer said in a videotaped confession with the police. \u201cAfter a while, I started to really wonder, after some of the murders, if it was God or if it was the Devil fooling me.\u201dMs. Wettlaufer\u2019s mother, Hazel Parker, told CBC News on Thursday that her daughter had bipolar disorder and was receiving medication.Also on Thursday, the Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario called for a \u201cpublic inquiry into the deaths of the residents who died at the hands of Elizabeth Wettlaufer.\u201d\u201cWe need to get to the bottom of what happened, how it happened and what we can learn from an organizational, regulatory and system perspective to ensure nothing like this ever happens again,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNurses across Ontario, Canada and beyond, share the outrage about this gross violation of the most sacred principle of our profession \u2014 the commitment entrusted in us to ensure the well-being of patients and their families.\u201dThe police identified the nursing home victims as James Silcox, 84; Maurice Granat, 84; Gladys Millard, 87; Helen Matheson, 95; Mary Zurawinski, 96; Helen Young, 90; Maureen Pickering, 79; and Arpad Horvath, 75.Ian Austen contributed reporting and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

Across the country, teenagers\u2019 phones lit up with a push notification: Bryce was live.The phone framed Bryce in close-up. His mom sat off-camera across the table; her son had really come to eat with his fans. Tens of thousands of them poured into a virtual chat room that layered over his image. A bright stream of emoji floated up the side of Bryce\u2019s face, the product of hundreds of fingers tapping the \u201clike\u201d button at the same time.In the streaming of Bryce\u2019s life, lunch is a recurring event. He calls it \u201cA Bite With Bryce.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re going on a lunch date,\u201d Bryce told me later. \u201cI go to my favorite places, and then they can become my fans\u2019 favorite places, too, through the phone screen.\u201dOnline influencers occupy the gap between celebrities and friends, and skate between mass cultural performances and moments of perceived accessibility. At wildly popular national meet-and-greet tours like Magcon and Digitour, fans can pay to claim hugs and selfies from their online idols; Live.ly digitizes that experience. It feels a little like a spontaneous fan club meeting. Videos vanish instantly, which creates a vibe of temporal exclusivity: When a favorite user goes live, it\u2019s like being invited to a show that only you and a few dozen to thousand people can see.Plus, fans can have questions and comments answered in real time. (They are often some variation of \u201cHow old are you?\u201d \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d and \u201cWill you go out with me?\u201d) All of that elevates forms of extemporaneous, unstructured play that would feel amateurish on other platforms. You\u2019ll often find groups of girls sitting on the floor, mixing up homemade slime, or boys running their hands through their hair as if they\u2019re staring into the bedroom mirror. One account trails a home\u2019s four cats as they prowl countertops and bat curtains.This has the trappings of an old capitalist trick: Create a problem, sell its solution. Live streaming isn\u2019t a repudiation of the personal brand. It\u2019s an extension of it. And on Live.ly, the stakes of the performance are heightened, because there, unlike most other teenage-centered social networks, you can actually earn money.This is a boon for online influencers like Bryce, who work hard to bring a high volume of traffic to these sites, and deserve compensation. (It\u2019s good for Musical.ly, too, which takes a 20 percent cut, and the phone\u2019s app store, which takes 30 percent.)Bryce told me that virtual gifts bring him between $100 and $1,200 a broadcast, depending on the timing and length of the show. (Brands also ship him merchandise to wear on camera.) In May, the top 10 broadcasters on Live.ly brought in an average of $16,000 each. But the monetization of Live.ly has also quickly turned it into a highly commodified zone, a frenetic virtual marketplace where social media performers angle at cashing in on their elusive celebrity status and fans shell out for the illusion of greater intimacy. Everything follows the money.On Live.ly, users pay real cash for Live.ly coins that can be traded for virtual \u201cgifts\u201d that are delivered to broadcasters midstream in the hopes of extracting some kind of recognition from them. When Bryce appears on Live.ly, fans can conjure his image in a way that feels similar to calling up a friend on FaceTime. But the fans who join the stream to interact with him are relegated to the realm of text and symbol. He\u2019s the star of the raw video; they\u2019re frantically tapping the \u201clike\u201d button and thumbing out comments that zoom past faster than he can possibly read them.That\u2019s where the coins come in. Buy a gift, and your user name will be lifted above the textual scrum, beaming a bright cartoon animation and signal that you\u2019ve paid anywhere from 5 cents to $50 for the chance to catch the broadcaster\u2019s eye. Popular live streamers can conjure expensive gifts on command by promising to recognize the most generous contributors with live shout-outs or with a social media follow.Cash donations are so central to the Live.ly community that the biggest spenders are ranked on the app, turning spending into its own competition. One day this month, the No. 1 contributor shelled out 120,000 Live.ly coins \u2014 the equivalent of around $1,200. At the meager end of the Live.ly economy, penniless teenagers toil to scrape together enough to buy the cheapest gifts. Those who can\u2019t afford to buy coins can watch 30-second ads to earn the equivalent of 1 cent in Live.ly currency \u2014 an exchange that makes the attention economy undergirding the web explicit.When animated gifts are flying, the authentic streamer is leveled into a kind of avatar who can be paid to perform certain actions. And with tens of thousands of people clamoring for recognition, it\u2019s often the simplest and least meaningful requests that end up being honored. (Bryce recently complied with a fan\u2019s request to say \u201ctoy boat\u201d 10 times.)Nowhere is this more obvious than among one particularly category of Live.ly star: kids. Across the app, children are learning to perform back flips on command or dab on cue when a big contribution comes in. One girl\u2019s parents recently live streamed her playing a game on her iPad. Another mom live streamed her child\u2019s preschool graduation.Bryce said that he looked forward to live streaming, and that \u2014 even without a regular school schedule \u2014 the biggest challenge is finding time to fit it into his day. But for Live.ly stars half his age, live streaming isn\u2019t an extracurricular activity or a career path: It\u2019s something that happens to them. There\u2019s something viscerally destabilizing about those videos, which reveal the moments when unsuspecting children at play collide with the demands of capitalist exploitation. Now that\u2019s real.Advertisement"}

The goal is to enlist residents to do their part: \u201cClean up around your yard, trim the trees around your cabin, get those fuels removed,\u201d said Arizona\u2019s state forester, Jeff Whitney.\u201cPrevention is our most important opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can treat the fuels before the fire starts \u2014 in other words, if we can minimize the vegetation that feeds a fire \u2014 we\u2019ll be more successful at extinguishing that fire.\u201dEarlier this year, Mr. Whitney had some good and bad news for Governor Ducey about the current fire season: After a snowy winter, the mountaintop forests were moist and green, likely safe from burning. But not the vegetation that lines the lower elevations.\u201cTinder-dry\u201d is how firefighters on the ground have described the parched land in the area, seared by a lack of rain and increasing heat. From the southern edge of the state to the high desert of Central Arizona, brush and grass were brittle, Mr. Whitney told the governor, and \u201cready to combust.\u201dHis prediction is coming true.Still, the historians say, the changes seem almost meek when compared with the shock and magnitude of the tragedy of four years ago.In public meetings and on social media, incident commanders \u2014 the managers who oversee the work of crews assigned to specific wildfires \u2014 are no longer reluctant to tell residents that no home is worth risking a firefighter\u2019s life.\u201cIt is important for people to understand the limitations we have at protecting values at risk when firefighter safety is on the line,\u201d said Alan Sinclair, an incident commander stationed in the Southwest.Earlier this month, Mr. Sinclair kept crews away from a rugged corner of the Frye fire in southeastern Arizona, even as it threatened the Mount Graham International Observatory, home to several of the world\u2019s largest and most powerful telescopes.On Tuesday, as he met with residents displaced by the Goodwin fire near Prescott, Pete Gordon, fire chief for the Prescott National Forest, invoked the Granite Mountain Hotshots. \u201cPlease understand that while we send firefighters into difficult places, there are places we will not go,\u201d he said.Four years ago, the 19 members of the Hotshots were trapped by flames in a canyon choked with dried brush west of Yarnell, presumably while trying to protect nearby homes.Mr. Gordon and Mr. Sinclair were among a small group of firefighters who brought their bodies out of the canyon. They knew the fallen firefighters well. At Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Mr. Gordon said the experience had caused him to question safety decisions constantly.Mr. Sinclair agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that the job was dangerous,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when you\u2019re closely connected to a tragedy as I was to Yarnell, it really woke me up.\u201dThe issue, he said, is not simply what decisions to make, but whether he is prepared to make them.\u201cAfter Yarnell,\u201d he said, \u201cI had to ensure that I was willing to face the uncertainties of an inherently dangerous job.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019ve had suhoor at an IHOP in every United States city I\u2019ve lived in: New York; Washington; Ann Arbor, Mich.; and in the Bay Area.On Saturday nights, the restaurant would be crowded with club-goers recovering from partying, and us: loud and sober Muslims, trying to make sure we got our orders in before the first light of sunrise, when each day\u2019s Ramadan fast begins. We wouldn\u2019t eat again until sunset.Those of us who ate strictly halal passed on meat, choosing pancakes and omelets, and others went for steak and eggs. Sometimes, if I spotted a friend, I\u2019d join a table of club-goers for a bit, making my way back to share the big stack of chocolate chip pancakes that someone would always order on the suhoor table.There was always a responsible member of the group, diligently ordering rounds of water to keep us hydrated through the day of abstaining from all food and drink. As in every coed gathering of adolescents, someone would excitedly take charge of the seating arrangement with hopes of doing some unsubtle matchmaking.For many Muslim-American teenagers from all backgrounds, those late-night suhoor trips are a rite of passage, often the occasion for their first unsupervised late night out with friends.I don\u2019t know whether that night, on the last weekend of Ramadan, Ms. Hassanen\u2019s parents had let her go out on her own for the first time.And after what happened to her, I don\u2019t know whether the American IHOP Ramadan ritual will ever feel the same.According to the police, Darwin Martinez Torres had a dispute with one of the teenagers whom Ms. Hassanen was walking with on their way back from suhoor at IHOP around 4 a.m. Mr. Torres then followed the group, first in his car and then on foot, striking Ms. Hassanen with a metal baseball bat and taking her with him when he left the scene. An hour later, he was arrested. The young woman\u2019s lifeless body was found in a nearby pond.An hour before Ms. Hassanen was attacked, she was praying at her mosque. If she was anything like me and my friends when we were 17, she was probably praying for good grades, mercy for people she had never met far away in war-torn countries and happiness for the people she knew were sad. Or perhaps she spent the night asking for something that no one close to her even knew she wanted.Her mosque, like mosques in communities around the country, must have been alive this Ramadan with prayers like these, as well as late-night basketball games and groups of kids gathering for early-morning food runs.Later, at IHOP with her friends, I imagine she was having the kind of night that makes up some of my best memories: laughing under fluorescent nights, surrounded by friends and sugary breakfast foods, and buzzing with the universal thrill of being out in a teenage pack in the wee hours of the morning. But her life was cut short on that walk back from the restaurant before the first sun rays broke through the dark sky.When I mused about this in a Facebook post, a friend reminisced in a comment about her own Ramadan IHOP runs over the years in Tampa, New York and Washington, wondering, \u201cWere we always teetering so close to the edge of danger?\u201dIt\u2019s what many of us are thinking. But I don\u2019t want a uniquely Muslim-American tradition to be ruined by fear. As long as young people and pancakes exist, the kind of suhoor that made up Ms. Hassanen\u2019s final memories will be sacred.Advertisement"}

He was the one who carried out the firing of Mr. Trump\u2019s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.He said he was still frustrated by some of his father\u2019s aides: \u201cI think he\u2019s being served well by some people.\u201d Other people, less so, he said.Since assuming management of the Trump Organization with his brother Eric, Mr. Trump has been an infrequent presence in the White House, attending events like the Easter Egg Roll and his father\u2019s birthday. But the Trumps are still able to close ranks from afar.Both father and son use Twitter as a digital flogging machine when they sense that someone has treated them unfairly. The family resemblance was on display this week after CNN \u2014 a perennial news nemesis \u2014 quickly retracted a story about a Trump campaign aide\u2019s business ties to Russia and accepted the resignations of three journalists. The network was also forced to defend the actions of a producer who criticized the network\u2019s news coverage \u2014 the producer had been speaking to someone wearing a hidden camera.The Trumps pounced.In some cases, conservatives have been reaching out directly to the younger Mr. Trump, asking him to jump in and fight. Political violence has been a preoccupation of Mr. Trump\u2019s. The episode in which the comedian Kathy Griffin held up what looked like the president\u2019s severed head was a particular source of outrage.\u201cTwitter allowed me to call her out immediately for her vile, sick, disgusting actions,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt brought attention to a serious issue that would have been glossed over otherwise. Social media, if used properly, is a fantastic tool to redefine the conversation in our terms.\u201dMr. Trump, who divides his time between Manhattan and a property upstate, seems to speak the language of conservatives most naturally. He is an avid hunter whose closest friends are not considered New York elite, but are people who enjoy the outdoors and are gun enthusiasts. This makes him as much his father\u2019s ambassador to Middle America \u2014 and a broader swath of conservatives \u2014 as anyone.\u201cAs of late I\u2019ve probably taken more of a role in it of my own volition,\u201d Mr. Trump said of confronting critics, noting he is not working in concert with the White House. \u201cI\u2019m watching from the outside.\u201dDuring sensitive times, the Republican National Committee has asked Mr. Trump to step in as a pinch-hitter when his father has been advised not to tweet. When James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, testified before the Senate in early June, the younger Mr. Trump coordinated with the national committee to push back against Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony. When Mr. Comey testified that the president had mentioned closing the federal investigation into contact between Russian officials and Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Mr. Trump took to Twitter.Lindsay Jancek, the deputy communications director for the national committee, said in an interview that there was frequent communication between the organization and Mr. Trump. The committee sends him messaging materials, including thoughts for posts, for him to consider sharing to his 1.7 million Twitter followers. That following has grown from about 700,000 since the presidential campaign began in earnest. Ms. Jancek called the work done during the Comey hearing \u201cvery successful in driving a narrative and pushing back.\u201dThe message is working with millennials, according to Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, an activist group for young conservatives. Mr. Kirk, who interacts frequently with Mr. Trump on Twitter, said that members across the group\u2019s 1,100 college and high school campuses were avid followers of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, which tend to showcase his hunting prowess and dedication to his wife and five children.\u201cAs we work to grow the party and attract younger voters,\u201d Mr. Kirk, 23, wrote in an email, \u201chaving strong, confident, funny, and respected voices like Donald Trump Jr. is a tremendous asset.\u201dMr. Trump said that a tweet of support for people who promote conspiracy theories was not \u201can endorsement of everything that that person has ever said or done.\u201dHe said: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that one individual thought, though, is any less right or shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u201dDespite raising his public profile as a pugilistic defender of the president, Mr. Trump said he had no plans to follow his father\u2019s path into politics.\u201cFor the time being,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I\u2019m much more effective doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What a Leader of the Religious Left Admires About the Religious Right", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byThe protests against President Trump\u2019s policies since he took office have included marches of women, immigrants and scientists.There was no march for people of faith. And yet, at every one of those other marches, large contingents of religious people joined in. They carried signs identifying their churches and synagogues, and often citing the scriptures that motivated them to participate.A goal for many on the religious left is to reclaim the nation\u2019s moral agenda from the religious right, which has prioritized ending abortion and gay marriage. The left wants to reframe morality as caring for poor and marginalized people. However, a reader asked Ms. Butler if there was anything she admired about the religious right.She singled out how well organized it had been for decades. The religious right was \u201cnot ashamed to claim their public voice and to speak very clearly to their morals in public life,\u201d said Ms. Butler, who is a minister in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), a Protestant denomination.\u201cThose of us who were more social-justice oriented, we became embarrassed to speak to our faith and values publicly,\u201d she said. That embarrassment grew more acute, she said, as religion became associated with the Christian right and its hyperpartisan approach to politics.We would like to know more about how your religious beliefs have affected your political views and actions \u2014 or vice versa.The religious right has become a reliable voting bloc for the Republican Party, leading critics to say it is far more political than religious. If the religious left builds its ranks and power, some observers say, it may have trouble avoiding becoming an arm of the Democratic Party.Ms. Butler herself was appointed by President Barack Obama to serve as chairwoman of the President\u2019s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, so she is no stranger to politics. But she said: \u201cWe challenge the Democratic Party as much as we challenge the Republican Party. We will always be driven by our values and by our morals and by scriptures. And we see ourselves as reporting to a higher authority.\u201dShe said, \u201cNever will we be beholden to one political party, because that is idolatry.\u201dAn exploration of the largest compilation of American religious leaders ever assembled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: White House Looks to Defang Financial Watchdog", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byThe Trump administration has offered its most detailed plans to date for the unraveling of financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.In a report issued on Monday, the Treasury said that the president should be able to remove the bureau\u2019s director and recommended greater exemptions from the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d which bans banks from trading for their own gain.The report also called for relief from regulatory scrutiny, such as stress tests for community banks.The plan sets up a clash between President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was her brainchild.According to the Treasury report, \u201cThe C.F.P.B. was created to pursue an important mission, but its unaccountable structure and unduly broad regulatory powers have led to predictable regulatory abuses and excesses.\u201d\u201cThe C.F.P.B.\u2019s approach to rule making and enforcement has hindered consumer access to credit, limited innovation and imposed unduly high compliance burdens, particularly on small institutions,\u201d the report added.Critics argue that the plan would put the economy at risk.\u201cWe need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.Chief executives say they\u2019re optimistic about the economy and about the prospect of lower regulation and lower tax.And investors have bid up the stock market.Usually, when corporate leaders are confident, they do deals.But that has not happened since Mr. Trump was elected. In fact, the number of mergers have fallen off a cliff.Bellwether companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google led a two-day sell-off, after a relentless three-year ascent.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dUBS published a research report noting the heavy influence of these stocks on investor portfolios. Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far the stocks had run. Two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple.Hedge funds could be bailing out, too.The question now is whether retail investors will stick with them.The group of Uber executives that formed the inner circle around Travis Kalanick, the chief executive, is fraying.The A-Team, as it was informally known, shared Mr. Kalanick\u2019s aggressive approach and helped him barrel into new markets around the world.\u2022 Emil Michael, Uber\u2019s senior vice president for business and its second in command, left the company.\u2022 Eric Alexander, a top executive in Asia, was fired for mishandling the rape case of an Uber passenger in India.\u2022 Thuan Pham, Uber\u2019s chief technology officer, is under scrutiny for what many see as his shortcomings in listening to employee complaints.Uber staff members who sell even part of their stock back to the company under a repurchase program must give the voting rights associated with all their shares to Mr. Kalanick, according to a copy of the buyback agreement obtained by The New York Times.That voting power is crucial as the ride-hailing service wrestles with its issues and as the board considers whether Mr. Kalanick should take a three-month leave of absence.Even if he took time off, his ability to influence the direction of the company would appear to be secure, thanks to his \u201csuper-voting shares.\u201dAnd employees must follow the \u201cinstructions of Travis Kalanick,\u201d according to the buyback agreement, \u201cwith respect to any and all matters\u201d that are submitted to a shareholder vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Investors Flexed Their Muscles in Uber Fight", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The conventional wisdom in the world of Silicon Valley start-ups has been that the founders call the shots and that the investors are cheerleaders \u2014 and sometimes enablers \u2014 of the entrepreneurs they backed.\u201cThe examples people cite of founders having all of the power are exceptions,\u201d said Lenny Mendonca, a senior partner emeritus at the consulting firm McKinsey. \u201cIf investors are worried about returns, they engage. They take control. And that\u2019s what happened at Uber.\u201dThe balance of power at young tech companies has long been a delicate issue. Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem relies on founders\u2019 and investors\u2019 getting along \u2014 the entrepreneurs come up with the ideas and need the financiers\u2019 money while the financiers need the founders to help them strike it rich. Over time, who holds the upper hand has shifted back and forth.In recent years, the pendulum has swung decidedly in the direction of entrepreneurs. As with most things in the Valley, the reason is money. In 2016, $333.5 billion was directed into the venture capital industry, compared with $213.7 billion in 2006, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association and Pitchbook.That has allowed entrepreneurs to have their choice of investors. And they have been able to demand provisions that benefited them financially and cemented their control.About a decade ago, for example, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, got his early financial backer, the venture capitalist Jim Breyer, to agree to a board structure that gave Mr. Zuckerberg control. Facebook\u2019s success has been used to support the idea that good things happen when founders lead and investors stay quiet.But then few companies ever match Facebook\u2019s success. Some start-up founders, like David Byttow at the defunct app Secret and Andrew Mason of the online deals company Groupon, were allowed to cash millions of dollars out of their companies long before anyone could call their start-ups a success.\u201cBecause companies have been able to raise capital from all of these sources at high valuations, there has been a delay in the growing-up process,\u201d said Jeffrey Bussgang, a general partner at the venture firm Flybridge Capital Partners and a professor at Harvard Business School.Founders have increasingly taken control of the voting rights at their companies as well. The percentage of company financing rounds that gave extra voting rights to founders and early investors nearly doubled from 2014 to 2016 \u2014 to about 39 percent, from 20 percent \u2014 according to data from the law firm Fenwick & West.Mr. Kalanick and a cohort of early employees owned stock with 10 votes for every share, according to Uber\u2019s corporate charter.While such provisions have given the impression that founders are firmly in charge, the reality is different. In an acrimonious situation, it could be difficult for the founder to exercise the control that he or she technically has.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.At Uber, Mr. Kalanick may have had a path to outvoting the investors who asked for his resignation, including Benchmark, First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments.But that would have come with risk: Winning that battle could have meant burning bridges with powerful Silicon Valley investors he might need help from somewhere down the line. Alienating Fidelity risked Uber\u2019s relationship with the powerful mutual fund, whose support would be key should the company trade its shares on public markets.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that founder power peaked in 2015 and we\u2019ve been two years into normalizing,\u201d said Paul Martino, a partner at the venture firm Bullpen Capital. \u201cWe\u2019re not in an investor-friendly environment, but we\u2019ve certainly moved closer to the center.\u201dMr. Martino said there was a big difference between being supportive of founders and ceding absolute control to them. \u201cIf a board can\u2019t hire and fire the C.E.O., why is there a board?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is their only job.\u201dWhile investors can push out founders, they are aware that start-up dynamics still favor entrepreneurs. If venture firms want to court the best ones, they need to have a reputation for playing nice.When venture investors become board members at a very young company, they can think about their funds and founders first, but later on they have fiduciary responsibility to all shareholders, Mr. Bussgang said.\u201cBill Gurley was not speaking as an individual Benchmark partner, but as someone who represented the interests of a broad group,\u201d Mr. Bussgang said. \u201cHe exerted leadership through influence by rallying other investors.\u201dGiving up voting control to Mr. Kalanick caused headaches for the company\u2019s board and investors, but Mr. Martino said the episode was unlikely to deter companies and investors from giving that power to founders. \u201cTravis didn\u2019t try to start a war with the investors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get our teachable moment.\u201dBut entrepreneurs may have. Mr. Bussgang said the executives he worked with had been closely watching the Uber saga. \u201cThey recognize that it\u2019s not helpful to grow up later,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Increasing Voter Turnout for 2018 and Beyond", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byFixesAt the moment, given the rocky start experienced by President Trump, 2018 seems like a promising year for Democrats. Still, to win in the next congressional elections, Democrats will need to increase turnout. Last year, city dwellers, young people, Latinos and Asians all supported Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly. But those groups voted underwhelmingly.Even in presidential elections, when turnout is highest, the electorate does not reflect America. In primaries and local elections, turnout can dip into single digits. This has proved catastrophic for both major parties in our political system, often favoring extreme candidates and ensuring that most incumbents have no real contest.Raising turnout presents two distinct challenges: How does our campaign win the next election? And how does our political system raise voter turnout for the long term?The first challenge is easier. One way for campaigns to get their voters to the polls is to recruit a good candidate who can inspire voters and run a competitive race.Then there\u2019s painstaking fieldwork. All campaigns do it, but Donald P. Green, a professor at Columbia, said that many do it wrong. With Alan S. Gerber, Green wrote \u201cGet Out the Vote,\u201d which collected evidence from randomized controlled trials about what gets candidates\u2019 supporters to the polls. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong consensus that one of the few things that actually does increase turnout is contact, preferably in person,\u201d said Green. \u201cShoe leather really works.\u201d Especially when it\u2019s a neighbor doing the door knocking.Voter anger is another turnout boost; hence the dominance of negative ads (which, of course, increase polarization and dysfunction).Among Democrats this year, serious people are already signing up to run in 2018, even against incumbents formerly considered safe. That\u2019s partly because President Trump\u2019s initiatives have been resisted with an extraordinary wave of post-November activism \u2014 which can also supply door knockers. And voter anger? More like voter apoplexy.But there\u2019s no guarantee that the enthusiasm will last \u2014 or that any increase in turnout will, in the long term. Barack Obama\u2019s first election, in 2008, was a high turnout year. Just six years later, in 2014, turnout was the lowest it had been since 1942, when a lot of American voters were occupied defending democracy in other ways. Even in 2018, pro-turnout factors will be undercut by numerous structural barriers \u2014 long-term obstacles intended to preserve the dominance of rich, white, older people by suppressing the votes of poorer, younger minorities.Nevertheless, in the last few years, many states and cities have begun institutional reforms that make voting easier.Denver is a leader. Coloradans have long been among the nation\u2019s most enthusiastic voters, and last November, Denver set a personal best: 72 percent of those registered voted \u2014 much more than in most major cities. (The percentage was 67 in 2008, and 63 in 2012.)\u201cFor us, this is a customer service issue,\u201d said Amber McReynolds, Denver\u2019s director of elections. \u201cWhatever we can do to better serve our voters, we\u2019re going to do.\u201dDenver mailed a ballot to every registered voter. Voters could fill it out at home and then mail it in or bring it to a drop box. Mailed ballots could be tracked with bar codes.There were other modernizations: People could register and vote on the same day. Those who moved had their voter registration changed automatically when they updated their driver\u2019s license.We hear a lot about voter suppression. It is true that in many states and cities, Republican officials make it harder to vote, placing obstacles aimed especially at minorities. This has rightly drawn attention and condemnation \u2014 and some reversals in court.But the counter-trend is growing. The Illinois legislature, for example, just adopted automatic registration, by unanimous votes in both houses. If the governor signs it, then citizens who have contact with state agencies, including the motor vehicles department, will be automatically registered unless they decline.Republicans approve of automatic registration because researchers believe it is truly nonpartisan. It\u2019s so new that we have only one test case: Oregon this year. The state saw higher turnout among people who were young, poorer and less urban. While young people and poor minorities tend to skew Democratic, rural people and poor whites tend to vote Republican.It\u2019s also the right thing to do. \u201cNot everybody\u2019s trying to suppress votes,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cSome people want the system to work better.\u201dThese are all important. But can it raise turnout? By itself, probably not. In concert with other reforms, maybe.One reason turnout is dismal is that the United States is one of very few democracies that places the burden of registration on the voter. Does it seem normal to have to register to vote? It isn\u2019t. In nearly every other advanced democracy, citizens are automatically registered.And nearly every other democracy holds elections on weekends, or makes Election Day a holiday. (In some countries, people dress up to go vote!) Voting on a workday isn\u2019t usually a burden for old people, or people powerful enough to set their own hours. For wage workers, however, it\u2019s daunting.\u201cIt is very hard to get voters\u2019 attention,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, the director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe squeeze our Election Day into the middle of everything else Americans are doing. We never say, \u2018Stop, think about your country and vote.\u2019 \u201d\u201cChanging election administration, reforms around convenience voting \u2014 the literature is pretty conclusive that none of these have any significant long-term effect.\u201dNot everyone agrees. Some researchers point to election-day registration, for example, as something that works. Fifteen states let voters register when they vote. It makes sense that election-day registration could increase turnout. In some states, registration closes a month or more before Election Day. Are you finally ready to pay attention to the election? Too late!In their 2013 book \u201cWho Votes Now?\u201d Jan E. Leighley and Jonathan Nagler found that in such states, election-day registration would raise turnout by 6.6 percentage points. (Becker, however, thinks the evidence linking election-day registration to better turnout is weak.)Other strategies could focus on helping young people identify as prospective voters and make voting a habit once they\u2019re eligible. Eric Marshall, director of the liberal Funders\u2019 Committee for Civic Participation, argues for expanding registration drives in high schools, to register high schoolers before they reach their 18th birthdays, and before they scatter.Election officials could try to help people feel more competent at understanding the issues and candidates. People don\u2019t enjoy doing things they\u2019re bad at. Becker suggests changing the typical small-type voters\u2019 handout about the candidates, written in government-ese, and experimenting with more appealing messages.Flaxman\u2019s goal is to bring voting information and inspiration into the channels people already use. His organization supplied the data to Google and Facebook to answer \u201cwhere do I vote?\u201d \u2014 a question people asked 123 million times last year. Colleges offer the TurboVote app alongside class registration. And Starbucks featured TurboVote on the side of millions of coffee cups.\u201cEach thing by itself has only a marginal impact,\u201d Flaxman said. \u201cBut all those different 2 to 3 percent increases \u2014 we\u2019re hoping it adds up to 20 percent.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of cups on which Starbucks featured TurboVote. The number is millions, not 35 million, a number that cannot be verified.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Night of Terror, a Year of Racism", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byOn CampusORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 A year ago today, a mass shooting during a Latin-theme dance night at Pulse, a popular gay bar in Orlando, Fla., left 49 people dead, more than 50 injured and the city \u2014 particularly its L.G.B.T. and Latino communities \u2014 shaken.I woke up to about 60 notifications on my phone that morning. Most were from friends and family asking if I was O.K. My mother was crying, worried I had been at the club.I was the editor in chief of the university\u2019s digital newspaper at the time of the shooting. (I graduated last month.) So the rest of the notifications I woke up to were from my staff. I posted a Facebook status confirming my safety, called my mom to reassure her and rushed to divvy up the day\u2019s coverage with my news team.As a gay person of color, I found something truly comforting about this response. Part of me felt accepted, understood and even coddled in the midst of this harrowing event.Another part felt more targeted than ever.When I fly, for example, my Spotify playlist is usually interrupted by a T.S.A. agent letting me know I\u2019ve \u201cbeen selected for additional screening.\u201d At the Dominican barbershop where I get my hair cut, my barber was stunned when he heard me speak Spanish for the first time. \u201cI thought you were one of those people who threw the bombs,\u201d he said.This stereotyping has gotten much worse since the Pulse shooting, because despite the outpouring of support for L.G.B.T. and Latino people, the tragedy became an excuse to vilify Muslims before the 2016 presidential election.The national coverage linking Islam to the massacre was inescapable.It was impossible to block it out even on campus. The administration had pledged its support to the L.G.B.T. community after the Pulse shooting, but did nothing to prevent anti-Muslim rhetoric from circulating.I interviewed this professor for the school paper, and he told me that far from regretting his word choice, he feels emboldened by his critics: The video made his book sales go up and he gets more speaking invitations when Muslim advocacy groups report on his rhetoric.When I asked him to consider whether his words might hurt my Muslim peers on our campus, he replied, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make a difference to me.\u201dMuslim students have raised concerns about this kind of speech to the U.C.F. administration to no avail. The dean of the school of communication did see a problem with his professor\u2019s insensitivity and exclusionary language. But ultimately, the dean told me, he prefers to err on the side of openness, allowing the university to be \u201ca marketplace of ideas.\u201dThis has become a common theme \u2014 and in some ways, an understandable position for administrators. Colleges are taking heat for their supposed liberal bias; it is bad press for them to be seen as \u201csilencing\u201d more conservative viewpoints. But this isn\u2019t really political conservatism. Muslim students see a direct and detrimental correlation between this kind of talk and the increased threats and prejudice they experience.This is not to say that I support censorship. I agree that listening to a variety of ideas can be enriching. But critics of students who seek to limit misleading or hateful speech rarely consider that we have experience with the consequences. Students aren\u2019t trying to block points of view we haven\u2019t heard. We are speaking out to change social narratives that we can see have devastating effects. And precisely because college campuses are bastions of free speech, we feel comfortable enough here to push back.As was clear after the Pulse shooting, messages of solidarity by those in power speak volumes. The school could have issued a statement in support of the Muslim community on campus after the tragedy, and, in this delicate political environment, it could reconsider its commitment to professors who stoke the flames of Islamophobia.The Pulse nightclub shooting was a terrible act of violence against a marginalized group of people. Attacking another marginalized group is not the way to prevent more shootings, or to help survivors heal.Adam Manno graduated from the University of Central Florida this spring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ponzi Scheme Meets Ransomware for a Doubly Malicious Attack", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The first message to pop up on the computer screen let the victims know they had been hacked. The second message gave them a way out.The victim had a choice: Pay the hackers a ransom of one bitcoin, a digital currency worth roughly $2,365, in exchange for regaining access to the computer, or try to infect two new people on behalf of the attackers. If someone the victim knew fell for the bait and became infected, the attackers would consider the ransom paid and cede control of the infected computer.The attack late last year was, according to the cybersecurity researchers who discovered what they now call the Popcorn Time ransomware, the first Ponzi scheme for one of the internet\u2019s oldest types of cyberattacks.Ransomware, a type of malicious software that infects a system and then holds it hostage, demanding a ransom for its release, is one of the most popular and lucrative ways to attack computers.The scheme has become more successful as more of what we do goes online, from business client lists to family photos. With the click of a button, an entire system can be infected. With another click, criminals can wipe information from a computer or expose it to the public. It all depends on what commands a bigger ransom: losing information or exposing it.Security researchers warn that WannaCry, which exploited a wide-ranging vulnerability in Windows systems and then used a clever mechanism to to spread itself across new systems, is just the tip of the iceberg. They are tracking new schemes dreamed up by criminals who have quickly realized that people are willing to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in ransom.\u201cThis is a growing business because it works,\u201d said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, a security firm based in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cAnd the attacks are becoming more creative and effective.\u201dMr. Hypponen, whose team found and first reported on the Popcorn malware, said it was an outlier in the world of ransomware. It was the first attempt to combine a Ponzi, or pyramid scheme, in which one person entraps another, with malware that holds a computer hostage for payment. If it proved successful, he added, a number of criminal networks were likely to copy the model. Researchers are still monitoring the scheme to see if it works.\u201cThese networks all watch each other and learn. When a new model works, it quickly grows as others build on it,\u201d Mr. Hypponen said.Asaf Cidon, a vice president at the security company Barracuda Networks who studies ransomware, said that criminals had become more sophisticated in the last year, especially in how they choose their victims.\u201cAttackers will go after a specific department at a company, for instance human resources, where they know emails and links are more likely to get opened,\u201d Mr. Cidon said. Networks will choose a company to target and then comb LinkedIn to draw a map of people employed by that company, he said.They might then use that map to impersonate various people or leverage their way into the company\u2019s social network, ultimately using whatever means necessary to make sure that the system becomes infected with the ransomware.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen them impersonate people within the company, or impersonate airlines sending ticketing information or vendors and customers of the company sending files,\u201d Mr. Cidon said, adding that all businesses, from mom-and-pop shops to giant Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google, were getting hit by ransomware attacks.\u201cThere is a lot of money at stake here, so criminals are always going to be interested,\u201d said Mr. Hypponen, whose company is still tracking the fallout from last month\u2019s WannaCry virus.Though the speed and effectiveness through which that particular attack spread caused it to make headlines, Mr. Hypponen said it was, in ransomware terms, unsuccessful.He also said it was an innovative idea, as the attackers combined ransomware with malware that acted like an old internet scourge known as a \u201cworm,\u201d essentially spreading itself across systems as it infected them.While the first worm was created in 1988 by a Cornell graduate student named Robert Morris, who appeared to be more motivated by curiosity than malice, computer worms quickly became one of the most popular and destructive forms of cyberattacks.\u201cThis was a good idea, to combine the two processes together,\u201d Mr. Hypponen said. \u201cOther groups are watching this, and we are going to see other versions of this, better versions, soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yet my husband\u2019s brother and wife have asked if they can stay at our house for a weekend visit soon. I also receive invitations from family and friends who should know that now is not a good time to ask me to parties or other events. What are the rules for giving grieving people space (even before the actual demise) without forcing them to repeatedly explain what they are going through?ANONYMOUSWe all suffer losses that knock us out \u2014 whether they are traditionally expected to or not. (We know what we feel, right?) My mother\u2019s dying was such a loss, and it sounds as if yours is, too. I am sorry for you. But hunting for rules and (perhaps) the small satisfaction of finding tone-deaf friends and relatives in breach of them seems like the wrong tack. Some may be reaching out to support you.Let\u2019s create a better game plan. Delegate chores and ignore voluntary activities to maximize time with your mom and take care of yourself when you are not with her. Enlist your husband as your partner. He can cancel his brother\u2019s visit. Now is the definition of \u201can inconvenient time.\u201dYou also enjoy complete dispensation to ignore social calls and party invitations. They are not life-or-death; time with your mother is. Circle back when you have time and feel better. If you are temperamentally unable to leave calls and emails unreturned, ask your husband or a pal to be your amanuensis. You will be shocked at how compassionate people are. We all grieve. And thoughtlessness is often a temporary failing.I am 27 and have been at my job for 18 months. I love it, and I\u2019m close with my co-workers. But I have decided to move with my boyfriend of several years to the West Coast. He was admitted to a good graduate program there. I am happy about the move; there are plenty of opportunities in my industry. But I am struggling with telling my co-workers. Can I tell them before I speak with my boss? (When should I tell him?) It feels like I\u2019m hiding things from my friends.ERICASpeaking (again) of my mother, a secret, she used to say, is just a head start. It will get out, even among friends. And your boss should hear the news of your departure from you. Do not tell your co-workers first. I get that this puts you in an awkward position with them, but life is sometimes awkward.Speak with your boss between two and four weeks before your intended final day at work. You want to give him enough time to replace you, but not so much that you begin to resemble dead wood. Thank him for your great experience and tell him about your relocation plan. If it sounds as if I am asking you to walk on eggshells, I am. I have seen workers \u2014 without legal protection \u2014 be terminated on the day they gave notice. We want a happier landing for you and ideally, a reference for your West Coast gig.I have developed arthritis in my hands to the extent that shaking them is painful \u2014 and really painful when the other person has an iron grip. What is the best way to avoid this? Offering my left hand doesn\u2019t work; my arthritis is just as bad. And when I say I have arthritis, it often doesn\u2019t register. The other person looks puzzled or offended.ROBERTAIn a slightly mortifying third reference to my mother, let me tell you how she handled this problem. (It looked elegant from a distance.) When people extended their hands to shake, she would lightly squeeze both of their upper arms (beneath their shoulders and above their elbows) and say: \u201cShaking hands bothers my arthritis, but it\u2019s lovely to see you.\u201d For sporty types, there is also the fist bump.

My aunt is coming to my town \u2014 not where my mother lives \u2014 and I would like to see her. But I would hate to betray my mother, and she would be heartbroken if she found out. What do I do?HAYLEYYour mother is acting like a petulant child. (Perhaps your aunt is, too.) That is their right. But adults may not ban each other from speaking with other adults. Have a nice lunch with your aunt. Make sure to avoid any discussion of her squabble with your mother. That is not your business. If your mother has a problem with this, refer her to me.

He said that a company that had surveyed the damage to the container ship, to determine whether it was still fit, had ordered it not to leave Tokyo Bay.It was not clear how long the Crystal and its 20 crew members, all from the Philippines, would stay in Japanese waters. The Japanese Coast Guard declined to comment.Investigators were expected to want to interview the Crystal\u2019s crew to ask, among other things, why there was nearly an hour\u2019s delay in reporting the crash. The Crystal reported the collision at 2:25 a.m. on Saturday, but Nippon Yusen determined that it occurred around 1:30 a.m.Junichi Kanegae, a board member of the Japan Captains\u2019 Association, said that while that might seem like a long delay, the crew of the Crystal probably would have reported to the captain and contacted the Fitzgerald before reporting the incident to the Japanese Coast Guard. \u201cIt might be possible that the time had passed while the crew was responding on these matters,\u201d Mr. Kanegae said.The Crystal, which carried 1,080 containers, left the Port of Nagoya, about 160 miles southwest of the capital, at 4:45 p.m. last Friday on its way to the Port of Tokyo. The collision, off the coast of Shimoda, about 80 miles southwest of Tokyo, inflicted serious damage to the destroyer, causing a section in its middle to cave in, above and below the water line, flooding berths, a machinery area and the radio room.The Fitzgerald had recently participated in exercises with two American aircraft carriers and ships from the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. Three Fitzgerald crew members, including its commander, Bryce Benson, were airlifted from the destroyer with injuries on Saturday.While the Navy will be conducting an internal investigation of its crew\u2019s operations, the United States Coast Guard, along with its counterpart in Japan, will be trying to determine the cause of the accident.The Coast Guard, which normally has a small operation of 10 active-duty members at the Yokota air base, has brought in additional investigators from Hawaii and New Orleans.Lt. Scott Carr, a Coast Guard spokesman, said he could not disclose details of the inquiry, but he said that investigators would typically interview crew members and examine electronic data from the ships involved.Lieutenant Carr said that Coast Guard investigators boarded the Fitzgerald and the Crystal on Tuesday to inspect the scene and take photographs in preparation for interviewing both crews.Takahiro Takemoto, professor at Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, said investigators would probably have a range of electronic information to examine.Nautical instruments on large commercial ships track data, and ships usually have a voyage data recorder, or VDR, much like the flight recorders recovered after airplane crashes.VDRs record conversations on the ship\u2019s bridge as well as other sounds, and track data on the ship\u2019s direction and speed so investigators can reconstruct the course of the ship. It was not clear whether the Fitzgerald had such a device on board.Professor Takemoto said investigators would also probably look at radar images and electronic charts that would have tracked the ships\u2019 paths.Ultimately, he said, important information would be gleaned from interviews with the crew members, particularly those who were on night duty.\u201cHow much information we can get from the interviews is the important point to conclude the cause,\u201d he said.Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The group argued in a lawsuit filed last month, and in an earlier complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that Walmart discriminated against pregnant workers.\u201cWalmart should fully comply with the law so that no one is illegally punished for a disability-related absence or for taking care of themselves or a loved one with a serious medical condition,\u201d said Dina Bakst, a founder and president of A Better Balance, the advocacy group that prepared the report.Walmart said that it had not reviewed the report but disputed the group\u2019s conclusions, and said that the company\u2019s attendance policies helped make sure that there were enough employees to help customers while protecting workers from regularly covering others\u2019 duties.\u201cWe understand that associates may have to miss work on occasion, and we have processes in place to assist them,\u201d Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, said. The company reviews each employee\u2019s circumstances individually, he said, \u201cin compliance with company policy and the law.\u201dKatie Orzehowski says her miscarriage last fall almost cost her a job.\u201cI still had a lot of bleeding going on, and that\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Ms. Orzehowski, 26, said.Her account is one of dozens included in the report, which clashes with the company\u2019s recent efforts to project a more worker-friendly image.In November, A Better Balance filed a complaint with the employment commission on behalf of Arleja Stevens, a Walmart employee who said she was fired after missing too many shifts because of complications from her pregnancy.In that filing, the group accused Walmart of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The employment commission is investigating the accusation, Ms. Bakst said.Mr. Hargrove said the company disagreed with Ms. Stevens\u2019s claims.The company has disputed the claims of the two women at the center of the suit.A Better Balance wrote the survey questions used for Thursday\u2019s report. The questions asked employees whether they believed that Walmart had a problem of regularly punishing people for absences relating to an illness or disability, and about how the company treated absences. The group worked with the labor group OUR Walmart, which promoted the survey to workers who listed Walmart as their employer on Facebook, according to Andrea Dehlendorf, a director of OUR Walmart.\u201cAlthough this system is supposed to be \u2018neutral\u2019 and punish all absences equally, along the lines of a \u2018three-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out\u2019 policy, in reality, such a system is brutally unfair,\u201d the report says of Walmart\u2019s absence-control policy. \u201cIt punishes workers for things they cannot control and disproportionately harms the most vulnerable workers.\u201dWalmart assigns disciplinary points for unexcused absences and other infractions. Nine points in a six-month period can result in an employee\u2019s being fired, according to a copy of the company\u2019s absence policy reviewed by The New York Times. New employees may be fired for accruing four points in their first six months.An advocacy group claims to document widespread violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act.While Walmart has written guidelines for how managers and supervisors should respond to employees who need help because of medical issues, those policies are not always followed, according to the report.\u201cThey just straight up tell you, \u2018We don\u2019t accept excuses,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Orzehowski, who still works for the company.In a follow-up email, Mr. Hargrove said that the company did \u201cnot have any information that would support that Ms. Orzehowski advised us of a medical reason for her absences.\u201d\u201cIf that were the case, she could have used those medical records to apply for a leave or accommodation,\u201d he said.The Americans with Disabilities Act requires businesses with 15 or more employees to make reasonable accommodations for disabled workers. In 2008, the definition of a disabled worker was expanded, to include temporary medical conditions like complications relating to a pregnancy.The Family and Medical Leave Act protects eligible workers \u2014 those who have been employed for 12 months at a company with 50 or more employees \u2014 who need to take time off to care for themselves or a family member.Under the A.D.A., employers must work with employees to determine if workers are eligible for such accommodations. Dismissing doctors\u2019 notes or otherwise refusing to consider the reason for a worker\u2019s absence could potentially be \u201cskirting the analysis\u201d in which employers are required to engage, according to Michelle Caiola, the director of litigation for Disability Rights Advocates, a nonprofit group, and a former senior trial lawyer for the E.E.O.C., which enforces federal worker protections.\u201cA company as big as Walmart, it\u2019s surprising that they don\u2019t have the appropriate training for the personnel that would be overseeing these sorts of leaves,\u201d Ms. Caiola said.Mr. Hargrove said that the company had worked with \u201ccountless\u201d employees to successfully authorize their absences from work.Advertisement"}

I sent the music on Friday.Did you know what it was for?All I knew at that point is that it was a spoken-word thing that Bob was doing. I had a hunch it might have something to do with the Nobel. When I sent it to the business manager, I said, \u201cCan you fill me in on what I\u2019m doing here?\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, this is for Bob\u2019s speech for the Nobel.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh God, what an honor!\u201d I just thought it was a really cool gig.Did you have access to the speech while you were working?I did not.How much music did you record?They wanted 30 minutes. I decided that rather than give them one 30-minute block, it would probably be more beneficial to do smaller chunks. So I did five- to six-minute pieces. I sent them half a dozen of those.I was treating it almost as a movie score. There has to be interest in the musical content, but it could not compete with Bob\u2019s speech, his words. And I also thought about the sound of his voice, and where on the piano I should be playing so it wouldn\u2019t be competing with him sonically.It\u2019s like accompanying a singer, except on this he\u2019s speaking. Same deal. You were in Mr. Dylan\u2019s band in 1978. Is this the first time you\u2019ve worked with him since then?Yes. I think there were a couple of really roundabout things that may have happened between now and then, but that\u2019s pretty foggy. I was a good friend of Steve Douglas, who was the saxophone player in Bob\u2019s band back then. We did some things, but I never recorded anything else for Bob that was ever released.What was it like to get the call after almost 40 years?It was as unpredictable as me getting a call to audition for him in the first place. My first gig out of college was playing with Tony Williams, Miles Davis\u2019s drummer. While we were rehearsing at S.I.R. Studios in New York, I met a guy in the hallway named Rob Stoner, who was Bob\u2019s bass player. We started talking and became buds. Later Rob called, and said: \u201cI\u2019m starting to put together a band for an upcoming tour. Why don\u2019t you come over and play for a little while, and I\u2019ll give Bob a tape.\u201d That\u2019s how it all started. Do you think this could lead to more work with Mr. Dylan?I have no idea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Makings of a Delicious Eton Mess", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenThe popular English dessert (a.k.a. \u201cpudding\u201d in British-speak) Eton Mess, attributed to a yearly celebration at Eton College, is a delectable combination of strawberries, smashed meringues and softly whipped cream. As desserts go, it\u2019s not daunting to make \u2014 just a matter of marinating strawberries with lemon juice, sugar and an optional slosh of liquor. \u201cMess\u201d in this context means \u201cmixture\u201d rather than \u201cmessy.\u201d Even so, you would not exactly call it elegant, though it has universal appeal.If you use store-bought meringues, it is ultra-easy. Most bakeries sell meringues, sometimes giant ones, or smaller versions called meringue shells. If neither is available, you could substitute a package of meringue cookies.You may, however, enjoy the sticky process of making meringues. Just three or four egg whites, whipped for 10 minutes or so with sugar until stiff and glossy, are enough. Electric beaters make the job painless, or use a wire whisk and give your arm a workout.It is a bit of a project, but mostly a waiting game. Meringues must be baked for at least two hours in a very low oven. If time permits, letting them dry overnight in a turned-off oven gives the best, crispiest results (though some prefer their meringues with a somewhat gooey center). If they are not to be used right away, the meringues should be stored in an airtight container. Do not try to make meringues in damp or humid weather because they will not set, remaining weepy and soft, which is not at all what you want.Cooks have long taken liberties with the original Eton Mess, adding other kinds of summer berries or stone fruit as they come into season. Indeed, blackberries, blueberries, nectarines and raspberries, alone or combined, make for a fine mess.With local rhubarb and strawberries in plentiful supply at the market, my mess contains those. I stew the rhubarb quickly with sugar until it is just cooked and syrupy, and then toss the cooled compote with the strawberries. The rhubarb juices supply plenty of sweetness. The cream is barely sugared, since the meringues are sweet, too. For the most luscious experience, be sure to keep the cream very softly whipped. Toss everything together and spoon into individual bowls or pile the mess onto a platter.If you prefer a more refined version, spread meringues with whipped cream, spoon the fruit on top and call it Pavlova, the dessert named for the early-20th-century ballerina.cookingAdvertisement"}

The additional details about the planning that went into the attack emerged on Thursday as a hazy portrait formed of Mr. Ftouhi, a 50-year-old married father of three who had worked as a truck driver in Canada.Court officials said he had no history of drug or alcohol abuse or mental health issues.

Most of the protesters were in their 20s, first- or second-generation French, their parents or grandparents having arrived from Morocco or Mali or Algeria in the 1960s and \u201970s. Among them was Mehdi Bouteghm\u00e8s, a 28-year-old city counselor in the neighboring suburb La Courneuve. When news of the incident first spread on social media, where the campaign for the presidential election was also heating up, Bouteghm\u00e8s took to Facebook. \u201cIn my vision of the Republic, the election campaign should come to a halt,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAll the candidates should focus on and make a priority of resolving the problem of the role of the police in this country.\u201d Then he posted the opening lines of \u201cWhat Is the Third Estate?\u201d a tract published by the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s in January 1789, that took up the cause of the common classes: \u201cWe have three questions before us. One \u2014 What is the Third Estate? EVERYTHING. Two \u2014 What has it been until now in the political order? NOTHING. Three \u2014 What is it asking for? TO BE SOMETHING.\u201dThe election campaign did not stop; instead Bouteghm\u00e8s found himself here, surrounded by the citizens he represented. A handful of gendarmes loitered on a steel walkway that ran above the complex, peering down at the crowd. A dozen young men hoisted themselves onto a parapet, fists raised. \u201cWe\u2019re finished with this savagery,\u201d one shouted into a microphone. \u201cWith this violence that\u2019s been going on for 30 years. Today you can kill an African, rape an African. Some of you experience daily humiliations. It\u2019s a myth, the country of the rights of man. Do you feel like the country respects you?\u201d The crowd yelled back: \u201cNo!\u201dThe protesters began to sing \u201cThe Marseillaise.\u201d Someone set off a mortar that burst red into the sky with a pop like gunfire, close enough to shed ash on the crowd. A humming sound floated up from behind. Everyone turned to watch a group of kids rush up the steps of the walkway toward the gendarmes, hurling stones at their riot shields until the officers charged, forcing them back down. A truck belonging to the radio station RTL went up in flames, sending a dark column of smoke skyward. Police reinforcements arrived and set off tear-gas, pushing the crowd out of the courtyard, into the surrounding streets and down into the metro station.The next morning, newspapers ran pictures of streets filled with fumes and burning cars; inside one, reports said, was a child rescued just in time. Far-right activists took to Twitter to denounce the protesters as savage anarchists. \u201cSupport goes out to police confronting those who take advantage of an unfortunate accident to attack the police and spit on France,\u201d Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, the niece of the president of the National Front, tweeted. Another party leader wrote, \u201cRiots in Bobigny \u2014 there you have it: the result of 40 years of mass immigration, judicial cowardice and political blindness.\u201dI was separated from Bouteghm\u00e8s in the chaos, and he messaged me later to make sure I got out all right. \u201cWhat happened was predictable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe speeches weren\u2019t clear, weren\u2019t calming. We need only to be able to communicate in order to make things just a little bit better. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible anymore.\u201dHe had plenty of ideas. Architecture was a passion, and he had studied urban planning to understand how new buildings might be designed to resist the kind of rapid degradation that plagued the town\u2019s infrastructure. He even helped start a program for architecture students in Paris, who could propose ideas for La Courneuve as their final thesis. The results were sometimes outlandish \u2014 one student drafted a blueprint for a perfume museum \u2014 but Bouteghm\u00e8s still found them useful. \u201cIt makes you dream a bit,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich changes what you can do.\u201dThe mayor encouraged Bouteghm\u00e8s and his friends to run on his ticket; he needed to join forces with young men of their background to win a majority in a town that has more than 100 nationalities. Once elected, though, they felt constrained by a decades-old political machine. In the fall of 2015, Poux shut down the Samaritain Roma camp in La Courneuve that was home to 300 people; he stated that what was needed was a national, not a local, solution. For months, Bouteghm\u00e8s had helped organize protests to keep it open, and as it became clear the Roma would not prevail, he worked with local nongovernment organizations to help find temporary squats. He felt that he could no longer share a political identity with the mayor, and he and three others split off to form the \u00c9lan Populaire Courneuvien, on the theory that as a bloc they could wield some power. Eventually, one of them might even run against the mayor.\u201cIn the beginning, in my head, identity was important,\u201d Bouteghm\u00e8s told me. I met him at an Illy cafe behind the Op\u00e9ra Garnier in late January, when all the surfaces of the city are darkened from incessant rain. He is tall and unfailingly well put together; that day he had on a navy blue shawl-neck sweater over a pressed white button-down shirt, dark, slim-fitted wool pants and large glasses with clear-plastic frames that were slightly out of tune with his otherwise sober demeanor. We talked for nearly an hour and a half before he smiled for the first time. \u201cIn reality, identity doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said. What had been, initially, an American-style venture in identity politics led him back to the French Republican ideals of universalism. \u201cYou have a group of people who all look alike, they criticize the old white guys who keep everything to themselves. But then we do the same thing. The Arabs complain about racism, but they\u2019re racist toward the Roma. Identity is a trap.\u201dBouteghm\u00e8s\u2019s father was born near Constantine, in the Algerian east, in 1950, when the country was still a part of France. He left at 23 for France and met Bouteghm\u00e8s\u2019s mother, a Tunisian, while they were working at a hotel near the Gare de l\u2019Est in Paris. He went back to Algeria, as he always planned, but after a few months he returned to France to be with Bouteghm\u00e8s\u2019s mother. They bought an apartment in La Courneuve, when suburban design was still confidently utopian. Bouteghm\u00e8s\u2019s father eventually became a site manager for a construction company and a union representative. \u201cHe paid for it dearly,\u201d Bouteghm\u00e8s told me. \u201cIn front of him were the bosses attacking him, next to him people who deserted him, betrayed him.\u201d He would negotiate a pay raise, and they would increase everyone\u2019s salary except for his. \u201cMy father would always say to me, \u2018Don\u2019t do what I did.\u2019 And now I\u2019m living the same thing he lived. Exactly the same.\u201dThe problems facing the suburbs, Bouteghm\u00e8s asserted, could not be addressed without taking on the larger national malaise. \u201cFor me, today, being named Mehdi Bouteghm\u00e8s, my father was born in a French colony, my mother was born in a French protectorate, if I want to question the political methods, practices, Republican institutions, people will say I\u2019m an Islamist,\u201d Bouteghm\u00e8s told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal.\u201d At 18 he joined the Young Muslims of France, a community youth group, and during a phase in college read extensively in Islamic philosophy and theology. Islam was part of his identity, but now, 10 years later, he was certain this would be used against him if he decided to enter national politics. \u201cThey\u2019ll attack me, twist positions I may have taken before, activities I might have been involved in in the past,\u201d he said.Bouteghm\u00e8s attended high school in the neighboring suburb Aubervilliers, at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri Wallon, where, in 2003, during his first semester, the Affaire Alma and Lila L\u00e9vy, which led to the 2004 law banning religious symbols, unfolded. \u201cIn my opinion, that was the breaking point of the Republic,\u201d he said. That fall, two sisters, daughters of an Algerian mother who was baptized Catholic and an atheist Jewish father, refused to remove the head scarves they had recently begun to wear. The school suspended them for \u201costentatious\u201d attire that was \u201cdisturbing\u201d to the public order. \u201cWe had debates about it in the schoolyard,\u201d Bouteghm\u00e8s said. \u201cBut with the teachers, there was an incredible racism.\u201d He went on: \u201cYou crack. It becomes us against them, against those who want nothing of us \u2014 everyone.\u201d His parents weren\u2019t particularly religious, but social dynamics led him, for a time, to delve into Islam. \u201cI would go around talking about values: \u2018No, that\u2019s no good. No, this is what Islam is.\u2019 But people allowed me to make my mistakes, let me evolve, realize my errors. I didn\u2019t know who I was yet. Today, if you\u2019re an 18-year-old kid, you talk about Islam like that, you go straight to prison.\u201dTo Bouteghm\u00e8s, the hysteria in France about Islam, on display most recently in the \u201cburkini\u201d controversy, smacked of the anti-Semitism of the \u201930s. \u201cThey are attacking people who don\u2019t represent what people are saying they represent,\u201d he said. Women in head scarves had become symbols, flash points, everything except individuals with complicated personal reasons for expressing themselves in a particular way. Even for the people who did turn to fundamentalism, religion was often a question of economic and political exclusion. Solve the economic problems \u2014 find people jobs, help them educate their families \u2014 the \u201cwoman question\u201d would resolve itself.The politics of French culture now seem intrinsic to the country\u2019s sense of itself, but it wasn\u2019t until the early 1980s, as Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, notes in a new book, \u201cDire la France,\u201d that \u201cculture\u201d became mixed with \u201cnational identity.\u201d It was a theme of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s Socialist Party, a bid to recapture power. \u201cWithout knowing it, they engendered a monster they could not control,\u201d Martigny says. The far-right took up the theme and unity became confused with uniformity. \u201cThere is a gap between civic culture, the culture of the Republic, which is defending the principles of France, and the majority culture,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople think \u2018real France\u2019 is like us. It\u2019s not all these other people: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s good if they claim that they are French, but they\u2019re not white, they\u2019re not from Christian families, they don\u2019t come from a small village, we don\u2019t have enough dead people buried in the same cemeteries.\u2019\u2009\u201dFor decades the far right has been obsessed with a speech that the Algerian revolutionary leader Houari Boumediene supposedly gave in the 1970s, in which he predicted that one day the famished masses would travel from the south to the north in a wave of immigration that would be \u201cneither fraternal nor pacifist.\u201d France has been so transformed by terrorism \u2014 more than 230 deaths over nine attacks since 2015 \u2014 that a significant part of the intellectual and cultural establishment is now comfortably aligned with the far right. The Figaro columnist \u00c9ric Zemmour, a ubiquitous presence on TV and a top-selling nonfiction writer, asserted that the French Army has a secret plan, called Operation Brambles, to clear out Muslims from the suburbs, developed in consort with Israeli military specialists who refined their technique in Gaza. The ostensibly liberal feminist \u00c9lisabeth Badinter recently denounced in an introduction to \u201cFrance in Submission,\u201d a collection of testimonies from local politicians and civil servants about their battles with Islam, the \u201cseparatism, indeed secession\u201d sought by elements of society, and she encouraged the French to fight against \u201cthose who aspire to impose their laws and values on us.\u201dIn early March I attended a conference dedicated to de-Islamizing Europe. It was organized by a Catholic activist group and held in B\u00e9ziers, a southern town whose famously provocative mayor, Robert M\u00e9nard, warmly welcomed the attendees. The conference offered a daylong workshop in which to learn how to become a \u201cvector\u201d in society to fight against a plot cooked up by Islamic nations to set up colonies across Europe, by way of European Muslims, who were adherents of Sharia law. In attendance were a number of local officials from across the south, people who considered Marine Le Pen a liberal and were sworn devotees of her father. But there was also a couple sitting behind me who supported Fillon. They lived in Figeac, a small town north of Toulouse, and they had observed worrisome changes there over the last decade. There was more drug dealing, more crime, more incivility. The solution, they said, was to fight the spread of Islam.The ambivalence that many residents of La Courneuve exhibited toward the presidential campaign was reciprocated. Most of the candidates on the left made some effort to meet with organizations and businesses in the suburbs, but the candidates on the right mostly didn\u2019t bother. Marine Le Pen suggested that many of the terrorist attacks of the last few years could have been prevented by getting rid of \u201cthe birthright,\u201d automatic citizenship for anyone born on French soil.The remark made Yenbou want to cry. \u201cWhy,\u201d she said, \u201care you talking to me about Algeria and Morocco, I\u2019m talking about my country, France. I was born French, my parents were born French, it became Algeria later on, my grandparents were French, my great-grandparents were French, and I ask again: I don\u2019t have the right to criticize France, my country?\u201d She realized that these kinds of reactions were not fully conscious, but that didn\u2019t make them excusable. \u201cValues\u201d were something that only the country\u2019s minorities were required to prove they understood. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary that the idea of equality be taken into account, by everyone,\u201d Yenbou said. \u201cThere was a directive for teachers to talk about the values of the Republic in school, O.K. But when I learned that in the rich neighborhoods, teachers don\u2019t talk about values, what did they tell me? They said, \u2018But there\u2019s no problem with Republican values here \u2014 they know them.\u2019 Well, what about equality? Who will talk to these children in the rich neighborhoods about discrimination? Who will tell them that in our country, equality isn\u2019t real?\u201dThe Courneuviens I spoke with that weekend didn\u2019t hold out much hope for Macron. They were convinced he would turn out to be a continuation of Hollande, or worse. Legislative elections in June would determine whether Macron would be able to garner the power in Parliament to change the country\u2019s economy as he said he would; Bouteghm\u00e8s feared what Macron\u2019s plans to loosen regulations would do to the safety net, but he was loath to join the opposition of the aging far-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9l\u00e9nchon, who conducted politics as a personality cult and could be just as hostile to multiculturalism as other politicians of his generation. And if Le Pen won, well, one resident wondered whether it would \u201cbe possible to see the bad among the bad.\u201d Deciding between the two candidates, he said, was \u201clike being asked to choose your own death.\u201dElisabeth Zerofsky is a freelance writer living in Paris.

{"Headline": "Texas Governor Revives Stalled Transgender Bathroom Bill", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 Gov. Greg Abbott reignited one of the most divisive issues in Texas politics on Tuesday, calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session of the Legislature in part to consider a bill that would reinforce the state\u2019s effort to regulate bathroom use by transgender people in public buildings.An attempt during the regular session by conservative lawmakers and pastors to pass legislation to regulate bathroom use had been unsuccessful by the time the session ended on Memorial Day. But on Tuesday, Mr. Abbott, a Republican, ordered a 30-day special session starting in July and put on the agenda a bathroom bill that would prevent municipalities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances designed to protect transgender people. The special-session agenda also includes bills that would limit property taxes and keep several state agencies operating.\u201cAt a minimum, we need a law that protects the privacy of our children in our public schools,\u201d Mr. Abbott told reporters at the Capitol in Austin.In doing so, Mr. Abbott ignored the concerns of local and national business leaders but earned swift praise from social conservatives, some of whom had complained that he had remained largely on the sidelines in the debate. Critics said Mr. Abbott, a former judge who is viewed by many as more cautious than his predecessor, Rick Perry, had capitulated to the extreme right, and to one of his Republican colleagues, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who led the push for the restrictions.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Patrick praised what he called the \u201cbig and bold special-session agenda,\u201d which he said \u201csolidly reflects the priorities of the people of Texas.\u201d\u201cMy take is that he is clearly panicked about the far right, and he feels the need to shovel as much red meat to the far right of his party as he can,\u201d said State Representative Chris Turner, a Democrat who was the campaign manager for Wendy Davis, Mr. Abbott\u2019s Democratic rival in 2014.In a recent interview at his Capitol office, Mr. Abbott pushed back against that idea. \u201cThe positions that I\u2019ve fought for in my first session and in this session are unalterable conservative principles, so it\u2019s just who I am,\u201d he said.Mr. Straus\u2019s attempt to loosen the bathroom restrictions in the House was rejected by Mr. Patrick and Senate leaders. The resulting stalemate threatened the operation of several state agencies, including the one that licenses doctors. The failure by the Legislature to pass legislation to keep those agencies operating put added pressure on Mr. Abbott to call a special session.\u201cA special session was entirely avoidable,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThere was plenty of time for the House and Senate to forge compromises.\u201dIt would effectively ban local regulation of discrimination. The bill would prohibit cities, counties and school districts from passing anti-discrimination measures to protect any class of people already protected under state law. And it would nullify existing policies in San Antonio, Dallas and other cities that allow transgender people to use the public bathroom that matches their gender identity.Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, and David Montgomery from Austin, Tex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Clarion Call of Being Canadian", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byFirst PersonMy children are Canadian. They are also American and British, though they do not necessarily identify in that order. Once, British might have come first; later, American. But now the Canadian part is on the rise.Until they were 8, 5 and 3, we lived in London. For the last nine years, we have lived in Brooklyn. And for as long as the children can remember, they have spent one to three months every year in Ontario.My husband and I always believed that their having three passports was a gift, one that David (who is Canadian, with Scottish ancestry) and I (American) were lucky to give. (British citizenship came because by the time they were born, we had permanent leave to remain in the country.) They were born into the blessings of bilateralism. When they were little, we plotted ways to create ties for them to their various countries of origin. We wanted them to feel equally invested and at home in all three.Still, the Olympic Games were always a bone of contention in our house. Ditto the Stanley Cup. Someone was usually upset about the team someone else was rooting for. (Oftentimes it was the New York Rangers who were the issue.)In fact, one of the reasons we moved from London back to the United States in 2008 was because my husband became increasingly irritated by our elder daughter cheering for the British rowers and the American swimmers. It seemed to suggest she had absorbed the Canadians\u2019 mythic inferiority complex, the one in which they define themselves by what they are not, and are generally ignored to go about their healthy business.Even though the kids spent pretty much every summer and Christmas in Canada, visiting relatives and canoeing in the wilderness or doing other activities that required tractors and involved antler treasure hunts, the country was to them almost an abstract concept representing nature, escape, space and good manners, rather than an electoral identity. Of all their passports, the Canadian one was the one they looked at the least.Then came 2016.\u201cWill we have to get a new passport?\u201d one asked. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to be English?\u201d another said. Their fondest memories, it turned out, were of the free flow across borders \u2014 of the speed of belonging rightfully in the E.U. line at Heathrow Airport and being able to move from culture to culture without being labeled an \u201calien.\u201dWe didn\u2019t move. But Canada has become a point of pride for our children.Our 16-year-old has just gone off on a 52-day canoe trip through Quebec to Hudson Bay that she has been dreaming about since last summer. (She had a countdown clock as the screen saver on her laptop.) At a recent high school rowing championship, where all sorts of souvenir T-shirts are sold, she expressed a desire for a Canadian national team tank. In a discussion of what colleges she might apply to, she dismissed the idea of British universities entirely, but American and Canadian schools are still on the list.Her little brother is canoeing eight hours north of Toronto. Not long ago, he acquired two T-shirts advertising the local highway poutine shack by his grandmother\u2019s weekend cabin near Alliston, Ontario, which he proudly wears around school. He took a picture of himself on the Brooklyn Bridge wearing his Just Judy\u2019s Chip Wagon shirt and an enormous grin, sent it to the woman who runs the stand, and she posted it on her Facebook page. The image shows a little bit of Canada in Brooklyn.Though he might think Brooklyn in Canada was more like it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Uber\u2019s Chief Is Gaining Even More Clout in the Company", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, already wields plenty of control over the company because it is structured to favor its founders. But Mr. Kalanick is quietly amassing even more control than entrepreneurs typically enjoy at their start-ups.That is because Mr. Kalanick has been gaining voting rights power at Uber, a privately held ride-hailing company, through employee share sales. Uber staffers who sell even part of their stock back to the company under a repurchase program must give the voting rights associated with all of their shares to Mr. Kalanick, according to a copy of the buyback agreement obtained by The New York Times.Under the terms, Mr. Kalanick could gain control of nearly 8 percent of the voting rights of one kind of Uber stock, Class A, and 2 percent of the voting rights of another type of stock, Class B. It is unclear how much of those types of stock he already owns.Yet even if Mr. Kalanick were to take time off, his ability to influence Uber\u2019s direction would appear to be secure. He and his allies hold a hefty number of what are known as \u201csuper-voting shares\u201d that give them 10 votes a share, or an outsize vote. The employee buyback agreement cements Mr. Kalanick\u2019s control, giving him more sway on any matter put before all shareholders.Employees must follow the \u201cinstructions of Travis Kalanick,\u201d according to the buyback agreement, \u201cwith respect to any and all matters\u201d that are submitted to a shareholder vote.Amassing voting rights will not help Mr. Kalanick win in all situations. For matters that are put only to a board vote, such as whether to remove top executives, each of Uber\u2019s seven voting members has one vote. And Mr. Kalanick will not control the voting rights associated with the employee stock options if he steps down or is ousted as chief executive, leaves the board, or is no longer dedicating the vast majority of his professional time to Uber, under the terms of the employee buyback agreement.A spokesman for Uber declined to comment on the employee stock buybacks and their terms.Since at least 2015, Uber has offered employees different versions of the share buyback program. In general, employees who have worked at the company four years and have been granted stock options \u2014 meaning the ability to buy a certain number of shares from the company at a low price \u2014 may sell part of those options back to Uber at a locked-in price. Uber pays the employee for those options over several months.The idea behind the program is that employees can turn some of their paper wealth into cash while still working at Uber. If they quit before the entire amount is paid, the payments stop.Such a buyback targets early employees because participants must have worked at Uber four years or more. About two years ago, when Uber had fewer than 2,000 full-time employees, it stopped issuing stock options in compensation packages and instead issued restricted stock units, which the company is not permitted to repurchase. Uber now has about 14,000 employees.Fewer than 100 Uber employees have participated in the buyback program, according to a person familiar with the program, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to discuss the private contracts. Even so, what those employees relinquished in voting rights as part of the buyback program is onerous.Even if a worker sells only 10 percent of his or her stock back to the company, that worker agrees to give Mr. Kalanick the voting rights to 100 percent of his or her stock. Each share of Class A stock comes with one shareholder vote, while each share of Class B comes with 10 votes.Uber had 545.8 million Class A shares at the end of last year, which included 43.4 million employee stock options that had been issued, according to financial statements obtained by The Times. If all of the early employees who owned those options sold even a small part of their stock to Uber, Mr. Kalanick could control the votes of up to 43.4 million shares, or an additional 7.9 percent of that stock class.Uber also had 459.7 million Class B common shares at the end of 2016, which included 9.9 million employee stock options that had been issued. If all of the holders of those options sold even part of their stock to Uber, Mr. Kalanick could control the votes of up to 9.9 million shares, or an additional 2.2 percent of that stock class.Mr. Kalanick does not control those votes until he issues something called a \u201cvoting notice,\u201d which requires the employee to vote all of his or her remaining stock in accordance with Mr. Kalanick\u2019s wishes on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, according to the agreement. If Mr. Kalanick issued such a notice to a Class B shareholder, the stock gets only one vote a share, which goes to Mr. Kalanick.The agreement also obligates Uber to buy back an employee\u2019s stock at a price that tracks the value of the company\u2019s common stock, as determined by an outside party, and that price is locked in for the life of the payout. Uber\u2019s valuation has skyrocketed over time, to nearly $70 billion. More employees may take the buyback deal now amid worries that the current management troubles could affect the company\u2019s valuation.Uber, which is based in San Francisco, is working with a third party to re-evaluate the value of its stock, according to a person familiar with the process, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tinder Could Take Back the White House", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBy now, you may have heard that young voters were critical in the election in the United Kingdom earlier this month, helping deliver embarrassing losses to the Conservative Party. As politically active progressives in our 20s, we were eager to help mobilize the youth vote before the election. But we also knew that reaching out to people in our mostly left-wing social bubble would change nothing. Yara\u2019s matches on the dating app Tinder were surprisingly responsive when she suggested that they register to vote. So we decided to scale it up.With the help of two software engineers, Erika Pheby and Kyle Buttner, we designed a chatbot, a smart computer program that deployed an adaptable script. In the two days ahead of the election earlier this month, the chatbot struck up conversations with thousands of young people between 18 and 25 years old on Tinder. The chatbot talked about politics, with the aim of getting voters to help oust the Conservative government. The results were amazing. Over 30,000 messages reached young people in key constituencies.This is how it worked: People we recruited from Facebook and Twitter \u201clent\u201d us their Tinder profiles, and the bot convinced Tinder that their profiles were in geographical locations where the vote was close. In these places, the proportion of 18-25-year-olds was high enough that they could swing the election \u2014 if they turned out at the national average. Using the photograph of the person who\u2019d lent their profile, the program would automatically swipe \u201cyes\u201d on every user, and if someone swiped \u201cyes\u201d back, creating a \u201cmatch,\u201d the bot would ask about the user\u2019s voting plans.If the user planned to vote for Labour (or whatever party best placed to beat the Conservatives), the bot sent a message with a link to the nearest polling station. If the user planned to vote for another progressive party, the bot asked if he or she would consider a tactical vote to beat the Tories, voting for the progressive party most likely to beat the Conservatives in their area. And if the user was voting for a right-wing party or was unsure, the bot sent a list of Labour policies, or a criticism of Tory policies. People who lent their profiles could jump in and chat at any time. And they did.We were amazed by the number of people saying that they\u2019d spent hours convincing a match 300 miles away that high taxation for the rich would benefit them, because we all benefit from investment in the National Health Service. Others organized dates with people with whom they had compatible politics. The occasional match was disappointed to be talking to a bot instead of a human, but there was very little negative feedback: Tinder is too casual a platform for users to feel hoodwinked by some political conversation. By and large, users surprised us with their receptiveness. Some people who received bot messages asked how they could join us. Our inboxes were flooded. The number of profiles lent to us in just two evenings was incredible \u2014 we needed a 10-person team to process sign ups. We knew we were a part of something big.The fact is that until we saw the exit poll, which showed significant losses for the Conservative Party, we were pessimistic. When the election was announced, we prepared ourselves for a bloodbath. But like thousands of young people across the Britain, we got to work.This election campaign has been like no other. Voters have been more engaged online than ever before. People aren\u2019t just posting \u201cI voted\u201d as a status update, they\u2019re sharing information with each other on how to vote tactically in their area. Meme-friendly graphics have condensed 200-page manifestos into bullet points, helping people easily understand the parties\u2019 policies.Social media has also made canvassing more inclusive. Several people who volunteered with us said our bot allowed them to canvass despite physical or mental health conditions that prevented them from handing out leaflets. Nathalie Wright, a disability activist and writer, said: \u201cI could do it in my own time on my own terms, as much or as little as I wanted. This reflects a bigger shift this election, where politics has been made more accessible and relevant to people who are usually marginalized.\u201dWhat have we learned? At least two things.First, that in the weeks since this election was called, people on the left have come together. Every single person on our team wanted to beat the Tories, but we never discussed where exactly on the left we stood.This isn\u2019t unusual: All over Britain, progressive alliances have been cropping up. These groups, made up of activists from Labour, the Green Party and Liberal Democrats, campaigned together locally for whichever candidate was best placed to defeat the Conservatives, something unprecedented in Britain\u2019s highly partisan political culture. After years of the Conservatives\u2019 austerity program, which included cuts to housing, domestic violence services, hospitals and schools, people became more willing to unite against something.In the United States, you might feel like all you do is talk and disagree. But when it comes it to beating Donald Trump in 2020, leftists will have a level of anger that just couldn\u2019t be mustered after eight years of President Obama. Many voters had reservations about Hillary Clinton \u2014 many voters also weren\u2019t sure about Jeremy Corbyn. But many on the left will agree that Mr. Trump has to go. If you get together and get organized, you can win.Secondly \u2014 and this is more speculative \u2014 Tinder is an intimate medium. When you\u2019re on your way home from work and someone stops you in the street, you\u2019re busy: You don\u2019t want to listen. But on Tinder, people want to talk, and they talk candidly. It\u2019s not unusual to disclose a taboo sexual preference in an opening message. And the political is personal. A \u00a310 minimum wage is personal. So is universal healthcare. Talking politics on Tinder works because your matches are waiting for you to say something personal to them. And they are willing to listen.Advertisement"}

The prime minister\u2019s siblings accused him of wanting to preserve it as a monument for his political advantage.Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s \u201cpopularity is inextricably linked to Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s legacy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHis political power is drawn from his being Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s son. We have observed that Hsien Loong and Ho Ching\u201d \u2014 the prime minister\u2019s wife \u2014 \u201cwant to milk Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s legacy for their own political purposes.\u201dThey added that Lee Hsien Loong and his wife, who is chief executive of Temasek Holdings, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, were harboring political ambitions for their son. The prime minister also denied this assertion.Lee Hsien Yang, who is chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, and Lee Wei Ling, a surgeon and a senior adviser at the National Neuroscience Institute, said they had nothing to gain from the demolition of the house except to honor their father\u2019s wishes.\u201cWe do not trust Hsien Loong as a brother or a leader,\u201d they wrote in their statement. \u201cWe have lost confidence in him.\u201dChua Beng Huat, a sociology professor at the National University of Singapore, called the public feud \u201cmind-boggling.\u201d He doubted, however, that it would undercut the political standing of Lee Hsien Loong, who has been prime minister since 2004.But Catherine Lim, a political commentator, wrote in an email that the Lee Kuan Yew era was \u201ceffectively over,\u201d with the governing People\u2019s Action Party \u201copenly preparing Singaporeans for the new leadership, a prominent lineup of young, already tested leaders.\u201dMs. Lim said that she was startled last year when the prime minister\u2019s sister \u201cactually called him \u2018dishonorable\u2019 and accused him of \u2018dynastic\u2019 ambitions, as the Lees have generally been a very private family.\u201d\u201cThis new, very acrimonious development of the feud,\u201d she said, \u201cis likely to unfold further, and probably in unexpected ways, over the coming months.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Attack on Muslims Shakes Cosmopolitan London", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cIt feels like you\u2019re under siege,\u201d said Mr. Abdullah, 23, a law student standing outside Finsbury Park Mosque in North London on Monday morning hours after the attack. \u201cI wonder,\u201d he said, \u201cis anyone going to write about a \u2018white Christian terrorist\u2019 this time round?\u201dBut this proudly cosmopolitan city is now confronted with the tensions and ugliness that have been simmering on the fringes for years and are boiling to the surface.As Hamdan Omar, another student who grew up in the area, put it, \u201cThere are people on both sides who want the clash of civilizations.\u201dThe authorities said they were treating the attack as an act of terrorism against Muslims, while many of the city\u2019s Muslim leaders pleaded for calm and warned against a rising tide of anti-Islamic sentiment.In the week after the June 3 terrorist attack on London Bridge and at Borough Market that killed eight people and was carried out by three men inspired by the Islamic State, the Metropolitan Police reported 120 Islamophobic events, compared with 36 the previous week. Similar increases were recorded after the terrorist attacks in March on Westminster Bridge in London, and in May at the Manchester Arena.On Monday in Finsbury Park, one of London\u2019s many diverse neighborhoods, residents left flowers and messages of solidarity outside the mosque.\u201cWith love, sympathy and support to our Muslim neighbors, victims of this horrific act of terrorism,\u201d one handwritten note read. \u201cThis does not represent Finsbury Park,\u201d another read.The children of a local school had drawn a colorful, even cheerful, sign: \u201cOne Community. Standing Together.\u201dBy late morning, the initial fear and shock over the attack had given way to anger \u2014 anger at the government and at the news media for too often amalgamating Islam and Islamists. But by the afternoon, another sentiment made itself heard powerfully here: defiance.\u201cThings like this will only strengthen London,\u201d said Mr. Abdullah, the law student. His grandfather and father had both been praying at the mosque before the attack and were inside when it happened. \u201cAn event like this will be met with resilience.\u201dUba Osman, 20, a local business manager, concurred: \u201cThere are some people who are trying to divide us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t divide us. Londoners are not like that.\u201dThere was a sense of relief here, carefully expressed, that the man suspected in the attack was not from the city. \u201cSomehow, it would have been even worse if he had been from our city,\u201d said Zahra Mounia, 45, a mother of two who lives in South London but traveled here to see a friend after the attack. \u201cWe are so proud of this city and what it stands for.\u201dBut some worried London\u2019s tolerance was fraying on the edges, too. Over the past three months, as Islamist militants struck three times, several residents said they experienced small but unsettling episodes of hostility.\u201cIn London, people feel they must tolerate you, so they won\u2019t say anything but you get the dirty looks, people avoiding eye contact,\u201d said Suzanne Stone, 42, a convert to Islam and a writer of children\u2019s books. \u201cMy friend outside of London gets real abuse.\u201dHer husband, Omar Faruq, said he worried about some of the things in the news media. \u201cThey say things on the radio and are not held to account,\u201d he said, recalling one show in which a member of the far-right anti-Muslim English Defense League \u201cwas calling on people to form militias.\u201dMr. Faruq was also concerned that the government might further stigmatize Muslims by expanding the country\u2019s already powerful antiterrorism legislation. \u201cNow there is a lot of talk about nonviolent extremism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does that mean? If you don\u2019t believe in a certain way, you are extremist? Everything is extremism now.\u201dHe pointed out the way the news media had been quick to identify Finsbury Park Mosque as a former hotbed of radicalization. He wondered if that was appropriate. \u201cIt just takes away that little bit of sympathy,\u201d he said.Details matter. That is something many people here said on Monday. It was Muslims, awake because of Ramadan, who saved a lot of lives in Grenfell Tower by waking up neighbors and alerting the fire department. And it was an imam of the Muslim Welfare House who helped form a protective ring around the van driver on Monday before the police arrested him. \u201cHow many people know that?\u201d asked Omar Hussain, a community worker.One answer, said Jacob Davey of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, who analyzes extremist online narratives, is that Islamist militants and far-right extremists have fed on one another\u2019s hatred to recruit people for their causes.After the Grenfell fire, the English Defense League posted an image of the tower on Facebook (later removed) with the caption: \u201cThey say Ramadan saved Lives. It would be the first time Islam saves lives.\u201dIn another Facebook thread about Monday\u2019s mosque attack, one comment read, \u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d Another, \u201cCivil war has begun.\u201dMeanwhile, on Ummah News, a forum that supports the Islamic State, commenters reacted to the Monday attack by calling for Muslims to fight back: \u201cOh Muslims you need to wake up the war is starting now in your own streets outside your own Masajids. Your elders could be killed, your sisters could be attacked. They hate your Oh Muslims.\u201dNazir Afzal, who was once the acting chief prosecutor for London and has lived in the city for 20 years, said it was a powerful message to people \u201con the cusp of radicalization.\u201dIn Finsbury Park, some linked last year\u2019s vote to leave the European Union to a change in atmosphere in the country that also left its mark on London, its opposition to the British exit notwithstanding.\u201cSince the \u2018Brexit\u2019 vote, things have been crazy,\u201d said Mr. Abdullah, the law student. \u201cThe spotlight is on minorities. The signal is, \u2018You\u2019re not wanted here.\u2019\u201dMendy Korer, the rabbi of Islington, one of many local faith leaders who had come to Finsbury to show solidarity, said he was confident the local community would beat hatred. \u201cWe have a duty to break that cycle,\u201d he said.Not everyone was so optimistic.\u201cI think it could escalate,\u201d said Shiraz Kothia of the London Muslim Community Forum, who helps the Metropolitan Police to manage community relations during major episodes like this. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the right-wing extremists and we\u2019ve got the Muslim extremists.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really worried,\u201d he added. \u201cToday outside a Muslim mosque.

{"Headline": "Grab Your Picnic Baskets: The Party\u2019s Moving Outside", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byA picnic may sound like an old-fashioned pursuit, best suited for the romantically tangled characters of a 19th-century novel. But on a recent Sunday in a park in Red Hook, Brooklyn, a dozen families unpacked platters of food for the kind of generous, unfussy picnics you may actually want to join.Marisol and Angel Morales live in a small second-story apartment but wanted to entertain a party of 30 or so people outdoors in the sun. The couple arrived with a broom to clean up the plot of concrete and grass they had chosen in nearby Coffey Park. They came prepared because that morning, their son had been up early to scout out a good spot and report back.The couple lugged an extra folding table and chairs so that they could play dominoes, a large plastic cooler on wheels full of food, and the most important accessory for outdoor entertaining, according to Ms. Morales: a fully charged wireless speaker.Throughout the afternoon, the speaker blasted Marc Anthony, Big Pun and the \u201cFrozen\u201d soundtrack. Regardless of the song, Mr. Morales, who is 65 and moved to New York from Puerto Rico as a teenager, often broke from conversation with family and friends to dance a few steps, a gold Sphinx pendant swinging on his chest.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to feel lonely,\u201d he said, gesturing to the crowd growing around him, \u201cso we just kept inviting more and more people.\u201dMs. Morales, 54, a party planner who makes custom decorations, knows the importance of advance work. She had cooked a big platter of macaroni with ground beef the night before, and woke up extra early to make her arroz con gandules, generously seasoned rice with pigeon peas. She picked up trays of grilled chicken ordered from a nearby restaurant and set all the food out family-style, nudging guests to remove the lids and help themselves as they arrived.\u201cI don\u2019t bother serving everyone,\u201d said Ms. Morales, who keeps her picnics casual, with no set eating time \u2014 an arrangement that works especially well for her grown children and their toddlers. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to wait for everyone to eat, and we don\u2019t need to all sit down at the same time. That\u2019s the best part.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a classic way to entertain,\u201d Ms. Hanel said in a phone interview, \u201cbut it also addresses a lot of modern obstacles to entertaining.\u201dMs. Hanel first embraced picnics when she lived in an apartment in New York City. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that\u2019s where I started,\u201d she said.Like the Moraleses, and so many others in small apartments, Ms. Hanel didn\u2019t have the luxury of private space, so she turned to the city\u2019s public space.\u201cIn the Instagram age, people are so intimidated by entertaining that we often fall back on restaurants for big groups,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that can be so expensive, and it\u2019s tough to organize everyone for a reservation.\u201dMaking the meal a potluck, and shifting it outside, instantly made things more affordable and communal. It was also a way to accommodate more people.\u201cFor those with food restrictions or allergies, they can bring some of their own food,\u201d Ms. Hanel said.And unlike at a formal dinner, there is no need to consult with the host about special requirements. \u201cPeople with small kids can just stop in and leave when it\u2019s convenient, according to their nap schedules, and you can bring the dog,\u201d she said.To keep food cold, a hard plastic cooler is ideal, but Ms. Hanel has improvised. A plastic wagon filled with ice will keep bottles of beer and wine cold. So will a picnic basket when it\u2019s lined first with a trash bag.\u201cDon\u2019t forget a few trash bags,\u201d Ms. Hanel cautioned. \u201cI love specialty equipment, but the only thing that can make a picnic terrible is not being able to get rid of dirty things.\u201d When gathering once a month with friends to picnic, she finds that the most commonly forgotten items tend to be trash bags, serving spoons and a sharp knife.Fried chicken is ideal picnic food, and Ms. Slonecker, a food stylist and former culinary instructor, developed a recipe for \u201cThe Picnic\u201d in which the meat is brined with Lapsang souchong, a smoky tea, then breaded with cornmeal and fried.Others may have their own methods, such as frying boneless pieces of meat coated in Japanese bread crumbs, then sandwiching them in biscuits with hot honey butter. Biscuits can make an ideal vehicle for chicken tenders, but a soft dough should be worked slightly to yield a firmer biscuit that won\u2019t crumble to pieces. And hot sauce and pickles should arrive on the side, to prevent a mushy breading or biscuit.Advice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.However you make the chicken, maintaining its crunch is key. \u201cHumidity is the enemy of crispness,\u201d Ms. Slonecker said. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re trapping in heat as it\u2019s cooling, you\u2019re ruining that crispness.\u201dA common mistake she sees in serving cold fried chicken is overseasoning. \u201cWhen you eat foods that are hot, the perception of flavors is not as full,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as things cool, you\u2019re really able to detect more taste, more flavor and more saltiness.\u201dMs. Slonecker recommends frying chicken in the morning and letting it cool uncovered at room temperature. Using a wire rack will enable the breading to cool quickly, with air circulating around it, so that no part gets soggy. If kept uncovered, the chicken will even keep some of its texture overnight. But for optimal crunch, Ms. Slonecker advises taking it to the picnic the same day.Back at Coffey Park, Nancy Feliciano had received a distressing text message. \u201cMy niece who\u2019s supposed to bring the fried chicken?\u201d she said. \u201cShe only just woke up!\u201dMs. Feliciano, 53, grew up across the street from the park, where she played as a child. She had arrived at 8 a.m. to beat the competition. \u201cYou get here any later, and all the picnic tables are gone,\u201d she said.She found a seat and waited for everyone to arrive, popping open an umbrella during a rain shower, and at one point taking a pamphlet from a passing Jehovah\u2019s Witness just to have something to read.Ms. Feliciano\u2019s tips for a successful picnic are to plan the menu in advance, to share the work, and to send someone to the park early to stake out a location. A week earlier, she was editing a master list of who was bringing what.Her nephew was on baked ziti duty. Her sister was charged with arroz con gandules. Her niece planned to bring a cold pasta salad made with crab meat, and juice for the children. Another family member was making orange-tinted pasteles filled with turkey and scrambled eggs. Ms. Feliciano would take care of the potato salad.By the afternoon, everything was set up, except for the fried chicken. One youngster who had been sent running home for silverware, and then to the bodega down the block to pick up cold drinks, was refusing to go for anything else.\u201cYou know what?\u201d Ms. Feliciano said. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.

{"Headline": "May and London Mayor Are Met With Anger as They Respond to Fire", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Grenfell Tower residents said they had warned about fire hazards for years before their London public housing project became a 24-story cinder. On Friday, they stormed the local government council, accusing officials first of ignoring them and then of leaving them without financial assistance and lodging, or even a rough accounting of their missing loved ones.Prime Minister Theresa May and Mayor Sadiq Khan were heckled on separate visits with survivors. The queen and Prince William, upon leaving a relief center for the victims, were subjected to calls of \u201cWhat about the children?\u201dThe authorities confirmed on Friday that at least 58 people had died and estimated that the final toll could be more than 70 killed in an inferno so intense that the remains of many of the victims will be unidentifiable. And already, the fire at the Grenfell Tower housing project \u2014 its scorched shell looming above one of London\u2019s most upscale neighborhoods \u2014 has become a grim symbol of class inequality in a city that has long been a magnet for global wealth.After revelations that corner-cutting by government officials and building contractors alike may have played a role in the deadly fire, resentment played out in public.The criticisms echoed those made of her election campaign, during which she was accused of preferring speeches in carefully controlled environments. On Friday, finally, she perilously ventured outside that comfort zone, meeting with survivors and promising a fund of about $6.5 million for emergency supplies, food, clothes and other costs.\u201cEveryone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the government is there for them at this terrible time \u2014 and that is what I am determined to provide,\u201d she said outside St. Clement\u2019s Church, near the tower.Angry residents heckled her with shouts of \u201cCoward!\u201dLeila Amani, a survivor who visited Al Manaar mosque for prayer on Friday, said she had been placed in a hotel in Earl\u2019s Court with her family, but had not been given any information about how long she would stay there.\u201cOne of the charity workers told me it would be four or five days, but I haven\u2019t been told anything directly, and we have no idea where we will go after that,\u201d she said.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost everything, and this is the richest borough in Chelsea,\u201d she added. \u201cHow is it the mosques and churches are taking care of us and not the authorities?\u201dEven those who had rushed to volunteer and help were exasperated.\u201cI think it\u2019s appalling that these people have to organize their own relief,\u201d said Miriam Busani, a West London resident and volunteer. \u201cI left yesterday feeling that there could be a civil disturbance as these people are desperate and have been systematically dehumanized.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a riot waiting to happen,\u201d she added.Later on Friday, dozens of angry residents barged into the headquarters of the local council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, to demand a meeting with officials.The crowd shouted \u201cNot 17!\u201d a reference to the initial death toll put out by the authorities. Their demands included that the tower\u2019s residents be relocated within the borough and given immediate financial aid.The council said that it would do its best to relocate displaced residents, but gave no guarantee, and said it had already released funds. It was up to the coroner to release names and numbers of victims, it said.Laura Murray, 25, a beautician whose family lived in Grenfell Tower, said she was shocked by the fire and the official response, but not at all surprised.\u201cThere have been so many fire hazard complaints in the past, with power outages in cramped apartments full of children,\u201d Ms. Murray said. \u201cBut the council doesn\u2019t consider the working class and immigrants in the same way it does the rich, which is unacceptable in one of the world\u2019s richest countries.\u201dIn London, public housing is relatively distributed, something that has long been seen as a positive force for social cohesion.Yet in recent years, the city has also become home to a jaw-dropping concentration of global wealth, which Grenfell Tower residents could see all around them but many could scarcely touch. The overcrowded towers that accommodate some of the poorest families in the country are adjacent to streets lined with townhouses worth tens of millions.The glaring juxtaposition only sharpened the sense among Grenfell Tower residents that their well-being and safety were ignored because of who they were.\u201cPeople are not getting their heads around the paradigm in which we exist here, which is one of absolute inequality,\u201d Toby Lavrent Belson, a local activist, said. \u201cOur warnings were ignored, because that is normal here.\u201dMany of the immigrants who lived at Grenfell Tower came from war-ravaged countries like Syria, Somalia and Sudan. Mohammed Alhajali, a 23-year-old Syrian refugee, was one of them.A family friend, Umar Maan, said Mr. Alhajali had narrowly escaped the \u201cslaughter and bloodshed\u201d of Syria and risked his life making the dangerous crossing to Europe by sea before being granted asylum in Britain in 2014.On Thursday, Mr. Alhajali was the first victim of the fire to be identified, in part because of pictures and a video of his body that had been posted to Facebook on Wednesday.On Friday, the man who posted those images, Omega Mwaikambo, 43, was found guilty of \u201cmalicious communications offenses.\u201dBut a friend of Mr. Alhajali\u2019s, Abdulazz Almashi, said that it was only because another friend had shared the images with him that he was able to identify the victim to the police as Mr. Alhajali.Grenfell Tower is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, on behalf of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.Known by its initials, K.C.T.M.O., the group was formed in 1996 and manages nearly 10,000 properties, including several large tower blocks, underground parking lots and river vistas, on behalf of the borough, according to its website.Among the properties under its management is Adair Tower, a 14-story tower block that was set aflame in October 2015 in an arson attack.Several Grenfell Tower residents accused the K.C.T.M.O. of purposely neglecting their needs so that the building would eventually decay and have to be demolished, and of cutting corners in the refurbishment.The K.C.T.M.O. did not reply to a request for comment.\u201cTrust me, no one was fooled,\u201d she continued. \u201cOur neighbors called this. They knew it would happen and they tried to stop it, but no one listened because no one would profit from listening.\u201d\u201cIt is a truly terrifying thought but the Grenfell Action Group firmly believe that only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord, the K.C.T.M.O., and bring an end to the dangerous living conditions and neglect of health and safety legislation,\u201d the post read.The group also accused the management company of failing to provide proper fire safety instructions for its tenants apart from a temporary notice stuck to the elevator, telling residents to stay in their apartments in the event of a fire.Even after the building underwent the multimillion-dollar renovation, many of the health and safety concerns that had been voiced by residents in the past were not addressed. \u201cWhat did they do with that money? Buy some cheap shoddy inflammable materials and just pocket the rest?\u201d said Isobel Kirk, a Grenfell Tower resident, who was returning from work early Thursday when the fire broke out. She had to wait for over two hours watching the building burn down while her family was still inside. They were taken to a hospital and survived, but it was hours before she knew.\u201cYou would think they\u2019d at least build a second fire escape,\u201d she said. \u201cOne badly lit fire escape and one exit for hundreds of people. It\u2019s a death trap.\u201dReporting was contributed by Dan Bilefsky, Iliana Magra, Sewell Chan and Yonette Joseph.Advertisement"}

Artificial intelligence. No, I\u2019m not referring to your intellect, Farhad. I\u2019m making a quick segue into introducing our newest addition to the tech team, Cade Metz. He just joined us.O.K., that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m not a bot. I\u2019m just some hack who covers A.I. The truth is: A.I. is a long way from mimicking the behavior of a Times reporter. I hope.I have to say, I was really impressed with this whole exercise. I think tech companies have long been too reluctant to talk about the potential dangers of their technology. It\u2019s great that Facebook \u2014 after, of course, a lot of questions and prodding arising out of its role in the election \u2014 is taking these issues seriously. But Cade, you\u2019re our resident A.I. expert, so could you explain what exactly Facebook is doing, and whether it\u2019ll work?Some of the stuff they talk about, like identifying an image known to be related to terrorism, will work well. But other stuff, like the experimental system that seeks to identify online conversation and other natural language that points to terrorism, won\u2019t work really well for years. (Hint: experimental is a key word). That kind of thing requires A.I. that is still very much under development.The other key bit is where they say: \u201cA.I. can\u2019t catch everything.\u201d That\u2019s an understatement. When it comes to catching unwanted behavior on Facebook\u2014 whether it\u2019s someone planning an act of terrorism or spreading fake news \u2014 Zuckerberg and company still need help from real live humans who see this stuff as it happens. That means Facebook users who can flag questionable content with a click, and it means the many contractors hired to review what has been flagged and remove what needs to be removed. This is stuff is very hard, and it will continue to be very hard until A.I. gets a lot better.All that said, I agree with you, Farhad. Hard stuff should be taken seriously.In Thacker\u2019s case, he was among the researchers at Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Lab in the 1970s who built the Alto, the machine with the graphical user interface that spawned the Macs and the PCs and, eventually, the smartphones that are such a big part of our everyday lives. Plus, he helped design Ethernet, the networking technology that linked the Altos together \u2014 and now links all the machines in your office, not to mention the thousands of machines inside the giant data centers that feed all the internet apps you use.Think of it like this: When Steve Jobs died, he deserved avalanche of tributes that arrived from across the globe, and Thacker deserves much the same.These are huge changes. I\u2019m not sure if people who don\u2019t follow the tech industry get this \u2014 a few months ago, it was unimaginable that Kalanick, who has overwhelming control of the company, could ever be pressured to step away. And if Uber actually follows through on its plan to remake its culture, it will operate like a completely different company.But that\u2019s what makes me so skeptical of this plan. Can a $70 billion company really change so radically?To be honest, a lot of this seems to hinge on the personality of Travis, who is famously aggressive and obsessive. And while he\u2019s said he\u2019s taking time off right now, I do wonder whether that will hold true \u2014 especially since Uber is undergoing its most prolonged set of crises, um, ever.I think companywide DNA, instilled and fostered by the founders, is seriously difficult to change. Just ask Twitter.That said, we should give Uber a chance \u2014 just like it is giving peace a chance! \u2014 and see what the company looks like six months to a year from now.What Amazon is good at is building enormous supply chains and physical infrastructure (warehouses, trucks, planes, even drones) that provide ways of delivering goods to your door much quicker than competitors can. By the same token, Whole Foods puts more Amazon groceries closer to you. Those stores aren\u2019t just stores. They\u2019re part of the supply chain.Advertisement"}

Today\u2019s introduction comes to us from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles.Are they a public work of art? An eyesore? A statement about urban development? Or a marketing stunt? Three houses were painted bright pink last week on a residential corner near the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles. The top-to-bottom paint job, which includes driveways, windows and bushes, has become an instant Instagram hit as thousands have flocked to the neighborhood for selfies (and at least a couple of commercial shoots, including one woman modeling in a bathing suit.)For the pink homes, it seems to be working for him, though it has been a bit more of a headache for the architect, Matthew Rosenberg, who has spent much of the last week fielding complaints from nearby residents. Still, it hardly seems to be affecting the bottom line: Mr. Rosenberg said in an interview that there already was a waiting list for the apartments. He said he could not predict what the monthly rent would be and that four had been set aside as affordable housing units for low-income residents.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)As twilight fell in Los Angeles on Thursday, a crowd of fans dressed as Batman began to gather on the steps of City Hall.The caped crusaders, and the hundreds of civilians with them, were not there to take on the Joker, or to trade punches with Two-Face. But nonetheless, they were responding \u2014 if a bit preemptively \u2014 to a bat signal shining on the tower of city hall.Batman, of course, is from Gotham, a city more often associated with grim, gritty New York than with Los Angeles. Asked before the ceremony if his town was trying to poach the Dark Knight, Mayor Garcetti made a bold claim.\u201cBatman may hail from Gotham, but to us, he\u2019s a true Angeleno,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThe TV show starring Adam West was filmed almost entirely in and around Los Angeles \u2014 and I know I speak for generations of Angelenos when I say that growing up would not have been the same without the Caped Crusader.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Bodies of Several Sailors Are Found Aboard Damaged U.S. Destroyer", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported bySearch crews had to work their way through the extensive damage to the Fitzgerald\u2019s starboard side before they found the sailors, the Navy said. They were taken to a naval hospital in Yokosuka, Japan.The collision with the Philippines-registered cargo ship, the ACX Crystal, occurred about 60 miles off the coast at 2:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, at a time when most of the crew of the Fitzgerald would have been asleep. After the accident, the ship was escorted back to its base, in Yokosuka, Japan, where the search took place.At the ship\u2019s base, and elsewhere, relatives anxiously awaited news.The Fitzgerald\u2019s commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, and two other crew members were injured but conscious, the Navy said. An official with the Japanese Coast Guard, which is aiding the rescue effort, said one of the injured sailors sustained a head injury and was unable to walk.The shipping lane where the collision occurred is a congested one, with about 400 vessels passing through each day, the Japanese Coast Guard said. Three major accidents have been reported in the area in the last five years, including at least one fatality, said Masayuki Obara, a Coast Guard official.Mr. Obara said the Coast Guard was interviewing the crew of the Crystal to determine, among other things, whether negligent piloting by either side contributed to the collision.No injuries were reported on the Crystal, which was traveling up the Japanese coast.The Fitzgerald was about 64 miles south of Yokosuka when the Crystal rammed nose-first into the destroyer\u2019s starboard, or right, side, on a clear night.Photographs showed the side of the Fitzgerald caved in about a third of the way back. The Navy said the collision inflicted significant damage to the destroyer above and below the water line, flooding berths, a machinery area and the radio room. The Crystal, at 730 feet in length, is more than 200 feet longer than the Fitzgerald and, with its load of shipping containers, would weigh several times as much.The cause of the collision was unclear. Under international maritime rules, a vessel is supposed to give way to another one on its starboard side, and the damage indicates that the Crystal was to the Fitzgerald\u2019s starboard, and therefore had the right of way.But maritime experts cautioned that many other factors could have led to a crash. Marine traffic records show the Crystal made a series of sharp turns about 25 minutes before the collision, which in crowded seas could cause a cascade of maneuvers by other vessels.\u201cThose are very high-traffic-density areas near coastal waters,\u201d said Bill Doherty, a ship safety investigator and auditor with a long career of service on naval warships. \u201cWhen a big ship like that makes a drastic change in a high traffic area, that has to be explained.\u201dSean P. Tortora, a veteran merchant marine captain and consultant who said he had sailed through the area of the collision many times, said that evidence suggested the Fitzgerald was at fault.Captain Tortora described the collision as a \u201cT-bone\u201d in which the bow of the Crystal hit the starboard side of the Fitzgerald. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, the Fitzgerald should have given way and passed to the stern of the container ship,\u201d he said.He added that a common cause of collisions, at sea or on the simulators used for training, is a misjudgment of distance and speed on the part of a captain trying to cross in front of another vessel. \u201cThey think they can make it and they make a run for it,\u201d Captain Tortora said.Another possibility, Mr. Doherty said, is that one or both vessels were acting \u201cin extremis,\u201d or ahead of what appears to be an imminent collision. \u201cAt that point, both vessels are burdened, and then both vessels, by law, are required to immediately take the best action to aid to avert a collision,\u201d he said.Asked about Captain Tortora\u2019s comments, a Navy spokesman, Capt. Charles W. Brown, said it was premature to address the cause of the collision.\u201cAt this point our foremost concern is the search for the missing sailors and the well-being of the crew,\u201d he said.A former director of the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s office of marine safety, Marjorie Murtagh Cooke, said it could take a year or more to determine what happened.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what information was available to each of these vessels at the time,\u201d Ms. Cooke said. \u201cWas all of their equipment working? Was one vessel at anchor and the other moving? There are just so many facts that we don\u2019t have yet.\u201dThe Fitzgerald had recently participated in military exercises with two American aircraft carriers and ships from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, as that country\u2019s navy is known.The Crystal, chartered by Nippon Yusen, a Japanese shipping company, had about 20 Filipino crew members on board, the company said in a statement. The cargo ship was heading toward Tokyo at the time of the collision, after making a stop on Friday at Nagoya, Japan.Marc Tuell, who served as a personnel specialist on the Fitzgerald from 2010 to 2013, found it disturbing to watch the video of the damaged ship being towed to port in Japan.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty heart-wrenching, having walked those decks for three years,\u201d Mr. Tuell said. He retired from the Navy and lives in Deltona, Fla. \u201cHeaven forbid that those seven souls are lost.\u201dJonathan Soble and Motoko Rich reported from Tokyo, and Andy Newman from New York.

It\u2019s got these very closeted but very accepted forms of corruption.\u201dThe report focused in part on two billionaire property developers who have given millions of dollars to Australian politicians: Chau Chak Wing, an Australian citizen, and Huang Xiangmo, a resident who has applied for citizenship.Both men have denied that their generosity has anything to do with efforts to tilt Australian politics toward China.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said this week that he wants to put an end to some of this by banning donations from foreigners. The idea appears to have wide support even if it is a convenient bit of outrage for Mr. Turnbull given that more of money from Chinese donors is believed to go not to his party, but to Labor.The real question, though, according to some of the legal scholars we talked to, is: When will Australia go beyond cutting off foreigners, and shaming China, to create a more transparent political culture that forces all parties to disclose a wider range of giving, quickly, and to explain how the money they receive is spent?Further to the point, when democracies worldwide are facing toxic distrust and cynicism, when will elected leaders here and elsewhere do more to address public frustration with a political structure that looks rigged and wired up for those who have already acquired power and wealth?Now here are a few other items worth reading, some tied to Australia, some not \u2014 followed by a few recommendations from my trip to Melbourne._____________________________My final suggestion, drawn from a few more beers at Belleville with an old friend from San Francisco who now lives in Melbourne, is a 1999 documentary that captures the American working-class with humor and dignity.Here\u2019s a key passage from the review:\u201cThese may not be people whom moviegoers think they want to spend time with, but this is accomplished documentary making, finding universal lessons in determination, struggle, planning, persistence and the relationship of mind and body.

{"Headline": "At Last, Jeff Bezos Offers a Hint of His Philanthropic Plans", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported byInside WealthJeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, is well on his way to becoming the richest person in the world, with a net worth of more than $80 billion. What\u2019s less certain is what he plans to do with his fortune, and how he could reinvent philanthropy.Citing a homeless program in Seattle, Amazon\u2019s hometown, that the company is working with, he said he was seeking to help people \u201cat the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you have any ideas, just reply to this tweet...\u201dThe message was classic Bezos \u2014 challenging conventional wisdom, seeking the wisdom of the market and highlighting his various businesses. Yet it failed to answer a question that is likely to follow him more often if and when he becomes the richest man: What are his plans to give away some or all of his wealth?Mr. Bezos, who owns about 17 percent of Amazon, has enjoyed what could be the most rapid personal-wealth surge in history. As Amazon\u2019s share price has more than tripled since 2015, its leader has added more than $50 billion to his net worth, bringing his current total to nearly $83 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is now less than $7 billion shy of taking the title of the world\u2019s richest person from Bill Gates, who has held the crown for 18 of the past 23 years.Mr. Bezos\u2019 wealth is proof of Amazon\u2019s seemingly unstoppable growth and dominance in a wide range of fields, including online retailing and cloud computing. It adds another Horatio Alger story to the mythmaking machine of American wealth \u2014 showcasing someone from the middle class who was adopted by his Cuban-immigrant stepfather, quit his Wall Street job to start selling books online from his garage and created a company now worth nearly a half trillion dollars.Yet until Thursday, his philanthropy remained largely a mystery.Still, Mr. Bezos has never said publicly what he plans to do with his fortune, what causes he might support or even whether he will give away some or most of it.Mr. Bezos declined to comment for this article. His Twitter invitation on Thursday came after repeated questions on Wednesday from The Times about his giving levels and the lack of public information on his philanthropy. A spokesman declined to comment on whether the queries prompted the post.The Twitter post \u2014 while offering the most insight so far about his philanthropy thinking \u2014 did not commit to any funding levels or to creating a foundation or an L.L.C., as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and other billionaires have done.Experts on nonprofits and friends of Mr. Bezos say he has been more focused on building Amazon and would probably turn to philanthropy later. The more wealth he creates today, they said, the more he can give away later.\u201cI took the less safe path to follow my passion,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m proud of that choice.\u201dYet Mr. Bezos has so far refused the kind of charitable pledges common among billionaires today. The Bezoses\u2019 giving has largely been a family affair, with Mr. Bezos\u2019 role hard to determine. Nonprofit experts said the Bezos Family Foundation, while funded with Amazon stock, is mainly led by Mr. Bezos\u2019 mother. The foundation has given away tens of millions of dollars, mainly to causes related to child brain development and early education.And judging from his Twitter post and conversations with people who know Mr. Bezos, he wants to forge a new path for addressing social problems rather than just writing checks to nonprofits. His desire to get ideas from the public and fund \u201chere and now\u201d philanthropy suggests what could be a bold new direction for philanthropy.Mr. Bezos also sees for-profit ventures as a more effective way to solve certain social problems.\u201cIn many cases, for-profit models improve the world more than philanthropy models, if they can be made to work,\u201d he told Charlie Rose in 2010.\u201cWe know that he hasn\u2019t been very receptive to traditional philanthropy,\u201d said Steve Delfin, a Washington-area philanthropy adviser to companies and wealthy families. \u201cMy guess is that at some point, he will create an innovative new model or a hybrid approach.

{"Headline": "How Silicon Valley Pushed Coding Into American Classrooms", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byEducation DisruptedThe Apple chief\u2019s education mandate was just the latest tech company push for coding courses in schools. But even without Mr. Trump\u2019s support, Silicon Valley is already advancing that agenda \u2014 thanks largely to the marketing prowess of Code.org, an industry-backed nonprofit group.In our tech-driven world, Hadi Partovi argues, computer science has become as essential for students as reading, writing and math. \u201cEncryption is at least as foundational as photosynthesis,\u201d he said.Computer science is also essential to American tech companies, which have become heavily reliant on foreign engineers. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to limit immigration make Code.org\u2019s teach-Americans-to-code agenda even more attractive to the industry.Along the way, Code.org has emerged as a new prototype for Silicon Valley education reform: a social-media-savvy entity that pushes for education policy changes, develops curriculums, offers online coding lessons and trains teachers \u2014 touching nearly every facet of the education supply chain.Mr. Partovi, 44, said he simply wanted to give students the opportunity to develop the same skills that helped him and his backers succeed. He immigrated as a child to the United States from Iran with his family, went on to study computer science at Harvard, and later sold a voice-recognition start-up he had co-founded to Microsoft for a reported $800 million.\u201cThat dream is much less accessible if you are in one of America\u2019s schools where they don\u2019t even tell you you could go into that field,\u201d Mr. Partovi said.Even so, he acknowledged some industry self-interest. \u201cIf you are running a tech company,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s extremely hard to hire and retain engineers.\u201dCode.org is now one of the largest providers of free online coding lessons and more comprehensive computer science curriculums. It has also provided training workshops to more than 57,000 teachers, Mr. Partovi said.The rise of Code.org coincides with a larger tech-industry push to remake American primary and secondary schools with computers and learning apps, a market estimated to reach $21 billion by 2020.Then Mr. Partovi came along with the idea of using a viral video to spark mass demand for the courses.He began by persuading Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, to appear in a short film promoting coding to students. In its first week on YouTube, the video, called \u201cWhat Most Schools Don\u2019t Teach,\u201d racked up roughly nine million views. Within two weeks, Mr. Partovi said, about 20,000 teachers contacted him.Mr. Partovi compared Code.org\u2019s approach to those of start-ups like Airbnb and Uber. \u201cAirbnb is disrupting the travel space, but they don\u2019t own the hotels,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are in a similar model, disrupting education. But we are not running the school and we don\u2019t hire the teachers.\u201dMr. Partovi\u2019s elite connections didn\u2019t hurt.Mr. Partovi, for his part, was hoping to go viral with a message that coding could improve students\u2019 job prospects. Teaching skills that may lead to higher-paying jobs \u201cseems like the kind of idea that everyone in the country can get behind,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi promptly invited Mr. Smith over to preview his celebrity coders video.\u201cWe think computer science is to the 21st century what physics was to the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Smith said.But the movement has also supported legislation that could give companies enormous sway in public schools, starting with kindergarten, with little public awareness.\u201cIt gets very problematic when industry is deciding the content and direction of public education,\u201d said Jane Margolis, a senior researcher at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.The Idaho bill read, in part, \u201cIt is essential that efforts to increase computer science instruction, kindergarten through career, be driven by the needs of industry and be developed in partnership with industry.\u201dWhen a reporter apprised him of the bill\u2019s language, Mr. Smith of Microsoft seemed taken aback, saying he had not endorsed it. \u201cBroad public education should not be grounded first and foremost in the needs of any particular industry \u2014 or in the needs of industry as a whole,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi noted that Code.org had opposed a \u201cmore extreme\u201d coding bill in Florida that would have required students to obtain industry certification. It has also opposed bills that would allow coding courses to count toward foreign-language credits in high schools, he said. Still, Mr. Partovi added, \u201cWe do think that tech companies have a role to play.\u201dThe clout behind computer science has all but obviated a wider debate about whether, to better prepare students, schools might introduce an array of new subjects. It has also overshadowed discussion about whether students would be better off if schools modified traditional math classes to increase the emphasis on fields like statistics.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said that tech companies and philanthropists were simply trying to give voice to an overlooked subject. \u201cWhat we really need is a national conversation about the broad array of intellectual disciplines that will be fundamental to the future of American students,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a broad array, not a single subject.\u201dMr. Partovi concurred. \u201cWe have a lot of debate in this country about how to teach,\u201d he said, \u201cand not enough debate about what to teach.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s only the beginning.\u201dItalians vote on Sunday in the final round of municipal elections seen as a bellwether before national elections, and immigration is the issue that may determine races from this northern city on the Swiss border to the southern coast of Sicily.Italy has registered more than 70,000 migrants this year, 27 percent more than it did by this time in 2016, when a record 181,000 migrants arrived.Shoving has broken out in Parliament over the center-left government\u2019s proposal to extend citizenship to the children of migrants born on Italian soil.All over, parties and politicians are shifting to a tougher stance.Champions of a more welcoming approach to immigrants have not fared well.In Lampedusa, the Sicilian island that became the emblem of Italy\u2019s immigration issue after years of inundation by desperate migrants, the Democratic Party mayor had become an international symbol of Italy\u2019s open arms. She failed even to make it to Sunday\u2019s runoff.Here in Como, Sunday\u2019s election could well be determined by the debate over what to do with the hundreds of African migrants hoping to go north to Switzerland or Northern Europe for jobs.As seaplanes glided to dock and women in sun hats sipped aperitifs, scores of African migrants gathered, looking at the verdant mountains standing guard between the placid lake and Switzerland.\u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d said Fofana Abdoulaye, a 31-year-old migrant from the Ivory Coast, as he stood in the shadow of the city\u2019s landmark Volta Temple.While he and other migrants spoke of their appreciation of Italy\u2019s humanitarian efforts to save them from the Mediterranean Sea, they also expressed exhaustion with the country\u2019s intricate web of permits and papers and European agreements that required them to stay in the country that first documented them.But locals, too, were exasperated.\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible calling card for the city,\u201d Enrica Tattamanti, 65, said as she watched her granddaughter, Benedetta, play next to Lake Como.She worried that funds redirected to migrants deprived the town\u2019s handicapped citizens of services and complained that any protest prompted accusations of racism. \u201cI hope the center right wins,\u201d she said.Its candidate, Mr. Landriscina, argues for closing migrant reception centers and removing the migrants who he argued did not want to be here to begin with, to relieve mounting tension between Como\u2019s locals and immigrants who he said made no effort to integrate.\u201cIt\u2019s a problem where the conflict \u2014 a little bit ethnic, a little bit religious \u2014 risks creating tension,\u201d said Mr. Landriscina, who just finished a book about Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s time as mayor of New York.If elected, he said, he would go to Rome, which has jurisdiction over such issues, and appeal for a change.Mr. Landriscina arrived for the endorsement event at the Broletto, a medieval and elegantly arched building next to the cathedral, to the cheers of familiar right-wing politicians including Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the law-and-order Brothers of Italy party.At the event, Ms. Meloni, a member of Parliament, wasted no time bringing up her party\u2019s opposition to the government\u2019s proposal to extend citizenship to children born in Italy.\u201cWe believe Italian citizenship cannot be a concession or automatic,\u201d she said to applause. \u201cThey must earn it, ask it, and citizenship should be celebrated.\u201dIn an interview after the event, Ms. Meloni mocked the Five Star Movement for its belated hard line on immigration, saying it only followed opinion polls and believed in nothing.This was one of the rare areas where she and the leader of the Democratic Party, former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who considers Italian citizenship a civil right to those born here, agreed.Of the Five Star Movement\u2019s leader, Beppe Grillo, Mr. Renzi wrote on Facebook: \u201cGrillo got a big slap in the face in the local elections. So what do they invent? A nice attack on immigrants.\u201dBut Ms. Meloni had no problem with attacking the government\u2019s welcoming approach to immigrants. \u201cIt devastates the culture, devastates tourism, devastates security, devastates everything,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing good comes of it. Not even for the immigrants.\u201dAdvocates in Como worry that the adoption of such a hard line in City Hall would only create resentment.\u201cIt\u2019s a losing strategy,\u201d said the Rev. Giusto Della Valle, a priest who since 2011 has run a center on the outskirts of town where more than 50 migrants sleep at night.In the dining room where immigrants prepare and eat their dinners, he proudly pointed out the soccer trophy the refugees he hosts won in a tournament for National Refugee Day this month.He then gave a tour of the center, showing the room where a woman and her two small children had slept the previous night and in which 24 teenagers had slept until May.A learning center with outdated computers, the locker room with the locker doors warped from break-ins. He walked up the stairs and came upon three Nigerian women in the lobby.\u201cAfter school I can find a job in a restaurant,\u201d Sandra Obodo, 26, said as one friend braided her hair and another slept, recovering from a collapse brought on by stress.Ms. Obodo said she had crossed over from Libya nine months ago after escaping retribution murders at home. While her ship had made it to shore after a rough journey, she said, migrants on a boat that departed at the same time had been lost at sea. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d she said.Father Della Valle said Nigerian traffickers, headquartered nearby in Turin, promised many of the women jobs but then put them to work as prostitutes. He has kicked out of his center pimps who tried to recruit the women, but he said the local police cared only about potential radicals.The current center-left government had also struck down his proposals to turn abandoned buildings into more dignified centers, he added. (The center-left candidate in Como, Maurizio Traglio, declined to comment.)The issues roiling Italy touched many of the people in the center personally. In a small courtyard, Muhamed Delah Abillah, 31, spoke of his family\u2019s long search for work and stability since coming from Afghanistan more than a decade ago.His oldest child, Marzia, 8, was born in Italy, he said. \u201cShe has an Italian name,\u201d he said as she read an Italian magazine and chatted with her siblings in Italian. \u201cWe want her to be Italian.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attack Tests Movement Sanders Founded", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The most ardent supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders have long been outspoken about their anger toward Republicans \u2014 and in some cases toward Democrats. Their idol, the senator from Vermont, has called President Trump a \u201cdemagogue\u201d and said recently that he was \u201cperhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country.\u201dNow, in Mr. Sanders\u2019s world, his fans have something concrete to grapple with: James T. Hodgkinson, a former volunteer for Mr. Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, is suspected of opening fire on Republican lawmakers practicing baseball in Alexandria, Va.\u201cBoth sides need to look in the mirror,\u201d said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who campaigned for Mr. Sanders and is working on a new think tank started by the senator\u2019s wife. \u201cWe have to decide what kind of language we are going to use in our political discourse.\u201dMr. Sanders has advocated what he has called a peaceful political revolution. On Wednesday, he acknowledged that Mr. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., had been a volunteer on his campaign and said he was praying for the recovery of Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, and the other victims.\u201cI am sickened by this despicable act,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. \u201cLet me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society, and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values.\u201dHis most prominent followers said that blaming all of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters for the actions of one was akin to blaming all Muslims for the actions of the Islamic State.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me, not with this shooting and not with blaming an entire Black Lives Matter movement when a random black man shoots a police officer,\u201d said Shaun King, a columnist for The New York Daily News who campaigned for Mr. Sanders.He added that violence would not help move liberal policies forward: \u201cIf 20 Republican congressmen were shot and killed, it would not improve the chances of us having a better health care system. It\u2019s nonsensical.\u201dTo be sure, supporters of Mr. Trump, as well as Mr. Trump himself, have assailed opponents and the news media.But long before the shooting on Wednesday, some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters had earned a belligerent reputation for their criticism of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party and others who they believed disagreed with their ideas. Sanders fans, sometimes referred to derogatorily as \u201cBernie Bros\u201d or \u201cBernie Bots,\u201d at times harassed reporters covering Mr. Sanders and flooded social media with angry posts directed at the \u201ccorporate media,\u201d a term often used by the senator.The suspect in the shooting in Virginia put a new spotlight on the rage buried in some corners of the progressive left.Mr. Hodgkinson filled his Facebook page with photographs of the senator and quotes from his speeches. Mr. Hodgkinson also wrote messages filled with expletives directed at the president, and a post in March said: \u201cTrump is a traitor. Trump has destroyed our democracy. It\u2019s time to destroy Trump & co.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Hodgkinson posted a cartoon on Facebook explaining \u201cHow does a bill work?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s an easy one, Billy,\u201d the cartoon reads. \u201cCorporations write the bill and then bribe Congress until it becomes law.\u201dFive people were shot at a morning practice about five miles from the Capitol, the police said.\u201cThat\u2019s Exactly How It Works. ....\u201d Mr. Hodgkinson wrote.That is not far from Mr. Sanders\u2019s own message. On Saturday, during a conference in Chicago filled with Sanders supporters, he thundered, \u201cToday in the White House, we have perhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country,\u201d to cheers from thousands. \u201cAnd we also have, not to be forgotten, extreme right-wing leadership in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.\u201dAdam Lassila, 30, of Athens, Ga., who attended the conference, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump was justified and illustrated that the senator represented \u201cthe kind of politicians that we want in this society, those who describe things how they are actually happening and not speak around them in platitudes.\u201dFor conservatives, Wednesday\u2019s attack was a moment to say, \u201cEnough.\u201d In 2010, as the Tea Party movement rose, often with violent messages, Democratic lawmakers lamented the threats they faced. Republicans are feeling a similar lash as the left rises to confront a Republican president.Harlan Hill, a political consultant based in New York who supports Mr. Trump, said people should not blame Mr. Sanders personally, but he said the senator\u2019s description of the president as \u201cdangerous\u201d illustrated the \u201capocalyptic terms\u201d and \u201cmelodrama\u201d that have created a combustible political atmosphere.\u201cIt is a passive justification for the kind of violence we saw,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe that, and you\u2019re just casually using these words, then you should accept the consequence of those words because you are empowering the people that follow you to take whatever sort of action that they deem necessary to avert what is being described to them as a potential genocidal leader.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump was restrained in his remarks about the shooting, other figures on the political right let loose. Michael Savage, a radio host, wrote on Twitter, \u201cI warned America the Dems constant drumbeat of hatred would lead to violence!\u201d Bill Mitchell, a radio host who supports Mr. Trump, said on Twitter, \u201cThe Left in this country is ushering in a new #CultureOfViolence where violent hate is the new normal.\u201dRoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, a union that campaigned heavily for Mr. Sanders and continues to work with him, said some were hoping to discredit Mr. Sanders to slow down the continuing success of his brand of politics. She called it a \u201cboldface lie\u201d to connect the shooting to Mr. Sanders\u2019s push for opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals.\u201cHe\u2019s the most popular politician in America,\u201d Ms. DeMoro said of Mr. Sanders. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sit well with establishment Democrats or Republicans. They are trying to delegitimize and discredit anyone who is speaking out for a better society. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byTo the Editor:Judith Shapiro\u2019s review (June 18) of two recent books by Howard W. French (\u201cEverything Under the Heavens\u201d) and Graham Allison (\u201cDestined for War\u201d) uncritically reinforces two prevailing myths about modern China. Many Sinologists have labored for years to disabuse lay readers of the notion that contemporary China is a modern-day imperial dynasty bent on dominating Asia and beyond. But Shapiro (channeling French) buys into this delusion without any qualms.Similarly, many international relations specialists have incisively challenged Allison\u2019s flawed application of the so-called Thucydides\u2019s Trap to Sino-United States relations, yet Shapiro sees the argument as confirmation of French. The overall result is yet another simplistic affirmation of the \u201cChina threat\u201d thesis.The writer is a senior fellow in the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\u2666To the Editor:Judith Shapiro\u2019s adoring review of French\u2019s and Allison\u2019s new books on China\u2019s supposedly aggressive new role in the world is, I believe, misplaced. She clearly buys their similar arguments that China is locked on a path of redress for past humiliations by the West and to (once again) dominate East Asia, if not the world. This is a truly myopic view of Asian history. For much of its long history, China has been regionally divided, occasionally invaded by other (Asian and European) powers and, given its strong traditions of internal conflict, self-isolated from the rest of the world. It developed elaborate social customs that could be employed in lieu of destructive warfare.While we may agree that China represents a newly emerging force in Asia (it had no previous pretensions to the East or South China Sea), I believe its aims are primarily economic and materialistic, not political. (Certainly oil, of which the mainland has little, is of interest.) Nor do I believe China bears innate hostility toward the United States; it admires our economic and technological successes, which it seeks to emulate.If China and the United States conflict in the future, it will not be on any battlefield but rather for dominance in the world\u2019s commercial realm \u2014 which has a short memory.The writer is an adjunct lecturer in the geography department at Eastern Michigan University.\u2666To the Editor:Justin Vogt, in his review of \u201cRaven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government\u2019s Secret Plan to Save Itself \u2014 While the Rest of Us Die,\u201d by Garrett M. Graff (June 18), mentions George Stephanopoulos\u2019s nuclear emergency evacuation wallet card. This reminds me that as a teenager in the \u201960s, I asked my father why we were not building a fallout shelter in our suburban Virginia backyard as a lot of our neighbors were doing. My father, then a colonel in the Army serving at the Pentagon, walked me around to our carport and pointed to a sticker on the driver\u2019s side window of our station wagon. He said we would not need a private shelter because, in the event of a nuclear emergency, that sticker would allow him to drive our family on highways closed to our neighbors to a huge shelter for government and military officials only.These many years later I realize he was just trying his best to offer Cold War comfort to an anxious adolescent. He must have realized it was absurd to expect to survive that long privileged drive, exposed not only to nuclear fallout but also to attacks by outraged citizens denied access to those highways.\u2666To the Editor: Vogt\u2019s review gave me the eerie feeling of viewing my own long-past career. As a Canadian representative from the 1970s to the \u201990s on several national and NATO committees preparing for the unthinkable, I was struck by the unreality of much of our planning. Since the 1950s, Canada too had prepared bunkered headquarters outside Ottawa, although Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau (father of Justin) disdainfully declared he would stay put. Using these facilities, annual exercises were held with midlevel officials representing their principals. When these revealed the inadequacy of our plans, I was charged with making them workable ASAP. Since speed was of the essence, the work was entrusted to a select few government, military and industry hands-on experts. We intended to present the final plan to the prime minister and Privy Council on an \u201conly plan feasible\u201d basis.Unfortunately, or more truly fortunately, our work came to fruition just as Reagan and Gorbachev achieved peace and good will between the West and Russia, thus consigning my magnum opus to the classified waste bin of irrelevance.\u2666To the Editor:In his illuminating review of the new biography of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe by R\u00fcdiger Safranski (June 18), Michael Hofmann aptly describes the great German writer as seemingly \u201cboth imperturbable and invulnerable\u201d and \u201calmost clownishly omni-competent,\u201d all of which brings to mind Max Beerbohm\u2019s characteristically witty assessment of Goethe: \u201cBut a man whose career was glorious without intermission, decade after decade, does sorely try our patience.\u201dLetters may be edited for length and clarity.

{"Headline": "Planned Parenthood Battle Could Sway Fortunes of G.O.P. Health Bill", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe fight over one provision \u2014 to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood for a single year \u2014 may be tangential to the wider war over the American health care system. But with the Senate so narrowly divided, Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement could rest on the hot-button issue of abortion.Republicans can afford to lose only two votes when the final tally comes as soon as Thursday. Moderate Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have expressed deep misgivings over the Planned Parenthood provision, which would deprive the organization of more than 40 percent of its funding, jeopardizing health care for women in states like theirs. But restoring Medicaid reimbursements to the health organization could cost just as many votes on the right.\u201cThe expectations of the pro-life movement have been very clear: The health care bill must not indefinitely subsidize abortion and must redirect abortion giant Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer funding to community health centers,\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, and Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council, said in a joint statement Friday.But even if the defunding provision is for a single year, anti-abortion activists see a beachhead they must defend, then fight from.\u201cThat one-year mark is not going to pass quietly,\u201d said John Seago, legislative director at Texas Right to Life.Groups on both sides of the debate have lobbying operations in place and millions of dollars at their disposal for the final sprint.\u201cSometimes you have this phenomenon where everyone freaks out in the moment, signs a petition and then goes back to their everyday life,\u201d says Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing really high levels of retention and engagement.\u201dAnti-abortion groups are also gearing up for the Senate vote. Ms. Collins plans to amend the health care bill to restore Planned Parenthood funding, giving Democrats a conundrum: They may strongly favor supporting Planned Parenthood, but Democratic aides say senators must decide whether the bill has a better chance of passing with or without the defunding provision. If they think the Collins amendment would help final passage, they are likely to vote against it, ensuring its defeat.That would be fine for the anti-abortion forces.\u201cAs the Republicans start negotiating with the Democrats or with more moderate members, this is one of the hot-button topics that comes up that they try to negotiate away,\u201d Mr. Seago said. \u201cWe will keep pressure on the Texans in D.C. to ensure this isn\u2019t a bargaining chip to make sure this bill goes across the finishing line.\u201dKristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life of America, an anti-abortion group, toured 80 college campuses this spring, preparing for this moment.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait around. We can\u2019t afford to rest on our laurels,\u201d Ms. Hawkins said.The proposed legislation, which Planned Parenthood labels \u201cthe worst bill for women\u2019s health in a generation,\u201d would strip the organization of federal funding for one year and bar any federal tax credits from being used to help buy private health plans that cover abortions.With over 600 affiliate health centers across the country, Planned Parenthood serves 2.4 million people a year, three-quarters of whom have incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level.The election of Mr. Trump has in some ways helped the group\u2019s financial footing. Since November, contributions have poured in from big-name patrons such as Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, and smaller donors alike.A real-time count of every senator\u2019s position.\u201cWe basically have a pink army that we\u2019re able to deploy,\u201d said Paul Dillon, a spokesman at Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho.This activism has been teamed with contingency planning at some affiliates in the event that the legislative battle is lost.\u201cA lot of us across the country are doing that, shoring up of our business, being more efficient and looking for alternative funding,\u201d says Vicki Cowart, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, which serves about 100,000 patients a year across Colorado, southern Nevada, New Mexico and Wyoming.Affiliates, and even individual clinics, face a different threat level based on geography and politics.A Planned Parenthood center near Aspen, Colo., for example, receives generous funding from the affluent residents of the skiing community, Ms. Cowart explained. Two centers in Las Vegas just got part of a $1 million donation by the casino magnate Elaine Wynn.Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties in California sends both money and staff to other states in need of extra resources. And Planned Parenthood Southeast, which serves several Southern states, is now providing advice to teams elsewhere in the country on how to operate in an environment without generous government funding and local support.\u201cSo much of this threat is something that we\u2019ve been living with for decades already in the south,\u201d said Staci Fox, head of Planned Parenthood Southeast, which has seven health centers in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.But without federal assistance, such planning can go only so far. Remote centers serving poor patients without alternative health care providers have no fallback.After last year\u2019s election, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains decided to close six of its 29 health centers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Owner Is Angry His 20-Pound Lobster, Dinnah, Was Photographed by the T.S.A.", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byIn the final hours of his life last weekend, he was plucked from anonymity, nestled in darkness at the bottom of an insulated cooler and given a name: Dinnah, like how a Mainer might pronounce the last meal of the day. His fate was sealed, literally, with Dinnah placed at the bottom and a layer of smaller friends on top in the cooler, which was wrapped with duct tape.His owner, Christopher Stracuzza, a 32-year-old auto-body repairman from Savannah, Ga., wanted Dinnah, a hulking 20-pound American lobster, and another 20 pounds of more-modest crustaceans to reach their final destination peacefully. \u201cYou don\u2019t think a lobster gets stressed too?\u201d Mr. Stracuzza said.But the lobster\u2019s final journey, from a tank at a seafood market in Connecticut to a propane cooker in Savannah, was bumpy and controversial, and included a brush with internet celebrity. It started after Mr. Stracuzza checked in for a JetBlue flight from Boston back home on Sunday morning and placed the cooler on a conveyor belt for oversize checked luggage.According to officials with the Transportation Security Administration, agents at Logan International Airport in Boston conducted an initial screening of the container \u2014 marked \u201cLive Lobster!\u201d in black marker \u2014 but still had concerns. Agents removed the duct tape and opened the cooler to take a closer look.Lobsters and luggage are no strangers at the Boston airport. But for some reason, perhaps because T.S.A. officials were impressed by Dinnah\u2019s beefiness, a grinning agent held him by his prodigious pincers for a photo. It was shared on T.S.A. social media accounts and was soon the subject of many news stories.By the time Mr. Stracuzza got home on Sunday afternoon, Dinnah was a celebrity and Mr. Stracuzza was just confused why his cooler was wrapped in tape labeled T.S.A. His confusion became anger when he discovered Dinnah had been removed and placed back on top of the other lobsters.\u201cWould you want a 500 pound person sitting on top of you?\u201d Mr. Stracuzza said in a phone interview on Wednesday.Mr. Stracuzza did not have much time to dwell on Dinnah\u2019s repositioning because a group of friends were waiting at his house for a cookout: $700 worth of lobster, drawn salted butter and beer. But then a friend called him.\u201c\u2018Holy,\u2019\u201d his friend started the phone call, followed by an expletive, Mr. Stracuzza recounted. \u201c\u2018Your lobster is all over the internet.\u2019\u201dMr. Stracuzza\u2019s emotional state reached a new level: red-hot, steaming anger. \u201cJust because it was labeled \u2018live lobster\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean there could be a bomb in there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are dumb. They are like the dumbest people in the world.\u201d\u201cSeriously, nothing better to do?\u201d Ms. Feinman wrote. \u201cAnd who would be to blame when these lobsters show up with a claw broken off because the T.S.A. agent doesn\u2019t know how to properly handle a lobster? Do your job and leave our personal property alone.\u201dMichael McCarthy, a T.S.A. spokesman, said on Wednesday that agency officials had contacted Ms. Feinman to discuss the situation. \u201cWe share images through social media to provide helpful travel tips and to better inform the traveling public about T.S.A.\u2019s mission,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Back at the cookout on Sunday, Dinnah lived up to his name, joining the other lobsters on the outdoor cooker, providing tender chunks of meat for Mr. Stracuzza and his friends. They were splayed out on a table covered in newspaper, next to bowls of melted butter and cans of Bud Light.There was so much lobster meat on Sunday that side dishes were not even considered, Mr. Stracuzza said. With pounds of meat leftover, he turned Dinnah into surf and turf on Monday night. And on Tuesday night, Dinnah was tossed with macaroni and cheese. On Wednesday night, Dinnah took the form of the classic dish made famous near the waters where he lived: lobster rolls.Despite all the attention Dinnah received, Mr. Stracuzza said he is not crazy about colossal crustaceans. \u201cI am more of a one-and-a-half, two-pound lobster kind of guy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

This obligation included participation by Buddhist monks like him. \u201cMonks are also people,\u201d he added.Luon Sovath, 37, is the most prominent member of a group of monks who have become citizen journalists, monitoring political events and human rights conditions in Cambodia on social media. Their efforts are part of a growing campaign by Cambodians who are using the internet to get around the government\u2019s stranglehold on mass media and civic life.Facebook, news apps and political memes have allowed the monks and the country\u2019s nascent political opposition to connect directly with Cambodians who have scant access to independent news media.\u201cFacebook changed communication and politics, because whatever politicians did, we all knew,\u201d Luon Sovath said. \u201cGood or bad, we could know by Facebook. Previously, they just showed the good things on television. The violence against people, the land abuses, the forest clearances and the corruption they did not show on television.\u201dThe government of the ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party operates or has influence over all of the country\u2019s television stations; the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party has spent years trying to get a license to operate its own channel, without success.So those like Luon Sovath who wanted to bring greater transparency to Cambodia sought inexpensive and accessible ways to connect with people, many in poor villages, outside the government-controlled networks.\u201cThe Cambodian People\u2019s Party has many television stations and facilities already, so we are helping people who don\u2019t have anything, who are poor,\u201d Luon Sovath said.The monks\u2019 Election Day videos included descriptions of polling procedures, interviews with voters and exhortations for Cambodians to get out and vote. At one point during his broadcast, Luon Sovath was expelled from a polling station by police officers and threatened with legal action. Thousands of people viewed the encounter online, showing their support for the monk by posting emojis on his live stream.Previous elections for local officials have not generated much interest because the government\u2019s political machine has been so dominant that results were a foregone conclusion. But a newly formed opposition, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, performed well in the 2013 national parliamentary elections, setting off waves of street protests. Though the opposition has struggled since then to gain a political foothold, it is still believed to have significant support among voters.Meas Nee, a political researcher in Cambodia, said that in recent travels to rural areas of the country, he noticed a marked increase in villagers\u2019 willingness to chat and banter about politics in public, the type of open discourse that once made many people uncomfortable.\u201cThe people are eager to see change,\u201d Mr. Nee said, adding later, \u201cPeople are very engaged, and people are not feeling intimidated.\u201dUnusually large crowds gathered in Phnom Penh on Sunday afternoon to watch the votes be counted, and late in the day the National Election Committee announced that turnout had been a record 85.7 percent of 7.8 million registered voters.\u201cPeople are more enthusiastic, are more interested in observing the political process, and they wanted to witness the election,\u201d said Preap Kol, executive director of Transparency International Cambodia, an anti-corruption organization.By late Sunday night, the National Election Committee issued a statement on national television saying that only some of the results in 1,646 local races had been tallied, and that counting would continue on Monday.The official results are to be announced no later than June 25. Observers are watching the returns closely as an indicator of what to expect in national parliamentary elections scheduled for next year.Neou Vannarin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret Social Media Lives of Teenagers", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byIt is easy for parents to be left wondering, \u201cWhat were they thinking?\u201dOver the past few years, memes \u2014 usually images or videos with text often meant to be funny or sarcastic in nature \u2014 have become one of the most popular ways, along with photos and videos, that youth communicate on social media. While some of that communication can be positive, allowing teenagers to explore their own identity development and find a sense of belonging, it can also get teens in trouble.I\u2019ve spent nearly two decades working with teens on organization and time-management in the heart of the Silicon Valley, and many teen girls tell me they have a real Instagram account (\u201crinsta\u201d) for a wider audience and then keep a \u201cfinsta\u201d (friends-only or \u201cfake\u201d Instagram) for their closest friends.Many teens use shortened versions of their names or aliases for finsta accounts, which they often see as an opportunity to share a less edited, less filtered version of their lives. They might spend a lot of time trying to capture the perfect Instagram photo for the \u201crinsta,\u201d which reaches a wider general audience, while a finsta might reveal, as one high school sophomore girl declared, \u201cmy innermost thoughts.\u201d Like the teens in the Harvard Facebook group chat, those using finsta accounts can have a false sense of confidence to say and do things they might not want a wider audience to see.And because so much of today\u2019s teen social media use is rooted in a fear of getting caught, many teens have detoured their online activity to different ways of cloaked communication. Closed and secret Facebook groups are one way teens (and adults!) privatize communication to a select group \u2014 a closed group feels more private because it allows an administrator to approve new users and monitor content. Secret Facebook groups remain unsearchable, and members can only be added or invited by another member. Another trick is to use hidden apps like Calculator% and Calculator+ that look like regular calculators, but require users to enter their passcodes to reveal a back storage area containing private photos.Also popular with secretive teens are storage apps like Vaulty, which allows users to hide photos and videos, and also has a \u201cmug shot\u201d feature, which takes a photo of anyone who tries to access the app using an incorrect password. Vaulty\u2019s most clever trick? Users can create two passwords for one vault, with each password tied to specific levels of access. So, a parent who insists that a teen hand over the password still might be getting limited access. Some teens just hide apps within folders on their phones. Parents wondering if their children are hiding something might look for a cleared search history and an unexplainable spike in data usage as potential red flags.The ready availability of tools to hide teen social media use can be problematic, leading teens to overshare images, videos and commentary. But that privacy has long been proven to be unreliable, because information shared within a private group can be easily captured in a screenshot and shared with a wider audience. The notion of privacy online is only as reliable as teens\u2019 relationships with other users, and that combined with general privacy concerns provides little guarantee that online information will ever be kept secret. In the case of the Harvard students, administrators found out about images and messages shared within a private group chat, highlighting how easily information shared behind digital walls can quickly become more public.What would motivate such seemingly intelligent teens to behave so recklessly online? Many people \u2014 adults and kids alike \u2014 view likes, loves, comments and followers as a barometer for popularity, even within a smaller, closed group. Teens can quickly get caught up in the feedback loop, posting and sharing images and videos that they believe will gain the largest reaction. Over time, teens\u2019 own values may become convoluted within an online world of instantaneous feedback, and their behavior online can become based on their \u201call about the likes\u201d values rather than their real-life values.There is a very real biological basis for this behavior. The combination of social media pressure and an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that helps us rationalize decisions, control impulsivity and make judgments, can contribute to offensive online posts.Even though 86 percent of teens say they\u2019ve received general advice around online use from their parents, researchers at Common Sense Media found that 30 percent of teens who are online believe their parents know \u201ca little\u201d or \u201cnothing\u201d about what social media apps and sites they use. And yet, teens still say that their parents have the biggest influence on determining what is appropriate and inappropriate online.Some parents try to monitor their teen\u2019s social media use with apps of their own. Bark, an app that monitors accounts on 20 different social media platforms, along with iOS and Android texting and email accounts, alerts parents to potentially risky behavior. TeenSafe links teens\u2019 phones directly to their parents\u2019 phones, and allows full-fledged supervision of phone calls, emails, texts, social media use and geolocation. But such high-level monitoring runs the risk of breaching trust with teens at a crucial developmental time.Another option is to help young social media users realize that their online and real-life experiences are more intertwined than they may think. Parents might, for example, cite current events, like the Harvard episode, to remind them that nothing online is ever completely private and talk to them about the ways private information can become public. Using open-ended questions will help encourage children to identify and develop their own values and standards around appropriate online behavior. Helping them think through how they might react or behave in certain scenarios can give them the confidence to make better decisions under pressure. Because in the end, teens\u2019 online life choices can have real-world outcomes \u2013 as those students whose admittance at Harvard was rescinded learned the hard way.Advertisement"}

In particular, an Amazon presence in groceries might transform it from a company you shop at every once in a while to one you think about several times a week. This is not a novel idea: It was the key reason Walmart got into the grocery business in the 1980s, a move that accelerated its shift from a regional chain into the world\u2019s largest physical retailer.Yet if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, after years of watching Amazon, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time predicting future possibilities. He is instead consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer\u2019s eyes. The other thing to know about Mr. Bezos is that he is a committed experimentalist. His main way of deciding what Amazon should do next is to try stuff out, see what works, and do more of that.So the best way to think of this deal is to look at Whole Foods as a kind of guinea pig for Amazon \u2014 a pricey, organically sourced one, perhaps, but a guinea pig all the same.Amazon almost certainly doesn\u2019t know yet how exactly Whole Foods will fit into its long-term plans. You can expect it to make few dramatic changes to Whole Foods in the near future. Instead, Mr. Bezos and his team will most likely spend years meticulously analyzing and tinkering with how Whole Foods works. They will begin lots of experiments. When something works, they will do more of that, then more, and then even more. They may take over the world all the same \u2014 and, in the process, probably usher in big changes to large swaths of the economy, affecting everything from labor to urban planning \u2014 but they\u2019ll do it in ways we won\u2019t be able to predict now.\u201cI think they look at this as an opportunity to learn,\u201d said Venky Harinarayan, an early Amazon executive who later worked at Walmart, and who also ran a venture capital firm in which Mr. Bezos was a big investor. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for everyone \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone has figured out yet how to use a store to service online customers at massive scale. That\u2019s the experimental piece.\u201dIn this light, I suspect that the Whole Foods deal starts less with a strategic end-goal and more with this insight: Shopping for food is broken. Both the in-store experience and the many attempts at online delivery \u2014 from Webvan to Instacart to Amazon\u2019s own service, Amazon Fresh \u2014 have failed to create the sort of seamless buying experience we enjoy with nonfood e-commerce.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.But online grocery delivery also isn\u2019t so great. Delivery services tend to be far more expensive than in-store shopping, and it\u2019s still not quite painless: You have to order ahead of time, you often have to deal with last-minute substitutions, and the whole process is still quite labor-intensive and wasteful. (Ask me about the many pounds of ice-filled plastic bags I have to dispose of every time I shop at Amazon Fresh.)But wait a second, isn\u2019t $13.4 billion a lot for an experiment? Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u201cNo doubt it\u2019s a big deal; it\u2019s a large amount of money,\u201d Mr. Harinarayan said. But he also noted that Amazon is flying high.Advertisement"}

Closing arguments and the start of jury deliberations are scheduled for Monday.This week, prosecutors laid out their case against Officer Yanez, leaning heavily on Ms. Reynolds\u2019s eyewitness account, the Facebook footage and newly released images and audio from Officer Yanez\u2019s dashboard camera.He was going for his wallet, Ms. Reynolds testified, but was having trouble because of the seatbelt.Officer Yanez told jurors that he stopped Mr. Castile for a broken taillight, but that he was suspicious because he matched the description of a robbery suspect.Mr. Castile, who was licensed to carry a weapon, told Officer Yanez he had a gun after being pulled over. Officer Yanez responded \u2014 calmly at first, then more alarmed \u2014 that Mr. Castile should not \u201creach for it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pull it out!\u201d the officer shouted just before shooting seven times. In court, Officer Yanez testified that he saw Mr. Castile\u2019s gun before pulling the trigger.\u201cI was able to see the top of the slide and the back of the tab of the firearm, and that\u2019s when I engaged with Mr. Castile and shot him,\u201d Officer Yanez said on Friday.But prosecutors have expressed doubt about whether Officer Yanez ever saw the gun, which they believe was in Mr. Castile\u2019s pocket. They said Mr. Castile had gone beyond what the law required in telling the officer about his weapon and that Officer Yanez\u2019s subsequent commands were unclear.Prosecutors pressed one witness, an expert on the use of force hired by defense lawyers, about why Officer Yanez did not instruct Mr. Castile clearly to stop moving or put his hands up. Emanuel Kapelsohn, the witness, replied that \u201cofficers are not perfect. Many other commands would have been more perfect.\u201d But he said the shooting was justified.Defense lawyers have sought to paint Officer Yanez as a sympathetic figure, a Minnesota native who became the first in his family to graduate from college and who dreamed of becoming a police officer.Officer Yanez, who could be sentenced to 20 years in prison if convicted of manslaughter and two lesser charges, is among several American police officers facing juries this spring.Matt Furber reported from St. Paul, and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

But everyone has an idea about what lemon tart is supposed to taste like.\u2019\u201dLemon bars are the home cook\u2019s rendering of lemon tart, with a pressed-in crust and a simplified filling. But the desserts have the same appeal. Both pay homage to the lemon in the same way a piece of sushi pays homage to the fish: The other elements are there only to set off one perfect ingredient. The sugar balances the lemon\u2019s tartness, the butter smooths its acidic edges, and the flour mellows its intensity.For people who are mad for lemon desserts, like me, no lemon bar is truly bad. But some are better than others: the ones with golden-brown crusts, the ones with just the right proportion of soft filling to crunchy base, the ones with creamy fillings that taste brightly of fresh lemon. Like Beyonc\u00e9 and her backup dancers, the fierce, attention-grabbing filling should be supported by a crust that performs strongly on its own \u2014 and also does a brilliant job of making the star look good.In many traditional recipes, the filling is a thick lemon curd, a slow-cooked spread of eggs, lemons and butter. In other recipes, the filling is more like a custard, simply blended, poured onto a hot crust and baked.I\u2019ve made lemon bars both ways, and hoped to prove my suspicion: that in this case, the easiest route is also the best. (Let\u2019s call it kitchen wisdom, not confirmation bias.)I set out to forge a single recipe that could stand out at a picnic or potluck, and also sweep confidently into a dinner party in tart form.Lemon bars belong to the family of bar cookies: Along with brownies, pumpkin bars and dream bars, they are distinctly American sweets. Tarte au citron is one of the defining French desserts, and there are hardly any recipes more British than shortbread and lemon curd. Lemon chess pie, beloved in the South, has a similar flavor profile.Those fluffy white shavings are pretty, and they are the basis for canonical American desserts like coconut cream pie and German chocolate cake. But they also usually contain preservatives like propylene glycol and sulfites. Since I have an embarrassing number of half-empty bags of dried unsweetened coconut in the pantry, I took a stab at making my own all-natural version. Just stirring the shreds together with sugar failed, but a quick simmer in sugar syrup was a howling success.Coconut turned out to be the booster that lifts these lemon bars above the pack. A handful of sweetened coconut added to the crust gives it just the right fattiness to set off the sharp lemon, and helps keep the crust moist and crumbly. It allowed me to reduce the sugar in the crust to a mere quarter of a cup. And it accomplishes all this without adding any noticeable flavor of coconut.Every lemon bar filling is an attempt to transform lemon juice and sugar from liquid and grit into a unified, creamy fluff. To do this, some cooks simmer the ingredients together, which changes their flavors; others add thickeners like egg yolk, flour and cornstarch that can make filling dense and stiff. Baking powder is an uncommon addition but a fantastically effective one. Since baking powder is mostly baking soda (which reacts with the acidity of lemon) and cornstarch (which acts as a thickener), it is a multitasking ingredient here. Its leavening action puffs the filling, as it would puff a cake batter, adding air and softness.The other thing to consider is a matter of personal taste: how thick you like the layers to be.And she has a very specific vision for what perfectly baked items like pie crust, shortbread and cookies ought to look like: G.B.D., or Golden Brown Deliciousness. A browned crust, she said, shows that the flour and butter are cooked as they should be; a whitish crust, with undercooked ingredients, will have a raw taste and often a pasty texture.\u201cIt\u2019s the first thing you have to learn as a baker,\u201d she said. \u201cTo know G.B.D. when you see it.\u201dcookingcookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Our two anthems, played back-to-back in a state-owned theater, didn\u2019t elicit boos, as some of us had feared, but tearful cheers. The warm welcome we received from the citizens of a closed country, most of whom had never met an American, came along with a surprising openness to American culture. And this from a country we Americans continue to punish.The negative effects of turning back the clock on Cuba have been widely discussed over the past few months. Trade, agriculture, shipping, manufacturing and tourism will suffer, along with America\u2019s efforts to control illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Even United States national security could be hurt should America\u2019s presence be ceded to a less friendly nation.To these, we in the arts and education world would like to add our small but insistent voice.

It was made richer by personal encounters between American orchestra members and young Cuban musicians and their teachers, many of whom are immensely talented and driven despite economic hardship. Although our embargo and their own government has made everyday life a struggle, Cubans take justified pride in their arts, athletics, health care and education. The students with whom we worked at the national music schools soaked up everything we could give them and asked for more.One of these students was a 20-year-old clarinetist named Nieves.

{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Open Wound of Division", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 Many Greeks were surprised when a mild-mannered former prime minister who tried to use unity and consensus to lead the country out of an economic and political impasse was seriously injured by a parcel bomb last month.What followed was even worse: The attack was not greeted with unanimous condemnation, suggesting that Greece has a long way to go to heal divisions that were exacerbated by the economic crisis, that have shaped politics and that obstruct efforts to get Greece on its feet.As Lucas Papademos, 69, lay in a hospital, members of a self-proclaimed anti-establishment movement threw pamphlets onto the hospital grounds proclaiming, \u201cDie, Papademos, so we can celebrate.\u201d (There were no arrests; there seldom are when members of the burgeoning anti-establishment scene attack police with gasoline bombs, stage sit-ins or vandalize property.) A senior official of the Athens journalists\u2019 union wrote on Facebook that he would not be \u201cat all upset\u201d if the current governor of the central bank, Yannis Stournaras, were also the target of a bomb. When a prosecutor reportedly started an inquiry into the comment, a government member, Deputy Health Minister Pavlos Polakis, asked sarcastically on his Facebook page, \u201cWhere are the sensitive defenders of free speech now?\u201dMr. Papademos, currently president of the Academy of Athens, a highly respected research foundation and briefly prime minister while head of a multiparty coalition from November 2011 to May 2012, would seem an unlikely target for Greece\u2019s domestic terrorists. Despite the intensity of Greek politics, no prime minister or former prime minister had been targeted this way since two failed attempts on Eleftherios Venizelos in 1920 and 1933, when the national schism between the liberal republican statesman and royalists dominated politics.In a sense, though, Mr. Papademos was an unsurprising target. Educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he served as governor of the Bank of Greece and vice president of the European Central Bank. He was an unelected technocrat who brought together three of Greece\u2019s fractious parties in order to reach agreement with international creditors and keep Greece in the euro at a time when the country\u2019s membership in the common currency was in jeopardy. He was called on when the socialist Pasok government, which had signed the first bailout in 2010, reached a dead end, and a respected personality was needed to head a coalition \u2014 someone who could do the job without being a threat to the party leaders\u2019 own aspirations.Mr. Papademos drew the enmity of populists and nationalists from the left and extreme right who were opposed to the bailout\u2019s demands for austerity and reforms, who saw it as a loss of Greece\u2019s sovereignty. He embodied the country\u2019s elite, leading a government of mainstream parties at a time when rage at elites was at a crescendo. Both the left and the extreme right claimed that his government was a \u201cjunta,\u201d a highly charged accusation in a country where the last military dictatorship ended in 1974. The unity expressed in such accusations and insults presaged the coalition that the radical-left Syriza and right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks would forge in January 2015 \u2014 and that is still in power. As prime minister, Mr. Papademos was a magnet also for internet trolls.In a commentary in the newspaper Kathimerini after the attack on Mr. Papademos, the political scientist Nikos Marantzidis described the \u201cnew populism\u201d of the bailout era as combining all the divisions \u201cthat anyone can imagine: patriots and traitors, the corrupt and incorruptible, ideologues and sellouts.\u201d He added: \u201cSuch a level of verbal violence has not been seen since the restoration of democracy. Never were such extreme things said in Parliament or from official lips as in this period,\u201d and continued: \u201cWhen you call someone a quisling, a sellout, a fascist, a traitor, why wonder when some hothead takes things further?\u201dOn the day that Greece\u2019s president gave him the mandate to form a government, Mr. Papademos made a point of saying that he was not a politician, implying that he would focus on helping Greece without seeking personal power. \u201cThe course ahead will not be easy. But the problems, I\u2019m convinced, will be solved,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be solved faster, with a smaller cost and in an efficient way, if there is unity, agreement and prudence.\u201dIt may sound modest, but to call for unity, agreement and prudence in the context of Greece\u2019s politics is to set the bar very high. And a few months later, one of the coalition members, the center-right New Democracy Party, pushed for national elections.At the start of the Papademos administration, three-quarters of Greeks supported it, polls showed. Fewer people blamed the political system for the country\u2019s troubles than when the first bailout was signed (17 percent in November 2011, down from 21 percent in May 2010). But by May 2012, this had shot up to 29 percent, and it was clear the coalition members could not keep their government together, even with a majority of 255 in the 300-seat Parliament. Anger, disappointment and fear had given way to hope, but hope had given way to disappointment.Mr. Papademos\u2019s government had reinforced the prejudices of populists on the left and right, who claimed that foreign interests were trampling over Greece\u2019s democracy; at the same time, it failed to break the pattern of fraternal squabbles that have plagued Greece\u2019s politics from the start of the modern Greek state. Inconclusive elections in May 2012 saw Syriza become a major force; new elections in June 2012 resulted in a new coalition, led by New Democracy; the January 2015 elections saw the Syriza-led coalition under Alexis Tsipras come to power.Mr. Tsipras was relentless in his attacks on previous governments, including Mr. Papademos\u2019s. Now, as he struggles to meet conditions demanded by Greece\u2019s partners in the European Union and by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for more loans, Mr. Tsipras finds himself isolated \u2014 both from those he undermined in the past and from erstwhile allies who accuse him of wanting only to stay in power. This makes it more difficult to agree to creditors\u2019 demands, which, in turn, imposes further uncertainty on the economy and society. Without \u201cunity, agreement and prudence,\u201d the country\u2019s wounds remain open.No group has claimed the May 25 attack on Mr. Papademos, who remains hospitalized, his injuries clearly not as light as initially reported.Nikos Konstandaras, the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany vs. Twitter", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byHamburg, Germany \u2014 Heiko Maas may be about to learn where the road being paved with his good intentions will lead. A Social Democrat and the current federal justice minister, he has announced ambitious plans to rid the internet of abusive and offensive language. His plans have incited concern in the German offices of Twitter and Facebook and may ensure that he goes into history books as the politician who brought the curtain down on free speech on social media in Germany.Mr. Maas\u2019s plans, which center on legislation allowing legal actions against online insults, libel and sedition, take aim at several real problems, including a sharp increase in hate crimes against more than one million new migrants and refugees to Germany and the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d that, in his view, helped Donald Trump win the American election. And they come after his own failed attempt to get social media companies operating in Germany to agree to self-regulation. Despite promises by Facebook to crack down on harmful speech, Mr. Maas says Facebook still deletes only 39 percent of punishable content, and Twitter only 1 percent. After years of negotiations the minister, quite understandably, has run out of patience.One such account is called @einzelfallinfos \u2014 roughly, \u201cindividual case reports.\u201d The account\u2019s name mocks the mainstream narrative in Germany that crimes committed by refugees and migrants are \u201cindividual cases\u201d \u2014 something the account\u2019s operators clearly dispute. Instead, they see a \u201crecurring pattern\u201d of sexual assaults against women perpetrated by young men of mostly Arab origin. So they persistently post official police reports about, as they put it, \u201ccrimes committed by refugees, migrants, and presumed migrants.\u201dAs of May 15, the @einzelfallinfos account is no longer accessible in Germany. When I asked Twitter why it was being blocked, and how many other accounts are being blocked in Germany, a press officer said, \u201cWe do not comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons.\u201d What were these privacy and security reasons, I asked? \u201cLongstanding company policy \u2014 nothing further to add.\u201dOf course, as a private company, Twitter isn\u2019t obliged to give any reasons for blocking users from its platform. In theory, it could do so because it doesn\u2019t like someone\u2019s face. But for a business that thrives on giving a voice to as many people as possible, such arbitrariness and opacity may be self-defeating.Though narrower than in the United States, freedom of speech in postwar Germany has been broadly interpreted by the courts. In 2009, the Constitutional Court, Germany\u2019s highest legal body, ruled that disseminating radical-right-wing and Nazi views is not per se unconstitutional. On the contrary, the judges ruled that the Constitution \u201crelies on the power of free confrontation as the most effective weapon\u201d against \u201ctotalitarian and inhuman ideologies.\u201dTwitter is less sure. Faced with the threat of being held responsible for offensive and illegal content, the company instead relies on the power of the algorithm. In March, the service announced that it had updated its software to restrict accounts that engage in \u201cabusive behavior.\u201d We don\u2019t know how Twitter reaches these decisions, because it doesn\u2019t disclose the process.One possibility is that after an account attracts a certain number of complaints, algorithms intervene to silence it. That\u2019s bad news for Twitter, as users are likely to flock to alternative platforms like gab.ai. And it\u2019s bad for the rest of us, because it creates yet another bubble in our already filtered public discourse.The truth about free speech in Germany is that its limits depend heavily on context, in ways that are far too complex for any algorithm to sort out, let alone to discern \u201cobvious illegality.\u201d An utterance that is punishable as an insult in a normal exchange can be perfectly legitimate if done in a satirical context.So what is Twitter supposed to do when caught between its users\u2019 interests in a broad debate and an ambitious leftist minister with ideological guidelines that, if in doubt, rule against free speech?Rather than pull up the drawbridge, or fall back on algorithms, Twitter should hire a corps of well-trained personnel to deal with hundreds of thousands of contested cases. There will always be public courts to turn to as a last resort. But if Twitter wants to maintain its unique position as a leading marketplace for opinions and ideas, it needs to invest in the personnel to keep it there. Only then can it offer the most orderly and open debate possible.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lacking Entries, Essay Contest for a Catskills Cabin Is Halted", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported by360 ViewFor a winner to have been chosen, 5,500 people would have had to enter, according to contest rules, a threshold that would have delivered to the organizers around $820,000 for the two-bedroom cabin, set on five and a half acres of lakefront property in Bethel, N.Y., about two hours north of New York City.But the contest attracted only a fraction of that target, so each entrant will receive a $100 refund by July 15. The organizers, Andrew Bares and Kelly Lavorgna, a couple who live in New Jersey, will keep each entrant\u2019s $49 administrative fee, for a total of around $29,400. The results, or lack thereof, were announced on the contest website on May 30.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d said Ms. Lavorgna, 57. \u201cYou want somebody to be the winner.\u201dMr. Bares and Ms. Lavorgna set up the contest after unsuccessfully listing the house on the market twice. They had hoped it would allow them to get closer to the price they sought, even after no prospective buyer would meet it. If the contest had succeeded, they planned on repackaging and selling the contest platform to other homeowners seeking to rid themselves of challenging properties.The outcome throws both visions into doubt, and exposes the risks inherent in such contests. If they go awry, organizers can expect not only a failed sales plan, but a backlash, too.\u201cWe were looking at doing this as a business model,\u201d said Mr. Bares, 43, who bought the land in 2007 for around $750,000, and spent another $350,000 building the cabin, which has a three-car garage beneath it.Some entrants expressed frustration with the contest, particularly the rule that allowed the organizers to keep the $49 administrative fee. \u201cIt is funny that all of that risk gets shifted over to the people who entered,\u201d said Casey Cornwell, 40, a financial consultant and contestant who lives in San Francisco.Even with the administrative fee, Mr. Bares and Ms. Lavorgna said, they stand to lose around $20,000. And they still own the house. \u201cI understand people don\u2019t know us, they don\u2019t know our intent,\u201d Mr. Bares said. \u201cOur intent was always to sell the house.\u201dOn social media, some people doubted the contest\u2019s legitimacy. \u201cWill you be announcing the winner or is this a ploy for free advertising,\u201d Karen Wrenn posted on Facebook.Another user responded, \u201cBet no one won.\u201dMs. Wrenn, 62, a retired teacher who lives in Wilmington, N.C., said that the contest appeared on her Facebook feed one day and reminded her of the telephone scams designed to target older people, so she steered clear. \u201cWhen I saw that house, I had to write something about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is legit.\u201dBut others did enter, like Henry Chamberlain, 54, a cartoonist who lives in Seattle. \u201cI got caught up in the fantasy,\u201d he said. He wrote an essay about how he wanted a quiet retreat and an inheritance to leave to his daughter, who is 21.Mr. Bares and Ms. Lavorgna shut down the contest\u2019s social media accounts on May 30 and sent emails to contestants explaining the outcome and their refund policy. But some, including Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Cornwell, did not receive that first email and only learned of the results from a reporter. They both received the email when it was resent on June 5. The muddled messaging struck Mr. Chamberlain as disorganized. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to play with people\u2019s dreams, you need to find a way to do them the courtesy of getting things in order,\u201d he said.Now, Mr. Bares and Ms. Lavorgna are asking themselves why so few people participated. Perhaps the guidelines were too strict, or maybe the taxes gave people pause; property taxes run around $11,000 a year, and a winner would have had to pay substantial income taxes.Sara F. Hawkins, a lawyer who represents the couple, suspects that it might just be hard to draw people to a region without a national reputation. \u201cI think it would be different if we were giving away an apartment in New York City,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Largely because of Israel, the Jewish state, which today\u2019s progressives see only as a vehicle for oppression of the Palestinians \u2014 no matter that Israel has repeatedly sought to meet Palestinian claims with peaceful compromise, and no matter that progressives hold no other country to the same standard. China may brutalize Buddhists in Tibet and Muslims in Xinjiang, while denying basic rights to the rest of its 1.3 billion citizens, but \u201cwoke\u201d activists pushing intersectionality keep mum on all that.She isn\u2019t. Because though intersectionality cloaks itself in the garb of humanism, it takes a Manichaean view of life in which there can only be oppressors and oppressed. To be a Jewish dyke, let alone one who deigns to support Israel, is a categorical impossibility, oppressor and oppressed in the same person.\u201cI wanted to be in public as a gay Jew of Persian and German heritage. Nothing more, nothing less. So I made a shirt that said \u2018Proud Jewish Dyke\u2019 and hoisted a big Jewish Pride flag \u2014 a rainbow flag with a Star of David in the center, the centuries-old symbol of the Jewish people,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDuring the picnic in the park, organizers in their official t-shirts began whispering and pointing at me and soon, a delegation came over, announcing they\u2019d been sent by the organizers. They told me my choices were to roll up my Jewish Pride flag or leave. The Star of David makes it look too much like the Israeli flag, they said, and it triggers people and makes them feel unsafe. This was their complaint.\u201dShe tried to explain that the star is the \u201cubiquitous symbol of Judaism,\u201d and that she simply wanted \u201cto be Jewish in public.\u201d Then, she \u201ctried using their language,\u201d explaining \u201cthis is my intersection. I\u2019m supposed to be able to celebrate it here.\u201dIt didn\u2019t work. Ms. Shoshany Anderson left sobbing. \u201cI was thrown out of Dyke March for being Jewish,\u201d she said. Just so.For progressive American Jews, intersectionality forces a choice: Which side of your identity do you keep, and which side do you discard and revile? Do you side with the oppressed or with the oppressor?That kind of choice would have been familiar to previous generations of left-wing Jews, particularly those in Europe, who felt the tug between their ethnic heritage and their \u201cinternationalist\u201d ideological sympathies. But this is the United States. Here, progressives are supposed to be comfortable with the idea of hyphenated identities and overlapping ethnic, sexual and political affinities. Since when did a politics that celebrates choice \u2014 and choices \u2014 devolve into a requirement of being forced to choose?Jews on the left, particularly in recent years, have attempted to square this growing discomfort by becoming more anti-Israel. But if history has taught the Jews anything it\u2019s that this kind of contortion never ends well.It may be wrong to read too much into an ugly incident at a single march, but Jews should take what happened in Chicago as a lesson that they might not be as welcome among progressives as they might imagine. That\u2019s a warning for which to be grateful, even as it is a reminder that anti-Semitism remains as much a problem on the far-left as it is on the alt-right.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japanese Airline Apologizes After Disabled Man Crawls Aboard", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 A Japanese airline has apologized to a disabled rights activist, who is partly paralyzed, after it tried to prevent him from boarding a flight at a remote airport, prompting him to crawl up a portable boarding staircase to reach the plane\u2019s cabin.The airline, Vanilla Air, a budget affiliate of Japan\u2019s largest carrier, All Nippon Airlines, said it offered the apology earlier this month in response to the incident, which occurred on June 3. The episode drew public attention this week \u2014 including outrage against the airline, but also criticism of the activist \u2014 after reports surfaced in the Japanese news media.The activist, Hideto Kijima, said Vanilla Air staff initially told him he would not be allowed to board the small aircraft, which was flying from a small airport on the southern island of Amami to Mr. Kijima\u2019s home in Osaka, because it lacked wheelchair-accessible boarding ramps or elevators.Mr. Kijima was paralyzed from the waist down while playing rugby as a teenager and now uses a wheelchair.Angry at the airline\u2019s decision, and worried that he would be stuck on the island, Mr. Kijima decided to board anyway, he wrote on his blog.He was visiting the island with a group of friends, and they offered to carry him up the short stairway from the tarmac, he said. But the airline told them that would violate safety regulations.So he started crawling.\u201cI sat down on the stairs and started climbing up one at a time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe staff told me to stop but I ignored them. How else was I supposed to get back to Osaka?\u201dHe was allowed to take a seat once he reached the top, he said.Mr. Kijima has a long history of campaigning for access to public spaces for the disabled. He challenged All Nippon Airlines after a similar incident in 2002, in which he was told he could not board a flight because the gate lacked wheelchair access.Japan was long seen as trailing the West in infrastructure and legal rights for the disabled, though experts say that gap has mostly closed in recent years. Some advocates have called for renewed efforts to remove barriers before the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo in 2020.In a telephone interview, Mr. Kijima said he had traveled to dozens of countries and, except in Japan, had never been told he could not board a plane.\u201cThey always find a way,\u201d he said.Mr. Kijima said he had received messages of support on social media, but also a distressing flood of criticism, including more than 100 messages on his Facebook page accusing him of unfairly targeting the airline or making unreasonable demands.One Facebook user called him a \u201cflying claimer\u201d \u2014 using a word, claimer, adopted from English to mean someone who regularly makes nuisance complaints.\u201cI was surprised how many people didn\u2019t see this as an issue of basic human rights,\u201d Mr. Kijima said.Hirotada Ototake, a well-known author who was born without arms or legs because of a genetic disorder called tetra-amelia syndrome, defended Mr. Kijima\u2019s actions. He pointed out that airlines are legally obliged to ensure disabled travelers can board flights.\u201cSure, if traveling smoothly was his only priority, he could have found another airline,\u201d Mr. Ototake wrote on his blog. \u201cBut then Vanilla would still be breaking the law.\u201dA spokesman for Vanilla Air, Akihiro Ishikawa, said the airline had ordered an electric wheelchair lift for its planes on Amami after the incident. The lift went into service on Thursday, Mr. Ishikawa said.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Fails E.U. Standard on Removing Hate Speech Online", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byTwitter has failed to meet European standards for removing hate speech online, figures to be published Thursday show, as pressure mounts, particularly on the Continent, for tech companies to do more to tackle such harmful material.The battle between European policy makers and tech companies over what should be permitted online has pitted freedom of speech campaigners against those who say hate speech \u2014 in whatever form \u2014 has no place on the internet.In this standoff, European officials have called on Silicon Valley companies to take down at least 50 percent of the hate speech from their services once they are notified, and they signed up the likes of Twitter, Facebook and Google to a voluntary code of conduct last year to combat the rising tide of harmful content online.But findings to be published by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, show that Twitter removed hate speech from its network less than 40 percent of the time after such content had been flagged to the company.While the social network failed to meet the European standard, it has improved significantly from a study published late last year, which found that it removed a mere 19 percent of hate speech when notified.Google and Facebook, by contrast, now comply with the region\u2019s demands to take down at least 50 percent of hate speech, upon notification, according to the study.\u201cWe embarked in this process together, determined to bring about real changes for people who suffer from hatred and violence online,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European commissioner of justice, consumers and gender equality, said in a statement on Wednesday before the report\u2019s publication. \u201cThe code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online has delivered significant progress.\u201dIn response, Twitter said it had invested in new reporting procedures to allow individuals to flag probable hate speech, and it was striving to balance people\u2019s right to freedom of expression with the need to police material on its network.\u201cOur work will never be \u2018done,\u2019\u201d Karen White, Twitter\u2019s head of public policy in Europe, said in a statement.Google and Facebook also said they had made it easier for organizations and individuals to report hate speech and they were continuing to invest to tackle such material across the region and elsewhere.The European findings were based on about 2,500 potential instances of hate speech recorded by 34 nongovernmental organizations in 24 of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states. These groups notified the tech companies of the possible abuse and recorded how the companies responded. The study was conducted over seven weeks through May 5.Fifty-nine percent of the material flagged by these nongovernmental groups was removed by tech companies, according to the report. Just over 50 percent of the notifications were assessed by tech companies within the first 24 hours.While the Pan-European findings were greeted with praise by Ms. Jourova, policy makers in several countries have said that they will take more action against Silicon Valley companies if they do not go further in tackling hate speech online.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dutch Have Solutions to Rising Seas. The World Is Watching.", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands \u2014 The wind over the canal stirred up whitecaps and rattled cafe umbrellas. Rowers strained toward a finish line and spectators hugged the shore. Henk Ovink, hawkish, wiry, head shaved, watched from a V.I.P. deck, one eye on the boats, the other, as usual, on his phone.Mr. Ovink is the country\u2019s globe-trotting salesman in chief for Dutch expertise on rising water and climate change. Like cheese in France or cars in Germany, climate change is a business in the Netherlands. Month in, month out, delegations from as far away as Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New York and New Orleans make the rounds in the port city of Rotterdam. They often end up hiring Dutch firms, which dominate the global market in high-tech engineering and water management.That\u2019s because from the first moment settlers in this small nation started pumping water to clear land for farms and houses, water has been the central, existential fact of life in the Netherlands, a daily matter of survival and national identity. No place in Europe is under greater threat than this waterlogged country on the edge of the Continent. Much of the nation sits below sea level and is gradually sinking. Now climate change brings the prospect of rising tides and fiercer storms.Area of Rotterdam below sea level Eendragtspolder rowing course\u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u201310DELFTSchiebroekse parkSCHIEDAMCAPELLE AAN DEN IJSSELKralingsepark lakeResidentialIndustrialROTTERDAMErasmus University Rotterdam90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.ErasmusMedical CenterFeyenoordStadiumRotterdam AhoyConvention CenterPernisserparkRIDDERKERKRHOON BARENDRECHT1 mileArea of Rotterdam below sea level \u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u201310DELFTEendragtspolder rowing course1 mileSchiebroekse parkSCHIEDAMCAPELLE AAN DEN IJSSELKralingsepark lakeResidentialIndustrialROTTERDAMErasmus University Rotterdam90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.ErasmusMedical CenterFeyenoordStadiumRotterdam AhoyConvention CenterPernisserparkRIDDERKERKRHOON BARENDRECHTArea of Rotterdam below sea level \u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u201310EendragtspolderDELFTResidentialIndustrialCAPELLE AAN DEN IJSSELROTTERDAM90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.RIDDERKERKBARENDRECHTRHOON 1 mileArea of Rotterdam below sea level \u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u2013101 mileROTTERDAM90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.ResidentialIndustrialArea of Rotterdam below sea level Eendragtspolder rowing course\u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u201310DELFTSchiebroekse parkCAPELLE AAN DEN IJSSELSCHIEDAMKralingsepark lakeROTTERDAMResidentialIndustrialErasmus University RotterdamErasmusMedical Center90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.FeyenoordStadiumRotterdam AhoyConvention CenterPernisserparkRIDDERKERKRHOON BARENDRECHT1 mileArea of Rotterdam below sea level \u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u2013101 mileROTTERDAM90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.ResidentialIndustrialFrom a Dutch mind-set, climate change is not a hypothetical or a drag on the economy, but an opportunity. While the Trump administration withdraws from the Paris accord, the Dutch are pioneering a singular way forward.How climate change is challenging the world\u2019s urban centers.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.It is, in essence, to let water in, where possible, not hope to subdue Mother Nature: to live with the water, rather than struggle to defeat it. The Dutch devise lakes, garages, parks and plazas that are a boon to daily life but also double as enormous reservoirs for when the seas and rivers spill over. You may wish to pretend that rising seas are a hoax perpetrated by scientists and a gullible news media. Or you can build barriers galore. But in the end, neither will provide adequate defense, the Dutch say.And what holds true for managing climate change applies to the social fabric, too. Environmental and social resilience should go hand in hand, officials here believe, improving neighborhoods, spreading equity and taming water during catastrophes. Climate adaptation, if addressed head-on and properly, ought to yield a stronger, richer state.This is the message the Dutch have been taking out into the world. Dutch consultants advising the Bangladeshi authorities about emergency shelters and evacuation routes recently helped reduce the numbers of deaths suffered in recent floods to \u201chundreds instead of thousands,\u201d according to Mr. Ovink.\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can say we are marketing our expertise, but thousands of people die every year because of rising water, and the world is failing collectively to deal with the crisis, losing money and lives.\u201d He ticks off the latest findings: 2016 was the warmest year on record; global sea levels rose to new highs.He proudly shows off the new rowing course just outside Rotterdam, where the World Rowing Championships were staged last summer. The course forms part of an area called the Eendragtspolder, a 22-acre patchwork of reclaimed fields and canals \u2014 a prime example of a site built as a public amenity that collects floodwater in emergencies. It is near the lowest point in the Netherlands, about 20 feet below sea level. With its bike paths and water sports, the Eendragtspolder has become a popular retreat. Now it also serves as a reservoir for the Rotte River Basin when the nearby Rhine overflows, which, because of climate change, it\u2019s expected to do every decade.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.The project is among dozens in a nationwide program, years in the making, called Room for the River, which overturned centuries-old strategies of seizing territory from rivers and canals to build dams and dikes. The Netherlands effectively occupies the gutter of Europe, a lowlands bounded on one end by the North Sea, into which immense rivers like the Rhine and the Meuse flow from Germany, Belgium and France. Dutch thinking changed after floods forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate during the 1990s. The floods \u201cwere a wake-up call to give back to the rivers some of the room we had taken,\u201d as Harold van Waveren, a senior government adviser, recently explained.\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep building higher levees, because we will end up living behind 10-meter walls,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to give the rivers more places to flow. Protection against climate change is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain, and the chain in our case includes not just the big gates and dams at the sea but a whole philosophy of spatial planning, crisis management, children\u2019s education, online apps and public spaces.\u201dMr. van Waveren was talking about a national GPS-guided app created so that residents always know exactly how far below sea level they are. To use public pools unrestricted, Dutch children must first earn diplomas that require swimming in their clothes and shoes. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic part of our culture, like riding a bike,\u201d Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch architect, told me.In the Netherlands, scholarly articles about changes to the Arctic ice cap make front-page headlines. Long before climate change deniers began to campaign against science in the United States, Dutch engineers were preparing for apocalyptic, once-every-10,000-years storms. \u201cFor us, climate change is beyond ideology,\u201d said Rotterdam\u2019s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb. He took me one morning around new waterfront development in a formerly poor, industrial neighborhood, to show how urban renewal dovetails with strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change.\u201cIf there is a shooting in a bar, I am asked a million questions,\u201d Mr. Aboutaleb said of his city. \u201cBut if I say everyone should own a boat because we predict a tremendous increase in the intensity of rain, nobody questions the politics. Rotterdam lies in the most vulnerable part of the Netherlands, both economically and geographically. If the water comes in, from the rivers or the sea, we can evacuate maybe 15 out of 100 people. So evacuation isn\u2019t an option. We can escape only into high buildings. We have no choice. We must learn to live with water.\u201dA Moroccan-born Muslim and a rising star in the Dutch political world who denounces religious radicals and reactionary nationalists alike, the mayor runs a traditionally tough, working-class city. Rotterdam today is anything but a paradise. It is riven by social fissures and discord over immigration. But it has begun to improve in recent years as it has become greener and more diverse. When asked about climate threats, the mayor talks about creating a less divided, more attractive, healthier city \u2014 more capable of facing the stresses climate change imposes on society.\u201cThat\u2019s just common sense,\u201d Mr. Aboutaleb said. The Eendragtspolder is one example, he pointed out, repaying Rotterdam\u2019s investment with green spaces and the rowing course, which has the added perk of aiding a prospective Dutch bid for the 2028 Olympics.Leveled by bombs during World War II, Rotterdam is not quaint and touristic like Amsterdam but industrial, down to earth, a surprisingly stylish sleeper among Europe\u2019s cultural hubs, with a legacy of radical architecture, attracting young designers and entrepreneurs. Its tradition of openness has made it a magnet for outsiders and helped it recover from years of hardship, when, during the 1970s, \u201980s and \u201990s, it became notoriously crime-ridden and filthy, a place wealthy people fled.Lately the city, accustomed to starting over, has reinvented itself as a capital of enterprise and environmental ingenuity. It has pioneered the construction of facilities like those parking garages that become emergency reservoirs, ensuring that the city can prevent sewage overflow from storms now predicted to happen every five or 10 years. It has installed plazas with fountains, gardens and basketball courts in underserved neighborhoods that can act as retention ponds. It has reimagined its harbors and stretches of its formerly industrial waterfront as incubators for new businesses, schools, housing and parks.These are all stops on the standard tour for visiting foreign delegations: proof-of-concept urban interventions, if not actually all-encompassing solutions, that address climate threats in ways that incrementally serve the economy and social needs.\u201cA smart city has to have a comprehensive, holistic vision beyond levees and gates,\u201d as Arnoud Molenaar, the city\u2019s climate chief, put it. \u201cThe challenge of climate adaptation is to include safety, sewers, housing, roads, emergency services. You need public awareness. You also need cyber-resilience, because the next challenge in climate safety is cybersafety. You can\u2019t have vulnerable systems that control your sea gates and bridges and sewers. And you need good policies, big and small.\u201cThis starts with little things, like getting people to remove the concrete pavement from their gardens so the soil underneath absorbs rainwater,\u201d Mr. Molenaar said. \u201cIt ends with the giant storm surge barrier at the North Sea.\u201dThat would be the Maeslantkering, built near the mouth of the sea, about a half-hour drive west from downtown Rotterdam \u2014 the city\u2019s first line of defense. It is the size of two tubular Eiffel Towers, toppled over.In the 20 years since it opened, the Maeslantkering hasn\u2019t actually been needed to prevent a flood, but it is tested regularly just in case. Picnickers line the shore to watch. The trial closings are a little like the Dutch version of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade.I drove with Mr. van Waveren to see it one day. It is not uncommon here to witness the astonishing sight of ships cruising by overhead. This happens in a country where the highways are frequently below sea level.The Maeslantkering is a consequence of repeated historic calamities. In 1916, the North Sea overwhelmed the Dutch coastline, inaugurating a spate of protective construction that failed to hold back the water in 1953 when an overnight storm killed more than 1,800 people. The Dutch still call it the Disaster. They redoubled national efforts, inaugurating the Delta Works project that dammed two major waterways and produced the Maeslantkering \u2014 the giant sea gate, completed in 1997, keeping open the immense waterway that services the entire port of Rotterdam.Protecting the port is paramount. Once the world\u2019s busiest, Rotterdam\u2019s port remains the most important in Europe, each year serving tens of thousands of ships from around the world, supplying steel to Germany, petrochemicals to South America and pretty much everything else to everywhere. The port is still the bedrock industry in this city of more than 600,000, according to port officials, accounting for 90,000 jobs, not to mention another 90,000 workers whose businesses depend on the port, too.The port supports five oil refineries, whose owners include Shell and the Koch brothers, along with a massive coal-fire power plant. Officials say the port accounts for 17 percent of the entire nation\u2019s carbon footprint. A central paradox \u2014 and to skeptics, the ultimate hypocrisy \u2014 of this city\u2019s environmental self-branding is that, at heart, Rotterdam\u2019s economy continues to rely on the fossil fuel industry.In any case, the safe transport of all those raw materials, not to mention the responsibility of keeping the feet of people in the city dry, now and in the future, depends on the Maeslantkering.The idea behind it, first discussed decades ago, was unprecedented \u2014 a monumental gate with two arms, resting on either side of the canal, each arm as tall and twice as heavy as the Eiffel Tower. It was a staggering work of engineering. Wim Quist, the architect, devised an object of surpassing beauty, one of modern Europe\u2019s lesser-known marvels.1,000 feet7003000Eiffel TowerOne arm of the MaeslantkeringROTTERDAMThe steel ball joints for each arm are about 30 feet in diameter and weigh 1.5 million pounds. 525 feetThe storm surge barriers are about 70 feet tall.ATLANTIC OCEAN1,000 feet7003000ROTTERDAMEiffel TowerOne arm of the MaeslantkeringThe steel ball joints for each arm are about 30 feet in diameter and weigh 1.5 million pounds. 525 feetThe storm surge barriers are about 70 feet tall.ATLANTIC OCEANThe steel ball joints for each arm are about 30 feet in diameter and weigh 1.5 million pounds.

When the gate is closed, the arms float out onto the canal, meet and lock, the tubes filling with water and sinking onto a concrete bed, making an impenetrable steel wall against the North Sea. The process takes two and a half hours. Pressure from the sea is then transferred from the wall to the largest ball joints in the world, embedded in the banks on either side of the river.Computers, using a closed electronic system to avoid cyberattack, monitor sea levels hourly and can shut the gate automatically \u2014 or open it. This is critical: Thirty pumps inside the gate are linked to one of the country\u2019s power grids. They extract water from the tubes when it is time for the Maeslantkering to be reopened.If the grid fails, there is a backup grid and, as a last resort, a generator, because even more dangerous than the gate\u2019s not closing is the gate\u2019s not reopening. In that case, water pouring down from the Rhine and Meuse rivers could not flow into the sea and would overwhelm Rotterdam even more swiftly than the North Sea could. As Mr. Aboutaleb noted, escape would be impossible.Mr. Ovink said only half-jokingly, \u201cthe last resort would be to blow it up.\u201d The Maeslantkering was clearly built with Hollywood disaster-movie scenarios in mind: There are redundancies to redundancies, and the barrier is prepared for the most extreme climate change models, with sea levels rising beyond current forecasts.Even so, Rotterdam port officials have plans underway to add another two feet to the height of the gate.Beyond the Maeslantkering, back in town, there are countless fortifications, big and small, knitted into streets and squares. One sunny afternoon, I met Wynand Dassen, manager of Rotterdam\u2019s resilience team, and Paul van Roosmalen, who oversees rooftop development for the city, at the Dakpark, a dike in a poor, largely immigrant neighborhood bordering industrial waterfront. The site of the Dakpark used to be a railway switching station, a grim nowhere place abutting a cluster of social housing blocks. This was a red-light district, notorious for drug dealers and crime.The dike does a lot more than just hold back water. It has a shopping center, which the neighborhood needed, and a park on the roof. Shops face the waterfront and help pay to keep up the park. The park slopes from the roof down to streets and housing blocks, creating a grassy hill that links park and neighborhood.When the weather is good, sunbathers sprawl on the grassy roof and toss Frisbees. Formal gardens open onto acres of well-kept lawns. The park is a kilometer long. And wonderful. Its success \u2014 not only as a barrier but also as a boon to business and the area \u2014 has persuaded officials to consult neighborhoods and set aside money for community-initiated projects. \u201cWe became invested in getting more people involved in all kinds of civic issues,\u201d Mr. Dassen told me, \u201cand water inevitably becomes an integral part of this process. We believe you get the smartest solutions when communities are engaged and help make the links between water and neighborhood development.\u201dMr. van Roosmalen agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of what you can do if you connect storm-water management with social welfare and neighborhood improvements,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we mean here in Rotterdam by \u2018resilience planning.\u2019\u201dIn a neighborhood nearby, where drug addicts used to trek all the way from France to buy cheap heroin, I came across Marleen ten Vergert, a single parent supporting a young daughter on a civil servant\u2019s modest salary. Women in hijabs lugged groceries, old men lounged on park benches and children rode skateboards over broken concrete paths, past aged housing blocks. One block of houses surrounded a water plaza created to capture floodwater. Young families were enticed by prices of a single euro to buy abandoned houses around it. Many families came and went. The water park was vandalized. But, slowly, little by little, it has come to be embraced by the neighborhood.\u201cNow, for the most part, it works,\u201d Ms. Vergert told me. \u201cPeople want the water square, so they take better care of it. There\u2019s a greenhouse nearby run by a Turkish community. The value of houses in the neighborhood has gone up.\u201dA few blocks away, a start-up in a converted industrial waterfront building is developing solar-powered sailing drones for collecting plastic trash from the sea, and, back in the middle of the city, a warehouse with a Brooklynesque mix of artisanal food stalls, a circus academy and a pinball museum has rejuvenated a formerly dingy pier. Where the old Hotel New York, a century-old landmark, used to be the tallest building along a stretch of waterfront, skyscrapers have sprung up, producing a whole new business district in Rotterdam, with a photography museum across the street from the city\u2019s signature office tower, De Rotterdam, by Mr. Koolhaas, and Ben van Berkel\u2019s harplike Erasmus Bridge.Rotterdam is clearly trying to cast itself as a model of inventive urbanism. A local businessman, Peter van Wingerden, envisions floating dairy farms along the waterfront. One in every three trucks coming into the city carries food, he said. Floating farms would reduce truck traffic and carbon emissions, supplying the city with its own milk. With the city\u2019s encouragement, he is constructing a $2.2 million prototype, for 40 cows, producing a half-million liters (about 130,000 gallons) of milk a year. \u201cThe river is no longer just for industry,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe need to find new uses, which keep us safe from climate change, and help the city grow and prosper.\u201dThat\u2019s the city\u2019s mantra. When I asked Mr. van Wingerden if it was unsettling to live in a waterfront city mostly below sea level, he said: \u201cIt seems to us less dangerous than living on the San Andreas Fault. At least when we flood, we\u2019ll have some warning before our feet get wet.\u201dTo the Dutch, what\u2019s truly incomprehensible, he added, is New York after Hurricane Sandy, where too little has been done to prepare for the next disaster. People in the Netherlands believe that the places with the most people and the most to lose economically should get the most protection.The idea that a global economic hub like Lower Manhattan flooded during Hurricane Sandy, costing the public billions of dollars, yet still has so few protections, leaves climate experts here dumbfounded.Mr. Molenaar, Rotterdam\u2019s climate chief, summed up the Dutch view: \u201cWe have been able to put climate change adaptation high on the public agenda without suffering a disaster in many years because we have shown the benefits of improving public space \u2014 the added economic value of investing in resilience.\u201cIt\u2019s in our genes,\u201d he said. \u201cWater managers were the first rulers of the land. Designing the city to deal with water was the first task of survival here and it remains our defining job. It\u2019s a process, a movement.\u201cIt is not just a bunch of dikes and dams, but a way of life.\u201dGraphics by Jugal Patel. Design by Rumsey Taylor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "7 Sailors Emerged From Diverse Backgrounds to Pursue a Common Cause", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byThe seven sailors who died when the destroyer Fitzgerald collided with a container ship last weekend were a snapshot of the nation they served: an immigrant from the Philippines whose father served in the Navy before him; a poor teenager whose Guatemalan family came north eager for opportunity; a native of Vietnam hoping to help his family; a firefighter\u2019s son from a rural crossroads in the rolling green fields of Virginia.The roll call of the dead also illustrated the degree to which the military relies on recruits from immigrant communities around the country.The destroyer\u2019s windowless living quarters, where bunks are stacked three high, represented unlimited possibility for Sonar Technician Third Class Ngoc T. Truong Huynh. It was only after the sailor joined the Navy, his sister said, that he started smiling more often.\u201cHe was going out on so many adventures with his fellow sailors, and we at home missed him,\u201d said the sister, Lan Huynh. But, she added, her family was \u201cso happy that he was finally happy.\u201d\u201cHe found his purpose and he loved every minute of it,\u201d she said.Seaman Huynh, who went by Tan, was born in Da Nang, Vietnam, in 1992, and immigrated with his mother to the United States in 1994, looking for a better life, said Ms. Huynh. But his mother struggled to find her economic footing here, and his childhood was difficult and unsettled, with the family moving often. As the oldest of four siblings, he felt the tug of responsibility.By 2014, Seaman Huynh, who his sister said became a citizen in 2009, was yearning to find adventure and a way to provide for his family, she said. So he enlisted in the Navy and was soon assigned to the destroyer that traveled to ports in Australia, Japan and Korea.Mr. Huynh turned 25 on Friday, shortly before the collision that cost him his life.\u201cWishing him a happy birthday,\u201d Ms. Huynh said, \u201cwas the last thing we said to him.\u201dIn recent years, the military has tried to draw in immigrants with programs that allow enlistees to become citizens after basic training, attracting about 5,000 takers each year, according to the Defense Department. One out of every 13 sailors is foreign born, the highest proportion in any military branch, according to the Navy. The service regularly holds citizenship ceremonies aboard ships.At the same time, the proportion of racial and ethnic minorities in the military, mirroring the nation as a whole, has surged to 40 percent \u2014 nearly twice what it was 20 years ago.Former sailors from the destroyer said the diverse ranks shared a common cause.\u201cYou are crammed in with all sorts of cultures on the ship,\u201d said Corey Bell, 23, of Wynne, Ark., who served on the destroyer with six of the sailors who died. \u201cBut when you are on the Fitzgerald, you\u2019re family. There was no racism or nothing.\u201dThe relatives of Gunner\u2019s Mate Second Class Noe Hernandez of Weslaco, Tex., whose family immigrated from Central America, followed his Navy travels around the world from their small town in the southern tip of Texas. Seaman Hernandez, 26, was stationed first in Italy, then in California, then in Japan.\u201cWe just felt so proud that one of our own was living this life,\u201d his cousin Aly Hernandez-Singer said. She added, \u201cTo me, he represents \u2014 I\u2019ll be honest, I have to say it \u2014 what Trump says we are not. He represents the good side of the Latino community. He was a proud American. He was a good citizen, and he was Latino and proud of his roots.\u201dMonday was supposed to be the birthday celebration for the brother of Fire Controlman Second Class Carlos Sibayan, 23. Instead, his mother, Carmen, said she was preparing for a Mass at her home in Chula Vista, outside San Diego.Ms. Sibayan said that her son was born in the Philippines and that the family left when he was 4 to join his father, who served in the United States military. Friends describe Seaman Sibayan as an outgoing sailor who regularly dominated informal tournaments of the video game Super Smash Bros. that were held on the destroyer.\u201cHe helps people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loves to help everybody. He\u2019s a very good kid.

There are causes that explicitly advocate violence \u2014 Islamist extremism, Marxist revolution, white supremacy \u2014 and inspire their followers to kill. The Tea Party wasn\u2019t one of them during the Obama years. The Resistance isn\u2019t one of them today.

Then: Boom. Another awful postal moment, stirred by frustration or loneliness or impulse, loosely yoked to a political cause.But the fact that events are frightening, bloody and tragic doesn\u2019t necessarily make them especially meaningful. Americans are outraged; our politics are angry. It was ever thus. In a nation of 320 million someone fired a gun, shot people and got shot. It shouldn\u2019t be like that. It is. As for gun control, we\u2019ll learn more about Hodgkinson in the days ahead. But it would take something close to repeal of the Second Amendment to keep someone with his general profile from owning a rifle.In 2011 the left wanted to blame millions of Americans for the acts of one crazed man. The indictment served nobody. In 2017 the right may seek to do the same. Bad idea.

{"Headline": "We Taste-Tested 10 Hot Dogs. Here Are the Best.", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byThe New York Times Food department hasn\u2019t taken a close look at hot dogs in some time. Back when hot dogs were on every list of foods to avoid \u2014 alarming additives, questionable cuts, salt and fat galore \u2014 home cooks didn\u2019t want to know too much about what was in them.But cooks are different now, and so are hot dogs. We want to know that what we\u2019re eating is as good as it can be. Hot dogs are made from better ingredients, with fewer additives.One thing hasn\u2019t changed: Billions of hot dogs will be eaten at cookouts this summer, and serving them is one of the easiest ways we know to make people happy.And so, we present our first official hot dog blind tasting.The terms were as follows:First, the hot dogs would be cooked on a gas grill until well browned.Next, each would be tasted plain to evaluate the intrinsic qualities of the hot dog: seasoning, beefiness, snap, texture.Last, each would be eaten in a bun with the judge\u2019s preordained condiments \u2014 the same for each dog, to keep the flavor profile consistent.This important final step would allow us to assess the melding of meat and bread, sweetness and spice, salt and juice that makes up a perfect hot dog. The bun should hug the hot dog closely; there should be enough juice in the hot dog to keep the whole package together; condiments should complement the hot dog, not overwhelm it.And the judges? Some may say that enlisting three native New Yorkers \u2014 Sam Sifton, Melissa Clark and me \u2014 amounted to putting a thumb on the scale.All-beef hot dogs are part of the city\u2019s food DNA. (So are forcefully expressed opinions and a general skepticism about the food of Other Places.) Nationally popular pork-beef specimens like red hots, Vienna sausages, Coneys and weenies wouldn\u2019t have a chance.But the question became moot as I researched the contenders, and it quickly became clear that only all-beef franks could be invited to this event.Most of the high-quality hot dogs available to home cooks in the United States are made with all beef. (Hot dogs with lots of added fat and fillers often use multiple meats.) An overwhelming majority of the producers of organic, all-natural and humanely raised meat make only all-beef hot dogs. Restricting entry to all-beef hot dogs also leveled the playing field, making it possible to compare like with like.The hot dog\u2019s immediate ancestors, traditional wienerwursts and frankfurters from Germany and Austria, were made from combinations of pork, beef and sometimes veal. Beyond the meat, frankfurters have a trace of smoke, a touch of garlic and a hum of warm spice from paprika, coriander, clove or nutmeg. These subtle seasonings are what make a hot dog a hot dog.Within the all-beef subset, we were ecumenical, including all the major national brands as well as some organic, kosher and small-batch outliers. Ten dogs made the final cut.Some sausages were great alone in the first tasting, but glitchy in the second when they were placed in the bun. The Niman Ranch hot dog was so thick that \u2014 as Melissa astutely observed \u2014 it threw off the ratio for meat, condiment and bun. The Oscar Mayer entry was surprisingly small and sweet, inspiring nostalgic fits about childhood dinners of beanie weenies. I wanted to eat the smoky, slim Brooklyn Hot Dog Company sausage with a knife and fork alongside some parsleyed potato salad, as you might in Frankfurt, but not on a bun.And others were simply tasteless, oversalted or peculiar. \u201cNot a hot dog,\u201d was Sam\u2019s scathing assessment of those hapless contenders.The detailed results are below, with notes from the judges.Only Wellshire Farms, a brand sold only at Whole Foods markets, and Hebrew National, a stalwart, had what we considered a true and familiar hot dog profile: an identifiable beefy taste, a texture that\u2019s soft but not mealy, a noticeable juiciness and a thread of warm spice flavor. Wellshire Farms got the edge because of its slightly larger size, coming in first in our tasting.These hot dogs were good over all but missed greatness because of one attribute: The sausage was either too sweet, too salty, too smoky or too tough.Advice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.The Ball Park hot dog had noticeably less flavor and tasted more of additives than any of the others in our tasting. The Trader Joe\u2019s frank suffered from a rubbery, unfamiliar taste.An article last Wednesday about a taste test of 10 all-beef hot dogs misstated some of the ingredients that could be tasted in Ball Park Uncured Beef Franks. They are additives, not fillers.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Lesson: Silicon Valley\u2019s Start-Up Machine Needs Fixing", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtWhat happened at Uber is an indictment of everyone who enabled Mr. Kalanick\u2019s worst tendencies and practices, which is just about everyone in a position of power at the ride-hailing company and its funders. In other words, this was systemic. Top to bottom, Uber was a failure of Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up machine.And if we want Silicon Valley to create better start-ups \u2014 which we should, for everyone\u2019s sake \u2014 the Valley would be wise to now examine Uber\u2019s entrails and find another way.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.But there was a crowd standing behind him, too.First, this was a clear failure of oversight \u2014 of investors, boards of directors, partners and anyone else who could have altered Uber\u2019s course and clearly failed to do so. Overlearning the lesson of Steve Jobs\u2019s first fall at Apple \u2014 and of founder-led hyper-successes at Google and Facebook \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s investors created a culture where founders are given carte blanche, their pronouncements and tactics elevated to the level of divine infallibility.A convenient excuse. And, in retrospect, a bad strategy. If Uber had been forced to go public sooner \u2014 if it couldn\u2019t raise billions at the drop of a hat from the likes of Saudi Arabia \u2014 it would have opened itself up to much-needed scrutiny and potential reform. Staying private created a hothouse that reinforced its worst side, and allowed it to delay building a sustainable culture with a focus on long-term interests.How might Uber have created such a culture? First, by admitting that founders are not infallible, and recognizing that the most successful ones do best when their impulses are hemmed in by trusted lieutenants, mentors and firm boards of directors.Fun fact: Mr. Jobs didn\u2019t want to create a Windows-compatible version of the iPod or an app store for the iPhone; it was his lieutenants who pushed him to do it. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and the Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were guided by strong, experienced and extremely sober operators \u2014 Sheryl Sandberg and Eric Schmidt, respectively. Mr. Kalanick, meanwhile, was allowed to operate more or less solo, to micromanage a company that grew to enormous scale, and was left alone even when the firm\u2019s problems became plain to see.Finally, this was a failure driven by plain greed, of ends justifying means.Over the next few days you may hear a revisionist defense of Uber and Mr. Kalanick that will go like this: Uber was fighting an entrenched and monopolistic cabal \u2014 taxi companies and their captured regulators \u2014 so it had to act more like a wolf than a sheep. Related to that, you will hear this: Uber is good for the world. If it wins, it will reduce car ownership, drive up fuel efficiency, reduce traffic, lower the cost of transportation, probably reduce accidents, almost certainly save lives.In every Uber story I write, I get to a paragraph that aims to succinctly note all the recent scandals at the company. What\u2019s notable about this paragraph is how many different kinds of problems there are to put down.It didn\u2019t have to be like this. Yes, business ain\u2019t beanbag; yes, fighting the incumbent businesses requires a strong stomach. But there were so many different problems at Uber that you\u2019d have to be comically na\u00efve to conclude they all stemmed from an intransigent rival.No, there was something much more deeply amiss here \u2014 and everyone put in their money anyway, because, hey, Uber was growing very quickly, so why not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Likes Trump\u2019s Tweets and Why", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byDispatchMr. Trump and his die-hard followers delight in the shock value of violating social and political norms. They revel in the thumb in the eye. It\u2019s intrinsic to the president\u2019s appeal to his base, and it\u2019s increasingly clear that either deliberately or impulsively, both his conduct and his policies are aimed at that base and not beyond it.There is something about his swagger, his unabashed embodiment of a time when women were eye candy and arm candy. And there is something about the way he strikes back at women who anger him that seems to resonate for some men \u2014 and which, at least so far, has not cost him the support of the women who backed him. The uncomfortable larger question is whether this president\u2019s behavior is encouraging and unmasking resentments about women\u2019s place in society.\u201cTrump\u2019s persistent insults to high-profile women play to that part of his base that has long been incensed at a definition of political correctness that includes women, L.G.B.T.Q. people, immigrants and other groups \u2014 but leaves out working-class whites nursing the hidden injuries of class,\u201d she said. \u201cSo long as class remains unacknowledged as a key source of social disadvantage, Trump\u2019s insults will feel to some of his supporters like a delicious poke-in-the-eye of elites.\u201dSocial media offers another lens. It\u2019s a medium Mr. Trump exploits brilliantly, and one that has fostered and amplified a toxic subculture of misogyny. Today on Twitter, there was glee about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet alongside the denunciations. Some piled on with more insults about women. Others were overjoyed that Mr. Trump was upsetting \u201csnowflakes,\u201d that derisive term of art for oversensitive liberals. Still others believed that the president was justifiably striking back against attacks on him from Ms. Brzezinski and her co-host, Joe Scarborough. Some insisted there was no sexism involved, that women aren\u2019t exempt from criticism and have to learn to take it, just as men do.Ms. Matthews thinks Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction is more visceral than strategic. \u201cHe can\u2019t stand to be criticized, especially by a woman, and he can\u2019t stop himself from lashing out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no strategic audience he is winking and nodding to. However there is a segment of his base that enjoys his political incorrectness \u2014 even at this extreme \u2014 and I would say his misogyny. They are not the majority of his supporters, but they are his most fervent.\u201dYet criticism, even from Republicans, has not deterred Mr. Trump and some of his supporters in the past \u2014 witness how many denounced him over the Access Hollywood tapes. The president has paid no discernible political price for his actions. So that leaves the question very much open whether behavior once ruled unthinkable is again permissible in America today.Advertisement"}

It was kind of a time suck (long, dull), but there was payoff, as I immediately put it in my novel \u201cThe Identicals.\u201d My character finds it on her twin sister\u2019s night stand; it\u2019s the book that once belonged to their mother.

Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?I am a very nerdy reader, in that I am as disciplined about my reading as I am about my writing. I consider reading to be part of my job. I had a Kindle for a brief while, but I dropped it in the ocean, and that was the end of electronic reading for me. So I read only paper books, and I read them one at a time, all the way through \u2014 although since I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014, I loosened up on my rule of finishing everything no matter how abysmal.

When I was in second grade, I told my elementary school librarian that I had read \u201cevery book in the library.\u201d The following year, she ordered the Nancy Drew mysteries, and I worked my way through them all.

I\u2019ll have to call my mom later and ask her how.\u201dMr. Lenn\u2019s connection to Blackberry Farm is both a blessing and a curse in Knoxville. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s a good thing because Blackberry is associated with quality,\u201d he said. \u201cBut others reject it because it\u2019s this fancy place.\u201dAnd so while his techniques and ingredients are rarefied, Mr. Lenn\u2019s food is decidedly less luxe in Knoxville, designed to appeal to a broader audience. At Blackberry, he served poached North Carolina trout with a buttermilk consomm\u00e9 and watercress \u2014 a dish inspired by the Tennessee streams he waded in as a child. At J. C. Holdway, that trout is smoked and served over a kale salad with a creamy dressing. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Am I going to like that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI answer, \u2018If you like Caesar salad, then yes.\u2019\u201dHis new menu also embraces international flavors that were implicitly forbidden at Blackberry Farm, which has built its brand as a home to all things Southern. Mr. Lenn remembers being encouraged not to use soy sauce until he managed to find one produced in Kentucky.Nothing is off limits to him now. One of his most popular specials is a plate of fiery gochujang ribs topped with scallions and peanuts. The dish is ridiculously simple to make. Mr. Lenn quick-cures the ribs overnight in a mixture of salt, pepper and brown sugar, then smokes them in the wood-burning oven, where almost all of the restaurant\u2019s food is cooked. The \u201cmop sauce,\u201d a mix of Heinz apple cider vinegar, brown sugar and spices, including smoked paprika, is whizzed in a blender (the heat dissolves the sugar), then pulsed with a generous dollop of the sweet-and-spicy Korean chile paste.Mr. Lenn prefers to serve the ribs only at the bar. But he may one day have to add them to the regular menu: \u201cPeople see them and they say, \u2018Why can\u2019t we have that at our table?\u2019 So I say: \u2018O.K.

{"Headline": "The Savory Side of Carrot Cake", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenWhen I was a child, I wanted carrot cake for every birthday. I wasn\u2019t a fan of bakery cakes, expertly plastered with supersweet butter-free frostings in pastel colors. (I did like the realistic decorative little roses, though.) Those fine-crumbed white or yellow cakes did not have much appeal for me, somehow both dry and gummy.Carrot cake, on the other hand, had many enticing qualities to recommend it. It was gloriously moist and dark, with raisins and walnuts, sweetly spiced with clove, cinnamon and nutmeg. The fact that the cake was full of carrots barely registered, and it certainly didn\u2019t taste like carrots. I adored the tangy cream-cheese frosting.Despite the vivid and fond memories, I haven\u2019t tasted carrot cake \u2014 or any cake, for that matter \u2014 in years. My sweet tooth is satisfied with a couple of good cookies, maybe some gelato. I tend more toward salt than sugar, so lately I have been toying with savory baked goods, experimenting with various spices to flavor flatbreads, griddlecakes and biscotti.As it happened, I had invited guests, one of whom was celebrating a birthday, to a dinner party recently. Carrot cake immediately came to mind, and I was determined to make it a savory one.I could picture it clearly: a well-spiced cake with not a speck of sugar. It would be iced with thick cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and adorned with cilantro sprigs, black sesame seeds and red pepper, with a single candle at the center. At first glance, it would look like dessert. Very trompe l\u2019oeil.Recipe development began. I can report a few failures. I wanted a tender cake with a carrot-colored interior, but a relatively low fat content. Several stodgy versions later, I happily settled on a white cornbread batter into which I folded grated carrots, scallions, South Asian aromatics (cumin, mustard seeds, turmeric and cayenne) and crumbled feta cheese. Success. The cake can even be baked a day in advance if stored in an airtight tin.If you are not in the mood to frost and decorate this savory carrot cake, cut it in wedges, call it glorified cornbread and serve it alongside whatever you\u2019re having for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It is very good toasted a day later, smeared with butter, or to accompany salads, leafy or otherwise.But all dressed up, it really shines as a special-occasion cake.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Trump Destroy Obama\u2019s Legacy?", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "News AnalysisThe president seems determined to define his time in office by demolishing what his predecessor did.Supported byEvery new president changes course, particularly those succeeding someone from the other party. But rarely has a new president appeared so determined not just to steer the country in a different direction but to actively dismantle what was established before his arrival. Whether out of personal animus, political calculation, philosophical disagreement or a conviction that the last president damaged the country, Mr. Trump has made clear that if it has Mr. Obama\u2019s name on it, he would just as soon erase it from the national hard drive.\u201cI\u2019ve reflected back and simply cannot find another instance in recent American history where a new administration was so wholly committed to reversing the accomplishments of its predecessor,\u201d Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center, said. While other presidents focus on what they will build, \u201cthis one is different, far more comfortable still in swinging the wrecking ball than in developing models for what is to follow.\u201dShirley Anne Warshaw, director of the Fielding Center for Presidential Leadership Study at Gettysburg College, said Mr. Trump is not unusual in making a clean break from his predecessor. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t doing anything that Obama didn\u2019t do,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is simply reversing policies that were largely put in place by a president of a different party.\u201dThe difference, she said, is that other presidents have proactive ideas about what to erect in place of their predecessor\u2019s programs. \u201cI have not seen any constructive bills in this vein that Trump has put forth,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as I can tell, he has no independent legislative agenda other than tearing down. Perhaps tax reform.\u201dAdvisers insist Mr. Trump is not driven by a desire to unravel the Obama presidency. But like the Manhattan real estate developer he is, they said, he believes he must in some cases demolish the old to make way for the new.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t dismantled everything, and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s looking to do,\u201d said Hope Hicks, the White House director of strategic communications. \u201cThat may be a side effect of what he\u2019s building for his own legacy. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s coming into the office every day saying, \u2018How can we undo Obama\u2019s legacy, and how can he go back?\u2019 \u201dCritics say Mr. Obama brought this on himself. His biggest legislative achievements were passed almost exclusively with Democratic votes, meaning there was no bipartisan consensus that would outlast his presidency. And when Republicans captured Congress, he turned to a strategy he called the pen and the phone, signing executive orders that could be easily erased by the next president.\u201cI\u2019ve heard it joked about that the Obama library is being revised to focus less on his legislative achievements as each week of the Trump administration goes by,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. \u201cIt\u2019s like living by the sword and dying by the sword. When your presidency is based on a pen and a phone, all of that can be undone, and I think we\u2019re seeing that happening rather systematically.\u201d\u201cObama\u2019s legacy would be under much greater threat by a more competent president than Donald Trump,\u201d said Josh Earnest, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s White House press secretary. \u201cHis inexperience and lack of discipline are an impediment to his success in implementing policies that would reverse what Obama instituted.\u201dOther Obama veterans said much of what Mr. Trump has done was either less dramatic than it appeared or reversible. He did not actually break relations with Cuba, for instance. It will take years to actually withdraw from the Paris accord, and the next president could rejoin. The real impact, they argued, was to America\u2019s international reputation.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of posturing and, in fact, not a huge amount of change, and to the extent there has been change, it\u2019s been of the self-defeating variety,\u201d said Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser. \u201cWhat\u2019s been happening is not that the administration is undoing President Obama\u2019s legacy, it\u2019s undoing American leadership on the international stage.\u201dFor decades, presidents moving into the Oval Office have made a point on their first day or two of signing orders overturning policies of the last tenant, what Mr. Riley called \u201cpartisan kabuki\u201d to signal that \u201ca new president is in town.\u201dEven so, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Obama invested much effort in deconstructing programs left behind. Mr. Bush kept Mr. Clinton\u2019s health care program for lower-income children, his revamped welfare system and his AmeriCorps service organization. Mr. Obama undid much of Mr. Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind education program, but kept his Medicare prescription medicine program, his AIDS-fighting program and most of his counterterrorism apparatus.Mr. Obama understood that his legacy might be jeopardized by Mr. Trump. During last year\u2019s campaign, he warned supporters that \u201call the progress we\u2019ve made over these last eight years goes out the window\u201d if Mr. Trump won. Only after the election did he assert the opposite. \u201cMaybe 15 percent of that gets rolled back, 20 percent,\u201d he told The New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of stuff that sticks.\u201dIndeed, when it comes time to tally the record for the history books, Mr. Trump can hardly reverse some of Mr. Obama\u2019s most important achievements, like pulling the economy back from the abyss of a deep recession, rescuing the auto industry and authorizing the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Nor can Mr. Trump take away what will surely be the first line in Mr. Obama\u2019s obituary, his barrier-shattering election as the first African-American president.Conversely, Mr. Obama owns his failures regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. History\u2019s judgment of his handling of the civil war in Syria or the messy aftermath of the intervention in Libya or the economic inequality he left behind will not depend on his successor. If anything, America\u2019s decision to replace Mr. Obama with someone as radically different as Mr. Trump may be taken as evidence of Mr. Obama\u2019s inability to build sustained public support for his agenda or to mitigate the polarization of the country.But legacies are funny things. Presidents are sometimes defined because their successors are so different. Mr. Obama today is more popular than he was during most of his presidency, likely a result of the contrast with Mr. Trump, who is the most unpopular president this early in his tenure in the history of polling. By this argument, even if Mr. Trump does disassemble the Obama legacy, it may redound to his predecessor\u2019s historical benefit.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine future historians condemning Barack Obama for breaking with his country\u2019s past ostracism of Cuba or joining the civilized world in combating climate change or pursuing a more humane and accessible approach to health care,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIndeed, we build memorials to presidents who prod us toward fulfilling the egalitarian vision of Jefferson\u2019s declaration.\u201dBut that may not be all that comforting to Mr. Obama. Presidents prefer memorials to their lasting accomplishments, not their most fleeting.Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times and author of \u201cObama: The Call of History.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trial Over Suicide and Texting Lays Bare Pain of 2 Teenagers", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byTAUNTON, Mass. \u2014 Michelle Carter is a haunting presence in court, looking on darkly as her troubled past \u2014 with eating disorders, deep social insecurities and talk of killing herself \u2014 is laid bare in her trial, for all the world to see. Most of the time, she appears to be on the verge of tears.Sitting in court, she has said nothing publicly. But her own words, in the form of thousands of text messages, make up the bulk of the evidence both for and against her in an unusual trial that began last Tuesday and could come to an end this week.Ms. Carter, 20, is being tried on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Conrad Roy III, whom she called her boyfriend. He was 18 in July 2014 when he killed himself with carbon monoxide as he sat alone in his truck in a Kmart parking lot.Ms. Carter, then 17, was about an hour away at the time. But she had urged him, through screen after screen of texts, to kill himself.As a judge considers whether Ms. Carter is legally responsible for Mr. Roy\u2019s death, the pain and dependency of two desperately unhappy teenagers have spilled into the courtroom here in excruciating detail. Both had a history of emotional instability and, in his case, four failed suicide attempts. The copious texts between the two provide a stark window into their mind-sets, and the case will probably turn on the question of whether one person\u2019s words can cause the suicide of another.Prosecutors contend that Ms. Carter is as responsible for the death as if she had been sitting in the truck with Mr. Roy. They say she wielded enormous power over him: They contend that even as he was being sickened by the fumes and got out of his truck, she ordered him back in during a phone call. He returned to the truck.But Ms. Carter\u2019s lawyers say it was Mr. Roy who held sway over her. They say that for many months, she tried to talk him into getting treatment. But, the lawyers say, two weeks before he died, Ms. Carter underwent a transformation set off by antidepressants and came to believe the best way to help him was to encourage him to carry out his plan to kill himself.Closing arguments could come on Tuesday, with a decision by the judge before the end of the week. (Ms. Carter waived her right to a jury trial.) If found guilty, she faces up to 20 years in prison.The two teenagers met through their families in 2012 when they were vacationing in Florida. It turned out they lived less than an hour apart in Massachusetts. Once they returned home, though, they rarely saw each other in person, instead developing an intense relationship that played out in texts and Facebook messages.According to court documents and testimony, Mr. Roy had been physically and verbally abused at home and ended up, at least once, in an emergency room. When his parents divorced, Mr. Roy was despondent, and in October 2012 he tried to kill himself.In videos played in court, Mr. Roy, speaking into his computer, described his despair. He called himself a \u201cminuscule little particle on the face of this earth\u201d and \u201cno-good trash.\u201d At another point, he called himself \u201can abortion\u201d and said his life was \u201ca joke.\u201dMs. Carter often showed the world a more positive aspect, according to testimony by Dr. Peter R. Breggin, a psychiatrist and expert in psychopharmacology who testified for the defense and said he had interviewed people who knew Ms. Carter and reviewed her texts, posts and medical records. She was constantly trying to help people, he said.Her lawyers said she had a host of other \u201cfrailties,\u201d including a severe eating disorder. In her texts, she talked about being distraught over her body image and said she cut herself when she was anxious. At one point, she told a friend that she, too, had nearly attempted suicide. She also expressed confusion about her sexuality and lamented having no friends. All the while, she craved the attention of certain popular girls at school and appeared excessively grateful when they were nice to her.It was this yearning for attention that prosecutors said drove Ms. Carter to push Mr. Roy to kill himself. His death, they said, would allow her to play the role of the \u201cgrieving girlfriend\u201d and become the focus of sympathy.Ms. Carter\u2019s voluminous correspondences showed she texted freely about her own problems and Mr. Roy\u2019s. In June 2014, she wrote to Samantha Boardman, one of the girls she admired:\u201cHes suicidal and has severe depression and social anxiety which is the bad part but I\u2019m the only one he has and he needs me. I mean it\u2019s not helping that I\u2019m kinda going thru my own stuff but if I leave him he will probably kill himself and it would be all my fault. I\u2019m keeping him alive basically.\u201dMs. Carter had been through a suicide attempt with Mr. Roy before. In October 2012, she was shocked when he told her on Facebook he was planning to kill himself. \u201cYou have so much to live for please don\u2019t,\u201d she told him.When he raised the subject again in June 2014, she continued to encourage him to seek help.\u201cHave you thought about getting professional help?\u201d she wrote. \u201cI think it will really help you.\u201dBut by early July 2014, Ms. Carter\u2019s attitude changed. She abruptly turned her attention to helping Mr. Roy end his misery. Prosecutors said she was craving her friends\u2019 attention; Dr. Breggin said it was a \u201ctransformation\u201d brought about by her switch from Prozac to Celexa months earlier.\u201cShe was enmeshed in a delusional system,\u201d Dr. Breggin said. \u201cShe\u2019s thinking it\u2019s a good thing to help him die.\u201dShe also gave him elaborate instructions on how to do it. Most of the prosecution\u2019s case against Ms. Carter is built on texts she sent in the two weeks before his death on July 12. In those, she counseled Mr. Roy to overcome his doubts. She told him that he was \u201cstrong\u201d enough to commit suicide and that his parents would manage:\u201cI think your parents know you\u2019re in a really bad place. I\u2019m not saying they want you to do it but I honestly feel like they can accept it.\u201d She added, \u201cEveryone will be sad for a while but they will get over it and move on.\u201dWhen technical and logistical issues arose, Ms. Carter provided direction and advice. If the gas did not work, she noted at one point, he had other options:\u201cHang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself idk there\u2019s a lot of ways.\u201dOddly, she began texting her classmates on July 10 that he was missing, even though he was not; in fact she was texting with him at the time and instructing him on how to fix the generator that he wanted to use in his suicide. He would not kill himself for two more days, after more exchanges in which Ms. Carter declared, more than once, \u201cYou just have to do it.\u201dMr. Roy sent his last text to Ms. Carter at 6:25 p.m. on July 12: \u201cOkay, I\u2019m almost there.\u201dThey spoke by phone then. It is not known what was said, but she later texted Ms. Boardman that he got out of the truck because the carbon monoxide was working \u201cand he got scared.\u201d She \u201ctold him to get back in.\u201dShortly thereafter, Ms. Carter texted Mr. Roy\u2019s mother asking where he was, not mentioning the call she had just had with him while he was killing himself.He was found dead the next day.A short time later, she arranged a fund-raising baseball tournament in Mr. Roy\u2019s name \u2014 in her hometown, Plainville, not his \u2014 and presented herself as an anti-suicide advocate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Thom Browne the Most Underestimated Designer in New York?", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byNot just because it is in the garment district of New York rather than the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in the Sixth Arrondissement, but also because when you step off the elevator on the 15th floor of his building, you find yourself in front of a glass door without a sign or a logo but with a doorbell and the kind of white louvered shades you normally find in a dentist office or an accountancy firm.And because behind that door is a long gray-walled corridor with a gray terrazzo floor, leading at the far end to two facing doors, which open to reveal men and women running about in variants of the same uniform: gray tailored Buster Brown shorts or trousers cropped to show the ankle; white shirts; gray ties with tie clips, often tucked into the high waistbands of their trousers; shrunken schoolboy jackets; knit vests; pleated gray skirts; and black brogues, all of them working in rooms with the same gray terrazzo floors, gray marble walls and louvered blinds, all of them speaking in hushed tones, united in a single mission: to disseminate the Look of Browne as widely, and virally, as possible.It\u2019s easy to dismiss that ambition as fashion fantasy. In fact, up to now it has been largely dismissed, most often with an aside about fashion insiders and those damning words \u201cconceptual\u201d and \u201cniche.\u201dExcept, it turns out, this niche is a rapidly expanding territory. \u201cI was talking to someone about Thom Browne the other day, and they said, \u2018But that business is not that big,\u2019\u201d said Danielle Vitale, chief executive of Barneys New York. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018What? It\u2019s huge!\u2019\u201d\u201cHuge\u201d may be something of an exaggeration, but it is probably not overstating the matter to say that Thom Browne may be the most underestimated not-just-a-men\u2019s-wear-designer in New York.Which is partly why he is moving his women\u2019s wear show to Paris, too.He has never been approached by a big brand to take the reins of a heritage house. When rumors start about what brand might hire what buzzy, young New York name, his never comes up. No conglomerate like LVMH or Kering has ever tried to buy him.And yet last year, his company (which was founded in 2001 and is profitable) brought in $100 million in revenue and is on track to increase that to $120 million to $125 million this year, of which 70 percent is men\u2019s wear sales and 30 percent is women\u2019s, even though women\u2019s wear was just introduced in 2011. (It is currently growing at 30 percent a year.) Thirty percent of the sales occur in the United States, 40 percent in Europe and 30 percent in Asia. Mr. Browne is opening six new stores in the second half of 2017, following three openings so far this year.That makes Thom Browne much bigger than the Row, bigger than Altuzarra and bigger even than Proenza Schouler, and nearly close to the size of Alexander Wang, whose former chief executive, Rodrigo Bazan, left in May 2016 to become the C.E.O. at Thom Browne, an acknowledgment of sorts that of all the third-generation American brands (those that came after the Ralph/Calvin/Donna and Marc Jacobs/Michael Kors eras), Mr. Browne\u2019s may be the one to watch.\u201cIt\u2019s a rare brand that is bigger than it appears,\u201d said Kenneth Suslow, a founding managing partner of Sandbridge Capital, the private equity firm that last year bought a majority stake in the company from Mr. Browne\u2019s former majority investor, the Japanese company Stripe International. It was the most significant investment in Sandbridge\u2019s initial portfolio. (It also holds stakes in Derek Lam, Karl Lagerfeld and Tamara Mellon.) Mr. Bazan thinks sales will triple in the next five years.Fans of Mr. Browne\u2019s clothes include not just fashion people like Andrew Bolton, his partner and the curator in charge of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Solange Knowles, who wore a Thom Browne puffer tuxedo to the last Met Gala, but also LeBron James; Steve Ells, the chief executive of Chipotle; Laurene Powell Jobs; Michelle Obama; and Janis Leigh, the chief human resources officer for Hudson\u2019s Bay Company.At Barneys, where Thom Browne men\u2019s wear is among the top five most popular brands, Ms. Vitale said she believes his women\u2019s wear can easily occupy the same place. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else that does what he does,\u201d she said, referring to his emphasis on classic tailoring with a twist and extreme interior construction.It is possible no American designer has created as fully realized a world in which to frame his work since Ralph Lauren. Indeed Mr. Browne, like Mr. Lauren, was not classically trained, began his career in men\u2019s wear and then moved into women\u2019s wear. Mr. Lauren\u2019s ethos is also rooted in a peculiarly American mythology, though where Mr. Lauren went west, Mr. Browne took on the rise of corporate culture and the suburban dream, then twisted it. Instead of making the wearer seem like a cog in a wheel, Mr. Browne\u2019s suits made him or her stand out.Mr. Browne\u2019s stores, including the recently expanded New York flagship in TriBeCa, which now contains a full-fledged women\u2019s store to mirror the men\u2019s, look like his offices, which look like his home. (Furniture often moves back and forth among them all.) All of his employees get a \u201cgenerous\u201d clothing allowance to cover shirts, suits and outerwear, and are expected to model the collection pretty much all the time. Mr. Bazan, who wears the de rigueur shrunken gray suit, even when bicycling in Los Angeles, has the wardrobe of his former life in storage.\u201cMy first employee once wore pink socks to work,\u201d Mr. Browne said. \u201cI told him he couldn\u2019t wear those socks. It was ruining the message.\u201dGetting that message out is part of the rationale behind the move to the Paris shows next season, much to the delight of Ralph Toledano, the president of French fashion\u2019s governing body, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de la Couture, du Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter des Couturiers et des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Mode. Mr. Toledano had been discussing the possibility of joining the Paris schedule with Mr. Browne for a while.\u201cHe belongs in the Paris family,\u201d Mr. Toledano said with satisfaction, taking a bit of a dig at the politics of fashion weeks. \u201cHe is about creativity, fabric, point of view.\u201dWhen asked if he felt overlooked or stereotyped by his home industry, Mr. Browne paused for a moment and then shrugged. \u201cWell, yes, a little,\u201d he said, sitting at a white Eero Saarinen table in his showroom, wearing a gray suit, the buttons on the cuffs undone, a white handkerchief folded into a square and peeking out of his pocket. (He doesn\u2019t like handkerchiefs folded into triangles; he considers them too \u201cfancy.\u201d) \u201cWe do care. I\u2019ve never been interested in cool, but I know other people are.\u201dPart of the problem is that fashion loves the myth of the boy wonder (see: Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Wang, Tom Ford), the story of designers having a moment and seizing it, the buzz of the millions of followers who may or may not actually ever make a purchase. That has never been the Thom Browne narrative. Not to mention the fact that at 51 he\u2019s not exactly a boy.Instead of opening more elaborate stores, he and Mr. Bazan plan to keep them small, like little windows on his world, with approximately 500 women\u2019s (and many more men\u2019s) products available online via a partnership with Farfetch. It is a direct reversal of the traditional equation in which a few pieces are sold via e-commerce, with most held in physical back rooms. Every piece is photographed in-house (two floors above the main offices) before being uploaded, and Mr. Browne oversees the shoots. He is his own stylist.His interest is above all in controlling the message. This is a man who runs eight miles every morning and eats exactly the same breakfast. It took him two years to decide that taking on Sandbridge as an investor would be a good idea.Though, in the fable of fashion, those are probably the wrong animals. Really, Mr. Browne may be a tortoise. The question now is whether he will likewise win the race.Advertisement"}

Walker-Descartes, a child abuse specialist at Maimonides, evaluated Nylah and said her \u201cinjuries could not have been caused from falling off a bed, but rather, were inflicted intentionally,\u201d according to the complaint.Debbie Silberman, a lawyer with Brooklyn Defender Services who is representing Mr. Taylor, declined to comment.A spokesman for the New York City Administration for Children\u2019s Services would not say whether it had any previous involvement with Nylah, citing confidentiality laws. \u201cThe loss of this child is a terrible tragedy,\u201d the spokesman, Jose Bayona, said by email. \u201cWe are engaged in an aggressive investigation along with N.Y.P.D.\u201dIn July 2016, Ms. Lewis obtained a court order against Mr. Taylor to prohibit him from stalking or otherwise harassing her, according to information provided in the criminal complaint.On a Facebook page that appears to be Mr. Taylor\u2019s, a post that was put up about two months after Nylah was born expresses fury that her mother did not get an abortion as he said she had promised.Later posts show a different side, with photos of Nylah, dressed in pink with a pink bow on her head. In the most recent post, Mr. Taylor wishes everyone a happy Father\u2019s Day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Universal Phenomenon of Men Interrupting Women", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "Supported byFor women in business and beyond, it was an I-told-you-so day.Academic studies and countless anecdotes make it clear that being interrupted, talked over, shut down or penalized for speaking out is nearly a universal experience for women when they are outnumbered by men.\u201cI think every woman who has any degree of power and those who don\u2019t knows how it feels to experience what Kamala Harris experienced yesterday,\u201d said Laura R. Walker, the president and chief executive of New York Public Radio. \u201cTo be in a situation where you\u2019re trying to do your job and you\u2019re either cut off or ignored.\u201dSenator Harris, a former prosecutor, assertively questioned Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, interrupted and chided her to let Mr. Sessions answer her questions. Soon after that, Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the committee chairman, cut her off, saying her time had elapsed.Women in a wide range of industries, at all levels, offered hundreds of such examples in response to an invitation from The New York Times for people to share their personal experiences on Facebook. \u201cI can\u2019t even count the number of times I\u2019ve witnessed a woman being interrupted and talked over by a man, only to hear him later repeat the same ideas she was trying to put forward,\u201d wrote one respondent, Grace Ellis. \u201cI\u2019d say I see this happen \u2026 two to three times a week? At least?\u201dJoyce Lionarons wrote, \u201cMy female boss told me she needed to allow each man to interrupt her four times before protesting in a meeting. If she protested more often, there were problems.\u201dErica Brown wrote that she has worked for three months as a distiller. Virtually every time she goes to pick up supplies, she said, the staff asked her husband what she needed.Megha Banerjee said she used to work at a company with very few women. \u201cWhen I would express my opinion, I was often interrupted, or my point was ignored,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s been six months that I\u2019ve left that job, and I\u2019m a much happier, more confident person.\u201d\u201cI used to work for one of the 10 largest independent booksellers in the country,\u201d Bianca DiRuocco wrote. \u201cOften, a suggestion made by one of the female staff during meetings the owner attended would be shot down, only to reappear in a week or two as his own brilliant idea. It happened so often a few of us started joking privately about noting our suggestions in the calendar to see exactly how many days later it would take for our ideas to go from ridiculously impossible to sheer genius.\u201dA ream of studies affirm such anecdotes. Researchers consistently find that women are interrupted more and that men dominate conversations and decision-making, in corporate offices, town meetings, school boards and the United States Senate.Indeed, Jason Miller, a former adviser to President Trump\u2019s campaign and a CNN commentator, described Senator Harris as \u201chysterical\u201d and shouting during her questioning of Mr. Sessions. At times, Senator Harris cut Mr. Sessions off, but she spoke in an even tone.That experience, too, resonated with many women responding to the Facebook callout.\u201cAnd if you complain, you are excluded,\u201d said Paula Minnikin. \u201cAs the only woman on a particular corporate board, I asked the chair in private if we could consider finding another one or two women as we were seeking to replace three board members. He said there was no doubt I was one of our strongest members but that there ARE no good women. I was the exception. He then went on to share that this is because I\u2019m tall and strong, like a man, and don\u2019t confuse things like a regular woman. I was flabbergasted.\u201d\u201cThe fact that women are outnumbered in every room puts them in a position where they\u2019re often coming up against gender-based stereotypes,\u201d said Deborah Gillis, president and chief executive of Catalyst, which works for women\u2019s advancement in business. \u201cWomen are too hard, too soft, but never just right. What that means is that women are seen as either competent or liked but not both.\u201dSome women are working to subvert these gender imbalances in their own organizations.Ms. Walker, of New York Public Radio, said she pressed for more women at its senior level and on its board. \u201cI think this not only empowers women throughout our organization, it also makes for better discussions,\u201d she said. She is also pushing to increase the number of women who host podcasts.Jacqueline Hinman, chairman and C.E.O. of CH2M Hill Companies, a Colorado-based engineering company that manages projects including light rail in Toronto and Olympic facilities in London, works in a field where women have typically been scarce. Now, however, women make up 30 to 40 percent of her board and are well represented in senior positions.It took years of work to get to that point, Ms. Hinman said \u2014 and part of the push came from clients, increasingly women, who wanted to see diverse engineering teams. She said she made it clear to subordinates they will be judged partly on how many women and minorities they advance.\u201cMen who come to our companies from competitors are astounded by the number of women everywhere,\u2019\u2019 she said, adding, \u201cThey love it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For G.E.\u2019s John Flannery, It Was a 30-Year Trip to the Top", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byHe is the quintessential company man.Mr. Flannery, 55, will also be counted on to revive the company\u2019s languishing stock price. Under Mr. Immelt\u2019s leadership, shares of G.E. fared poorly, drawing the ire of investors and the involvement of an activist hedge fund that hastened the succession planning that led to Mr. Flannery\u2019s appointment.Already, Wall Street is betting that Mr. Flannery has what it takes. G.E. shares were up more than 3 percent on Monday. And analysts spoke approvingly of his behind-the-scenes maneuvering in various G.E. deals \u2014 particularly the $13.5 billion agreement two years ago to take over the power business of the French giant Alstom and the spinoff that year of G.E.\u2019s consumer finance arm, Synchrony Financial.That Mr. Flannery is not afraid to divest assets has some analysts betting that he could reach back into that toolbox to further simplify G.E.\u2019s sprawling business.Any major divestitures will probably take time. Mr. Flannery said in a video broadcast on Facebook that he planned to conduct a review of the company with a \u201csense of urgency\u201d and that he would make recommendations later in the year.Mr. Flannery said he was going to \u201creview all aspects of the business,\u201d with a particular focus on the cost structure. For the next few months, he will be traveling the globe, visiting businesses, customers and investors. Asked whether those decisions would be about the portfolio or the financial outlook, he said, \u201cI think you should expect both.\u201dMr. Flannery lands in the hot seat at a pivotal moment for G.E., a 125-year-old company with $120 billion in annual sales.Major shifts in geopolitical tides have resulted in bumpy currency fluctuations for the multinational conglomerate. And while Mr. Immelt, who is retiring as G.E.\u2019s chief on Aug. 1, praised President Trump\u2019s policies on deregulation and tax reform, he criticized his nationalistic trade policies, publicly supporting Mexico and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump wants to renegotiate.In an interview, Mr. Flannery said he had had \u201cno interaction with President Trump,\u201d adding that the administration\u2019s proposals to cut taxes and spend on infrastructure represented an \u201cagenda\u201d that G.E. supported.But Mr. Flannery suggested that he would try to steer clear of politics as he conducted his review of the company.A keen wine collector who often grills for guests at his Nantucket home, Mr. Flannery, who is married and has three children, is an avid reader and enjoys attending R.E.M. and Natalie Merchant concerts. He named the family\u2019s new puppy, a 12-week-old black Labrador, after Boston Red Sox outfielder Mookie Betts.Analysts said that in the last few months, it had become clear that Mr. Flannery had landed on the shortlist of chief executive candidates. Various institutional investors who visited General Electric\u2019s headquarters in Boston were increasingly meeting with Mr. Flannery.In the fall of 1987, Mr. Flannery, fresh from graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, arrived at General Electric\u2019s finance arm, GE Capital. Just a few weeks later came Black Monday and the stock market crash.The son of a former director for bank supervision for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Mr. Flannery worked with a group that assessed risks in providing financing for the booming arena of leveraged buyout deals. In the wake of the market crash, as banks steered clear of the risky deals, GE Capital moved in.Besides providing funding for early cable and wireless deals, Mr. Flannery\u2019s team was involved in G.E.\u2019s funding the 1987 leveraged buyout of the magazine publisher Edgell Communications. G.E. took a hit a few years later when that company, suffering from a steep decline in sales and overburdened by a heavy debt load, filed for bankruptcy.But Mr. Flannery\u2019s star was already on the rise. After tours in Latin America, Asia and India, Mr. Flannery returned to corporate headquarters to run mergers and acquisitions in 2013.There, under the direction of Mr. Immelt to transform the company and shed various businesses, Mr. Flannery negotiated the Alstom deal in France and also spun off Synchrony and sold off G.E.\u2019s refrigerator business.In 2014, Mr. Flannery stepped in to run the company\u2019s health care business, which is a leader in imaging and diagnostic equipment. Many analysts and investors expected the unit to be sold or spun off, but Mr. Flannery instead expanded it, pushing into life sciences and cell therapy systems businesses.Still, Mr. Flannery may face new pressure to evaluate businesses to divest. And one early target, some analysts say, could be the health care division he has been leading.\u201cWhat has always struck me about his background is that he ran G.E.\u2019s business development \u2014 that is G.E. shorthand for mergers and acquisitions,\u201d said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cSo when he was running health care \u2014 a guy who wasn\u2019t a health care guy but an M&A guy \u2014 one could draw the conclusion that he was preparing it for some sort of action that would maximize shareholder value.\u201dThe health care division is still very much a part of G.E. But analysts say that with pressure coming from investors \u2014 including the activist hedge fund Trian Partners, led by the billionaire Nelson Peltz \u2014 health care could once again be a target for a sale or a spinoff sooner rather than later.\u201cHealth care is not a shining star of G.E.,\u201d said Paul Keckley, an independent health care industry analyst. \u201cIt has been a staple, but aviation is what is driving the company\u2019s earnings more these days.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe question is going to be how quickly institutional investors have him answer the question of break up the business or keep it together.\u201dMr. Flannery on Monday played down the idea that he was simply an unsentimental deal maker.When he took over the health care business, he said, the expectation was that this \u201cbean-counter guy is here, and we\u2019re for sale.\u201d Instead, he made a top-to-bottom review of the business, streamlining it in places but investing in others.\u201cThere was a preconception\u201d about me, he said. \u201cBut the reality was the opposite.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Revitalized Pittsburgh Says the President Used a Rusty Metaphor", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byUrban Studies\u201cI was elected,\u201d the president said, \u201cto represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\u201dBut the president was hardly speaking about a place of domestic political strength: Although Mr. Trump carried Pennsylvania last fall, 75 percent of voters in Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Clinton.In defiance of the president, city leaders vowed again on Thursday to pursue their own climate action. Pittsburgh, they point out, is the wrong metaphor anyway: The former steel hub has spent the last 30 years trying to remake its economy in precisely the mold that climate advocates envision.Once among the most polluted cities in the country, Pittsburgh today is increasingly rebuilding around greener medical complexes, research universities and tech offices. In place of steel mills, the city now has its own Google outpost and test track for autonomous cars. The U.S. Steel Tower, the tallest building in town, now bears the name of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The local renewable energy industry employs 13,000 people, according to the city.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto said Thursday, is an example of how environmentalism can also mean economic development. It was a very different message from the one the president delivered hours earlier at the White House, where he warned that the international climate pact would cost the American economy too much.\u201cTo some, Pittsburgh is still the 1975 Pittsburgh, a steel mill town based on heavy industry, still struggling through the post-Depression,\u201d said Mr. Peduto, a Democrat, when asked why he thought the president had singled out his city (particularly in light of its reliably liberal politics). \u201cI also think it\u2019s the first city they thought of that started with a \u2018P\u2019.\u201dEnding the day at Cappy\u2019s Cafe, a tavern he frequents in the city\u2019s Shadyside neighborhood, Mr. Peduto said he was angry enough when he heard about the president\u2019s plans to withdraw from the climate agreement. When he heard that the president had mentioned Pittsburgh, he said, he was \u201clivid.\u201dBy citing the city, Mr. Trump seemed to be reaching for a stereotype of a coarse industry town where workers would cheer the return of coal (and where they might also scoff at the comparison to Paris). But many are no longer waiting for old industry to return. And Pittsburgh has joined with international cities, Paris included, to commit to reducing its own emissions.If anything, the city today stands to be affected more by Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to repeal the Affordable Care Act than by his promises to revive the steel and coal industries.\u201cThe economy looks more like Boston than it does Gary, Ind.,\u201d said George Fechter, who was chief executive of the McGowan Center for Artificial Organ Development at the University of Pittsburgh. He called the president\u2019s comments \u201cabsolutely outrageous,\u201d adding \u201che doesn\u2019t represent the people of Pittsburgh.\u201dPittsburgh\u2019s transformation from a steel town to a center of \u201ceds and meds\u201d has been visible even on the city\u2019s streets.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I watched soot come off the buildings \u2014 the buildings turned from black to beige while I lived there,\u201d said Richard Florida, an urban economist who has championed the emerging knowledge economy in cities like Pittsburgh. He taught at Carnegie Mellon and lived in the city from the late 1980s through the early 2000s. \u201cIt\u2019s not the typical down-in-the-dumps Rust Belt town. It\u2019s still in the midst of a transformation, but it looks like it has turned a corner.\u201dPerhaps no place has come to represent Pittsburgh\u2019s shift from heavy industry to high tech more starkly than the East Liberty neighborhood, which has seen almost unrelenting redevelopment. The neighborhood now has a Whole Foods; Pittsburgh Google moved its office here from Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s campus in 2010; and the Ace Hotel opened in an old Y.M.C.A. building in 2015.Shashank Laxminarayan Suresh, 28, a native of India who works in the data science department at the health care provider Highmark, said he had found Pittsburgh friendly and welcoming. He lives in the city\u2019s Squirrel Hill neighborhood.\u201cThere is so much opportunity in the technology fields here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to help you here, and I have never had anyone who was unkind to me because I am an immigrant.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s a very happening place!\u201dHadley Pratt, 26, works at BoXZY, a 3D printing company housed in a former Westinghouse building, once a mainstay of Pittsburgh\u2019s heavy industry. While meeting a friend for a drink at the Ace Hotel, she said Trump\u2019s picture of Pittsburgh was incomplete.\u201cTo me it was a big slap in the face,\u201d she said. \u201cPittsburgh is still industrial, but there\u2019s a lot of innovation here. None of it was done through Trump-type policies.\u201d If she were to give Trump a tour of the \u201creal\u201d Pittsburgh, Pratt said she\u2019d take him to \u201cindustrial areas revitalized through progressive organizations; we have that all over Pittsburgh.\u201dState Representative Dan B. Frankel, a Democrat who represents part of the city, used Facebook to post an old photograph of a smog-laden daytime Pittsburgh.\u201cTrump apparently wants to take Pittsburgh back to this,\u201d Mr. Frankel wrote. \u201cWe won\u2019t go back.\u201dThe city\u2019s concerns about pollution become a powerful political force around the time of the 1940 photograph that Mr. Frankel posted. In the 1940s, Mayor David L. Lawrence used an inaugural address to declare that he was \u201cconvinced that our people want clean air.\u201d An air quality ordinance was approved in 1949.But even with Pittsburgh widely viewed as a place on the rise today, residents still find themselves trying to distance and disentangle their city\u2019s reputation from its past.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since the steel industry collapsed,\u201d said Sam Williamson, a labor organizer who is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. \u201cPittsburghers have for a very long time \u2014 probably because of our early 20th-century history, which sticks in people\u2019s minds \u2014 taken very seriously the challenges of maintaining a strong economy while not destroying our environment at the same time. Those two things are not irreconcilable.\u201dMr. Williamson allowed that Mr. Trump\u2019s comment could have been \u201ca case of careless alliteration,\u201d but he also questioned the president\u2019s approach to environmental and economic policy.Michael Huber, a driver for Uber in the city, voted for Mr. Trump. If he had the president in his car, he said, he\u2019d drive him through the Fort Pitt Tunnel to catch the view of the city, and show him around Oakland where the universities are.\u201cDiversity in Pittsburgh is enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a coal town. We were, and we were great at it. But we\u2019re not anymore.\u201dKim Lyons reported from Pittsburgh, Emily Badger from San Francisco and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.Advertisement"}

He was one of at least three people who stepped in to try to stop a man\u2019s xenophobic tirade directed at two girls on Friday. That man killed two other men, the authorities say, and Mr. Fletcher suffered a serious stab wound.But Mr. Fletcher, a Portland State University student, was worried that while he was being lionized, two other very important victims of Friday\u2019s attack were being largely forgotten.\u201cWe need to remember, this is about those little girls,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said in a video that he posted on Facebook on Wednesday. \u201cJust remember that, you know, they got hurt too.\u201d\u201cWe in Portland have this weird tendency to continue patterns that we\u2019ve done forever, and one of them is this same old, just to put it bluntly, white savior complex,\u201d he said. \u201cSuffice to say, I think it\u2019s immensely, immensely morally wrong and irresponsible how much money we have gotten as opposed to how much support, money, love, kindness, that has been given to that little girl.\u201dMr. Fletcher, who identified himself as a poet, expressed his misgivings less than a day after he attended the first court appearance for the man accused of the fatal attack.An affidavit filed on Tuesday also laid out new details about what happened. Prosecutors said the man charged with murder in the attack, Jeremy Joseph Christian, had shouted at two girls on the train, one described as \u201cAfrican-American,\u201d and the other as an \u201cAfrican-American Muslim who was wearing traditional Muslim dress.\u201dDuring Mr. Christian\u2019s profanity-laced tirade, which appeared to be aimed at the girls, he told them to \u201cgo home\u201d and referred to the Islamic State and Saudi Arabia, according to the court document.Soon after, a tussle began in which Mr. Christian and Mr. Fletcher shoved each other, the affidavit said. After Mr. Fletcher told the man to get off the train, Mr. Christian stabbed Mr. Fletcher in the neck, the documents said, before proceeding to fatally stab two other men, Ricky John Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, 23.Mr. Fletcher\u2019s wound to the left side of his neck \u201cmissed being a fatal injury by millimeters\u201d the documents said. He did not immediately respond to a Facebook message seeking comment on Wednesday night, and members of his family also did not respond to a phone call and an email.But in his video, Mr. Fletcher called on viewers to \u201cimagine\u201d that they were one of the girls on the train.\u201cHer life is never going to be the same,\u201d he said, before marveling that \u201cthose brave young girls\u201d lived through Friday\u2019s harassment and attack and yet \u201cfind ways to wake up in the morning with smiles on their faces.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Decline of the Baronial C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Corporate giants once had all-powerful chiefs with domains to match. But activist investors and technological change are remaking the executive suite.Supported byFAIRFIELD, Conn. \u2014 They bestrode the business world, or at least the suburban corporate campus, like a colossus.Sitting behind burnished wooden desks, in glass-walled corner offices like the one Jeffrey R. Immelt occupied at General Electric\u2019s former headquarters here, a select group of American chief executives were once more akin to statesmen than businessmen.G.E. moved out of this sprawling Skidmore, Owings & Merrill-designed emblem of 1970s corporate modernism in favor of smaller, humbler digs in downtown Boston last year. And last week, Mr. Immelt unexpectedly announced plans to retire after 16 years in the top job, amid a sagging stock price and pressure from activist investors.General Electric is just the latest storied name in corporate America to show its leader the door. Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, had been in the job for less than three years when he was fired in late May. Two weeks earlier, Mario Longhi of U.S. Steel abruptly stepped down.With these departures, the American era of the baronial chief executive, sitting atop an industrial dominion with all the attendant privileges, is drawing to a close.It is one consequence of a transformed economic landscape in which many of the mega-corporations that defined 20th-century commercial life are confronting a host of new business and technological challenges. These changes \u2014 in corporate leadership, on boards and across Wall Street \u2014 are recasting the very idea of industry in America.\u201cThe C.E.O. with a big office, a tenure of 10 or 20 years, in a suit and tie, is becoming a thing of the past,\u201d said Vijay Govindarajan, who served as G.E.\u2019s chief innovation consultant in 2008 and 2009 and now teaches at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business.Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit from G.E. is particularly telling, given the company\u2019s reputation as a training ground for the future chief executives of other companies. He tried to change G.E., yet couldn\u2019t react quickly enough to the forces affecting companies like his.These include the rising power of activist investors, who buy up stakes in companies and then demand changes. Activists are now hunting much bigger game, demanding double-digit annual earnings growth in a stagnant economy. Or else.That deal also shows how the digital age has upended the competitive landscape, pitting companies in vastly different industries against one another.\u201cWho ever thought Ford would be competing with Google?\u201d said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who has studied corporate leadership for decades. \u201cBut they are, and Mark Fields wasn\u2019t moving fast enough.\u201dBoards, too, have changed, evolving from country-club-like collections of the same familiar faces into a much more diverse and demanding constituency.To be sure, the money is better than ever. And pockets of unbridled ambition and occasional excess remain, especially in Silicon Valley, where Apple\u2019s new $5 billion spaceshiplike headquarters opened in April.But for most of the Fortune 500, the unquestioned power and perks, the imperviousness to criticism from the likes of shareholders, and the outsize public profile that once automatically came with the corner office have gone the way of the typewriter and the Dictaphone.\u201cThese people were bigger than life, and I saw it up close,\u201d said Kevin Sharer, a former chief executive of Amgen who worked as a top aide to Mr. Immelt\u2019s legendary predecessor at G.E., Jack Welch. \u201cThey were a combination of chief executive, statesman and rock star. They were unassailable.\u201dA Naval Academy graduate, then an officer, before joining G.E. in 1984, Mr. Sharer said the only place that evoked a feeling of power comparable to the long hallways and corner offices of Fairfield in its prime was aboard the fast attack nuclear submarines where he once served as chief engineer.\u201cWe had the confidence, the swagger, and we felt like we had unlimited industrial potential,\u201d he said. \u201cCould we buy RCA or NBC? Of course we could. I\u2019m not complaining, but this is absolutely not the case today.\u201dAs Amgen\u2019s chief executive in the spring of 2009, Mr. Sharer visited the White House repeatedly to meet with Obama administration officials as they designed what would become the Affordable Care Act. He also played a key role in getting fellow pharmaceutical industry chiefs to support the legislation.Now retired and teaching at Harvard Business School, Mr. Sharer said he would never do that today, as wading into bitterly partisan public debates offers little upside for corporate leaders, and risks damage to their company\u2019s reputation.As a result, while companies in many ways have more economic and political power than ever, \u201cchief executives now shy away from weighing in on the policy level or broader societal issues,\u201d Mr. Sharer said. \u201cThey\u2019re more focused on running their companies.\u201dThere are exceptions. Besides Mr. Immelt\u2019s outspokenness on the climate issue, last year Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck called out \u201cbad actors\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry for exorbitant price increases. Timothy D. Cook of Apple challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed immigration restrictions in January.Still, Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit leaves a void at the intersection of business and public policy, along with the retirement this year of Douglas R. Oberhelman, the Caterpillar chief who led both the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers.\u201cIf you start fooling around in Washington with the Business Roundtable or writing op-eds, activist investors will ask what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Useem said.\u201cI don\u2019t see him stepping into that role,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep his head down and focus on the numbers.\u201dAt Exxon Mobil, it\u2019s referred to as the God Pod. On the 11th floor of Procter & Gamble\u2019s headquarters in Cincinnati, there was Mahogany Row. And while the official name of the executive wing at G.E.\u2019s Fairfield headquarters was E3, inside the company it was known as Carpet Land.And no wonder. From the Persian rugs that lined the hallways to the plush wool floor covering in Mr. Immelt\u2019s office and private conference room, the carpets created the hushed atmosphere of a monastery or library.\u201cIt was so quiet, you could feel the energy drain out of you,\u201d said Ann Klee, the G.E. executive who oversaw the move to Boston and the development of its new headquarters there.What these executive aeries all shared was an Olympus-like sense of remoteness, authority and defined hierarchy.At G.E., even in Carpet Land, office size grew in lock step with rank, and the biggest corner space was reserved for the chief executive. Not only did Mr. Immelt have his own bathroom, but his two administrative assistants had a private bathroom and a pantry.The abundant perks \u2014 in G.E.\u2019s case, two helicopter pads, a shoeshine station and an executive dining room linked to the kitchen below by dumbwaiters \u2014 fed the sense of exalted status. At the same time, faster economic growth and rising earnings camouflaged the cost of these indulgences.With G.E.\u2019s profits and shares soaring in the 1980s, Mr. Welch oversaw the construction of a private 28-room hotel known as the Guest House to serve visiting executives and others, with no expense spared on the parquet floors, wood-burning fireplaces and a Steinway piano, which was left behind when the company moved out.\u201cNothing was off-the-shelf,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Brien, a 19-year G.E. veteran who helped supervise the Fairfield facility. \u201cWith Jack Welch, everything was custom and the operation was five star, spot on.\u201dAlmost 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001 and Mr. Immelt took over, G.E. shares have never regained their 2000 peak. So while Mr. Immelt successfully steered the company through a near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis, refocused it on its industrial roots and shed its ancillary businesses, it became a natural target for activist investors.One of those was Nelson Peltz, a onetime corporate raider who relied on Michael R. Milken\u2019s junk bonds for financing back when Mr. Welch was building his Guest House. Mr. Peltz has come a long way since then, having scored big wins forcing laggards like Heinz and Wendy\u2019s to improve their performance, and he acquired a $2 billion stake in G.E. in 2015.G.E.\u2019s chief communications officer, Deirdre Latour, denied that activist pressure was a factor in Mr. Immelt\u2019s decision to retire. \u201cSixteen years is a long time,\u201d she said.But at 61, Mr. Immelt is four years younger than Mr. Welch when he stepped down, and joins a long list of otherwise respected executives whose stately succession plans were seemingly interrupted by impatient investors.\u201cC.E.O. tenure is down from the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, and the G.E. situation is a reflection of that,\u201d said Jason D. Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201cWithout this outside pressure, it\u2019s likely Jeff Immelt would have served out his term and retired at 64 or 65.\u201dNow other chief executives are feeling the same pressure, including Mary T. Barra of General Motors. \u201cShe\u2019s being pulled in different directions,\u201d Mr. Schloetzer said, noting that G.M.\u2019s shares have barely budged in the last two years, even as the broader stock market has soared.If Ms. Barra can\u2019t turn things around in 12 to 18 months, Mr. Schloetzer said, she could share a fate similar to that of Mr. Fields at Ford.Indeed, Mr. Fields\u2019s defenestration was more shocking in many ways than Mr. Immelt\u2019s slow-motion fade, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management.\u201cHe\u2019s the poster child for what\u2019s happened to the C.E.O. job,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cUntil last month, people thought dynastic family capital like the Ford family was the solution to rampant short-termism. I\u2019m sorry Ford forgot that recipe.\u201dHow did activist investors acquire such outsize power over publicly traded companies?\u201cWith fewer public companies out there, any one of them is more likely to become a target of interest for one hedge fund or another,\u201d Mr. Slaughter said.At the same time, activists are getting more, well, active. More than 300 American companies were targeted by these investors in 2015, up from just over 100 in 2010, according to Mr. Useem of Wharton. They\u2019re also becoming more successful at winning board seats, as fewer companies stagger their board elections over three-year cycles.What\u2019s more, chief executives have less internal latitude. In 2001, more than half of new C.E.O.s also assumed the position of chairman when they took over. By 2016, only 10 percent occupied both roles, according to an analysis by Strategy&, the strategy and consulting arm of PwC.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the C.E.O. running the board too,\u201d said Gary L. Neilson, a principal with Strategy&. \u201cNow the C.E.O. has a boss.\u201dBoards themselves have changed, Mr. Sonnenfeld added. A few decades ago, a Pittsburgh-based giant like U.S. Steel would draw board members from a local pool of business and community leaders.\u201cThere was a downside in terms of cronyism, mutual back-scratching and a hesitance to criticize,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positive was that they were anchored in their communities and they invested in them. Now, for C.E.O.s, all the constituencies have changed.\u201dSo while boards are still willing to dole out huge golden parachutes to C.E.O.\u2019s, even if they fail, they\u2019ve become much more generous with money than they are with additional time.The glaring exception to the trends outlined by Mr. Sonnenfeld is in the technology sector. But in many ways, these firms are the exception that proves the rule, because they play by different rules.Facebook also has a multi-class stock structure that effectively guarantees that the founder Mark Zuckerberg will retain control even as he sells shares. And on this point, the company offers no apologies.The staggering profitability of the tech giants provides their leaders with more than a little of the swagger the industrial executives once possessed.In 1990, the revenues of Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers totaled $250 billion while they employed 1.2 million people, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.Silicon Valley\u2019s top three companies in 2014 had almost the same revenues before adjusting for inflation \u2014 $247 billion \u2014 but with 137,000 employees, they required a work force just one-tenth the size.That kind of efficiency adds up to huge profits, soaring stock prices and few complaints from investors. Or as Brooks C. Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown, put it, \u201cIf your stock is doing well, your job is safe.\u201dIf the old quarters for G.E.\u2019s top brass were akin to a pedestal, the new ones are more like a fishbowl. At G.E.\u2019s interim headquarters in Boston, and in the permanent one set to open next year, the offices for top leaders have glass walls that enable them to see out and, in turn, let employees see in.They are also much smaller. In Fairfield, a handful of senior G.E. leaders and their assistants occupied 44,000 square feet in the executive wing. Now the same group shares a total of just 7,800 square feet, less space than in the big mansions many C.E.O.s inhabit in places like Greenwich, Conn., or the Bay Area.\u201cIt has a much more collaborative feel, and the glass replicates the transparency of working together,\u201d said Ms. Klee, the G.E. executive. \u201cThe Fairfield campus was beautiful, but it lacked the spark you feel here. It\u2019s a different time, and we like the power and energy and creativity that comes from mixing people together.\u201dG.E.\u2019s 66-acre Fairfield campus was purchased for $31.5 million last fall by Sacred Heart University, according to Michael J. Kinney, the school\u2019s senior vice president for finance and administration.\u201cThere\u2019s not as big a need for corporate headquarters like this any more,\u201d said Mr. Kinney, who as a Kraft executive once worked in a similarly spectacular setting in the Taj Mahal-like General Foods building in Rye Brook, N.Y. \u201cThose were the days.\u201dMr. Kinney has big plans to convert the old offices into classrooms, a business incubator space and a computer engineering center, among other things. Students will be trained in hospitality at the former Guest House.As a result, the university has kept the campus in pristine condition since the last G.E. executives left. \u201cThe only things missing are the Persian rugs and the artwork,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who now serves as Sacred Heart\u2019s director of facilities.\u201cIt\u2019s such a different vibe with the kids all here,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who added that he\u2019s still getting used to people strolling around the manicured grounds rather than quietly shuttling between hushed offices.Walking around the pub in the Guest House Mr. Welch built, Mr. O\u2019Brien confessed to a little nostalgia for G.E.\u2019s glory days in Fairfield. \u201cCan\u2019t you see just see Jack running the world from here in \u201987 or \u201988?\u201dAdvertisement"}

One of the loudest political messages of the past year, across the entire ideological spectrum, has been that all promises of balance and mutual gain are actually humiliating traps, set by exploitative people still snickering in secret over how easily you fell for the last one. And so we have barreled instead into the realm of pure \u201cwinning,\u201d where there is no such harmony of interest. Either exert your power or slink home ashamed.The warning here lay not in the number of Americans who rubbernecked at this episode, but in how many were genuinely thrilled by it. A USA Today story quoted one fan as saying \u201cThe dude is awesome\u201d and that he was \u201cliving the lifestyle most of us wish we could\u201d; a woman who found Sheen\u2019s \u201crants\u201d troublesome said she was nevertheless \u201cimpressed with his honesty \u2014 so tired of the lame apologies offered by celebrities like Tiger Woods when they get caught misbehaving.\u201d These responses offered proof of concept for something critical in American life: There appeared to be a market for a public figure who, insulated by enough wealth and public approval, could stomp past all the usual lines of shame, scandal and impropriety, roaring and grinning, shouting that he did not care how anyone reacted to his behavior and could not be stopped. People would even purchase tickets to see it. It was possible \u2014 difficult, but possible \u2014 to make erratic line-crossing and unrepentant bluster look like victory.Four years later, large segments of the Republican Party seemed to agree that they were faced with a very similar problem: a vain, volatile, win-infatuated celebrity running a squalid sideshow the country couldn\u2019t help gawking at. In September 2015, early in the presidential primaries, Bobby Jindal ran an attack ad that juxtaposed clips of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign speeches (which would soon culminate in lines like \u201cWe\u2019re going to win so much, you\u2019re going to be sick and tired of winning!\u201d) with clips of Sheen bellowing about his own wins. But Trump\u2019s rallies, unlike Sheen\u2019s \u201cMy Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat Is Not an Option\u201d speaking tour, only grew in size, and his focus on the nation\u2019s win-loss record only deepened.One obvious drawback of this mind-set \u2014 a gut-level inclination toward the hyperbolic exercise of power \u2014 is that it makes winning purely about imposing your will on reality, rather than, say, reaching an outcome that\u2019s actually desirable or defensible. As a candidate, Trump promised that he alone could provide such will to the country as a whole, racking up national victories like Olympic medals. But once his administration entered the White House, these goal posts shifted with alarming speed. Suddenly it was the administration itself that needed to demonstrate a capacity for imposing its will; the entity that needed wins ceased to be the nation and became the executive branch.Hence this administration\u2019s overwhelming attention to the form of victory, whatever the actual substance underlying it. Nowhere has this been clearer than with the American Health Care Act, an astoundingly unpopular measure that, according to Politico, Trump has very little interest in the details of, as long as its passage seems impressive. When the House eventually passed its version of the bill, Trump\u2019s celebratory speech did little to mount a case that the bill would benefit American citizens; he spent far more time lauding a triumph of process. \u201cA lot of people said, how come you kept pushing health care, knowing how tough it is?\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Obamacare took 17 months.\u201d The speed of this bill\u2019s passage, he reckoned, was praiseworthy in itself: \u201cWe\u2019ve really been doing this for eight weeks, if you think about it.\u201dBut this is a very strange measure of victory. This kind of winning doesn\u2019t set goals and then judge success by how much progress is made toward achieving them. Its focus is entirely on reputation and status and the superficial image of power. Sometimes it picks goals based on ease. Sometimes it achieves things at random and then claims they were goals. If all else fails, it just declares victory and sits back looking satisfied \u2014 as when Trump recently announced that \u201cwith few exceptions\u201d there has never in history been a president who has \u201cdone more things.\u201d After all, if you really do hold the almost feudal belief that there are two kinds of people \u2014 those ordained by nature to dominate and the losers upon whom they exercise their prerogatives \u2014 what do the details matter, as long as you\u2019ve claimed a seat among the winners?Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for The Times Magazine.Advertisement"}

Wrapping and sealing your device in padded plastic before packing it helps protect it from potentially rough handling and can also provide a clue as to whether the device was opened when it was out of your sight.

{"Headline": "For Officers in Fatal Shootings, an Unseen \u2018Grieving Process\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 There is a grim routine to the police shootings that have divided this country in recent years. First, we learn the names and ages of the deceased. We see them smiling in old family photos. We watch as their names trend on Twitter: Michael Brown, Philando Castile, Tamir Rice.A day \u2014 or maybe a week \u2014 later, the officer who fired the fatal shots is identified. We examine the officer\u2019s background and scrutinize body camera footage. The officer\u2019s name circulates on social media, often alongside labels like \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201cpig.\u201dAgainst the backdrop of widespread racial disparities in policing, with reams of evidence that African-Americans are more likely to be stopped, searched and killed by law enforcement officials, many view these officers as predators to whom the normal rules do not apply. To others, they are honorable men and women victimized by the political climate and skewered over a hard decision made in a split second.The officers themselves are rarely heard from. Overnight pariahs, they hunker down in a state of semi-seclusion \u2014 turning in their guns, shutting off their cellphones, living with the fact that they caused a death. And though they are usually cleared in the criminal arena, the reckoning, both personal and professional, can continue long after the public\u2019s attention has shifted to the next shooting.In St. Paul and Cincinnati, trials have begun for police officers involved in high-profile shooting deaths of black men during traffic stops. Other cases continue to unfold: Last week, the Cleveland officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice in 2014 was fired. In recent weeks, administrative charges were filed against five of the Baltimore police officers involved in the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. In Oklahoma, jurors acquitted Officer Betty Jo Shelby of manslaughter in the 2016 death of Terence Crutcher, the unarmed black man she shot and killed along a Tulsa roadway.\u201cThe night of the shooting, I shut down my Facebook account, deleted all news apps, kept the TV off at home and handed my phone to my husband,\u201d Officer Shelby recalled recently.As she awaited trial with her salary suspended, Officer Shelby found herself on the unfamiliar end of the criminal justice system. Like many people accused of serious crimes, she was unable to find temporary work. She and her husband, Dave, braced for the possibility of her spending decades in the state penitentiary. She planned how to explain that to her 4-year-old grandson, Luke.\u201cI made it clear that I didn\u2019t want Luke to come to the prison if that\u2019s where I was,\u201d Officer Shelby said. \u201cBut I wanted Dave to share the truth with Luke and to explain that actions have consequences.\u201dShe also went through a \u201cgrieving process\u201d over Mr. Crutcher\u2019s death, she said.Suddenly the worst kind of local celebrity, she feared for her safety and rarely left home except to attend church or meet with her lawyers. A man pleaded guilty to making a death threat against her.All that was reflective of the controversy around the shooting and police violence in general, with rising public anger over episode after episode in which video evidence contradicted official explanations.Officer Shelby\u2019s case was murkier than many others, but the shooting still defied easy explanation.She encountered Mr. Crutcher on a city street, followed him back to his car and yelled commands that he ignored. Before she fired, she said, she thought Mr. Crutcher was reaching for a gun through the car window. The gun turned out not to exist.At her trial, Officer Shelby testified that she had fired because \u201cI meet a gun with a gun.\u201d But her explanation was panned by prosecutors, who argued that she acted unreasonably and misjudged the threat.\u201cIn this situation, though,\u201d the prosecutor, Kevin Gray, responded, \u201cyou\u2019re not meeting a gun with a gun. You\u2019re meeting a guess about a gun with a gun.\u201dMr. Crutcher\u2019s family called the shooting unjustified, urging jurors to convict.Shannon McMurray, Officer Shelby\u2019s lawyer, said that her client\u2019s actions were reasonable and that prosecutors \u201cwere so concerned with civil unrest that they just charged her.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt was just a bad time for a police shooting.\u201dMuch of the public outrage has centered on what is seen as a failure to hold officers criminally accountable for their actions, resulting in mistrust that can taint even earnest attempts to reach a just outcome. But even in cases where criminal charges never materialize, officers can face an array of other consequences, including civil lawsuits and job loss.In Chicago, Officer Robert Rialmo \u2014 who in 2015 fatally shot a black teenager wielding a baseball bat and an innocent, African-American bystander \u2014 braced for the investigation and news media scrutiny even before he left the scene.\u201cI knew it was going to be a huge deal,\u201d Officer Rialmo recalled recently. \u201cI knew that right away.\u201dThe month before, another Chicago officer had been charged with first-degree murder in the shooting of another black teenager, Laquan McDonald, touching off weeks of protests.Officer Rialmo\u2019s case became national news. Mayor Rahm Emanuel flew home early from a Caribbean vacation to deal with the fallout. The police superintendent announced a new policy that would bench Officer Rialmo and all officers involved in future shootings for at least 30 days.\u201cI understood why,\u201d said Officer Rialmo, who more than 500 days later remains on desk duty, awaiting the results of an investigation by the city\u2019s police review agency, which could lead to discipline or dismissal. \u201cBut it was frustrating. It still is frustrating for me.\u201dIn an interview last month, Officer Rialmo said he was at peace with his decision to shoot, but was not unaffected by the results. \u201cI knew that I wasn\u2019t taking that bat upside the head,\u201d he said.It was clear that he drew a sharp distinction between the two lives he took. He said Quintonio LeGrier, the teenager with the baseball bat, had left him no choice but to open fire.\u201cHer death was his fault,\u201d Officer Rialmo said, referring to the bystander and recalling something that he said a Police Department psychologist had told him. \u201cI understood that. I knew that right away. I know that now.\u201dOfficer Rialmo faces lawsuits from the estates of Mr. LeGrier and the bystander, Bettie Jones, whose lawyers have each disputed his version of events.\u201cHe took a great woman from us that we can never get back,\u201d said Latisha Jones, Ms. Jones\u2019s daughter, on the day that prosecutors announced that Officer Rialmo would not be charged.Officer Rialmo said that he felt terrible for members of the Jones family and that he understood their anger toward him. But he chooses not to dwell on her death.\u201cI can\u2019t really sit back and think about, \u2018Wow, some innocent lady is dead because of me,\u2019\u201d Officer Rialmo said. \u201cI can\u2019t do that because it would just mess with my head, to be honest.\u201dHe sued the estate of Mr. LeGrier, blaming the teenager for the emotional trauma that came with killing a bystander. He sued the city, contending that it had provided him inadequate training to handle Mr. LeGrier\u2019s mental health issues. And he spoke openly about the \u201cbig relief\u201d that came when prosecutors announced in February that he would not be charged.Officer Rialmo\u2019s career remains in limbo. Last summer, he was returned to patrol and spent months as part of a roving team in some of the city\u2019s highest-crime neighborhoods. When higher-ups found out, he was put back behind a desk.Though Officer Rialmo avoided criminal charges, prosecutors have shown a greater willingness in recent years to present police shooting cases to a jury.In Ohio, Ray Tensing, a former University of Cincinnati police officer, is facing his second trial on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of Samuel DuBose, an unarmed black man whose death in 2015 was recorded by a body camera. The first trial last year ended with a hung jury.In Minnesota, Officer Jeronimo Yanez faces a second-degree manslaughter charge in the death of Mr. Castile, whom he pulled over and fatally shot last summer in the suburb of Falcon Heights. Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend streamed the aftermath on Facebook. In the courtroom on Monday, dashboard camera video and audio of the shooting were played publicly for the first time.During both trials, prosecutors will frame the shootings as unnecessary and criminal. Defense lawyers will call the officers\u2019 decisions reasonable and in line with their training.\u201cIf we lose, I wouldn\u2019t want to be a cop,\u201d said Earl Gray, a lawyer for Officer Yanez.In Oklahoma, days after her trial concluded, Officer Shelby went back to work. But she is not patrolling the streets of Tulsa anymore, and instead has been assigned a desk job.\u201cShe\u2019s alive, but her life passion is behind her,\u201d said Ms. McMurray, her lawyer.Officer Shelby tried to put a happier spin on the situation.

It garnered 67 likes in two days.At 136-49 Roosevelt Avenue, sandwiched between a video-game store and a bubble tea counter, Ruimilk appears no more than six feet wide. Most customers linger for only a moment by the three small tables, which serve as set furniture for customers as they photograph their confections.Proud parents photograph their children holding the desserts as if they were trophies or straight-A report cards. On a recent Saturday, two little girls in full-skirted dresses showed the camera all of their teeth. The same afternoon, a toddler with a bowl cut sat smiling as she waited to devour the Hello Kitty clone on the table in front of her.

His goal was, and still is, to bring \u201chappy smiles\u201d to customers\u2019 faces, he said in Chinese through a translator. He added that he chose to open his business in Flushing because of the area\u2019s ethnic diversity.The shop sells juices and smoothies made from natural ingredients, but the presentation of the drinks looks much more synthetic: The Galaxy beverage series features swirling colors illuminated by a flashing light planted inside the cup. Each drink is named for a city famous for its impressive skyline: the New York, the Seoul, the Tokyo, the Hong Kong, the Los Angeles.Other cotton-candy-and-soft-serve options include the Baymax, a white creature that resembles the Abominable Snowman, and the Air Balloon, a hot-air balloon fashioned with the help of Pocky biscuit sticks.A walk down Roosevelt Avenue with the Tutu Hoop \u2014 a classic cone made less classic with the addition of a pink cotton candy tutu, a sprinkling of popping candy and a drizzle of fruity red syrup \u2014 will earn some warranted stares.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Upscale Food and Gear Bring Campsite Cooking Out of the Wild", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byNow, distance backpackers pour French-press coffee into $60 double-walled titanium cups and make beer on the trail from concentrate fizzed up with citric acid and potassium bicarbonate. Car campers tuck chorizo, kale and sweet potatoes into custom hobo packs, and simmer cumin-scented breakfast shakshuka in camp kitchens that come assembled with sinks and paper-towel holders.And if your phone dies while you are enjoying the wilderness, a tiny stove fed with twigs can convert that heat to electricity and charge it.With visits to national parks setting records for three years in a row, and the rise of both culinary skills and the drive to document every meal on social media, the nation\u2019s campsite cooking has taken a quantum leap.\u201cWe\u2019re in a golden age of camp cooking, with food that\u2019s fresh, inventive and a cut above, both in flavor and in style,\u201d said Ms. Johnson, a veteran camper who is newly enamored of camp caf\u00e9s au lait made with a battery-powered milk frother.The number of camp cooks is growing, too. A million more American households have headed into the woods every year since 2014, according to a survey by the research company Nielsen Scarborough, and an estimated 13 million plan to camp more often in 2017 than they did last year.Many of them are sophisticated eaters looking to nail a great meal in a remote setting.She is one of more than 10 million Americans who backpack, many of them relying on spreadsheets, grids and calorie charts to plan a trip\u2019s worth of meals light enough to carry on their backs but nutritionally dense enough to provide sufficient fuel to keep hiking.The classic hard-core ultralight backpacker may chop off the handle of a spoon to save a few grams, or eat instant coffee instead of wasting time and fuel boiling water. But for others who carry supper on their backs, food quality outweighs ounce-counting.\u201cI see a lot of hikers who are very reluctant to give up good food as they go into the outdoors,\u201d Ms. Aksamit said.During a recent overnight car trip to a campsite not far from Lake Tahoe, they brought a bottle of Bandol ros\u00e9, two flatiron steaks, some English peas, farro and maitake mushrooms. Just to keep warm, they tucked in a flask of plum brandy a friend\u2019s uncle had made.Advice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.Their menu for backpacking trips, like the one they are about to take outside Nagano, Japan, is built on resealable silicone bags filled with dried food they will reconstitute with boiling water from a small, fuel-efficient stove.The base of their one-bag supper might be rice noodles or broken jasmine rice seasoned with custom spice blends and maybe some Happy Chicken Chinese bouillon, whose taste reminds Ms. Peng of her childhood. They\u2019ll add bits of salami or nori or some crunchy dried Japanese snacks, like the sweet, salty dried shrimp she has been partial to lately.When it\u2019s time to eat, they pour in the boiling water, seal the bag, then tuck it into a coat or a beanie to keep things hot.\u201cThe key is to really break things up into the smallest pieces as you can,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t hope to have perfect long noodles backpacking. The best you can hope for is a close approximation at the end.\u201dThe point is to avoid packaged freeze-dried food. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive, a lot of the backpacking food that we\u2019ve eaten,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it literally tastes like melted plastic.\u201dHer dehydrated versions of gluten-free penne with marinara sauce and Thai curry sell for $12.50 for two servings. She bagged 196 meals the first year. This month alone, her company has packaged 45,000.Plenty of people are dehydrating their own food, creating recipes that are far more delicious than what campers used to eat.Although rehydrated Bolognese might not sound appealing, a meal that might taste just O.K. at home tastes great after a day of hiking, said Ms. Ohm, 45.Dehydrated meat is not what many cooks envision when they head to the woods. They want a smoke-kissed meal cooked over a campfire in a cast-iron pot.Their approach is lighter and simpler, both in recipes and equipment. They are fans of the old-school two-burner Coleman stove, which allows them to make a good meal in places that don\u2019t allow fires and offers the flexibility to prepare chilaquiles for breakfast; hot, fresh flatbread for lunch; and spicy dal with red lentils, kale and fresh ginger for dinner.\u201cThere really is this sense of accomplishment you feel to pull off a really good meal in a small, simple camp kitchen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just simple, good food that tastes so much better outdoors.\u201dThen again, perhaps not so simple. Ms. Brones brings a hand grinder and coffee beans, along with a titanium French press.She is part of a revolution in camp coffee, said J. J. Jameson, 56, a senior instructor for REI Outdoor School, who took his first backpacking trip when he was 17. Last year, he and REI\u2019s other instructors taught 350,000 people how to do things outdoors, including cook.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from logs on the fire and one skillet and cowboy coffee to much more elaborate cooking styles,\u201d he said.Campers are demanding better coffee and drinking more of it, filling 20-ounce insulated mugs. \u201cOne person might dump the whole pot into their mug,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has become a thing that didn\u2019t used to be a thing.\u201dMr. Shute, 57, still makes old-fashioned coffee by adding loose grounds to a pot of water over a campfire. And \u201cas simple as it sounds, one of our favorite meals in the backcountry remains a big pot of mac and cheese,\u201d he said.What matters is not what\u2019s in the pot, but the process.\u201cAll of our meals are shared, from gathering the wood to problem-solving to joining together to eat together around the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThat meal really connects you to a place, which is meaningful. That is why you are in the woods.\u201dAn earlier version of this article and an accompanying picture caption misstated the given name of the chef de cuisine at the Slanted Door.

{"Headline": "In Court, Diamond Reynolds Recounts Moments Before a Police Shooting", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byWithin hours, millions had watched her video, and the death of Ms. Reynolds\u2019s boyfriend, Philando Castile, was international news.From the witness stand on Tuesday, she recounted the moment last July 6 when Officer Yanez, 29, began shooting, and dabbed away tears as prosecutors played a police dashboard-camera video from the encounter \u2014 as well as the video Ms. Reynolds had captured from inside the car.\u201cI felt broken, hurt, confused, lost,\u201d Ms. Reynolds told the 15 jurors, at least two of whom also wiped their eyes as they watched the videos.Ms. Reynolds spent hours on the stand, starting late Monday and continuing through much of Tuesday morning. She said that she had reached for her phone and started recording because she feared Officer Yanez might also hurt her or her daughter, and that she wanted there to be evidence if he did.\u201cI know that the people are not protected against the police,\u201d Ms. Reynolds said.Through dozens of questions from prosecutors and defense lawyers, Ms. Reynolds responded in even, firm tones, often repeating the phrase, \u201cThat is correct.\u201d Her testimony also offered a fuller portrait of a woman the public had come to know from her video that day.Ms. Reynolds said she moved as a girl with her family to Minnesota from Chicago seeking a better life. She attended high school here, but did not receive a diploma, and spent time in homeless shelters before meeting and moving in with Mr. Castile, a longtime cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district.Ms. Reynolds said Mr. Castile embraced her and became \u201ca father figure\u201d to her young daughter, Dae\u2019Anna, now 5. He would read the girl books and make sure she had a healthy breakfast. Jurors saw a photo of Mr. Castile and Dae\u2019Anna celebrating her birthday at the Mall of America.\u201cHe was a friend to her,\u201d Ms. Reynolds said. \u201cHe was a role model.\u201dOn the day of the shooting, Ms. Reynolds said Mr. Castile went to work, then got his hair fixed. Separately, Ms. Reynolds took public transit to drop her daughter off at preschool that morning and traveled to her job at a dollar store. Later that day, Ms. Reynolds said she and her sister smoked marijuana, picked up Dae\u2019Anna from preschool and met up with Mr. Castile in the evening to go grocery shopping.Earl Gray, a lawyer for Officer Yanez, questioned Ms. Reynolds at length about her marijuana use. Ms. Reynolds said she and Mr. Castile smoked marijuana daily, and had done so for years. She admitted that there was marijuana in the car at the time Officer Yanez pulled them over, but she said they had not been smoking.In court on Tuesday, Officer Joseph Kauser, Officer Yanez\u2019s partner, testified that he did not see a gun in Mr. Castile\u2019s car, did not smell the burned marijuana described by Officer Yanez and was not alarmed by the situation until his colleague started shooting.\u201cI did not feel threatened at that point from where I was standing,\u201d Officer Kauser said of the moment right before the shooting.But Officer Kauser, a college classmate and longtime friend of Officer Yanez, praised his partner\u2019s character and said he believed Officer Yanez acted appropriately. Officer Yanez\u2019s lawyers have said their client feared for his life and will testify in his own defense.Mr. Castile, who had a permit to carry a pistol, told Officer Yanez during the traffic stop that he had a firearm with him. The trial rests largely on whether jurors believe Officer Yanez\u2019s claim that Mr. Castile was grabbing for that gun, or whether they believe Ms. Reynolds\u2019s statement that her boyfriend was simply reaching for his wallet.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Food, a Plate, a Room. That\u2019s Enough at King, in SoHo.", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The restaurant, which opened in September, is not a show-off. The dining room is small, tidy and nearly square, painted the pale color of butter in the winter. Windows stretching to the ceiling along the north wall look out on the dormered Federal townhouses of King Street. The facing wall is broken up with a single abstract painting, a doorway to the kitchen and a long opening behind which the four people who make up the entire kitchen staff can be seen at work. It is a room content with being just a room, and letting you focus on the people you\u2019re with and the food that\u2019s on the plate.After this gift from the kitchen, an order of panisse may seem redundant. It isn\u2019t. At King, these chickpea fritters are long, thin tongues that puff up like pommes souffl\u00e9s and are scented all over by fried sage. They\u2019re beautiful. They were on the menu last month, but they may not stay long.Nothing does. King\u2019s two chefs, Jess Shadbolt and Clare de Boer, cook a different slate of dishes each night. The changes tend to be evolutionary, drawing from a fixed repertoire of ideas. The first time I had halibut there, it was grilled, and its skin had been deeply charred without drying out the rich white meat right under it. The plate was filled out with spinach and white coco beans soft enough to mash with a spoon.The next time I ate halibut at King, it was poached, the beans were back and the greens had been replaced with small artichoke hearts simmered in white wine and amaranth. I\u2019ll eat either dish again in a minute if the chefs give me a chance.Anybody who\u2019s eaten at that restaurant or has gone to bed with one of its cookbooks will experience occasional flashbacks at King. Polenta and almond flour go into a classic River Cafe dessert and into a different one that recurs at King. If you see it on the menu, especially if it is weighted with nectarines, pounce.Chefs can\u2019t get far on imitation. They need to understand the how and why of things, and Ms. Shadbolt and Ms. de Boer do. Once you get past King\u2019s debt to River Cafe, what you really notice is how many little moves they know that can raise a recipe from good to exceptional.Olive oil blended with nettles is an excellent sauce for boiled fingerling potatoes. What makes King\u2019s even better is that a few fingerlings have been crushed into the pur\u00e9e, so from time to time you bite into a chunk of potato hiding inside the sauce. This was a side dish that traveled alongside a guinea hen, roasted whole with a bath of verdicchio in the bottom of the pan. Wilted nettles sprawled over its crisp skin. With a squeeze of lemon, it was one of the most appealing guinea hens I had ever come across.If you eat at King often, you can see the chefs making subtle adjustments to keep flavors in balance. Ravioli under spring peas and raw pea shoots were filled with minimally seasoned ricotta one week. The next, the ricotta inside floppy tortellini got an extra spur from lemon zest. The citrus might have stepped on the sweetness of the peas, but it helped the tortellini, because the only competition on the plate was fresh marjoram.And when some new seasonal ingredient appears on the scene, you can see the chefs strike like cobras. Saltwort, the salt-marsh-loving succulent that Italians call agretti, was the exciting foundation for a May salad built with wild arugula and raw ovals of asparagus stalks, making one of their first appearances of the year. Salty goldenrod bottarga was shaved over everything, even the white rim of the plate.At King, the vision extends to how to drink. Annie Shi, who superintends the dining room and is a third business partner with the chefs, can offer guidance with the wine list. She favors French and Italian producers, many of them not quite famous, whose wines gracefully weave in and around the cooking.At the compact bar by the front door, cocktails are put together with the simplicity and respect for aperitif wines that you find in Italy. There is a kir and a sbagliato, which is nothing more than Campari and red vermouth on the rocks topped up with prosecco. These and other drinks slip into the bloodstream without knocking the palate out of alignment.The desserts are cafe style. They don\u2019t look like extraterrestrial landscapes but rather recognizable slices and scoops.One of the few things at King that didn\u2019t make perfect sense was a tiramis\u00f9; it went too heavy on the espresso and too light on the mascarpone. Every other dessert was just what I wanted, even when I didn\u2019t know I wanted it. Chilled, thickened cream flavored with Pernod? I\u2019m a fan now. I\u2019m also a new convert to something called the Colonel. It\u2019s a cup of lemon granita served with a tiny pitcher of cold vodka. You pour one over the other.I have no idea why the vodka makes the granita taste better, but it does.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}

Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Yahoo\u2019s share price rose by $5.16 after the vote on Thursday, to close at $55.71. That will raise the payouts to Yahoo employees who are terminated.Other senior Yahoo executives who are laid off will also get big severance packages, including up to two years of pay and accelerated vesting of all stock compensation.

{"Headline": "The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "Supported byOpinionBEIJING \u2014 What worries you about the coming world of artificial intelligence?Too often the answer to this question resembles the plot of a sci-fi thriller. People worry that developments in A.I. will bring about the \u201csingularity\u201d \u2014 that point in history when A.I. surpasses human intelligence, leading to an unimaginable revolution in human affairs. Or they wonder whether instead of our controlling artificial intelligence, it will control us, turning us, in effect, into cyborgs.These are interesting issues to contemplate, but they are not pressing. They concern situations that may not arise for hundreds of years, if ever. At the moment, there is no known path from our best A.I. tools (like the Google computer program that recently beat the world\u2019s best player of the game of Go) to \u201cgeneral\u201d A.I. \u2014 self-aware computer programs that can engage in common-sense reasoning, attain knowledge in multiple domains, feel, express and understand emotions and so on.This doesn\u2019t mean we have nothing to worry about. On the contrary, the A.I. products that now exist are improving faster than most people realize and promise to radically transform our world, not always for the better. They are only tools, not a competing form of intelligence. But they will reshape what work means and how wealth is created, leading to unprecedented economic inequalities and even altering the global balance of power.It is imperative that we turn our attention to these imminent challenges.What is artificial intelligence today? Roughly speaking, it\u2019s technology that takes in huge amounts of information from a specific domain (say, loan repayment histories) and uses it to make a decision in a specific case (whether to give an individual a loan) in the service of a specified goal (maximizing profits for the lender). Think of a spreadsheet on steroids, trained on big data. These tools can outperform human beings at a given task.This kind of A.I. is spreading to thousands of domains (not just loans), and as it does, it will eliminate many jobs. Bank tellers, customer service representatives, telemarketers, stock and bond traders, even paralegals and radiologists will gradually be replaced by such software. Over time this technology will come to control semiautonomous and autonomous hardware like self-driving cars and robots, displacing factory workers, construction workers, drivers, delivery workers and many others.Unlike the Industrial Revolution and the computer revolution, the A.I. revolution is not taking certain jobs (artisans, personal assistants who use paper and typewriters) and replacing them with other jobs (assembly-line workers, personal assistants conversant with computers). Instead, it is poised to bring about a wide-scale decimation of jobs \u2014 mostly lower-paying jobs, but some higher-paying ones, too.This transformation will result in enormous profits for the companies that develop A.I., as well as for the companies that adopt it. Imagine how much money a company like Uber would make if it used only robot drivers. Imagine the profits if Apple could manufacture its products without human labor. Imagine the gains to a loan company that could issue 30 million loans a year with virtually no human involvement. (As it happens, my venture capital firm has invested in just such a loan company.)We are thus facing two developments that do not sit easily together: enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands and enormous numbers of people out of work. What is to be done?Part of the answer will involve educating or retraining people in tasks A.I. tools aren\u2019t good at. Artificial intelligence is poorly suited for jobs involving creativity, planning and \u201ccross-domain\u201d thinking \u2014 for example, the work of a trial lawyer. But these skills are typically required by high-paying jobs that may be hard to retrain displaced workers to do. More promising are lower-paying jobs involving the \u201cpeople skills\u201d that A.I. lacks: social workers, bartenders, concierges \u2014 professions requiring nuanced human interaction. But here, too, there is a problem: How many bartenders does a society really need?The solution to the problem of mass unemployment, I suspect, will involve \u201cservice jobs of love.\u201d These are jobs that A.I. cannot do, that society needs and that give people a sense of purpose. Examples include accompanying an older person to visit a doctor, mentoring at an orphanage and serving as a sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 or, potentially soon, Virtual Reality Anonymous (for those addicted to their parallel lives in computer-generated simulations). The volunteer service jobs of today, in other words, may turn into the real jobs of the future.Other volunteer jobs may be higher-paying and professional, such as compassionate medical service providers who serve as the \u201chuman interface\u201d for A.I. programs that diagnose cancer. In all cases, people will be able to choose to work fewer hours than they do now.Who will pay for these jobs? Here is where the enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands comes in. It strikes me as unavoidable that large chunks of the money created by A.I. will have to be transferred to those whose jobs have been displaced. This seems feasible only through Keynesian policies of increased government spending, presumably raised through taxation on wealthy companies.As for what form that social welfare would take, I would argue for a conditional universal basic income: welfare offered to those who have a financial need, on the condition they either show an effort to receive training that would make them employable or commit to a certain number of hours of \u201cservice of love\u201d voluntarism.To fund this, tax rates will have to be high. The government will not only have to subsidize most people\u2019s lives and work; it will also have to compensate for the loss of individual tax revenue previously collected from employed individuals.This leads to the final and perhaps most consequential challenge of A.I. The Keynesian approach I have sketched out may be feasible in the United States and China, which will have enough successful A.I. businesses to fund welfare initiatives via taxes. But what about other countries?They face two insurmountable problems. First, most of the money being made from artificial intelligence will go to the United States and China. A.I. is an industry in which strength begets strength: The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product. It\u2019s a virtuous circle, and the United States and China have already amassed the talent, market share and data to set it in motion.For example, the Chinese speech-recognition company iFlytek and several Chinese face-recognition companies such as Megvii and SenseTime have become industry leaders, as measured by market capitalization. The United States is spearheading the development of autonomous vehicles, led by companies like Google, Tesla and Uber. As for the consumer internet market, seven American or Chinese companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are making extensive use of A.I. and expanding operations to other countries, essentially owning those A.I. markets. It seems American businesses will dominate in developed markets and some developing markets, while Chinese companies will win in most developing markets.The other challenge for many countries that are not China or the United States is that their populations are increasing, especially in the developing world. While a large, growing population can be an economic asset (as in China and India in recent decades), in the age of A.I. it will be an economic liability because it will comprise mostly displaced workers, not productive ones.So if most countries will not be able to tax ultra-profitable A.I. companies to subsidize their workers, what options will they have? I foresee only one: Unless they wish to plunge their people into poverty, they will be forced to negotiate with whichever country supplies most of their A.I. software \u2014 China or the United States \u2014 to essentially become that country\u2019s economic dependent, taking in welfare subsidies in exchange for letting the \u201cparent\u201d nation\u2019s A.I. companies continue to profit from the dependent country\u2019s users. Such economic arrangements would reshape today\u2019s geopolitical alliances.One way or another, we are going to have to start thinking about how to minimize the looming A.I.-fueled gap between the haves and the have-nots, both within and between nations. Or to put the matter more optimistically: A.I. is presenting us with an opportunity to rethink economic inequality on a global scale. These challenges are too far-ranging in their effects for any nation to isolate itself from the rest of the world.Kai-Fu Lee is the chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm, and the president of its Artificial Intelligence Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Sets New Policies to Curb Extremist Videos", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "Supported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 YouTube has struggled for years with videos that promote offensive viewpoints but do not necessarily violate the company\u2019s guidelines for removal. Now it is taking a new approach: Bury them.Under the policy change, Google said offensive videos that did not meet its standard for removal \u2014 for example, videos promoting the subjugation of religions or races without inciting violence \u2014 would come with a warning and could not be monetized with advertising, or be recommended, endorsed or commented on by users. Such videos were already not allowed to include advertising, but they were not restricted in any other way.Google said it would rely on the specialized knowledge of groups with experts on issues like hate speech, self-harm and terrorism. The company also said it planned to work with counter-extremist groups to help identify content aimed at radicalizing or recruiting extremists.By allowing anyone to upload videos to YouTube, Google has created a thriving video platform that appeals to people with a wide range of interests. But it has also become a magnet for extremist groups that can reach a wide audience for their racist or intolerant views. Google has long wrestled with how to curb that type of content while not inhibiting the freedom that makes YouTube popular.Part of the challenge is the sheer volume of videos uploaded to YouTube. The company has said that more than 400 hours of video content is uploaded to the site every minute, and YouTube has been unable to police that content in real time. Users flag offensive videos for review, while the company\u2019s algorithms comb the site for potential problems. Videos with nudity, graphic violence or copyrighted material are usually taken down quickly.In the aftermath of terror attacks in Manchester and London, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain criticized large internet companies for providing the \u201csafe space\u201d that allows radical ideologies to spread. According to news media reports, friends and relatives of Khuram Shazad Butt, identified as one of the three knife-wielding attackers on London Bridge, were worried about the influence of YouTube videos of sermons by Ahmad Musa Jibril, an Islamic cleric from Dearborn, Mich.A spokesman for YouTube said the new policies were not the result of any single violent episode, but part of an effort to improve its service. Google did not respond to a question about whether Mr. Jibril\u2019s videos would fall under Google\u2019s guidelines for videos containing inflammatory language but not violating its policies. Mr. Jibril still has videos on YouTube, but without ads.In its blog post, Google acknowledged that \u201cmore needs to be done\u201d to remove terrorism-related content from its service. YouTube said it would do more in \u201ccounter-radicalization\u201d efforts, including targeting potential Islamic State recruits with videos that could change their minds about joining the organization. Google said that in previous counter-radicalization attempts, users clicked on ads at an \u201cunusually high rate\u201d to watch videos that debunk terrorism recruitment messages.Google also announced a series of measures aimed at identifying extremist videos more quickly, an effort that the company started this year as YouTube tries to assure advertisers that its platform is safe for their marketing dollars.Brands such as AT&T and Enterprise Rent-A-Car pulled ads from YouTube. Google responded by changing the types of videos that can carry advertising, blocking ads on videos with hate speech or discriminatory content. Google also created a system to allow advertisers to exclude specific sites and channels in YouTube and Google\u2019s display network.Advertisement"}

A.N.U. introduced a sexual consent training course for all first-year students this year, said Richard Baker, pro vice chancellor of the university.How are public institutions in Australia responding to sexual assault and sexual harassment? To inform our coverage, we\u2019re asking readers to contribute their stories.The Australian Human Rights Commission is also conducting a survey of 39,000 students at 39 Australian universities to map the full extent of the problem.But many students question the universities\u2019 commitment. They say that it is still common for complaints to linger without a university response; for men accused of, say, rating women\u2019s bodies on social media to receive little punishment; and for there to be little coordination at a national level.The activists say their demands are reasonable: a university hotline that offers help from a trained trauma professional, required sexual consent training and a clear and transparent system for adjudicating complaints.At Sydney University, for example, the Safer Communities Working Group set up more than a year ago in part to deal with sexual assault is seen by some students as window dressing.\u201cI was pretty hopeful, maybe na\u00efvely, coming into it, thinking we could bring students\u2019 concerns there and they would be addressed,\u201d said Anna Hush, 23, a philosophy student who was part of the group last year. \u201cBut it was much more them telling us what they were doing rather than us contributing to decisions being made.\u201dKatie Thorburn, 22, the student government co-women\u2019s officer at Sydney University, said that school officials initially resisted a pilot program for sexual consent education, then bristled at questions about why they ended up choosing a voluntary quiz in which students could skip questions to reach the end.\u201cThey\u2019re tougher on plagiarism,\u201d Ms. Thorburn said.A Sydney University spokeswoman said they would review that concern as the program was used more widely.Some men on campus acknowledged a wider problem \u2014 \u201cthe treatment of women as sex objects first,\u201d as Harry Licence, 20, a second-year media and communications student, put it.In the most recent scandal, a student at St. Paul\u2019s, an elite residential college, posted a screed on Facebook comparing sex with large women to \u201charpooning a whale\u201d and offering advice on how to \u201cget rid of some chick\u201d after \u201crooting\u201d her.Mr. Licence, who has friends at St. Paul\u2019s, said that wherever privileged students from all-boys schools are concentrated, there is a lack of experience with treating women as equals.\u201cI think there are significant issues that come from living within that bubble,\u201d he said.In Canberra, Ms. Jones is still dealing with the consequences of that insularity.The \u201cEagle Rock\u201d incident happened on the dance floor of a bar in her former residential college, Burton and Garran, during a mixer last August. Ever since she wrote in April about the criticism she received after speaking out about it, she has not felt welcome there.Residents of her dorm started blasting \u201cEagle Rock,\u201d a 1971 Australian rock song often played at rugby games and bars, down the hallways. Some of her friends stopped talking to her and ignored her in the dining hall, common tactics, experts say.At A.N.U., officials have been grappling for more than a year with sexist incidents, especially in its residential colleges, most of which are independently governed living quarters, similar to American fraternities and sororities.Last year, university officials discovered a secret online group started by students at John XXIII, a prestigious Catholic residential college, who were sharing pictures of students\u2019 breasts and rating them on Facebook.In March, four male students there were caught chanting graphic sexual rhymes about \u201cnailing\u201d women.In both cases, the students were disciplined, and some suspended. Burton and Garran Hall has also officially prohibited the encircling of women when \u201cEagle Rock\u201d is played.Jane O\u2019Dwyer, an Australian National spokeswoman, said the university was working to address a nationwide problem. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural issue in Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a hypermasculine society.\u201dThat culture, advocates say, means serious cases still go unpunished.\u201cWe all know women who have been raped,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cWhat ends up usually happening to the perpetrator is they just either do nothing or move them to another college. It reminds me of the way the Catholic Church moved the priests along.\u201dThe End Rape on Campus report, based on public records at 27 of the country\u2019s universities, found that 575 complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault made to Australian universities in the last five years resulted in only six expulsions.Australian National officials say they are still trying to improve their response to the problem.\u201cThe university is reviewing all of its policies and procedures to see if we can further enhance their transparency and fairness,\u201d Professor Baker said.But the universities have a long way to go if they want to cleanse the toxic atmosphere that drove a Sydney University student to the brink last fall.Then the personal photos that decorated her dorm door started disappearing, one a day.\u201cWhat hurt so much was the fact that people I lived with, whom I had come to think of as my family, would purposely try to make me feel like scum,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were trying, albeit in a pretty pathetic and cowardly way, to run me out of my home.\u201dFinally, when there was only one picture left, Ms. Landis-Hanley took it down herself.As she wrote on Facebook, \u201cI was taken to hospital that night for being suicidal.\u201dJacqueline Williams reported from Canberra, and Damien Cave from Sydney.Advertisement"}

Amazon\u2019s booming cloud services business has become a contractor to the government.

But Not Entirely Intrepid.", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 For the fourth time in 12 weeks I marked myself safe on Facebook. In Britain.It was Wednesday morning, and Londoners had reason to be a bit optimistic.Once again, my phone buzzed with frantic messages, not just from editors, but from anxious family and friends abroad: \u201cAre you O.K.??\u201dLondon is O.K. (just ask a Londoner) and mostly feels normal. Mostly. Police with machine guns patrol train stations. There are steel and concrete barriers lining major bridges now to protect pedestrians. When I bike to work, across Waterloo Bridge, I find myself planning my escape if a car comes charging. My children\u2019s school sent out a note, saying it was reviewing planned class trips into central London and will \u201cbe avoiding travel on the underground and public transport.\u201dI found myself wondering: Is this what they call the new normal?It is not so much that Londoners are changing their lives in response to terrorism. It is more that terrorism has become part of life in London. Nervous glances passing between passengers on a subway car when the train gets stuck in the tunnel for a little too long \u2014 and relieved smiles when it starts moving again. A group of students outside a south London high school joking that the latest variation on \u201cthe dog ate my homework\u201d is \u201csorry, miss, I was caught up in a terrorist attack.\u201d One of my neighbors recounting how the loud \u201cbang\u201d of a blown exhaust pipe had given him a fright earlier this week. \u201cI thought it was them terrorists again,\u201d he said and chuckled at himself.Many here know someone who knows someone who could have been caught up in an attack. One friend of mine, a civil servant, was crossing Westminster Bridge just minutes before the March attacker ran over pedestrians at 70 miles an hour. Another friend runs a stall in Borough Market but had already closed for the day when the attack happened. \u201cI thought food was sacrosanct,\u201d she texted.Last weekend, in response to the latest attack, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, basically urged Londoners to go out and party \u2014 to show off \u201chow we pull together in the face of adversity.\u201dMy friend Nadja Stokes, who runs Gourmet Goats in Borough Market, told me the market was practically mobbed by visitors who wanted to show their supprt when it reopened Wednesday. \u201cLondon is a big city,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the end we\u2019re a community.\u201dPerhaps the best summary of the mood was a fake Underground sign that went viral after the Westminster bridge attack in March: \u201cAll terrorists are politely reminded that THIS IS LONDON and whatever you do to us we will drink tea and jolly well carry on thank you.\u201d Made to look as if it had been written by subway staff and displayed in a London subway station, the image had actually been generated online. But no matter; it was shared by thousands, quoted by the prime minister and on the BBC\u2019s flagship \u201cToday\u201d program as capturing the London spirit.Gustavo Lou, a 21-year-old student from West London, said he tried to avoid taking trains these days. \u201cIf I do, I get on the front or back,\u201d he said.Londoners of a different generation often call upon the city\u2019s history as proof of local resilience, from the Blitz \u2014 the German bombardments during World War II \u2014 to the terrorist campaign by the I.R.A. in the 1970s, \u201980s and into the \u201990s.Mick Bailey, a 63-year-old taxi driver from north London, grew up with \u201clots of amusing stories about the blackouts and bombing raids\u201d during the war. Once, his mother came out of the shelter to find the family home bombed to pieces. \u201cSo they moved in with other family,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone just got on with it.\u201dIn 1983, when an I.R.A. car bomb exploded outside Harrods department store at the height of the Christmas shopping season, Mr. Bailey was working as a firefighter. During the recent attacks at Borough Market, he was out driving his cab. \u201cIt feels much as it did during the I.R.A. days,\u201d Mr. Bailey said. \u201cIt happened and people were thankful that they weren\u2019t involved. And they carried on.\u201dHe worries about his son, who is a policeman in London. But he is determined not to change his life, \u201cbecause if you do,\u201d he said, \u201cthen it controls you, and you can\u2019t let that happen.\u201dThe thing that worries Mr. Bailey the most is that attacks carried out in the name of Islam are exploited by populists.\u201cI live in a very mixed area, I work around Muslims,\u201d Mr. Bailey said. \u201cWe do have to make sure that we don\u2019t point the finger in the wrong direction.\u201d\u201cLondon is a very special place,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these people from all over.\u201dThat made me think of something Richard Thompson, a former MI6 official, told me. \u201cTerrorism is not an enduring strategic threat to this country,\u201d he said. Wednesday\u2019s fire could well have killed more people than all three attacks combined, he said, warning against loss of perspective and knee-jerk reactions.Perhaps the earliest recorded terrorist plot in London was the so-called Gunpowder Plot in 1605, when a pro-Catholic conspiracy tried to assassinate King James and blow up Parliament with 36 barrels of gunpowder. The plot was foiled and Guy Fawkes, who had been guarding the barrels under the palace of Westminster, was hanged, drawn and quartered.To this day, Londoners celebrate Guy Fawkes Day every Nov. 5 with fireworks. It is one of the biggest family outings of the year.

{"Headline": "Young Asian-Australians Carve Out an Identity of Their Own", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Tan Falconer stood in the crowd milling outside the Sanctuary Hotel, a classic Sydney pub, cigarette in one hand. With the other, he greeted a stream of fashionable friends \u2014 men in tight shirts with hair smoothly buzzed on the sides, women with highlights and heavily drawn brows.Nearly everyone there was part of an emerging cross-cultural scene centered on an Asian-Australian identity: electronic music, athleisure fashion and social media savvy.They often call themselves the \u201clittle girls\u201d and \u201clittle boys\u201d of Sydney and Melbourne, or L.G.s and L.B.s for short.\u201cWe feel comfortable and more at ease when we share the same issues,\u201d said Mr. Falconer, 23, who is of Thai-Chinese heritage and a project manager at a construction and engineering firm. \u201cWe come together to drink and laugh it off.\u201dFor most white Australians, L.G. and L.B. do not mean much, but find a group of young Asian-Australians here in Sydney and they will reel off an archetype. L.G.s and L.B.s are attractive, confident and outspoken. They hail from the city\u2019s diverse western suburbs and they have the accents and the work ethic to prove it. They are devotees of trance or hardstyle (two differing genres of electronic music with ethereal vocals or a harsh, aggressive bass), and build their style on a foundation of expensive Adidas sneakers and Nike sports bras.Almost certainly, they have an Instagram account.In a country that is still trying to reconcile its multicultural population with its \u201cAustralia-First\u201d rhetoric, the L.G.s and L.B.s \u2014 who have grown up melding the expectations of immigrant heritage and traditional Australian identity \u2014 have carved out their own community, online and off, with a self-image that is still very much in flux.The little girl label seems to be a spinoff from a somewhat contemptuous shorthand applied by Asian-American communities in the United States to young Asian women who wore designer clothes and acted tough: A.B.G.s, or Asian Baby Girls.Both terms have been batted around by young people in the United States and Canada since the early 2000s.Giffie Ngo, 19, a student at the University of Technology Sydney who is from Bankstown, is reluctant to call herself an L.G. even though she is an administrator of the Facebook page and a regular at the raves that its followers attend. Many of the other young women in the scene also do not quite embrace the title either, even as they concede that they fit its parameters.The term can be \u201csort of derogatory,\u201d Ms. Ngo said, like an Asian-Australian parallel to the \u201cguido\u201d and \u201cguidette\u201d personas for Italian-Americans popularized by the television show \u201cJersey Shore.\u201dThat is part of what Mr. Falconer is trying to change. He said he created a presence on Facebook to mobilize the existing community and reverse the label\u2019s negative connotations.The page, which reaches more than 30,000 people, invites Sydney and Melbourne residents to submit photos of themselves or friends who fit the aesthetic and consent to be featured. Mr. Falconer and a team of administrators look through about 50 submissions a week, posting memes that poke fun at the subculture\u2019s silliest aspects (like a reverence for Sanctuary\u2019s Long Island ice teas) while also paying tribute to those who exemplify the group\u2019s ethos: \u201cParty hard, work and study hard.\u201dAnd despite their ethnicity, they say the page is multicultural and open to all young Australians.Catharine Lumby, a professor of media at Macquarie University in Sydney, said that for young Asian-Australians, and other groups of young people, social media and face-to-face social life have become indistinguishable.\u201cThe positive side of social media is that it\u2019s giving young people a voice and a way to explore their identities,\u201d she said.The danger, she cautioned, is that these explorations are pushed out to a world with pre-existing biases of race and gender that may seek to undermine those seeking freedom and safety in a more welcoming setting.Some of the women in the L.G. world acknowledged that broadcasting their look on social media came with risks.\u201cSome comments you like, some comments you don\u2019t,\u201d said Bianca Ha, an administrator of the page from Liverpool, whose picture was posted in the page\u2019s early days.While some of the L.B.s can at times seem to be playing the role of traditional Aussie lads, acting crass and carousing, she said the Facebook page can be empowering \u2014 a way for some women to take control of how they are portrayed.Eventually, Mr. Falconer wants to create a brand, produce merchandise and figure out how to make money with the L.B.-L.G. scene. A meme he made about a coming trance music festival went viral; he is now partnering with the festival\u2019s promoters on ticket sales.Maybe, he said, the scene will eventually lead him further up Australia\u2019s economic and social ladder, beyond his upbringing by a single mother in Parramatta.\u201cI want to be married and have kids,\u201d Mr. Falconer said, when asked what he envisioned for himself in 10 years. \u201cI want to go to a restaurant and not have to worry about the menu price.\u201dBut on a recent Friday night, with the chorus of The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cI Feel It Coming\u201d picking up, none of that mattered. The crowd of young Australians, sons and daughters of immigrants from China, Thailand, Vietnam and other countries, were busy hitting the beat.Two white men, huddled over beers at a table nearby, looked bewildered. \u201cI don\u2019t know why there are so many Asians here,\u201d said Mark Williams, a local resident from St. Leonards. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work it out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Best-Selling Israeli Philosopher Examines His Country\u2019s Inner Conflict", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileJERUSALEM \u2014 Micah Goodman, a popular Israeli philosopher of Jewish thought, hates to be labeled. When he lectures about Zionism, he says, people assume he is a conservative. When he speaks of liberalism and humanism, he is accused of being a leftist.So he was hoping his new book, \u201cCatch 67,\u201d which deals with the Israelis\u2019 inner struggle over their conflict with the Palestinians, would break down the monopolies of ideas commanded by the Israeli right and left, open up a healthier national dialogue and give expression to the largely unheard Israeli mainstream. Then, he thought, he could get back to his academic life of reading, writing and teaching.But wading into the political quagmire, Mr. Goodman, 42, a boyish-looking, first-generation Israeli with a cheerful disposition, has become an unlikely prophet of the nation\u2019s angst. He has also become a lightning rod for criticism, including from Ehud Barak, the former prime minister and army chief.Published in Hebrew in March, the book has topped Israel\u2019s nonfiction best-seller lists for weeks, and has driven a national discussion right at a charged moment: as Israel is observing the 50th anniversary of its victory in the June 1967 Middle East war, and the 50th year of its occupation of the territories where most of the world wants to see the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.It may be the hottest read in the country right now, but it is not a cheery one. Its prognosis is that there is no possibility of any comprehensive final peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians.\u201cThe reality now is that wars are not decisive,\u201d Mr. Goodman said in an interview. \u201cPeace is not, either. There are no more 1967 victories. There is no ultimate peace.\u201dThe book\u2019s argument centers on a paradox that Mr. Goodman says poses an existential threat to Israel.For years, polls have shown that a majority of Israelis would opt to leave the West Bank and end military control over the lives of millions of Palestinians in order to ensure Israel\u2019s future as an internationally accepted state with a clear enough Jewish majority to prevent its becoming a binational country.Yet the same majority of Israelis believe they cannot withdraw from the highlands of the West Bank, the heartland of any future Palestinian state. They distrust Palestinian intentions and fear for the security of a slimmed-down Israel in what many describe as indefensible borders. So, Mr. Goodman argues, both remaining in the West Bank and leaving it could spell the end of the Zionist project.The Israeli right and left have long been defined, and increasingly polarized, by their hawkish and dovish stances on the Palestinian issue. But the author says he is giving voice to a growing body of confused Israeli centrists, each involved in a deeply personal struggle, and most appearing to have given up both on the dream of peace and on the dream of a Greater Israel.\u201cThe Israelis in the center are not between the right and left,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cThey are both right and left. That\u2019s why we are so perplexed.\u201dBorn in Jerusalem in 1974 to parents who had emigrated a year before from the United States, Mr. Goodman was embarrassed as a teenager by his family\u2019s diversity, but has come to embrace it.His mother, who converted to Judaism, came from a pious Roman Catholic family. One uncle was a priest, another a personal adviser to Pope John Paul II. Still, Mr. Goodman grew up in an Orthodox Jewish household \u2014 but being a kind of an accidental Jew, as he put it, he began his own odyssey in search of meaning.Now he is a researcher at the Hartman Institute, a center for Jewish scholars in Jerusalem, and the director of Ein Prat, a pluralistic beit midrash, or center of Jewish study for young adults from all backgrounds, in the desert near Jericho in the West Bank.Mr. Goodman lives nearby with his wife and twin 8-year-old daughters in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Adumim, but he said: \u201cI would rather not be called a settler. It\u2019s where I live, not who I am.\u201dHe regularly speaks to audiences in the settlements, but he is just as comfortable being part of the entertainment at bars in Tel Aviv.His three previous Israeli best sellers, including the Hebrew version of \u201cMaimonides and the Book That Changed Judaism,\u201d dealt with ancient canonical texts. In \u201cCatch 67,\u201d he gives the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a kind of Talmudic treatment, where everything and its opposite are true.The treatise charts the main, competing ideological movements of Zionism \u2014 supporting the establishment and defense of a Jewish state \u2014 and how they have reached deadlock.The Zionist Revisionist right once combined nationalism with liberal values, promising an Israel that would grant all its residents the vote and equal rights, regardless of nationality. But most now acknowledge that the demographics of occupation have made that aspiration untenable \u2014 Palestinians are close to outnumbering Jewish Israelis between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.After the military victory of 1967, which gave Jews full command of Jerusalem for the first time in two millenniums and was seen by many here as miraculous, the Israeli right became increasingly religious and Messianic.But the vision of Messianic redemption suffered a blow with Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, Mr. Goodman argues. Rocket attacks against Israel from Gaza became more intense, and the right\u2019s arguments for remaining in the West Bank have focused increasingly on security.The Israeli left, for its part, swapped its original socialist agenda for land-for-peace after the conquests of 1967. But the peace camp dwindled after the suicide bombings of the second Palestinian intifada, and because of what many Israelis perceive as the Palestinians\u2019 inability to deliver a deal.Examining the political, ethical, religious and security aspects of the conundrum, Mr. Goodman\u2019s book gives equal weight to arguments on all sides. But while he allows that there is a dispute over the legal status of the West Bank land and whether it is truly occupied, he takes a clear stand when it comes to robbing the Palestinians of their freedom.\u201cThe occupation does not lead to a lack of morality,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe occupation itself is immoral.\u201dRejecting the paralysis of political deadlock, he suggests two models for a partial peace based on partial withdrawal or partial statehood, in order, he said, to \u201cshrink the amount of occupation without dramatically shrinking the amount of security for Israelis.\u201dNaftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the pro-settlement Jewish Home party, wrote in a Facebook post that he did not agree with everything in Mr. Goodman\u2019s book. But he added, \u201cThe truth be told, over the 50 years since the great victory in the war, we have sunk into a war of ideas in which we basically triumph over ourselves.\u201dLeftist critics say the book seems more concerned with finding internal peace for an Israel at war with itself than peace with the Palestinians.Mr. Barak noted that a smaller Israel had embarked on one of its greatest victories in 1967. Nobody on the left was suggesting dismantling the Israeli military, he added, suggesting that Mr. Goodman was out of his depth and not qualified to speak for the generals.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Guilty Verdict for Young Woman Who Urged Friend to Kill Himself", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byTAUNTON, Mass. \u2014 For a case that had played out in thousands of text messages, what made Michelle Carter\u2019s behavior a crime, a judge concluded, came in a single phone call. Just as her friend Conrad Roy III stepped out of the truck he had filled with lethal fumes, Ms. Carter told him over the phone to get back in the cab and then listened to him die without trying to help him.The judge\u2019s decision, handed down on Friday, stunned many legal experts with its conclusion that words alone could cause a suicide.Ms. Carter\u2019s defense team is expected to appeal the verdict. Legal experts said that it seemed to extend manslaughter law into new territory, and that if it stood, it could have far-reaching implications, at least in Massachusetts.\u201cWill the next case be a Facebook posting in which someone is encouraged to commit a crime?\u201d Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge and Harvard Law professor, asked. \u201cThis puts all the things that you say in the mix of criminal responsibility.\u201dJudge Moniz unspooled his verdict in a packed courtroom, which was silent except for his voice and Ms. Carter\u2019s gasping sobs. By the time he told Ms. Carter to stand up, and pronounced her guilty, the two families seated on either side of the courtroom\u2019s aisle \u2014 Ms. Carter\u2019s and Mr. Roy\u2019s \u2014 wept, too.For all the scrutiny during the trial of their texts, the judge based his guilty verdict on a phone conversation.Once Mr. Roy drove his truck to a remote spot at a Kmart parking lot, the two ceased texting and instead talked on their cellphones. When Mr. Roy, with fumes gathering in the cab of his truck, apparently had a change of heart and stepped out, the judge said, Ms. Carter told him to get back in, fully knowing \u201chis ambiguities, his fears, his concerns.\u201d\u201cThis court finds,\u201d the judge added, \u201cthat instructing Mr. Roy to get back in the truck constituted wanton and reckless conduct.\u201dBut the phone conversation was not recorded, and the only evidence of its content came three months after the suicide in a text from Ms. Carter to a friend.\u201cSam his death is my fault, like honestly I could have stopped him,\u201d Ms. Carter wrote. \u201cI was on the phone with him and he got out of the car because it was working and he got scared.\u201dShe said she then instructed him \u201cto get back in.\u201dThe prosecution made this phone call, as described in Ms. Carter\u2019s text, the heart of its case. And the judge accepted it as factual and incriminating.The defense strongly argued that there was nothing to substantiate what Ms. Carter had said on the phone and insisted that Mr. Conrad, who had tried to kill himself before, was determined to take his own life, regardless of anything Ms. Carter did or said.Judge Moniz acknowledged that Mr. Roy had taken steps to cause his own death, like researching suicide methods, obtaining a generator and then the water pump with which he ultimately poisoned himself. Indeed, Judge Moniz said that Ms. Carter\u2019s text messages pressuring him to kill himself had not, on their own, caused his death.Instead, the judge zeroed in on the moment that Mr. Roy climbed out of his truck.\u201cHe breaks that chain of self-causation by exiting the vehicle,\u201d Judge Moniz said. \u201cHe takes himself out of that toxic environment that it has become.\u201d That, the judge said, was a clear indication that Mr. Roy \u2014 as on his previous suicide attempts \u2014 wanted to save himself.But, the judge said, Ms. Carter had a duty to help Mr. Roy after she had put him in danger by ordering him back into the truck.\u201cShe admits in a subsequent text that she did nothing, she did not call the police or Mr. Roy\u2019s family,\u201d the judge said. \u201cShe called no one. And finally, she did not issue a simple additional instruction: \u2018Get out of the truck.\u2019\u201dThe verdict stunned many legal specialists because suicide is generally considered, legally, to result from a person\u2019s free will.Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University, said the decision surprised him because the manslaughter charge seemed \u201ca stretch\u201d to begin with. Because Ms. Carter was not at the scene, and Mr. Roy ultimately acted alone, he said, it was difficult to prove she \u201ccaused\u201d the death.Ms. Gertner of Harvard said that likely grounds for appeal would be that the verdict had \u201cextended the law of involuntary manslaughter to an arena into which it hasn\u2019t been extended before \u2014 the notion of liability with respect to a suicide for someone who failed to act, who wasn\u2019t present, who didn\u2019t provide the instrumentalities for the suicide and the concept of a failure to intervene are all unique and that\u2019s what would be litigated.\u201dAt its core, the case was about two troubled teenagers and the fatal path their online relationship took.Mr. Roy was a gentle but deeply depressed teenager who worked as a tugboat captain. He had graduated from high school with a college scholarship, but worried about the social anxiety he might experience there.The one-page decision in the case of Michelle Carter, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter after she urged her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, to commit suicide.Ms. Carter was a high school student with homework to finish and a love of the television show \u201cGlee,\u201d but she said her life was controlled by an eating disorder. She too was wrought by social anxiety, desperately seeking the approval of friends whom she admired but worried did not truly like her.When Mr. Roy told Ms. Carter in June 2014 that he was considering suicide, she told him he had a lot to live for and urged him to seek help.\u201cI\u2019m trying my best to dig you out,\u201d Ms. Carter wrote.\u201cI don\u2019t wanna be dug out,\u201d Mr. Roy answered, adding later, \u201cI WANT TO DIE.\u201dBy early July, she began to embrace the idea. \u201cIf this is the only way you think you\u2019re gonna be happy, heaven will welcome you with open arms,\u201d she wrote.They talked at length about how he could kill himself with carbon monoxide. \u201cIf you emit 3200 ppm of it for five to ten mins you will die within a half hour,\u201d she wrote. In the last days of his life, she told him repeatedly, \u201cYou just need to do it.\u201dProsecutors said Ms. Carter wanted Mr. Roy to kill himself because she wanted the sympathy that would come as the \u201cgrieving girlfriend.\u201d Ms. Carter\u2019s lawyers cast her as a na\u00efve teenager who wanted to help people and was not even on the scene when Mr. Roy took his lifeBut the prosecution argued in its closing \u2014 and evidently Judge Moniz agreed \u2014 that Ms. Carter\u2019s physical absence was immaterial.\u201cThe phones that we have now allow you to be virtually present with somebody,\u201d Katie Rayburn, an assistant district attorney, said, adding, \u201cShe was in his ear, she was in his mind, she was on the phone, and she was telling him to get back in the car even though she knew he was going to die.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some might have viewed this as an opportunity to escape. Instead, the inmates made a split-second decision to save the deputy\u2019s life.The deputy, whom the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office declined to name, was briefly unconscious. He was particularly susceptible to the heat because of complications from a brain surgery nearly 10 years ago, the sheriff said. Some of the inmates immediately ran over, ripped the deputy\u2019s shirt open and removed his bulletproof vest to make it easier for emergency workers to perform CPR. One of the inmates dialed 911.The inmates were quite familiar with the deputy, given that they spend most days together on the work program, which allows the inmates to shorten their sentences. The officer had told them that morning that he wasn\u2019t feeling well.\u201cNone of my guys ran,\u201d the deputy told WXIA. \u201cNone of them did anything they shouldn\u2019t have done.\u201dWhen the deputy woke up, he was in a daze, according to Sheriff Moats, and was informed by his fellow deputies of the good Samaritan work by the inmates.\u201cHe didn\u2019t really remember much,\u201d Sheriff Moats said. \u201cHe was kind of in and out of it. He didn\u2019t have a whole lot of details.\u201dSheriff Moats added, \u201cIt made me feel really good that they thought enough of one of my officers to help him.\u201dThese inmates are not violent offenders. The charges against them range from probation violations to minor drug crimes.\u201cThey\u2019d have a whole lot to lose,\u201d Mr. Moats said, if they tried to make a run for it. \u201cMost of their release dates are in three to six months.\u201dThe deputy has recovered, according to Sheriff Moats. And for the inmates, there is a reward for the good deed. The sheriff will recommend that their sentences be reduced or that they be released with time served.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Bots Are Inflating Instagram Egos", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byI posted a picture in March of the New York Times headquarters looking serene before a snowstorm to my Instagram account. The photo attracted 11 comments, all from strangers. \u201cVery nice!\u201d a monthly cocktail delivery company in San Francisco wrote. A cosmetic tattoo artist in Vancouver, British Columbia, posted three fire symbol emojis, and a vintage furniture seller in San Jose, Calif., left an emoji of a heart with a bow around it.I like to leave my apartment for cocktails, I don\u2019t have any tattoos and I\u2019ve never been to San Jose. So, what was up?The answer, as with so many things online, came down to marketing. Many people with public accounts on Instagram may not realize that when random users follow them or like or comment on their posts, it is often the work of a cottage industry of websites that, for as little as $10 a month, send their clients\u2019 accounts on automated liking, following and commenting sprees. It\u2019s a rogue marketing tactic meant to catch the attention of other Instagram users in hopes that they will follow or like the automated accounts in return.The fake activity has long violated Instagram\u2019s rules but has proliferated nonetheless. In the last seven weeks, however, Instagram, the Facebook-owned app with 700 million users per month, has been cracking down on such businesses. It\u2019s led to the shuttering of anonymously run sites with names like Instagress, PeerBoost, InstaPlus, Mass Planner and Fan Harvest, though others remain.Racking up followers and likes on photos gives a sheen of legitimacy to small businesses or aspiring social-media influencers. If 10,000 people are following them, someone quickly scanning through Instagram might think, \u201cMaybe I should start paying attention to them, too.\u201d And popular accounts also tend to attract advertisers.But marketers have started to wake up to how the system can be gamed.\u201cThe follower count is really completely meaningless,\u201d said Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company in Cincinnati. \u201cIt\u2019s untrustworthy for the true following, and it\u2019s certainly untrustworthy for the quality of the creative work.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a photographer trying to build a following or anyone trying to get your work out there and meet new people, when you get a genuine interaction, that feels good,\u201d Mr. Wilson said in an interview. \u201cWhen you have Instagress coming in there and leaving fake comments like \u2018stunning photo\u2019 and \u2018stunning gallery\u2019 and there\u2019s no one behind it and then the likes \u2014 it\u2019s as if they hijacked that personal neuropathway in your brain.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense what we\u2019re doing for these numbers,\u201d Ms. Melotti, 29, said. She decided to reveal the tactics and stop using them, she said, because the focus on so-called Instafame stopped rewarding original work and seemed to be having a toxic effect on other artists\u2019 self-esteem and perception of reality.These discussions have not been lost on marketers, which spent more than $570 million on influencer marketing on Instagram last year, according to estimates from eMarketer.Mr. Gilbreath of Ahalogy recently introduced a service for agencies and brands to verify quality, traffic and other metrics around influencer marketing campaigns. He recommended identifying powerful creative work through such users and paying Instagram to promote sponsored posts from them, rather than relying on endorsements to their accounts based on their numbers.Closing such businesses is like playing Whac-a-Mole, in part because they are working directly through individual accounts, avoiding any approval process with Instagram, said Alex Taub, the co-founder of SocialRank, which helps marketers find and analyze followers on Twitter and Instagram.\u201cThis is a little extreme, but I think the way you stop this is you start banning all the accounts that use it,\u201d Mr. Taub said. He is skeptical about the types of followers the services attract anyway and pointed out the strangeness of accounts using bots to engage with other accounts using bots.Mr. Wilson said he was questioning how many of his new fans on the @canon_bw account were real. The top five cities that his followers on his personal account came from were all in the United States, while on the experimental one, four of the five top cities \u2014 including Istanbul; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Mexico City \u2014 were outside the country.\u201cPeople use this stuff because it makes your life a little easier short term because your audience is growing,\u201d Mr. Taub said. \u201cBut your audience is probably growing by bots, and it\u2019s probably bots talking to bots.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like hot air,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not real.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian Runoff Elections Boost Center-Right Parties", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Center-right parties scored victories Sunday evening in runoff elections in more than 100 Italian towns and cities, a result that emboldened right-wing parties, raised the prospect of shifting coalitions and took the political temperature of Italy ahead of national elections expected within the next year.According to official results, candidates representing the center-right won many of the major contests, including in the northern port city of Genoa, a stronghold of the center-left for half a century.\u201cAlways more positive news, from many cities! Go, go, go!\u201d Matteo Salvini, the leader of the right-wing and anti-immigrant Northern League, who campaigned vigorously for the winning mayoral candidate in Genoa, wrote on Twitter late Sunday night.In the complicated calculus of Italian politics, the local elections may have adjusted variables just enough to change national outcomes. Mr. Salvini is now expected to argue that he is someone to be courted, either by the center-right \u2014 once again led by a reanimated former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi \u2014 or by the leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, Beppe Grillo.Italian voters had a lot to think about. A slumping economy, frustration with the European Union and a seemingly incessant tide of migrants from North Africa converged on voters on Election Day, which took place as the center-left government worked to avoid another banking crisis.Some analysts argued that local concerns more than national issues determined the results, while others doubted that the center-right would be as united in national elections as it was in local ones.Still, some members acknowledged the lackluster result.\u201cThere is a problem,\u201d Gea Schir\u00f2, a member of Parliament with the governing Democratic Party, acknowledged on Italian television.But she added that the most important takeaway was that the Five Star Movement, which she characterized as a threat to centrist parties and Italian democracy, had a poor showing.Indeed, the rise of the Five Star Movement has awoken some of Italy\u2019s long dormant power brokers, like Mr. Berlusconi. Now softening his image and appealing to older voters by frequently appearing in the company of lambs and fluffy dogs, Mr. Berlusconi campaigned in the weeks before the vote.Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, the head of the Democratic Party, mostly laid low before the vote. In the hours after, Mr. Renzi, a former mayor of Florence, noted on his Facebook page some victories for the center-left and bitingly predicted \u201capocalyptic\u201d and overreaching commentary in the coming days, \u201cbecause mayoral elections are something different from political elections.\u201d His opponents within the party wasted no time after the vote urging a reassessment of the Democrats\u2019 message and course.Months ago, the Five Star Movement had hoped to send a message with a show of strength in local elections. Genoa is the home of Mr. Grillo, the party\u2019s leader. But it suffered a serious setback on June 11, leaving the governing center-left and the center-right parties jostling for an edge.Immigration emerged as a theme in several elections, especially in Italy\u2019s border towns.Ignazio La Russa, a leader of the right-wing Fratelli d\u2019Italia, spoke elatedly on Italian television as the numbers rolled in. \u201cIt\u2019s clamorous!\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Delphi, the Auto Parts Supplier, Embarks on a High-Tech Overhaul", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byBitsTROY, Mich. \u2014 As automakers rush to catch up to Silicon Valley in the race to create the superintelligent, self-driving cars of the future, one old-line parts manufacturer is hoping to win by switching sides.Delphi Automotive has a corporate background that is as greasy and grimy as the steering gears it once produced.It began as the parts arm of General Motors, and years ago operated dozens of unionized plants that churned out the type of mechanical auto components that put venture capitalists to sleep: air-conditioners, brakes, heaters and radios.Its complicated corporate history includes years of downsizing and a long, messy reorganization in bankruptcy court.Cars produced today include dozens of computer chips along with cameras, radar, millions of lines of software and wireless communications links. Future vehicles will have all that and more, said Kevin P. Clark, Delphi\u2019s chief executive.Delphi, he added, hopes to be the supplier of networking components \u2014 like wiring, software and intelligent connectors \u2014 that link all those complex systems and enable them to work together under the hood.\u201cIt\u2019s the intelligent architecture that allows all the advanced safety systems, all the autonomous driving software, all the infotainment software to operate effectively,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Cisco \u201cis a pretty good analogy for us,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner who tracks the development of connected and self-driving cars, said Delphi is attempting the most extensive transformation by an old-line automotive company that he has run across. \u201cThey are the standard-bearer for this,\u201d he said.Its success is by no means assured. Technology shifts quickly, and the company has far more experience in the slower-paced, low-risk approach of the traditional auto industry, where innovations are engineered and tested for years before they are introduced. And Delphi\u2019s investments in start-ups may not pan out.Delphi hopes to create a new business that can gather vast amounts of data from vehicles \u2014 about how and where they go, how they\u2019re driven and how they\u2019re running. The company then envisions selling insights drawn from the data trove to automakers, insurance companies and possibly even advertisers.A driver who frequently drives to Starbucks locations, for example, could be targeted with Starbucks coupons via email or text. Someone whose data shows a pattern of gentle driving could be offered lower insurance rates, said David Ploucha, the president and co-founder of Control-Tec, a start-up Delphi acquired for $124 million as part of this data business strategy.It\u2019s a business model unlike anything the auto industry has ever seen. It\u2019s similar to what Google does by targeting ads to users based on terms they have searched, or how Facebook tailors ads and news posts based on what a member has \u201cliked\u201d on the social networking site.\u201cThe idea is to influence how people spend money in relation to their vehicle,\u201d Mr. Ploucha said.Mr. Clark said he was convinced such data services will evolve into a multibillion-dollar industry, though it may be years before this vision is confirmed.The boldness of Delphi\u2019s plan underscores how dramatic technological changes are loosening the dominant role traditional carmakers have in the auto industry, while opening opportunities for new players.Already, Tesla has jumped ahead in battery-powered cars, and in distributing software updates to its cars over the air, the same way iPhones receive new operating systems. Both Tesla and Google are ahead of many, if not most, automakers in self-driving technology. Uber, the ride-hailing company, is trying to press ahead in autonomous cars, too.Danny Shapiro, a senior executive at Nvidia, a chip maker that provides some of the powerful processors used by Tesla, Audi and many other automakers, said he would not be surprised to see some reordering of the auto industry in the next five to 10 years. \u201cI do believe there will be a rise and fall for some players,\u201d he said.Tesla, thanks to its rising stock, recently passed both Ford and G.M. in terms of market value.Mr. Clark, the Delphi chief executive, hopes his company will be one of the rising stars. For most of the last 20 years, it has been in a slow decline. Delphi was created to take over all the parts businesses G.M. no longer wanted in-house.It was spun off as a stand-alone company in 1999. Six years later, it filed for bankruptcy, slammed by high labor costs and the razor-thin margins of making low-tech commodity parts.Its Chapter 11 reorganization lasted four years, and resulted in plant closings and the elimination of tens of thousands of factory jobs. The company\u2019s steering systems business was sold to a Chinese investor. The remaining company kept operations in automotive electronics and engine technologies such as fuel injectors and diesel components.Over the last few years, as autonomous driving technology began developing rapidly, Mr. Clark saw an opportunity to take Delphi in a new direction.To preserve Control-Tec\u2019s freewheeling start-up culture, Delphi is allowing it to operate largely as an independent company. That includes one lounge where its engineers build Lego cars and occasionally play board games, and another where they share homemade beers.\u201cThe worst thing we could do is stifle the creativity, the energy they have,\u201d Mr. Clark said.This year, Delphi went further, acquiring a start-up with technology for wirelessly transferring data and software to and from vehicles, and investing $15 million in another Israeli company, Otonomo, which specializes in organizing masses of data into forms that automakers and others will pay for. These two investments, along with Control-Tec, make up the foundation of the data business Mr. Clark thinks Delphi can create.Then in May, Mr. Clark announced a final break with the traditional automotive industry. Delphi\u2019s powertrain business, which makes fuel injectors and diesel technology, will be spun off as a separate company by the first quarter of next year.The split will leave behind a new high-tech Delphi, known inside the company for now as \u201cRemain Co.\u201d \u201cHow we get there from here, we\u2019re all doing a lot to figure that out,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated when Delphi will spin off its powertrain business into a separate company. It will be by the first quarter of next year, not the end of this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Killing by Police, a Jury Sees What the Dash Camera Saw", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported byST. PAUL \u2014 The fatal shooting of a black motorist by a police officer just outside this city drew national attention last summer largely because the driver\u2019s girlfriend began livestreaming the graphic scene on Facebook moments after it happened. On Monday, as prosecutors began outlining their case against the officer, they presented a different video for the first time in public: dashboard camera footage of the shooting itself.Prosecutors said Mr. Castile gasped to say, \u201cI wasn\u2019t reaching for it,\u201d after the shots were fired, but the audio was hard to make out in a packed courtroom where the newly released footage was shown only once.As prosecutors show a greater willingness to charge police officers involved in questionable shootings, a series of trials has renewed debate about how the police use force and treat African-Americans. But even in cases like this one, with lots of video evidence, convictions are far from assured, and jurors often sympathize with officers who say they had to make a life-or-death decision in seconds.Here is some of what we are expecting as jurors hear evidence about Mr. Castile\u2019s death.The shooting of Mr. Castile provoked outrage almost immediately because Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, streamed the aftermath on Facebook. Ms. Reynolds, who was in the car with Mr. Castile and her young daughter, calmly challenged Officer Yanez\u2019s version of events and said Mr. Castile had been trying to cooperate when he was shot.The newly released video \u2014 recorded on Officer Yanez\u2019s cruiser behind Mr. Castile\u2019s car \u2014 showed an exchange that lasted only a matter of seconds. The camera\u2019s view did not show whether Mr. Castile was reaching for the handgun that he had a permit to carry or exactly where the gun was in the car.On the video, Officer Yanez and Mr. Castile briefly discussed a broken taillight before Mr. Castile mentioned that he had a gun in the car. Officer Yanez responded, calmly at first, instructing him not to reach for the weapon. Mr. Castile started to respond, but Officer Yanez interjected, his voice louder.Officer Yanez could be heard on the video yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t pull it out!\u201d Seconds later, he started shooting, seven shots directly into the car through the open driver\u2019s window. When the gunshots stopped, after bullets narrowly missed Ms. Reynolds and her daughter, Officer Yanez kept his gun pointed, grew emotional and began swearing.In an opening statement on Monday, Richard Dusterhoft, a prosecutor, told jurors that Officer Yanez could have eased his own concerns after Mr. Castile mentioned a gun.\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell Mr. Castile to freeze,\u201d Mr. Dusterhoft said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell him to put his hands up.\u201dOfficer Yanez\u2019s trial is the first time in modern Minnesota history that an officer has been charged for an on-duty fatal shooting, according to reports by local news organizations.The jurors, nine men and six women, two of them black, must determine whether Officer Yanez acted reasonably given what he knew at the time. Paul Engh, a defense lawyer, told jurors on Monday that the case was all about Mr. Castile\u2019s gun.\u201cBut for Mr. Castile\u2019s continuous grip on that handgun, you would not be here,\u201d said Mr. Engh, who called the shooting a \u201ctragedy\u201d but \u201cmost assuredly not a crime.\u201dMr. Castile\u2019s race has dominated the conversation about his death, and tensions spilled over into the final stages of jury selection in St. Paul on Monday.Defense lawyers tried to remove a young prospective juror who immigrated from Ethiopia as a child, saying she did not fully understand the American justice system and was incapable of serving. Prosecutors challenged the dismissal, saying that she was an accomplished student and that her exclusion was a veiled attempt at racism.Ultimately, the judge ruled that she would serve on the jury.Still, Mr. Castile\u2019s death has defied some of the racial fault lines seen in other shootings. Officer Yanez is the son of a Mexican immigrant and depended on welfare at points in his childhood, defense lawyers said. Ms. Reynolds, Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, who testified on Monday, said Mr. Castile had attended police barbecues in St. Paul and harbored no animosity toward officers.Though Officer Yanez\u2019s dash camera video was played inside a St. Paul courtroom on Monday, it was seen by only a few dozen people. People in the courtroom are forbidden to make video or audio recordings of the trial, and reporters are not allowed to post live updates on social media \u2014 strict limits that reflect the tensions such cases have stirred around the nation.The New York Times requested access to the footage shortly after the shooting and again after it was shown Monday, but a court spokesman said it would not be released until after the trial.And Judge William H. Leary III entered an order banning courtroom facial expressions that suggest an opinion about the testimony.Advertisement"}

In his 2009 manifesto, \u201cFree,\u201d on the new digital economy, Chris Anderson wrote that \u201cit is a unique quality of the digital age that once something becomes software, it inevitably becomes free \u2014 in cost, certainly, and often in price.\u201d Anderson and his cohort envisioned a new type of cultural economy that didn\u2019t degrade the effort or labor of production. \u201cLast century\u2019s free was a powerful marketing method,\u201d Anderson noted; \u201cthis century\u2019s free is an entirely new economic model.\u201d But that model assumes that everyone within its ecosystem has equal access to resources and capital.Over the last two decades, the web has pushed every creative medium \u2014 print, film, music, even art \u2014 into brand-new territory. Creators can now take nontraditional paths to traditional success, and mainstream industries have stretched to accommodate these new digital economic models. A musician like Chance the Rapper no longer needs a record label to win a Grammy, and a comedian like Quinta Brunson can use Instagram and YouTube to land a job producing and starring in videos for BuzzFeed Motion Pictures. And the internet has also allowed for the creation of new types of cultural products, even as we struggle to recognize them as such.Was she right? The types of ideas protected by intellectual-property law typically don\u2019t include a clever catchphrase on a Vine or a film idea in a tweet. But it\u2019s difficult to dismiss Newman entirely; the \u201cfreemium economy\u201d that Anderson heralded works only if the old hierarchies of access have been dismantled. And for the most part, they are still intact.Whether or not you agree with that analysis, the incident does point to the growing schism between those driving cultural conversations online and those profiting from them. There\u2019s a rich history of excluding certain types of creators from compensation for their contributions to culture. In her 2006 article \u201cFair Use and the Fairer Sex,\u201d Ann Bartow, now the director of the Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property at the University of New Hampshire School of Law, pointed out that \u201ccopyright laws are written and enforced to help certain groups of people, largely male, assert and retain control over the resources generated by creative productivity.\u201d Historically, she noted, that infrastructure played a key role in sustaining \u201cthe material and economic inequality between women and men.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that technology isn\u2019t keeping pace with innovation,\u201d says Amanda Levendowski, a teaching fellow at the New York University School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s that we aren\u2019t keeping pace with how to serve new types of creators who have never been valued by intellectual-property regimes.\u201d Often, those people most responsible for cultural touchstones are unable to profit from them because they don\u2019t have access to capital and resources (a digital ad agency, say, or a Hollywood pitch room). The internet has become the go-to place to toss out ideas, in the hope that they could lead to a job, but it has also become the place where people go to find the best ideas, creating a lopsided dynamic that tends to benefit people in power.This dynamic is further complicated by the way social media psychologically encourages and socially rewards us for our contributions to online culture. The founders of Instagram studied psychology and computer science at Stanford University. Before Facebook acquired the app for $1 billion, Kevin Systrom, one of its creators, spoke about designing a \u201cnatural cycle\u201d of participation that would keep engagement up on his service. \u201cThe more people love seeing content on the platform, the more they use it, the more they post,\u201d he told Business of Fashion in 2014. Likes and retweets on Twitter and Tumblr perform a similar function. Researchers like Nir Eyal and BJ Fogg have written about how apps \u201chook\u201d users and cultivate addiction. Online, there is an irresistible social currency to being a user who has thousands of followers, who starts memes, who comes up with an idea that is turned into a movie. But I wonder how comfortable we should be with this arrangement.Not long ago, I watched \u201cThe Founder,\u201d the movie about the businessman Ray Kroc, who mutated McDonald\u2019s from a family-owned restaurant into the global multinational corporation it is today. There\u2019s a scene in which Kroc, played by Michael Keaton, explains his plans to Dick and Mac McDonald. Kroc, who is in the process of swindling them out of a significant fortune, tells them how he justifies his behavior, by adding value to their original idea: \u201cDo you know what I came up with, Mac? A concept. I came up with the concept of winning.\u201dIn the movie, it\u2019s easy to identify Kroc as an amoral exploiter, sponging off the labors of Dick and Mac. Which brings me back to the Rihanna-Nyong\u2019o film project. Ownership on social media is far from clear. Even the genesis of the project is disputed, with some pointing to a meme on Tumblr as the original source. For now, representatives for Issa Rae have told Vanity Fair that the Twitter users who came up with the concept will be credited in some way, and judging by their tweets, they seem to be satisfied with that recognition as adequate payment. Meanwhile, we can expect everyone else associated with the film to actually be paid.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

One excellent place to begin, in addition to Marc Reisner\u2019s \u201cCadillac Desert,\u201d is Philip L. Fradkin\u2019s \u201cA River No More: The Colorado River and the West.\u201d Fradkin traced the Colorado\u2019s flow on foot and by raft and gives an intimate portrait of the river\u2019s troubles from the late 1970s. Both of these books help curious readers understand the tenuousness of Western waters.The writer covered the Colorado River and other environmental issues for The Las Vegas Sun from 1976 until 2009.\u2666To the Editor:In his review of \u201cThe Gulf: The Making of an American Sea,\u201d by Jack E. Davis (May 28), Philip Connors refers to \u201cnative culture\u201d and \u201cthe natives\u201d when mentioning the indigenous peoples who were living and thriving along the Gulf of Mexico when the first Europeans began to \u201cprobe gulf waters.\u201d In 1974, in a scholarly article I submitted to The Journal of Modern African Studies in which I compared the theories on revolution of Frantz Fanon and Am\u00edlcar Cabral, I had on several occasions referred to the people of Algeria and Guinea-Bissau as natives. In accepting my work, the editor asked for several changes, one of which was to substitute \u201cAfricans\u201d for \u201cnatives\u201d \u2014 a demeaning word, a product of the age of imperialism and a way to suggest an inferiority that was not necessarily, and certainly not always, true.Of course, I made the changes, but in confirming that this was the right thing to do I also realized that when, say, in France or Germany, I might refer to those indigenous people as Europeans, Frenchmen or Germans, but never as natives. Political correctness may sometimes exceed its usefulness, but in this case I believe a change of thinking is in order.The writer is an emeritus professor of history at California State University, San Bernardino.\u2666To the Editor:While Gal Beckerman\u2019s \u201cOn the Seventh Day: New Books on the Six Day War and Its Aftermath\u201d (Essay, May 28) articulates much of the disappointment and sadness that I feel after 50 years of occupation and no solution \u2014 and while he correctly places (in my opinion) much of the blame on the current Israeli government \u2014 I vigorously dispute his comment, presumably referring to the West Bank, about \u201cIsrael\u2019s occupation of large swaths of Arab land to which it had no legitimate right besides brute force.\u201dIt bears repeating that \u2014 whatever one\u2019s views about how international law and justice should inform a current solution to the conflict and what steps the Israeli government should take to move the process along \u2014 (1) the historical connection between the Jewish people and the land of Israel (both sides of the Green Line, e.g., Hebron) spans two millenniums; (2) the Green Line was intended as a temporary armistice line, not a final border; (3) the territories were acquired in a defensive war; (4) Security Council Resolution 242 contemplates the retention of some of the territories; (5) the 1948-49 war resulted in the destruction of existing Jewish settlements (e.g., Gush Etzion), to which Israelis returned after 1967; (6) there are significant security reasons for continued control of the territories; and (7) international law is far from clear as to which side has the better of the \u201clegal\u201d argument. I do not think that these arguments (individually or in combination) dictate continued retention of the territories and perpetuation of the occupation. But it is frankly absurd to characterize the current situation as, say, akin to that of France in Algeria or the British in India.One more thing. After a couple of pages of essentially holding Israel responsible for the continued occupation, the essay ends with a plea by Raja Shehadeh that until the Israelis \u201caccept that the land must be shared and that both people have the right to self-determination, peace will remain elusive.\u201d Maybe so. But how to square that with Nir Baram\u2019s conclusion (apparently endorsed by Beckerman) that the conflict is not about \u201cfinal borders\u201d and there remains \u201ctotal and irreconcilable difference\u201d between the parties?\u2666Readers chimed in with advice.

{"Headline": "A Kenyan Pursuit: Perfecting the Chicken Dish Kuku Paka", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The downpour stopped, so Kirti Patel decided to hold the dinner party on her balcony, with its views of colossal flowering trees and construction that had stalled for the rainy season. Pink vines of bougainvillea were in bloom, and the raw scent of ginger and garlic was in the air.The centerpiece of the meal was Ms. Patel\u2019s labor-intensive rendition of kuku paka, a coconut-chicken dish with roots about 300 miles east of her home, in the city of Mombasa.For centuries, that port on the Indian Ocean was a hub for immigrants, many from other parts of East Africa, the Middle East and India. Kuku paka is a product of the diverse influences that shaped Kenya\u2019s coastal cuisine, and today it is craved and recreated in home kitchens and restaurants all over the country, and beyond.The dish seems simple: chicken on the bone, in a sauce of spiced coconut milk.But you\u2019ll find the chicken cooked in a number of ways \u2014 grilled over charcoal, or steamed with aromatics, or braised. That sauce can be pale and soupy, or dark and glossy. It can be mild and easygoing, or it can prickle with chiles so your eyes fill with tears.Some cooks will add corn on the cob, potatoes or halved hard-boiled eggs to the mix. Others crowd the sauce with meat and nothing else.It\u2019s a dish that welcomes tinkering, but every kuku paka is a love letter to coconut, its fat and its sweetness, the way it can make so many other flavors shine without losing its own. And everything in that coconut sauce seems a bit more glamorous than it did before, even a chicken leg.Ms. Patel and her husband, Anil Patel, raised their two children in Nairobi, driving to Mombasa for family vacations by the beach, bringing home the flavors of the coast like a keepsake. Kuku paka, which has been part of her culinary repertoire for decades, is both celebratory and nostalgic.She found what she needed at Fruity Fruits, a produce market that almost seemed to be showing off the city\u2019s vast range of excellent, year-round ingredients. Back in her kitchen, Ms. Patel split open a few coconuts. She grated the white flesh and pressed the mass to make coconut milk, setting aside the sweet, cloudy water to braise the chicken.Once the milk reduced a little, Ms. Patel added the braised meat and let it all bubble together. When the sauce was creamy, thick with finely ground cashews, and the leanest pieces of meat were tender, she threw cilantro and fried onions over the top and set the dish out beside a basket of mandazi, deep-fried yeasted buns still warm from the fryer.As a dozen guests ate, a pile of clean chicken bones grew at the center of Ms. Patel\u2019s table.\u201cFor Kenyans who are more inland, this dish is an occasion,\u201d she said, noting its richness. \u201cWe make it only from time to time.\u201dWhen Ms. Adagala does make it, she braises the chicken in coconut, tinted with turmeric, and serves it over hot rice, or with a stack of supple chapati. She also likes it with ugali, the plainly delicious boiled cornmeal that, unlike kuku paka, is an everyday pleasure.She adapted it from a Kenyan-Indian immigrant who ran a restaurant in England. He slashed the meat as if preparing it for the tandoor, Ms. Jaffrey said, and roasted it in a hot oven to order.Kuku paka isn\u2019t constrained by hard rules, but there are patterns in its variations. \u201cThere should always be a touch of sourness,\u201d Ms. Jaffrey said, \u201cand the heat of green chiles.\u201dThis sourness often comes from a squeeze of lemon, but Agnes Kalyonge, a caterer and recipe developer in Nairobi, slips in a spoonful of tamarind pulp instead.She said she wanted to replicate the flavors of a kuku paka she had tried on the coast, but improve on it.So she added the step of brining the meat in apple cider vinegar, to season it right through. While many sauces begin with frying onion, and a paste of ginger, garlic and green chiles, Ms. Kalyonge simmered the aromatics raw in the coconut milk, and let them mellow slowly in the fatty, reducing milk, stirring the pan almost constantly.The name kuku paka is an abbreviation for kuku wa kupaka, Swahili that translates roughly as chicken in sauce. But Ms. Kalyonge said original versions of kuku paka always called for that chicken to be grilled.You can\u2019t argue with the smoky flavors that come from browning chicken slowly, over charcoal. It lends the finished dish the umami-rich notes of barbecue, and evokes the grills that were fired up on the coast a century ago, as kuku paka hopped from kitchen to kitchen, edited and revised in each.Ms. Kalyonge first cooks the chicken gently, wrapped in foil on the charcoal grill. Then she takes out the meat and sets it back on the grate, uncovered, to crisp the skin and to stripe each piece in so many shades of dark brown.\u201cThat extra step that we take, before finishing it off in coconut sauce,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is what makes it Kenyan.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: He\u2019s Your (Ferry) Captain", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byNew York TodayUpdated, 9:58 a.m.Good morning on this radiant Thursday.Ahoy, New York.Even after years at the helm, he finds that some of his friends still don\u2019t understand what his job entails.That misconception vanishes when he explains that his boats have concession stands, bathrooms, and heating and air conditioning.Mr. Santana\u2019s days begin as early as 5 a.m., when he commutes by bicycle from his home in South Williamsburg to the Brooklyn Navy Yard to meet with his three-person crew and inspect the ferry before it pulls out into the busy waters.On the water, he juggles keeping close watch on his craft through cameras above and below deck, communicating with other boats, and monitoring the currents, tides and skies.\u201cSeagulls are the best way to see what\u2019s going on with the wind,\u201d he told us, while bound for the Rockaways in Queens. \u201cYou just stare into the sky and see which way they\u2019re gliding.\u201dThe ebbs and flows of traffic in New York\u2019s waters, however, are a bit harder to predict.In a reversal of most people\u2019s commutes, Mr. Santana said, the commotion from tugboats, barges, divers and kayaks usually picks up after the morning rush hour and dies down before the evening.And it\u2019s nothing like the packed streets of New York, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s calmer than in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out here in the harbor, it feels peaceful. You\u2019re still in New York, but outside the chaos of the streets.\u201dEven more so if you catch a ride with Mr. Santana \u2014 he\u2019s what you\u2019d call a smooth sailor.\u201cI\u2019m really laid back,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth running the boat and docking, I\u2019m trying to make the ride as soft and safe as possible.\u201dThat makes him the ideal pilot for those looking to enjoy the sights: the Statue of Liberty, Governors Island, or the skyscrapers of the Financial District, which still give Mr. Santana \u201ca little fuzzy feeling\u201d when he glides by.Our ferryboat captain even offered us a nautical tip for later in the summer: Board the East River ferry or the new South Brooklyn ferry before the fireworks on the Fourth of July for an intense, up-close experience.\u201cYou can feel the pressure of the fireworks in your chest,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the moments that remind you that, yeah, this is a great job.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:(Perfect day for a boat ride, wouldn\u2019t you say?)Things simmer down a bit later, with a clear, cool evening ahead.This week\u2019s weather has flip-flopped between soggy and sunny, with similar uncertainty expected for the next few days.Last year, there were 23 closure days and 18 warning days across our city\u2019s eight public beaches, according to the Health Department.(We should note that it\u2019s not just sewage causing problems; often, the beaches were closed because of visible debris in the water or tropical storm conditions.)The good news for today: All our city\u2019s public beaches have the green light for swimming and wading.Advertisement"}
