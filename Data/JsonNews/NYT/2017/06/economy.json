{"Headline": "A President at War With His Fed Chief, 5 Decades Before Trump", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis was originally published in June 2017, but was updated on Thursday.A new president takes office with big plans, and needs a booming economy to help underwrite his promises. A Federal Reserve chief sees an economy starting to overheat, and begins warning of the need for higher interest rates.They were bound to clash: Lyndon B. Johnson, the new president, and William McChesney Martin, the longtime, fiscally conservative Fed chairman.Today, when the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, acts, we figure he is not doing Mr. Trump\u2019s bidding. But that independence was not always assumed in the Fed\u2019s early years, and Martin\u2019s standoff with Johnson provided a template for interactions between the Federal Reserve and the White House for decades to come.Within days of ascending to the White House after President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination in November 1963, Johnson had an agenda that included passage of a big income tax cut that had been one of Kennedy\u2019s legislative priorities. A year later, after winning the 1964 election, Johnson pursued fighting two wars: one on poverty, and one in Vietnam. Both would lead to significant budget deficits.Martin saw all this additional spending as a formula for inflation. He also feared he was not getting accurate information from the administration on their spending plans \u2014 that some spending on the Vietnam War was not being reported.Their conflict led to a fiery climax at the Johnson Ranch near Johnson City, Tex., when Martin was unwilling to bend to the president\u2019s will. The relationship \u2014 destined to range from warm to cagey to confrontational \u2014 was off to a good start when, eight days after the tragic shooting in Dallas, Johnson telephoned Martin to express gratitude for a note of support.\u201cNo act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of President Kennedy than the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this long year,\u201d he said, speaking to a joint session of Congress and a national television audience. A thunderous ovation followed.By March 1964, Congress had passed the tax cut and the economy was cruising. In August, Guy Noyes, the Fed\u2019s chief economist, was nothing short of effusive. \u201cIt is hard to be critical of the recent performance of the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been little short of magnificent.\u201dThis rosy picture was disrupted by an event across the Atlantic. Martin\u2019s folksy banter belied a crisis that had demanded quick reflexes by the Fed. By a narrow margin, British voters elected the first Labour government in 15 years, and its ministers followed with a series of big spending plans to nationalize industries and expand social services. The prospect of inflation prompted currency traders to dump the British pound, forcing the Bank of England to raise its discount rate to 7 percent from 5 percent, a huge jump. To prevent those higher rates from drawing dollars away from the United States, the Fed raised its own rate, by one-half of 1 percentage point.Johnson seemed to appreciate how Martin used a news conference to calm any distress in the markets, but he had one question: Would the rate increase tighten the money supply in the United States?His words were heard. That afternoon the New York Stock Exchange had one of its sharpest declines since Kennedy\u2019s assassination, and the next day The New York Times reported on Page 1 that \u201cReserve Board Chief Compares Boom Today With That of 20\u2019s.\u201d Johnson, at his next news conference, went out of his way to dispel \u201cgloom and doom\u201d about the economy.Martin\u2019s behavior, Fowler said, was giving Americans the impression there were \u201ctwo quarterbacks\u201d running the economy \u2014 Martin and Johnson.Johnson made sure Fowler passed along his warning.His voice rising, he then told Fowler they needed to replace Martin with a \u201ctough guy\u201d to run the central bank.The vote was 4 to 3. Martin cast the deciding ballot.In Texas, Johnson was enraged. Joseph Califano, an aide (later a cabinet secretary under President Jimmy Carter), recalled Johnson\u2019s \u201cburning up the wires to Washington, asking one member of Congress after another, \u2018How can I run the country and the government if I have to read on a news-service ticker that Bill Martin is going to run his own economy?\u2019\u201dMartin was summoned to explain why he had defied the president. Martin flew down to the Johnson Ranch on Monday, Dec. 6, along with Fowler and other advisers. The president met them at an airstrip behind the wheel of his\u00a0Lincoln convertible. They piled in and he drove them to the house. There, Johnson got Martin alone\u00a0and did not mince words. According to different accounts, the 6-foot-4 Johnson pushed the shorter Martin up against a wall. \u201cYou went ahead and did something that you knew I disapproved of, that can affect my entire term here,\u201d Johnson said, as Martin recalled later in an oral history. \u201cYou took advantage of me and I\u2019m not going to forget it, because here I am, a sick man. You\u2019ve got me into a position where you can run a rapier into me and you\u2019ve run it.\u201d\u201cMartin, my boys are dying in Vietnam, and you won\u2019t print the money I need,\u201d he said. Martin stood his ground. He pointed out that he had given the president fair warning that a raise was coming. More broadly, he insisted that he and the president had different jobs to do, that the Federal Reserve Act gave the Fed responsibility over interest rates. \u201cI knew you disapproved of it, but I had to call the shot as I saw it,\u201d he said. The two eventually stepped outside and tried to assure reporters that any differences had been patched up. Their sour expressions, captured in newspapers the next day, suggested otherwise.  Despite their differences, Johnson renominated Martin to the Fed chairman\u2019s job one year later. Martin would step down in 1970 during the administration of Richard M. Nixon, the fifth president he served under, after having had the longest term of any Fed chief. In the end, it appears Martin left the punch bowl out too long.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Unfettered Powers", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialEmmanuel Macron\u2019s grip on political power seems unshakable after the first round of France\u2019s legislative voting on Sunday. Mr. Macron won the presidency of France in May, a mere 13 months after starting his political movement, a remarkable achievement ratified by Sunday\u2019s vote.Projections indicate that his party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche (The Republic on the Move), may win more than 400 seats in France\u2019s 577-seat National Assembly after a final round of voting on Sunday. That would give Mr. Macron the ability to freely enact promised reforms to jump-start France\u2019s lagging economy and encourage job creation, something his three immediate predecessors tried but failed to do.Sunday\u2019s election does not, however, reflect enthusiasm on the part of a majority of French voters. More than half stayed away from the polls, the highest rate of voter abstention since 1958. And with the political opposition in tatters, and many political novices owing their seats to the president, Mr. Macron could face temptations to abuse executive power.Mr. Macron has already moved rapidly to bolster security in the face of the continuing terrorist threat by creating a national counterterrorism center at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, reporting directly to him. He has also drafted a bill, which will be presented at a cabinet meeting on June 21, that would permanently legalize much of the state of emergency declared by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande shortly after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015.The only thing preventing the bill from becoming law may be France\u2019s Constitutional Council. On Friday, the council wisely rejected one vaguely worded provision of the state of emergency that allowed authorities to bar individuals from areas where they might hamper police action, say, by participating in demonstrations.The council must not allow what was meant to have been an extraordinary, temporary suspension of citizens\u2019 rights to become permanent. Otherwise, the promise of Mr. Macron\u2019s fresh start for France could result in a more repressive republic and set the stage for other abuses of executive power beyond his mandate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angola\u2019s Corrupt Building Boom: \u2018Like Opening a Window and Throwing Out Money\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUANDA, Angola \u2014 An ambitious reconstruction plan after Angola\u2019s civil war was meant to reach even the country\u2019s most faraway corner, a region known as the Land at the End of the World.But the area\u2019s new paved road abruptly turns to dirt about five miles before reaching the city of Cuito Cuanavale, the result of a mysterious disappearance in public funds.\u201cThey\u2019re building, but they\u2019re not doing it well,\u201d said Domingos Jeremias, 48, a farmer whose assessment was echoed by the other men milling around the center of the city, obliterated during the war, which lasted from 1975 to 2002. \u201cThere\u2019s always something missing.\u201dWhen the war ended, Angola enjoyed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Its production of oil was set to swell and prices would remain high for years. Unlike many other African nations emerging from war, Angola had more than enough money to rebuild, on its own terms, a landscape destroyed by conflict.The skyline of the capital, Luanda, was quickly reshaped with skyscrapers. Gigantic satellite towns, the likes of which had never been seen in Africa, mushroomed in the outskirts of Luanda. New roads and railways stretched into the interior.But Angola\u2019s reconstruction and oil boom also presented the politically connected \u2014 those with \u201crelatives in the kitchen,\u201d as Angolans say \u2014 with a golden opportunity for self-enrichment. In an economy driven by President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, his inner circle of family and allies have amassed extraordinary wealth.Lopo do Nascimento, a former prime minister and onetime secretary general of the ruling party, said that spending on reconstruction had been \u201clike opening a window and throwing out money.\u201dBillions spent on rebuilding \u2014 guided by politically connected Angolans and carried out by foreign contractors \u2014 vanished into individuals\u2019 pockets, according to politicians, businessmen and academics. Little was done to ensure the money spent on reconstruction would yield lasting benefits to Angola\u2019s economy.\u201cIt\u2019s now time to say, \u2018If building or rebuilding this costs 10, I won\u2019t invoice for 20 and pocket the other 10,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nascimento said in an interview at his home, a large villa with half a dozen luxury cars parked in an inner driveway.It is impossible to determine exactly how much has disappeared from government coffers, though there are clues.During the same period, Angolan companies and individuals invested $189 billion overseas in often opaque transactions, according to the center.\u201cWho are those people making investments outside the country?\u201d asked Francisco Miguel Paulo, an economist at the center. \u201cHow did they earn that money?\u201dWhen peace finally came after 27 years of civil war and, before that, 13 years of a war of liberation against the country\u2019s former colonial ruler, Portugal, much of the country lay in ruins.Today, Angola has thousands of miles of new roads and railways, new airports, sports stadiums, hydroelectric dams, water treatment centers, government buildings and fancy shopping malls.In Huambo, a city that was the rebellion\u2019s headquarters and was destroyed during the war, few buildings still carry the war\u2019s scars. In the city center, stately government buildings, including a provincial library, surround a large roundabout.On a 500-mile drive from Huambo, in the country\u2019s center, to Cuito Cuanavale, in the southeast, every small town appeared to have a new school or clinic \u2014 easily spotted because government buildings are painted pink.\u201cWe\u2019re satisfied,\u201d said Jacob Candimba, 27, a resident of Cuito Cuanavale. \u201cBefore, we didn\u2019t have roads, water or electricity.\u201dBut in the capital, even though this is where the government has focused its reconstruction, there was still seething anger.In Sambizanga, a Luanda slum where Mr. dos Santos was born 74 years ago, narrow, muddy roads crisscross a labyrinth of concrete houses and tin shacks.One recent afternoon, two days after heavy rains, a handful of young men drank beer on a dry strip of road.\u201cWe live bad, without any basic sanitation, without any electricity,\u201d said Luquene Antonio, 24, an unemployed plumber wearing rain boots.Nearby, two children played inside an abandoned refrigerator floating in murky water.Since 2002, Angola has spent $120 billion on reconstruction, according to the Center for Studies and Scientific Research. At its peak, spending reached $15.8 billion in 2014.In the years after the war, new offshore oil fields came online, doubling Angola\u2019s daily production to nearly two million barrels a day and turning its economy into one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing.Oil also gave the Angolan government a freedom rarely seen in Africa, allowing it to circumvent Western governments and international lenders \u2014 and decide exactly how and what to rebuild. With oil-backed loans negotiated with China, Angola outsourced the country\u2019s reconstruction to state-owned Chinese companies and their subcontractors. Companies from other Portuguese-speaking nations, like Brazil and Portugal, also shared in the building boom.But the Angolan model of oil-for-infrastructure came with serious drawbacks, experts said. The deals between Angola and its foreign partners lacked transparency and often resulted in projects of poor quality, either because of a lack of oversight or outright corruption.Like many businessmen, Carlos Cunha, whose company deals in agriculture, distribution and tourism, said the new infrastructure\u2019s poor quality was the greatest impediment to growth. His trucks regularly ply a main highway from the interior to Luanda, transporting tropical fruits for shipment to Europe.\u201cOur trucks take eight hours on a 300-kilometer trip and can have two or three flat tires,\u201d Mr. Cunha said, referring to a distance of about 190 miles. \u201cAngola would have gained more with 2,000 kilometers of well-built roads rather than 5,000 kilometers of poorly built roads.\u201dAs foreign contractors have held a grip on reconstruction, little expertise and few skills were passed on to Angolans or domestic companies, experts said.Reconstruction \u201ccan only be sustainable if we train people,\u201d said Mr. Nascimento, the former prime minister, who emphasized that training had not occurred.Expatriate workers can often be seen performing tasks that locals would undertake elsewhere in Africa. On a main road in Luanda, half a dozen Portuguese workers were painting lane lines on a recent afternoon.Along a railway rebuilt by the Chinese, Chinese workers are busy painting and cutting grass, said Jos\u00e9 Severino, the president of the Industrial Association of Angola, adding that regulations requiring local participation in reconstruction projects were almost never enforced.Angolan government officials did not respond to requests for comments or interviews.But a sweeping scandal a continent away has provided a glimpse into how things work in Angola. Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant, admitted in a New York federal court that it had paid $50 million to secure contracts in the African nation and agreed last December to pay up to $4.5 billion to settle bribery cases totaling $800 million worldwide.Tellingly, the Angolan government has ignored Odebrecht\u2019s admission of guilt as well as critics\u2019 pressure to investigate.Marcolino Moco, who served as a prime minister and secretary general of the ruling party under Mr. dos Santos but is now a government critic, said that during the oil and reconstruction boom in recent years, power was further concentrated in the president\u2019s hands \u2014 fueling corrupt practices in his inner circle.\u201cI\u2019m no saint,\u201d Mr. Moco said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t accept the vulgarization of corruption,\u201d referring to how ordinary the practice had become.In 2008, as Mr. dos Santos campaigned for re-election, he promised to build one million new houses by 2012, a pledge meant to address the severe shortage of decent housing in the country.In a few short years, half a dozen satellite towns have appeared on Luanda\u2019s outskirts, arising on a scale that had never been attempted on the continent. But the projects became a symbol to many of the ruling elite\u2019s insatiable drive to accumulate even more wealth.The new towns \u2014 each with tens of thousands of people living in dozens of nearly identical high-rise towers \u2014 were new to Africa. If they looked as if they had been plucked out of Asia, it is because they were built by Chinese construction companies.The problem, critics said, is who got the units and how.A private Angolan company, Delta Imobiliaria, was given the lucrative contract to sell the units, even though the company\u2019s owners included high-ranking government officials with direct influence over reconstruction projects.Despite fierce demand for Kilamba\u2019s apartments, many of the units are thought to have gone to ruling party supporters despite Mr. dos Santos\u2019s campaign talk of social housing.On a recent Friday afternoon in Kilamba, four young women were chatting about their evening plans on a street with cafes and restaurants. The women\u2019s parents were government officials, and one of them, Gabriela Agostinho, 20, said it had been easy for her family to secure a unit.\u201cMy father is a policeman,\u201d she said, adding that he was of high rank.Most public spaces in Kilamba are now overgrown with weeds and littered with trash \u2014 a reflection of the lack of maintenance afflicting much of Angola\u2019s reconstruction.\u201cIn the beginning, people loved to say they live in Kilamba,\u201d said Francisco Fonseca, 21, who moved into the development with his parents three years ago. \u201cBut not anymore. It\u2019s lost its impact.\u201dStill, to many, Kilamba remained a dream.Late one afternoon, three young men were rummaging through large trash bins in Kilamba. They said they came every day to look for food and other goods in Kilamba.\u201cWe\u2019d love to live here, but we just don\u2019t know how,\u201d said Adriano Adao, 25, who was eating beans from a plastic container he had found in the bin.\u201cThis place isn\u2019t for people like us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s for people with relatives in the kitchen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Kindergarten Blast in China, \u2018The World Didn\u2019t Seem Real\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byXUZHOU, China \u2014 On most days, the pageant of parents jostling to pick up their children began at 4:45 p.m. on the tree-lined streets outside the Chuangxin kindergarten. Car horns blared. Parents whistled and waved their arms, holding boxes of juice and cookies, as the children emerged.But on Thursday, the rite turned into a scene of carnage, as an explosion outside the school\u2019s main gate killed eight people and injured 65 others. Children, their faces covered in blood, screamed on the sidewalk. Parents lay on the street, some unconscious and others pleading for help.\u201cSuddenly, we were in a nightmare,\u201d said Bo Li, 62, who was waiting to pick up his 4-year-old granddaughter. \u201cThe world didn\u2019t seem real.\u201dChinese investigators on Friday pointed to a suspect in the explosion, Xu Taoran, 22, a university dropout who had written violent screeds against parents and children. The police recovered explosive materials in the home of Mr. Xu, who died at the scene.\u201cThey feel frustrated that they can\u2019t solve the problems in their life,\u201d said Pi Yijun, a criminology professor at China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing. \u201cThe attention and terror they get by hurting children are far more than that achieved from hurting adults.\u201dWhile a booming economy has spread prosperity across China, rapid changes in society have caused anxiety in some regions. In recent years, as the economy slowed, a glut of college graduates has left many young people struggling to find work.Mr. Xu, who lived across the street from the kindergarten, seemed to be grappling with feelings of isolation. Over the past several days, he appeared to reach a breaking point, writing violent messages inside apartment buildings, the authorities said.\u201cCriminals=fathers and mothers,\u201d said a message scribbled in an apartment entryway that was viewed by The New York Times.\u201cWhen two people commit a crime, two people die,\u201d said another. \u201cWhen a nation commits a crime, a nation dies.\u201dJoshua Miller, a professor at Smith College who has studied attacks at schools, said many people in China were caught between traditional definitions of love, success and filial piety and the pressures of modern life.\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lot of social upheaval, people are in a less secure, stable situation in general,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes there is a localized grievance, fueled by a person\u2019s sense of being disenfranchised, angry and upset at unfairness or inequality in society.\u201dAt the same time, many Chinese hospitals are ill equipped to handle patients with mental health problems. The country\u2019s psychiatric system was torn apart under Chairman Mao, who considered mental illness a creation of the bourgeoisie and prescribed communist writings as a remedy.In recent years, the field has made important strides. But financing remains limited, and a social stigma against people with mental illness is pervasive.\u201cThere\u2019s been far fewer public health campaigns like in the West that have educated people that psychiatric problems are an illness,\u201d Professor Miller said.Attacks at schools have gained widespread attention in recent years, prompting some reflection about campus safety and mental health. Guns are strictly regulated in China, but assailants often employ knives and other tools.In addition to the 2012 attack, a man wielding a knife climbed over the wall of a kindergarten in January and attacked 11 students in Pingxiang, a city in the southern region of Guangxi. And last month, a disgruntled driver in eastern China lit a school bus on fire, state news media reported, killing 11 children.Top government officials, including Premier Li Keqiang, have in the past promised to improve school safety. But mental health issues persist, especially in rural areas, where health care for the poor is often inadequate.The Chinese Ministry of Education, seeking to ease concerns among parents, issued an order on Friday calling for stricter security on school campuses in light of the case in Xuzhou.The authorities have said that no children or teachers from the kindergarten were killed in the explosion there on Thursday. Most of the victims appeared to be parents and grandparents, who were lining up outside the school gate to pick up students, according to interviews with relatives and hospital officials. When the explosion occurred, children were still inside classrooms, parents said.Witnesses said the explosion had occurred just as the main gate was sliding open for dismissal. In interviews, residents said they did not recall seeing Mr. Xu at the scene.But a dossier that circulated on social media and was verified by The Times said the police believed that Mr. Xu had thrown an explosive at the gate. The authorities said they had DNA evidence linking Mr. Xu to the attack.Li Quanquan, 27, who was picking up his son, said the crowd of people had fallen to the ground as soon as the explosion broke out.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what had happened,\u201d he said from a hospital bed as he received treatment for hearing problems. \u201cI lost consciousness.\u201dMr. Xu\u2019s parents worked for the People\u2019s Liberation Army. As a child, he lived in a compound for military employees and their families in Xuzhou. His former neighbors said that the family was well off and that Mr. Xu appeared to have a normal childhood.Along the streets surrounding the kindergarten, residents said they worried about safety. A small explosion in a nearby apartment building several weeks earlier had gone unexplained, they said, and the police were slow to respond to Thursday\u2019s attack.\u201cIf it didn\u2019t happen so close to me, I wouldn\u2019t care,\u2019\u2019 said Liu Yao, who lives near the kindergarten. \u201cBut it\u2019s right here in my own neighborhood. It\u2019s frightening.\u2019\u2019Yufan Huang, Adam Wu and Karoline Kan contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Gratuitously Rejects the Paris Climate Accord", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Donald Trump does his best to destroy the world\u2019s hopes of reining in climate change, let\u2019s be clear about one thing: This has nothing to do with serving America\u2019s national interest. The U.S. economy, in particular, would do just fine under the Paris accord. This isn\u2019t about nationalism; mainly, it\u2019s about sheer spite.About the economics: At this point, I think, we have a pretty good idea of what a low-emissions economy would look like. I\u2019m sure that energy experts will disagree on the details, but the broad outline isn\u2019t hard to describe.Clearly, it would be an economy running on electricity \u2014 electric cars, electric heat, with internal combustion engines rare. The bulk of that electricity would, in turn, come from nonpolluting sources: wind, solar and, yes, probably nuclear.Of course, sometimes the wind doesn\u2019t blow or the sun shine when people want power. But there are multiple ways to deal with that issue: a robust grid that can ship electricity to where it\u2019s needed; storage of various forms (batteries, but also maybe things like pumped hydro); dynamic pricing that encourages customers to use less power when it\u2019s scarce and more when it isn\u2019t; and some surge capacity \u2014 probably from relatively low-emission natural-gas-fired generators \u2014 to cope with whatever mismatch remains.What would life in an economy that made such an energy transition be like? Almost indistinguishable from life in the economy we have now.People would still drive cars, live in houses that were heated in the winter and cooled in the summer, and watch videos about superheroes and funny cats. There would be a lot of wind turbines and solar panels, but most of us would ignore them the same way we currently ignore the smokestacks of conventional power plants.Meanwhile, there would be compensating benefits. Notably, the adverse health effects of air pollution would be greatly reduced, and it\u2019s quite possible that lower health care costs would all by themselves make up for the costs of energy transition, even ignoring the whole saving-civilization-from-catastrophic-climate-change thing.The point is that while tackling climate change in the way envisaged by the Paris accord used to look like a hard engineering and economic problem, these days it looks fairly easy. We have almost all the technology we need, and can be quite confident of developing the rest. Obviously the transition to a low-emissions economy, the phasing out of fossil fuels, would take time, but that would be O.K. as long as the path was clear.Why, then, are so many people on the right determined to block climate action, and even trying to sabotage the progress we\u2019ve been making on new energy sources?Don\u2019t tell me that they\u2019re honestly worried about the inherent uncertainty of climate projections. All long-term policy choices must be made in the face of an uncertain future (duh); there\u2019s as much scientific consensus here as you\u2019re ever likely to see on any issue. And in this case, uncertainty arguably strengthens the case for action, because the costs of getting it wrong are asymmetric: Do too much, and we\u2019ve wasted some money; do too little, and we\u2019ve doomed civilization.As I said, however, these days the fight against climate action is largely driven by sheer spite.And if all this sounds too petty and vindictive to be the basis for momentous policy decisions, consider the character of the man in the White House. Need I say more?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Battling Brands Online Has Gained Urgency, and Impact", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtUntil last week, Travis Kalanick, a founder of Uber and its chief executive, ruled his company absolutely. That was the Silicon Valley way; ever since Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple in the 1980s, tech founders have demanded, and been awarded, enormous deference by investors and corporate boards. So even as successive waves of scandal have hit Uber, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s position looked safe.It is the swiftness of the fall that\u2019s interesting here. In another time, Mr. Kalanick might have been able to hang on. But we live in an era dominated by the unyielding influence of social feeds. Every new Uber revelation ignited a massive campaign against the company on Twitter and Facebook. A swirl of negative branding took on a life of its own \u2014 and ultimately could not be ignored.But the effects of these campaigns go beyond business. In a nation where politics have grown pitched and sclerotic, fighting brands online suddenly feels like the most effective political action many of us can take. Posting a hashtag \u2014 #deleteUber, for instance, or #grabyourwallet \u2014 and threatening to back it up by withholding dollars can bring about a much quicker, more visible change in the world than, say, calling your representative.Yet the mechanics of social media suggest it will be the cultural and political left, more than the right, that might win the upper hand with this tactic \u2014 especially when harnessing the power of brands to fight larger battles for racial and gender equality, as in the Uber and Fox News cases.To see why, we must first understand why brands are suddenly more vulnerable to consumer sentiment than they once were. It all comes down to one thing: Social media is the new TV.In the era when television shaped mainstream consumer sentiment, companies enjoyed enormous power to alter their image through advertising. Then came the internet, which didn\u2019t kill advertising, but did dilute its power. Brands now have little say over how their messages get chewed up through our social feeds.Yes, they can run ads on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and everyplace else. But social media elevates consumers over corporate marketing; suddenly what matters isn\u2019t what an ad says about a company, but what your friends think about that company.It\u2019s this loss of power that explains why brands have become so jumpy and reactive. Take the production of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d that opened last week in Central Park as part of Shakespeare in the Park. In the play, a Caesar who is styled to look like Mr. Trump is graphically assassinated on stage, which many on the right took as disparaging the president.But none of that matters in 2017, when Twitter shapes the news. On social media, there\u2019s no room for nuanced portrayals of complex artistic treatments. There are only quick snatches of graphic imagery in your scrolling feed \u2014 and the sight of a Trump-styled Caesar getting assassinated proved too much for powerless brands to stomach.\u201cI think it\u2019s ultimately healthy and positive even when I don\u2019t agree with it \u2014 it\u2019s healthy and positive that consumers are making themselves heard,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s only in the last 15 years that women became aware of their own consumer power,\u201d Ms. Coulter said. \u201cAnd now, online, they can show that they\u2019re willing to flex it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When LeEco also began selling investment products online, Mr. Li snapped them up, even though the company said little about where the money would go.\u201cWhenever I have leftover money from my salary, I\u2019ll invest it,\u201d Mr. Li said, explaining that he had invested $7,000 in the company. \u201cMy spare change? I put it in.\u201dAll the while, its finances were deteriorating. Even as it continued to raise money, LeEco filled the lobby of its offices with potted plants to keep angry creditors from loitering there.\u201cThe problems are real, but manageable,\u201d said Arthur R. Kroeber, the head of research at Gavekal Dragonomics, an economic research firm based in Beijing. \u201cThe government needs to start managing them.\u201dLeEco, a catchall name for a variety of businesses controlled by the internet tycoon Jia Yueting, poses little threat by itself to China\u2019s financial system. But a review of the company\u2019s finances shows the extent of the opaque ways Chinese firms can use to raise money \u2014 and how failures could ripple through the system.A spokeswoman said LeEco\u2019s efforts to raise money complied with the law. Mr. Jia declined requests for an interview.To borrow more than $2.1 billion since the start of last year, LeEco affiliates have turned to China\u2019s vast but poorly understood informal financial system.LeEco raised $215 million from selling so-called wealth management products online, according to public data. In China, such investments promise a good rate of return and the illusion of a guarantee, but they offer little disclosure. LeEco listed the products on its app as \u201clow risk.\u201dMr. Li, the music teacher, bought LeEco wealth management products that promised an annualized return of up to 7 percent. He is not concerned about getting his money back.\u201cI\u2019m not too interested in where the money is going,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a Le TV and a Le phone. I\u2019m not worried.\u201dAccording to the latest available data, Mr. Jia has pledged 97 percent of his shares in LeEco\u2019s main publicly traded arm, Leshi Internet, to back loans primarily from securities brokerages. In November, those loans totaled $1.7 billion.Venturing into other corners of China\u2019s financial system, LeEco has raised $2.4 billion since last year by selling shares or debt convertible into shares in its various privately owned affiliates. Because those businesses are not publicly traded, they get less scrutiny from Chinese securities regulators than companies that sell shares on a public stock market.Mo Lingmei was among nearly 400 people to buy stakes in Le Sports, a LeEco affiliate that acquires sports broadcasting rights such as the right to show Premier League soccer online in China. Ms. Mo, who sells clothes online, said she drained her family\u2019s savings to come up with half of the $300,000 that a group of friends pooled together to invest in the company\u2019s $1.2 billion funding round last year.\u201cIt was an impulse decision,\u201d she said, adding that Mr. Jia \u201cwas so hot at the time, on TV, in the media, in the paper. I\u2019d never invested in anything before.\u201dMany of the company\u2019s problems have lingered. Last month, LeEco laid off 325 workers in the United States. Some affiliates have started new fund-raising efforts.In April, 37 representatives of small suppliers demanded that they be repaid $10 million owed to them by a LeEco affiliate. They staged a weeklong sit-in in the lobby of LeEco\u2019s office tower in Beijing, until large potted plants were placed in the sitting area. At LeEco\u2019s ride-sharing affiliate, Yidao Yongche, drivers have had trouble getting paid for weeks and have started protesting at several of the company\u2019s offices across China.LeEco says it is on the mend, citing a $2.2 billion injection in January from a Chinese real estate developer. At an investor meeting in May, Mr. Jia acknowledged that layoffs and asset sales were underway but said the moves would \u201callow our core operations, especially the nonpublic businesses, to enter a fast-paced recovery period.\u201dMr. Jia\u2019s commitment has reassured a number of investors, including Hu Yenan, who has formed a company to bring people together and pour money into the conglomerate\u2019s various businesses.One partnership Mr. Hu formed bought into a $1.08 billion offering of debt convertible into shares in LeEco\u2019s electric car start-ups, Faraday Future and LeSee. Mr. Jia, he noted, had personally guaranteed the debt.\u201cIf Warren Buffett comes to you asking for money, would you lend to him?\u201d Mr. Hu asked. \u201cOf course you would.\u201dYufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}

Can a democracy be destroyed by someone who has only the barest idea of what the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d means? Can pure incompetence plunge the world into a catastrophic war? We don\u2019t like to think so.We imagine the villains of history as cunning strategists, brilliant masterminds of horror. This happens because we learn about them from history books, which weave narratives that retrospectively imbue events with logic, making them seem predetermined. Historians and their readers bring an unavoidable perception bias to the story: If a historical event caused shocking destruction, then the person behind this event must have been a correspondingly giant monster. Terrifying as it is to contemplate the catastrophes of the 20th century, it would be even more frightening to imagine that humanity had stumbled unthinkingly into its darkest moments.But a careful reading of contemporary accounts will show that both Hitler and Stalin struck many of their countrymen as men of limited ability, education and imagination \u2014 and, indeed, as being incompetent in government and military leadership. Contrary to popular wisdom, they are not political savants, possessed of one extraordinary talent that brings them to power. It is the blunt instrument of reassuring ignorance that propels their rise in a frighteningly complex world.Modern strongmen are more obviously human. We have witnessed the greed and vanity of Silvio Berlusconi, who ran Italy\u2019s economy into the ground. We recognize the desperate desire of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to be admired or at least feared \u2014 usually literally at his country\u2019s expense. Still, physical distance makes villains seem bigger than they are in real life. Many Americans imagine that Mr. Putin is a brilliant strategist, a skilled secret agent turned popular leader.In the past few months, Americans too have grown familiar with the sight of a president who seems to think that politics consists of demonstrating that he is in charge. This similarity is not an accident (nor is it a result of Russian influence). The rejection of the complexity of modern politics \u2014 as well as modern business and modern life in general \u2014 lies at the core of populism\u2019s appeal. The first American president with no record of political or military service, Donald Trump ran on a platform of denigrating expertise. His message was that anyone with experience in politics was a corrupt insider and, indeed, that a lack of experience was the best qualification.That is why Mr. Trump fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director. Mr. Comey was annoying, and Mr. Trump, the most powerful man in the world, wanted him to go away. In his subsequent interviews, he displayed a clear lack of comprehension of why the news media and the Washington establishment insisted on creating so many complications in the wake of such a simple act as dismissing an employee. The sequence of events that followed \u2014 from the appointment of a special counsel to Mr. Comey\u2019s expected testimony in the Senate \u2014 would have been predictable in a conventional, complicated view of the political world. In the Trumpian universe, however, one effective gesture simply makes a problem go away.Consider some of the latest revelations to have shocked the nation: Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, appears to have asked the Russian government, back in December, to provide the incoming administration with a secret communication channel based in Russian facilities. In the complicated world of American politics, Mr. Kushner\u2019s behavior appears bizarre, dangerous and, most of all, inexplicable. In the Trumpian universe, there is likely to be a simple explanation, such as the incoming president\u2019s desire to boast of a tremendous accomplishment before he took office, and his son-in-law\u2019s being dispatched to negotiate an anti-terrorist alliance by making a few calls \u2014 the way Mr. Trump himself negotiated with Carrier, the air-conditioning company, a deal to keep several hundred jobs in the United States. Whatever the objective, pushing aside the accumulated national-security and foreign-relations expertise of the United States government came naturally to the budding Trump administration, which attacks institutions and attempts to render expertise irrelevant every step of the way.This is one way an autocracy can come into being. In other words, it is Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence on simplicity that makes him want to rule like an autocrat. Militant incompetence and autocracy are not in opposition: They are two sides of a coin.Masha Gessen is a contributing opinion writer and the author of \u201cThe Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clouds Are Forming Over the Bond Market", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe bond market is flashing warning signals that bad times may be ahead for the stock market and the economy.That is probably not what most people want to hear \u2014 stock investors especially. In the first half of the year, after all, stocks have performed spectacularly. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index returned 9 percent through June, churning out gains so regularly that it may seem churlish to note that clouds are appearing on the horizon.Yet like a long-range forecast about a possible storm, an old and trusted financial indicator is telling us that trouble may be looming.Simply put, while the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates since December, the bond market hasn\u2019t gotten the memo. The longer-term rates that are set through bond market trading have, for the most part, been declining, though there was a brief reversal in the last few days. But the disconnect over the last few months is a sign that bond investors believe economic growth and inflation are still weak and the Fed\u2019s actions are premature.In the past, when disputes between the Fed and the bond market have persisted and grown, they have sometimes predicted big problems ahead \u2014 like a plunging stock market and, eventually, a recession.Rain is coming, Mr. Rosenberg said, recommending that investors prepare by keeping enough cash on hand and setting up their portfolios to weather a storm. Regions like the eurozone are in an earlier stage of the economic cycle, he said, and may be better bets now. He urges caution in the United States. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you when it is going to happen,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the economic cycle has not been abolished, and the chances of a recession are rising.\u201dThough there is widespread concern about the behavior of the fixed-income markets, some analysts aren\u2019t as convinced that the forecast is quite so gloomy.\u201cThe economy is growing very slowly,\u201d he added, \u201cat a pace of less than 2 percent per year, a rate that we used to call \u2018stall speed,\u2019 in the belief that when the economy is that feeble, it will fall into a recession. But that hasn\u2019t happened. The economy keeps growing, the stock market keeps going up, yet inflation remains very low. Where are we heading? There are many possibilities here. This isn\u2019t the economy we used to know.\u201dUnderstanding the situation more deeply requires a little technical knowledge, so bear with me.The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, lowered short-term rates to near-zero levels during the financial crisis. With the economy on the mend, and asset prices like stocks and real estate soaring, Fed officials have begun raising short-term rates and say they intend to continue to do so.What is unusual is that while the short-term rates that are controlled and heavily influenced by the Fed have been rising, the longer-term rates that the bond market sets have generally been dropping. That is why 30-year fixed mortgage rates are still below 4 percent, not all that much higher than they were a year ago.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for example, declined from more than 2.6 percent in March to about 2.1 percent earlier in June. (It rose to 2.3 percent on Friday.) The rate on the 10-year note has been hovering at only about 1 percentage point above the Fed funds rate and 0.6 or 0.7 of a percentage point above the three-year Treasury note.In bond market jargon, \u201cthe yield curve has been flattening\u201d \u2014 meaning short- and long-term interest rates have been moving closer to parity. In itself, such a development is unusual. But if the trend continues, with shorter-term rates rising above longer-term rates, the message from the bond market would amount to a flashing red light.In such a case, bond mavens would say, \u201cThe yield curve has inverted,\u201d implying a reversal of the natural order of things, because most of the time, investors demand a yield premium for tying their money up for longer periods. An inversion would express deep skepticism about Fed policy and about the health of the economy. In the past, inversions have often predicted economic recessions and sharp declines in the stock market.That said, we don\u2019t have an inversion at this point, and we may not go there at all.Mr. Yardeni remains bullish on United States stocks and is cautiously positive about the economy, saying low bond yields probably reflect persistently low inflation, which could be benign. Factors like demography (the aging of the baby boom generation), technology (the efficiency of smartphones and cloud computing) and globalization have changed the economy and reduced the inflation rate, he said.Low inflation, along with low global interest rates, are at least partly responsible for the low bond yields in the United States. Those low yields have been a boon to people who own bonds because yield and price move in opposite directions: The benchmark Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate index returned more than 2.4 percent through June, despite predictions early in the year of bad times for bond investors.The danger signals from the bond market could easily change to another pattern. The Fed may pause in raising short-term rates, though that could unleash irrational exuberance and drive already stretched stock prices higher. On the other hand, the bond market could blink, raising bond yields and relieving the tension. But that would be far more likely if, counter to current expectations, inflation or economic growth began to surge.At a bare minimum, the policy choices ahead are difficult. And for investors, there is ample reason for caution.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robocalypse Now? Central Bankers Argue Whether Automation Will Kill Jobs", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported bySINTRA, Portugal \u2014 The rise of robots has long been a topic for sci-fi best sellers and video games and, as of this week, a threat officially taken seriously by central bankers.The bankers are not yet ready to buy into dystopian visions in which robots render humans superfluous. But, at an exclusive gathering at a golf resort near Lisbon, the big minds of monetary policy were seriously discussing the risk that artificial intelligence could eliminate jobs on a scale that would dwarf previous waves of technological change.\u201cThere is no question we are in an era of people asking, \u2018Is the Robocalypse upon us?\u2019\u201d David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told an audience on Tuesday that included Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and dozens of other top central bankers and economists.The discussion occurred as economists were more optimistic than they had been for a decade about growth. Mr. Draghi used the occasion to signal that the European Central Bank is edging closer to the day when it will begin paring measures intended to keep interest rates very low and bolster the economy.But along with the optimism is a fear that the economic expansion might bypass large swaths of the population, in part because a growing number of jobs could be replaced by computers capable of learning \u2014 artificial intelligence.Policy makers and economists conceded that they have not paid enough attention to how much technology has hurt the earning power of some segments of society, or planned to address the concerns of those who have lost out. That has, in part, nourished the political populism that contributed to Britain\u2019s vote a year ago to leave the European Union, and the election of President Trump.In the past, technical advances caused temporary disruptions but ultimately improved living standards, creating new categories of employment along the way. Farm machinery displaced farmworkers but eventually they found better paying jobs, and today their great-grandchildren may design video games.But artificial intelligence threatens broad categories of jobs previously seen as safe from automation, such as legal assistants, corporate auditors and investment managers. Large groups of people could become obsolete, suffering the same fate as plow horses after the invention of the tractor.Central bankers have begun examining the effect of technology on employment because it might help solve several economic quandaries.Why is workers\u2019 share of total earnings declining, even though unemployment is at record lows and corporate profits at record highs? Why is productivity \u2014 the amount that a given worker produces \u2014 stuck in neutral?\u201cThe mere fact that we are organizing this conference here in Sintra testifies to our interest in that discussion,\u201d Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s executive board, said in an interview, referring to the \u201cRobocalypse\u201d debate.Of particular interest to the European Central Bank is why faster economic growth has not caused wages and prices to rise. The central bank has pulled out all the stops to stimulate the eurozone economy, cutting interest rates to zero and even below, while printing money. Four years of growth have led to the creation of 6.4 million jobs. Yet inflation remains well below the bank\u2019s official target of below, but close to, 2 percent.One explanation is that more work is being done by advanced computers, with the rewards flowing to the narrow elite that owns them.Still, among the economists in Sintra there was plenty of skepticism about whether the Robocalypse is nigh.Since the beginning of the industrial age, almost every major technological innovation has led to dire predictions that humans were being permanently replaced by machines.While some kinds of jobs were lost forever, greater efficiency led to more affordable goods and other industries soaked up the excess workers. Few people alive today would want to return to the late 1800s, when 40 percent of Americans worked on farms.Robocalypse advocates underestimate the power of scientific advances to beget more scientific advances, said Joel Mokyr, a professor at Northwestern University who studies the history of economics.\u201cThink about what computers are doing to our ability to discover science,\u201d Professor Mokyr said during a panel discussion, citing computers that can solve equations that have baffled mathematicians for decades. There may be breakthroughs that \u201cwe can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\u201dThere are other explanations for stagnant wages besides technology.Companies in Japan, the United States and Europe are sitting on hoards of cash, doling out the money to shareholders rather than investing in new buildings, equipment or innovative products. Just why is another topic of debate.Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google \u2014 whose self-driving technology may someday make taxi drivers unnecessary \u2014 said that the plunging cost of information technology \u201chas virtually eliminated the fixed cost of entering a business.\u201d Companies can rent software and computing power over the internet.And flat wages reflect the large number of women who have entered the work force in recent decades as well as the post World War II baby boom, Mr. Varian said, adding that those trends have run their course. \u201cWe are going to see a higher share going to labor,\u201d he said.Yet already, disruptions caused by technology help account for rampant pessimism among working-class and middle-class people across the developed world.Mr. Bernanke referred to polls showing that about twice as many Americans say the United States is on the wrong track than say the country is moving in the right direction.As a result, \u201clast November Americans elected as president a candidate with a dystopian view of the economy,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said.Mr. Autor, co-author of the Robocalypse paper, concluded that it was too early to say that robots are coming for people\u2019s jobs. But it could still happen in the future.\u201cI say not Robocalypse now,\u201d Mr. Autor said, \u201cperhaps Robocalypse later.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Immigrants No One Wants", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOn a recent Wednesday, 75 Guatemalans disembarked from one of three charter flights, all full of deportees from the United States, scheduled that day. The group was led into a hangar, where authorities gave them a perfunctory welcome: a hello, a snack and bus fare to wherever they were headed.The Guatemalan government\u2019s relationship to the deportees ended there. Considering them a burden, even an embarrassment, the Guatemalan state and society are unable and unwilling to assist the thousands of migrants being sent back home.Reintegrating them is no doubt a challenge. But so is doing nothing. And Guatemala and the United States have far more to gain by harnessing the economic, social and political capital these migrants bring back with them.One reason Guatemala doesn\u2019t do much with deportees is the widespread belief that they won\u2019t stay for long.On a recent visit to the country, I heard businessmen, public officials and community activists insist that Donald Trump and his wall would not intimidate aspiring migrants. But migrants aren\u2019t wasting time, either. As a community leader told me, \u201cEveryone is saying that they better rush now before Mr. Trump finishes his wall.\u201dIn fact, many Guatemalans want the migrants to go back. Their return spells an end to remittances that constitute about 10 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. And returning migrants are flooding an already depressed job sector, where three-quarters of the labor force works off the books.Not surprisingly, returning migrants aren\u2019t particularly liked. Guatemalans figure they were sent home for breaking the law; those with tattoos are ostracized, assumed to belong to a violent street gang. Employers won\u2019t hire them, and passers-by glance away.Of course, such treatment becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Denying migrants the assistance to reintegrate economically and socially will just make the country\u2019s problems worse.Marginalized individuals often join street gangs in a search to belong, and drug gangs and human traffickers recruit returning migrants. They know how to get across the border; many have lived in communities where gangs and organized crime fester; and they are the Guatemalans most familiar with the United States.While it\u2019s true that some migrants will head back north, many have no interest. One man I know, whose remittances were used to set up a T-shirt factory that employs his 10 children in his village, is heading home for good. Older returnees, especially those who have squirreled away enough money to survive, no longer feel pulled toward the United States.Categorizing all deportees as criminals is equally misleading. Whereas a minority are felons, many more committed misdemeanors, and the majority are guilty only of crossing the border illegally and working without a permit.Indeed, many migrants represent an untapped resource. Most left their countries as unskilled peasants, yet through resourcefulness and hard work in the United States they acquired a diverse set of professional skills and rose through the ranks.During my visit, I encountered bricklayers and carpenters who undertook sophisticated home renovation projects, professional landscapers who worked on golf courses, a leather craftsman who oversaw a briefcase-making business and a young sushi chef who spoke fluent English and even rudimentary Japanese. They are eager to put their skills to work in Guatemala, either by opening their own businesses or by finding a private-sector partner.For starters, the government should provide credit and, for those in the construction and tourism industries, ease cumbersome certification requirements so that they can ply their trade immediately. It could also develop a returnee-specific \u201clinked in\u201d program, where returning migrants would advertise their skills, connected to an effort to match them with businesses committed to diversifying and modernizing the Guatemalan economy.Inasmuch as the migrants could help stabilize the Central American region, the United States could also benefit from the skills of deportees. The Alliance for Prosperity, which the American government has provided funds for, aims to curb migration by alleviating poverty, lawlessness and violence. Among other things, it fosters international, public and private investments in education, health care and vocational training \u2014 goals that skilled returning migrants can help achieve.In my conversations with recently returned migrants, a pattern emerged.

{"Headline": "In Hong Kong, a Bureau Evolves With Its City", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byFor the past two decades, The New York Times had its Hong Kong bureau in a beautiful apartment halfway up the slopes of Victoria Peak, with a view of the harbor that gradually narrowed as more tall buildings were built farther down the hill.A 20-minute walk downhill was enough to reach many government offices and the Asia headquarters of dozens of multinationals. A nine-minute walk was all it took to reach the famous Peak Tram, pulled by a winch up one of the steepest slopes of any funicular in Asia. Or for some real exercise, which I tried to do several days a week as Hong Kong bureau chief when not on reporting trips, there was a 40-minute walk up many steep switchbacks to the top of the tram tracks, with magnificent views of Victoria Harbor and its skyscrapers in one direction and a glistening reservoir, a verdant valley and the South China Sea in the other direction.In the past 15 years, the journalism was transformed as well. When I arrived as bureau chief in 2002, the city and our news coverage were mostly focused on Southeast Asia. I would write articles in Microsoft Word and email them to New York for editing and publication in a printed newspaper. Photos were often an afterthought, with a photographer sometimes assigned only after a first draft of the article had been filed.By the time The New York Times transferred me to Shanghai last year, Hong Kong and our news coverage were concentrated on the ever-growing economic and geopolitical muscle of mainland China. I was writing stories in a New York Times online system for editing in Hong Kong and immediate posting to the internet.The Times has had offices in Hong Kong almost continuously for many decades. Henry R. Lieberman, living at a particularly prestigious address on Peak Road, was the bureau chief in 1952, when he was the founding president of Hong Kong\u2019s famous Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club. Hong Kong was a safe, well-run British colony then, perched on the almost completely closed border of China, where Mao\u2019s Communists had just won an exhausting civil war and soon after intervened in the Korean War, triggering an international trade embargo against China.The role of Hong Kong and the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club as a base for media coverage of Asia was quickly popularized by an Oscar-winning Hollywood movie in 1955, \u201cLove is a Many-Splendored Thing,\u201d based on an almost identically titled novel by Han Suyin. The novel and movie also examined the dark side of Hong Kong: widespread racial discrimination by the tiny white elite against the ethnic Chinese majority, a chronic problem that would disrupt the city\u2019s politics for decades afterward.Joe Lelyveld was the newspaper\u2019s Hong Kong bureau chief in the early 1970s, when China was still in the throes of the Cultural Revolution and so-called China watchers in Hong Kong studied mainland newspapers and transcripts of radio broadcasts for clues of what was happening in Beijing. Nicholas D. Kristof, now an op-ed columnist for The New York Times, was the Hong Kong bureau chief in the late 1980s. Both exemplified the kind of close students of Chinese politics for which the Hong Kong journalism community was long famous.\u201cHong Kong was a glorious mix of British officials, Chinese communists and spies from Israel to North Korea \u2014 all in a place with the best dim sum in the world,\u201d Nick wrote to me in an email this week.Nick closed the bureau at the end of 1987 when he was transferred to Beijing. He and his wife and colleague, Sheryl WuDunn, won a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.But with the approach of Britain\u2019s return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, The Times decided that it needed a bureau there once again. The foreign desk chose Edward A. Gargan, an experienced correspondent who had previously served as bureau chief in Beijing, New Delhi and Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and had closely followed Chinese politics for many years.An avid jogger, Ed selected Bowen Road, a leafy colonial road near downtown with little traffic. After a year in another apartment on Bowen Road, Ed moved into an aging building next door and converted a four-bedroom apartment into the bureau, with two bedrooms converted into offices for him and for a news assistant and the rest as living quarters. That apartment became The Times\u2019s base as the bureau evolved over the next two decades.Mark Landler, now one of our White House correspondents, succeeded Ed in the apartment in 1998. An experienced business reporter, he began the evolution of the Hong Kong bureau toward covering more business and economic news, initially with an emphasis on Southeast Asia. The Asian financial crisis was triggering violent street protests when Mark arrived, and he spent much of his first year covering the fiery uprisings that led to President Suharto\u2019s ouster in Indonesia.\u201cIt was always such a relief to come home to that fabulous apartment,\u201d Mark said. \u201cIt was like \u2018The Year of Living Dangerously\u2019 meets \u2018The Year of Living Comfortably\u2019.\u201dWhen Mark was transferred to become our Frankfurt bureau chief in early 2002, The New York Times transferred me to Hong Kong from Detroit. I had previously covered telecommunications and then airlines in our New York office, international trade and then the Federal Reserve in our Washington bureau, and then the auto industry of course in Detroit. But moving to Hong Kong posed new challenges, of which the biggest was how to start covering the fast-growing mainland Chinese economy.When I arrived a week before Mark\u2019s departure, it was still almost impossible to get a journalism visa to mainland China from Hong Kong. Business executives and tourists could cross the nearby river to the mainland, but journalists almost never could because the Chinese Communist Party was and remains extremely wary of critical reporting. Some reporters even resorted to flying to Bangkok to apply for visas, because the Chinese embassy there had a somewhat more generous reputation \u2014 but even the embassy in Bangkok was chary of granting journalism visas.Oddly enough, it had become easier to get a journalism visa to live and report in Beijing or Shanghai than to visit China for even a single day from Hong Kong. This was partly because Guangdong province of mainland China, next to Hong Kong, had become fed up with critical reporting from Hong Kong-based foreign correspondents who came briefly across the border, and had discouraged the further issuance of visas. Many news organizations began moving correspondents from Hong Kong to Beijing or Shanghai, and The New York Times itself was expanding its presence on the mainland, particularly in Beijing.The Chinese foreign ministry initially refused to talk to me about the broad subject of journalism visas, saying that its sole authorized interlocutor was the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club \u2014 a designation that the club did not know it had. I organized a campaign by the club for more visas, and tried to enlist top Hong Kong government and business leaders in the effort. Mark had very graciously introduced me to Hong Kong\u2019s top government officials, and I told them that if Hong Kong ceased to be the place to learn about China, I would likely be the last Times correspondent assigned to Hong Kong. The Times would then join a broad move by other publications in posting journalists only to the mainland. That would undermine Hong Kong\u2019s role as a place to get information about China and its role as a financial center \u2014 a prospect that dismayed Hong Kong political and business leaders alike.China\u2019s foreign ministry agreed in November, 2002, to issue more visas. I then joined the club\u2019s board and had myself named as the visa policy negotiator, a role I held until I left last year. The ministry started issuing visas allowing a single entry to China, then several years later with two entries, and then, shortly before the Beijing Olympics in 2008, with multiple entries for a month or even three months.I ended up with well over 100 visas over the years. Each visa was a thick piece of paper that filled a whole page of my passport, and was then canceled with a stamp on the opposite page. I was also traveling regularly to places like India for the Mumbai hotels attack in 2008 and to the Philippines for coverage of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. So my passport would become as thick as a paperback novel before I had to replace it.Halfway around the world, The New York Times was buying out The Washington Post\u2019s stake in the Paris-based International Herald Tribune in 2003. The following year, The Herald Tribune opened an Asia newsroom in the North Point neighborhood of Hong Kong. Initially a handful of editors, that operation has grown and grown in the years since then, mainly adding editors but also correspondents specializing in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and mainland China. The International Herald Tribune has been gradually integrated into The New York Times\u2019s operations over the years. The Hong Kong newsroom, now with a staff of several dozen, edits the printed edition of what has become the international edition of The New York Times, as well as editing our coverage from most of Asia for our website and for printed editions in the United States. Journalists in the Hong Kong newsroom also write about events across the region.When the opportunity arose last year for me to become Shanghai bureau chief, I took it. The Chinese foreign ministry had become far more cautious once again about issuing journalism visas in Hong Kong, partly because of the Umbrella Revolution protests in Hong Kong in 2014 and partly because of mainland China\u2019s steady shift toward greater caution in dealings with the West.We gave up the apartment on Bowen Road, as it was no longer needed. The venerable title of Hong Kong bureau chief disappeared, as it no longer made sense to have such a position. Philip Pan, our Asia editor, now oversees our Asia operations from the North Point newsroom.\u201cHong Kong is more important to the Times than ever, part of a global, 24-hour digital operation that also includes newsrooms in New York and London,\u201d Phil wrote in an email.The timing, as it turns out, may have been lucky: the faded apartment building where my predecessors and I had lived and worked for so many years is about to undergo an extensive rehabilitation for 18 months. Scaffolding has already appeared at its base, and the building\u2019s gurgling pipes, drafty windows and creaky elevators will all be replaced.Like Hong Kong: the building is being renewed and remade. Mainland Chinese have been moving to the city by the hundreds of thousands, buying up apartments and taking many high-paid jobs but also displacing many longtime residents, who find themselves struggling for employment and affordable housing.While working in the past two weeks on an article on the twentieth anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese rule, it was hard not to look occasionally up the hill with more than a little nostalgia at the aging building that for so many years housed our bureau.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Contest That Defines a Championship in Auto Racing", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuto racing has a number of blue-ribbon events \u2014 the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix, the Indianapolis 500 and the Bathurst 1000 in Australia among them \u2014 but no single race defines a championship quite like the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\u201cThere are quite a few 24-hour races around the world in different forms of motor sport, but Le Mans without doubt holds the most prestige, giving it true global recognition from fans, drivers and teams,\u201d said Anthony Davidson, a former winner who is driving this year for Porsche.The endurance race has been held each June since 1923 on the Circuit de la Sarthe, a mix of racetrack and closed public roads in France about 120 miles southwest of Paris.It offers a mixed selection of cars, competing within classes based on performance, but all running on the same course at the same time.The overall winner of each class is the car that completes the most laps in 24 hours of shared driving.\u201cFrom a driver\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a race that calls on a lot of different skill sets,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cManaging a blinding sunset/sunrise with an incredibly dirty windscreen,\u201d driving at night and competing on the same course with cars in other categories with different capabilities are among them, he said.\u201cFrom a team\u2019s point of view, the main challenge is reliability,\u201d he said. \u201cBuilding an intricate modern hybrid racing car to undergo 24 hours of hard racing without the slightest of glitches seems like an impossible task, but that\u2019s what is needed to take victory at Le Mans.\u201dThe race is run under the direction of the International Automobile Federation \u2014 which oversees the World Endurance Championship (or W.E.C.), of which Le Mans is part \u2014 and the Automobile Club de l\u2019Ouest, which has traditionally overseen Le Mans.This year, four classes are running: LMP1, LMP2, LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am. The LMP categories 1 and 2 are the Le Mans Prototype classes, cars with closed cockpits and sleek, aerodynamic bodywork.LMP1 attracts the bulk of manufacturer \u2014 and news media \u2014 attention, because the teams\u2019 designers are given maximum room to maneuver within the technical rule book.In recent years, both diesel and hybrid-powered cars have achieved success, with victory now dependent on energy recovery systems as well as outright horsepower.Manufacturers use LMP1 for high-speed research and development, and recent engine advances made at Le Mans can be directly linked to current road car technology (though this year brings no engine innovation from any LMP1 contender).Last year\u2019s LMP1 winner was the Porsche Team No. 2 car, a 919 Hybrid powered by a 2-liter 4-cylinder turbo engine and a battery hybrid system. Driven by Marc Lieb, Romain Duman and Neel Jani, the car returns this year, with Jani joined by the 2015 Le Mans winner Nick Tandy and the three-time Le Mans winner Andr\u00e9 Lotterer.\u201cA Porsche 919 at Le Mans is something everyone talks about,\u201d said Mark Webber, a former Porsche driver. \u201cIt\u2019s still something to behold. It\u2019s pivotal we find a way to keep these powerful cars. Imagery-wise, emotion-wise, it\u2019s important.\u201dAfter an early June test, Porsche acknowledged more work was needed on performance. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a mixed test,\u201d said Andreas Seidl, Porsche\u2019s LMP1 boss. \u201cAlthough we didn\u2019t achieve the mileage we wanted, we still learned important lessons for the race regarding tire choice and tire wear. Toyota\u2019s speed was impressive. We could not match that. In the coming days we will analyze today\u2019s data and draw our conclusions to improve our cars\u2019 performance.\u201dToyota enters the race as the favorite, with its No. 8 car \u2014 driven by S\u00e9bastien Buemi, Davidson and Kazuki Nakajima \u2014 having won the first two rounds of the World Endurance Championship, six-hour races in Silverstone, England, and Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium.While LMP2 cars share the spectacular looks of the LMP1 class, all the cars in the class have identical engines, which makes the LMP2 category cheaper and more appealing for private entrants.After Audi\u2019s withdrawal from Le Mans after the diesel emissions scandal, the 2017 race will have only six LMP1 entries: three from the Toyota factory team, two from Porsche and the semiprivate Nissan-supported ENSO CLM P1/01.Having dominated the 2016 Le Mans until the race\u2019s closing minutes, when its leading car suffered a mechanical failure at the beginning of the final lap, Toyota returns determined to win.\u201cIt\u2019s a Porsche versus Toyota fight, and Toyota has thrown everything at W.E.C. this year,\u201d said Sam Collins, deputy editor of Racecar Engineering magazine and commentator for Radio Le Mans.\u201cBut nobody cares about W.E.C. as a championship \u2014 it\u2019s about Le Mans,\u201d he said. \u201cThe championship exists to sustain Le Mans, and Toyota are there to win.\u201cIn LMP1, Toyota\u2019s running three cars for the first time in a very long time,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey\u2019re really going all-out to win it. There\u2019s a Japanese driver in each car, which means they really intend to win. Porsche aren\u2019t going so hard. They\u2019ve won it now twice in a row.\u201dWebber said: \u201cWe still don\u2019t really know who will win Le Mans. We have the competition between two brands, which is good, but hopefully more manufacturers come in the future.\u201dThe LMP2 class has a new rule book for 2017, with the regulations making for a new car. To reduce costs, all cars run identical engines, leaving less room for innovation in the category as a whole. The upside is more entrants, with 25 cars running in this year\u2019s LMP2 class, including private and factory-backed teams.LMP2 cars run a 4.2-liter V8 engine, the Gibson GK428. \u201cThose cars are far quicker than they were last year,\u201d Collins said. \u201cMuch faster in straight lines, much faster in the corners. The cars are now so fast that it might be difficult for some of the LMP1s to overtake them, and that\u2019s going to be key to the outcome of the race.\u201dTire wear and fuel economy play a part in every class during the 24-hour race. The less often a car has to enter the pits for fuel or fresh tires, the more laps it will be able to complete before the clock runs out. So tire manufacturers and racers seek tires that retain high levels of grip during the race, helping to keep the cars planted as they corner at high speeds. One element to keep an eye on in LMP2 is the contest between Michelin and Dunlop (all of this year\u2019s LMP1 entrants will be on Michelin tires).While the prototypes command the bulk of the attention at Le Mans, the field is largely composed of LMGTE cars running in the Pro and Am classes, grand tourers from Aston Martin, Corvette, Ferrari and others, with their distinctive looks.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing new in LMGTE for 2017,\u201d Collins said, adding that he anticipated a more open race this year after Ford\u2019s easy win last year. Over all, he said, Le Mans is having a quiet year, \u201cwhat you might call a year of transition.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018The Retreat of Western Liberalism,\u2019 How Democracy Is Defeating Itself", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesIn his insightful and harrowing new book, Edward Luce, a columnist for The Financial Times, issues a chilling warning: \u201cWestern liberal democracy is not yet dead,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut it is far closer to collapse than we may wish to believe. It is facing its gravest challenge since the Second World War. This time, however, we have conjured up the enemy from within. At home and abroad, America\u2019s best liberal traditions are under assault from its own president. We have put arsonists in charge of the fire brigade.\u201dLuce does not see Donald J. Trump or populist nationalists in Europe, like Marine Le Pen, as causes of today\u2019s crisis in democratic liberalism but rather as symptoms. Nor does he see President Trump\u2019s victory last November as \u201can accident delivered by the dying gasp of America\u2019s white majority \u2014 and abetted by Putin,\u201d after which regular political programming will soon resume.Instead, he argues in \u201cThe Retreat of Western Liberalism,\u201d Trump\u2019s election is a part of larger trends on the world stage, including the failure of two dozen democracies since the turn of the millennium (including three in Europe \u2014 Russia, Turkey and Hungary) and growing downward pressures on the West\u2019s middle classes (wrought by the snowballing forces of globalization and automation) that are fomenting nationalism and populist revolts. These developments, in turn, represent a repudiation of the na\u00efve hopes, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that liberal democracy was on an inevitable march across the planet, and they also pose a challenge to the West\u2019s Enlightenment faith in reason and linear progress.The strongest glue holding liberal democracies together, Luce argues, is economic growth, and when that growth stalls or falls, things tend to take a dark turn. With growing competition for jobs and resources, losers (those he calls the \u201cleft-behinds\u201d) seek scapegoats for their woes, and consensus becomes harder to reach as politics devolves into more and more of a zero-sum game.\u201cMany of the tools of modern life are increasingly priced beyond most people\u2019s reach,\u201d Luce writes. One study shows it now takes the median worker more than twice as many hours a month to pay rent in one of America\u2019s big cities as it did in 1950; and the costs of health care and a college degree have increased even more. There is rising income inequality in the West; America, which \u201chad traditionally shown the highest class mobility of any Western country,\u201d now has the lowest.\u201dAs nostalgia for a dimly recalled past replaces hope, the American dream of self-betterment and a brighter future for one\u2019s children recedes. Among the symptoms of this dynamic: a growing opioid epidemic and decline in life expectancy, increasing intolerance for other people\u2019s points of view, and brewing contempt for an out-of-touch governing elite (represented in 2016 by Hillary Clinton, of whom Luce writes: \u201cher tone-deafness towards the middle class was almost serene\u201d).Trump\u2019s economic agenda (as opposed to his campaign rhetoric), Luce predicts, will \u201cdeepen the economic conditions that gave rise to his candidacy,\u201d while the \u201cscorn he pours on democratic traditions at home\u201d endangers the promotion of liberal democracy abroad. America\u2019s efforts to export its ideals had already suffered two serious setbacks in the 21st century: George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003 and the calamities that followed; and the financial crisis of 2008, which, Luce writes, was not a global recession but an Atlantic one that raised serious concerns about the Western financial model.

{"Headline": "Small Businesses Cheer \u2018New Sheriff in Town\u2019 After Climate Pact Exit", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs news that President Trump was pulling out of the Paris climate accord hit at a luncheon for small-business owners in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday, an already happy crowd suddenly turned euphoric.\u201cIt was like a major win at a football game,\u201d said Rick Longenecker, a management consultant who had been among the 50 or so attendees who gathered to trade thoughts amid a rapidly improving local economy.While multinational corporations such as Disney, Goldman Sachs and IBM have opposed the president\u2019s decision to walk away from the international climate agreement, many small companies around the country were cheering him on, embracing the choice as a tough-minded business move that made good on Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to put America\u2019s commercial interests first.This full-throated support from the small-business community comes even as the Trump administration struggles to advance health care legislation and tax reform plans through Congress \u2014 and despite the swelling controversy over Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.In Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and beyond, many small businesses are reporting improved sales and bigger work forces \u2014 regardless of what is going on in Washington.\u201cThere is a new sheriff in town,\u201d said Louis M. Soltis, the owner of a company in Toledo that manufactures control panels for large factories. \u201cBut the biggest frustration that I have is that there is so much resistance that is keeping him from moving forward.\u201dIn the months following Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, as stock markets hit historical highs and companies kept adding jobs, the business community as a whole seemed willing to give the president a chance to follow through on his bold promises to revitalize the economy by cutting taxes and rolling back regulations.Many small-business leaders in the Midwest, on the other hand, were largely unfazed.For those more concerned with their local economies than global greenhouse gas emissions, walking away from the Paris agreement was just another example of a bottom-line business decision made by a president who knows a good deal from a bad one.\u201cThis just heightens the divide between big business and small business,\u201d said Jeffrey Korzenik, an investment strategist for Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati who spends much of his time talking to small businesses in the Midwest. \u201cThey really have different worldviews.\u201dAt the root of this disconnect is a sense that companies that employ up to a few hundred workers \u2014 such companies make up 99 percent of businesses in the United States and account for half of its private sector employment \u2014 are held to a more onerous standard than their larger peers when it comes to complying with regulations.At the Toledo luncheon, for example, much of the discussion centered on the fact that the climate treaty is nonbinding. To businessmen who have spent the past 10 years complaining of ceaseless rules and regulations, the very idea that the climate pact lacked teeth was galling.\u201cWhen companies here do business with a Ford or a G.M., they sign a contract that is not only binding \u2014 in many cases it is pretty harsh,\u201d Mr. Longenecker said. \u201cNow we have this deal to prevent a global catastrophe, and it\u2019s nonbinding? That is ridiculous. And it makes us think that there is a hidden agenda, that we are just transferring trillions of dollars to China.\u201dTo some small business executives, seeing the president talk tough to the Europeans and the Chinese was a reminder of why they voted for him in the first place.\u201cI think that we\u2019re making a very big deal over a molehill,\u201d said Dave Griggs, owner of Dave Griggs Flooring America in Columbia, Mo. which employs 16 people. \u201cI think the president is exactly right, we need to certainly renegotiate.\u201dBut local business leaders are not without their worries.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a Republican Congress, a Republican president; hopefully we can get some initiatives passed,\u201d Mr. Griggs said. \u201cI am highly optimistic.\u201dBut by and large, local business leaders said they remained supportive of the president and believed the attention on his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia was overblown.John Bagge, 64, who runs a catering company in Kirkland, Wash., with his wife and two daughters, said his business was booming \u2014 so much so that this was the first summer he has had to turn away customers in 40 years.The chief executives of big American companies were less sanguine, and many distanced themselves from Mr. Trump.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, both resigned from the president\u2019s economic advisory council on Thursday.\u201cClimate change is real,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter. \u201cLeaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\u201dOther big company executives \u2014 including the chief executives Douglas McMillon of Walmart and Virginia M. Rometty of IBM \u2014 voiced their opposition to the president\u2019s decision but said they would remain on the council.\u201cDisappointed in today\u2019s news about the Paris Agreement,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cWe think it\u2019s important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201dDespite remaining broadly supportive of the president, some businessmen said that the whirlwind of controversies was beginning to raise questions about just how effective this administration could be.Jim Stouffer, Jr. the president of Catawba Island Club, a local resort in Port Clinton, Ohio, said he supported the decision to leave the Paris agreement, but added that he was growing more uncertain of what the future holds.\u201cI don\u2019t know what his endgame is,\u201d he said.Rachel Abrams contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Waves of austerity measures to satisfy creditors have inflicted great suffering: More than a quarter of Greeks are unemployed, and vital services, like health care and transportation, are running as bare-bones operations. The economy is in recession, and there is virtually no way Greece can dig itself out of such a deep hole.On May 18, Greece\u2019s Parliament dutifully passed a fresh round of austerity measures, including tax increases and new cuts to pensions. Yet, Greece\u2019s creditors met in Brussels last week and shamefully failed to agree on terms that would permit the release of 7 billion euros in bailout funds needed by July to keep Greece from defaulting.Much of the blame goes to Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats party. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble opposes debt relief for Greece \u2014 as do many German voters, who will head to the polls in September.Some in Germany have come around to reality. \u201cGreece has always been promised debt relief when its reforms are implemented,\u201d Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a member of the Social Democrats, said on May 22. \u201cNow we must stand by that promise.\u201dFrance\u2019s new president, Emmanuel Macron, expressed his support for relief in a telephone call to the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, last week.Europe\u2019s finance ministers hope to have an agreement after they meet on June 15. The main sticking points are the terms under which the International Monetary Fund would rejoin the bailout effort and how far Germany will bend.A failure to do so would be catastrophic for Greece and an unconscionable stain on Germany, whose stubbornness is costing Greece the only durable solution to its woes: economic recovery.Advertisement"}

He toils at a standing desk, listening to classic rock as he pores over budget documents, plots out the administration\u2019s agenda for overhauling the tax code and health care system and plans for a fight over the debt ceiling.The biggest fight in Congress this summer will most likely be about raising the debt ceiling. The Trump administration recently warned that the limit on federal borrowing needs to be increased before members of Congress go home for August recess.While Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has called for a \u201cclean\u201d debt-ceiling increase, with nothing attached to the bill, Mr. Mulvaney would like to see it coupled with other reforms or spending cuts. He said the White House had not decided yet whether the bill must be clean, but he was certain that he would get the ceiling raised.\u201cIf the debt ceiling is not raised, you have some difficulties. There\u2019s no question,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said cautiously. \u201cThere is absolutely no way that the U.S. will ever default on its debt. We are not going to do that.\u201dThe Congressional Budget Office has offered some dire forecasts of the Republican health care plan, and in the interview Mr. Mulvaney accused the nonpartisan scorekeeper of being politically biased.\u201cThey\u2019re people and they bring their own personal perspectives on things,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said, arguing that people who evaluate the effects of legislation have too much influence in the legislative process.Mr. Mulvaney said the C.B.O.\u2019s methodology was \u201cmiserable\u201d when making forecasts for the Affordable Care Act. While he would not say the C.B.O. should be abolished, he did call for changes to the 1974 law that created the office.The bottom line on nearly every policy decision in the Trump administration is getting sustained 3 percent economic growth. According to Mr. Mulvaney, that is what exiting the Paris accord was all about.\u201cIf we were going to live up to the promises that the Obama administration put in those documents, and if we were going to allow other countries to live up to their lack of commitments in those documents, it would have hindered our ability to get back to a healthy American economy,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said.The White House has been accused of using overly optimistic economic growth projections in justifying a tax cut that will not increase the budget deficit. Mr. Mulvaney rejects the idea that demographic and technological shifts have made 3-percent growth a thing of the past. He argues that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, eliminating regulations and cutting taxes will unleash pent-up economic activity.Preaching fiscal restraint is not necessarily the best way to win a popularity contest in Washington. Where does it come from? Mr. Mulvaney, 49, attributes his concerns over wasteful spending to his upbringing. His grandparents lived through the Great Depression and his father was a small-business man who never took money for granted.\u201cWhen you grew up in a household where mom would keep the extra ketchup packets from McDonald\u2019s and keep them in a drawer just in case there came a day when you couldn\u2019t afford to buy ketchup anymore, that gets ingrained in you,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said.Cost-consciousness is not just a policy preference for Mr. Mulvaney, but also a personal trait. On Friday his spartan lunch consisted of a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, eaten quickly before his next meeting.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Peter Pan?\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said of his choice of sandwich spread.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Made in America: The Bad News and the Good Bad News", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byA couple of weeks ago, I was honored to be invited to present my thoughts on the state of manufacturing in America to the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, headed by Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.The thrust of my message was that, regrettably, we should be leery of proclamations of a renaissance of \u201cMade in America.\u201d Job growth in the industrial sector continues to be anemic and at least equally important, wage improvements have been marginal.Below are nine charts that I presented to illustrate the situation. I closed with a list of suggestions \u2014 no magic bullets \u2014 for how to maximize the performance of our manufacturing sector. For the charts whose takeaway is not self-evident, I\u2019ve provided some brief commentary.In my opinion, the crux of the problem is that we are competing in large part against countries \u2014 notably Mexico and China \u2014 that have gotten better at making things at a much lower labor cost. Even highly technical products \u2014 like airplanes \u2014 are beginning to be assembled in these countries.Automation (or robots) certainly played a role in the loss of manufacturing jobs before the financial crisis and may play a similar role in the future. But at the moment, robots are simply not the problem, as indicated by the low productivity numbers. If robots were the problem, our worker productivity would be growing faster, not slower, than it has in the past.The job loss \u2014 particularly in areas most susceptible to competition from countries with low-cost labor \u2014 has been remarkable.Here\u2019s a ray of hope and an example of what\u2019s needed. Since 2012, the number of job openings in manufacturing has exceeded the number of people hired. That indicates that companies are trying to hire (good news) but are having trouble finding workers with adequate skills (bad news \u2014 but an opportunity). Better training and education are among our best hopes.See what education can do for an individual\u2019s income \u2014 and what happens to those without college degrees. That said, I understand that four years of college is not for everyone. That\u2019s where better technical training (and yes, apprenticeships) can play an important, positive role.While I appreciate the importance of humanities and other nontechnical disciplines, we are in tough shape relative to other countries when it comes to math and science.As the chart below shows, the call for more spending on infrastructure has sound basis in the numbers. As a share of gross domestic product, investment in infrastructure is at its lowest since before World War II. What doesn\u2019t get as much attention \u2014 but should \u2014 is that spending on basic research, an important function of government, has also dropped to an historically low level. President Trump\u2019s budget proposes to cut this further.As I said at the outset, I have yet to sight a magic solution to our manufacturing challenges. Inevitably, manufacturing will continue to decline as a share of our economy, as it is doing in almost every other developed country. However, there are a number of specific policy actions that would make us more competitive and also ameliorate the harsh impact of the new competitive realities on our workers:\u25a0 Better education (particularly in science and math) and training.\u25a0 Tax reform, including sensible corporate tax policy and more progressive taxation.\u25a0 Fair (but free) trade.\u25a0 Higher federal investment spending on infrastructure and research and development.\u25a0 Regulatory reform to facilitate business without sacrificing labor, environmental and other standards.\u25a0 Increasing mobility to encourage workers to move to where the jobs are.\u25a0 A better social safety net for those left behind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Central Bank Moves to Wind Down Two Italian Banks", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Central Bank effectively euthanized two small Italian banks late Friday, in another sign that the eurozone financial system remains vulnerable even as the economy improves.They become the second and third banks to be declared effectively dead by the central bank, which acquired power to supervise eurozone banks at the end of 2014.Shareholders of the two Italian banks will lose their money, as will investors in so-called junior bonds that are intended to absorb losses first.But deposits in the bank will be protected, as will investors in so-called senior bonds.The banks will continue to operate and depositors will not suffer any inconvenience, officials said.All Italian banks are plagued by bad loans and slack demand for credit because of the country\u2019s stagnant economy. But Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza are the first Italian banks to be declared effectively dead by the European Central Bank and wound down.The central bank said Friday that it had been keeping a close eye on Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza since 2014, when it was clear that both were short of capital. After the condition of both banks continued to deteriorate, the central bank asked the lenders to explain how they would rebuild their capital buffers.\u201cBoth banks presented business plans which were deemed not to be credible by the E.C.B.,\u201d the central bank said Friday in a statement.By announcing the failure of the banks on a Friday evening, the European Central Bank gave financial markets the weekend to absorb the news, in hopes that the news would not cause turmoil. Financial markets reacted calmly to the collapse of Banco Popular earlier in June, a sign that the eurozone\u2019s system for troubled banks was working.In Italy, protecting small investors in troubled banks has been a sensitive political issue, with elections expected by next spring.

{"Headline": "Saudi Prince\u2019s Elevation Will Have Far-Reaching Consequences in Energy", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the new heir apparent to the throne of Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed bin Salman will play an even more influential role in world oil markets at a time when big crude-producing nations are struggling to prop up prices.With the kingdom\u2019s economy suffering from weakened oil markets, Saudi Arabia, with the prince\u2019s backing, has been a leading force behind the effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to bolster prices by limiting production. It is a complicated task with prices continuing to fall, as American shale oil producers and Libya add to the glut of supplies.Supporters say the 31-year-old prince will bring youthful energy and a fresh eye to the kingdom\u2019s most valuable export, using it to help modernize and diversify the economy. Detractors, however, charge that he is inexperienced and prone to meddling, undermining experienced officials and making sudden public pronouncements.\u201cThe problem is he is unpredictable, and it is not clear who he is relying on for advice,\u201d said Paul Stevens, a Middle East energy analyst at Chatham House, a research organization based in London.Here\u2019s how Prince Mohammed\u2019s rise may affect oil prices, global energy production and the sale of shares in Saudi Aramco:Oil prices are around $45 a barrel, continued their slide after the news of Prince Mohammed\u2019s promotion.That is down 20 percent since mid-April, and well off the levels in 2014 above $100 a barrel.The main reason for the decline in prices, though, is that OPEC\u2019s much-trumpeted production cuts seem to be having little impact on the persistent glut of oil for sale.The higher prices resulting from OPEC cuts have prompted increased production from shale oil producers in the United States and by other rivals, undercutting the cartel\u2019s actions.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Prince Mohammed appears to have gone back and forth on oil strategy.He initially declared that prices did not matter. But when they fell to uncomfortable levels early last year, he backed production cuts by OPEC and other producers, like Russia, as a way to prop up prices.The Saudis and OPEC may now be headed for another crunch, and there do not seem to be any good options.Analysts say the most likely path is for the Saudis to persist with, or even deepen, production cuts to bolster prices and improve the environment for the Saudi Aramco I.P.O.\u201cWe should be prepared for Saudi Arabia to do whatever it takes to keep the prices above\u201d $50 a barrel, FGE, an energy consultancy, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \u201cIf the I.P.O. is to go ahead, prices cannot go below\u201d $50 a barrel, it added.The question is how long the Saudis can stick with a policy of reduced production if it does not result in higher prices.In 2014, Saudi Arabia\u2019s former oil minister Ali al-Naimi concluded that there was little point in OPEC restraining production because any cuts would just be replaced by producers of shale oil.When prices fell below $30 a barrel early last year, Mr. Naimi and other officials began pursuing temporary production restraints to prop up prices.So far, those cuts are credited with bolstering prices and supporting the revenues of producer countries. But falling prices could push Prince Mohammed to once again consider whether output constraints serve Saudi interests.Prince Mohammed\u2019s elevation gives him added authority to push ahead with his pet project, overriding the objections of traditionalists who argue that only the state should own natural resources like oil.The Saudi Aramco offering is a big part of the prince\u2019s overall blueprint for overhauling the economy and reducing its dependence on oil, a plan known as Vision 2030.Oil prices, though, may play a major role in the success of his ambitious undertaking: Buoyant prices would help raise more money through the I.P.O., and help attract investment to Saudi Arabia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Steps Back, Jerry Brown Talks Climate Change in China", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut instead, Mr. Brown was in China on Tuesday, emerging as a de facto envoy from the United States on climate change at a time when President Trump has renounced efforts to battle global emissions. In a meeting packed with symbolism \u2014 and one that seemed at once to elevate the California governor and rebuke Mr. Trump \u2014 President Xi Jinping of China met with Mr. Brown, at the governor\u2019s request, at the very moment China prepares to take a more commanding role in fighting climate change.\u201cCalifornia\u2019s leading, China\u2019s leading,\u201d Mr. Brown said at a wide-ranging and at times feisty news conference after he met with Mr. Xi. \u201cIt\u2019s true I didn\u2019t come to Washington, I came to Beijing. Well, someday I\u2019m going to go to Washington, but not this week.\u201dMr. Brown has long used his platform as governor to advocate emission reduction policies, both in his state and globally. But the decision by Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, on the eve of Mr. Brown\u2019s trip here, gave an already planned visit new visibility.The son of a governor, Mr. Brown has been in public office \u2014 or running for public office \u2014 nearly every year since he was elected secretary of state in 1970. This is the second time he has served as governor. He ran for president three times. He has been mayor of Oakland, the chairman of the California Democratic Party and the state\u2019s attorney general.But the election of Mr. Trump, and his decision to pull out of the climate accord last week, suggests that Mr. Brown\u2019s likely final act in public life is going to be much different than he ever imagined. Instead of fighting, to name one example, for the high-speed rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco that has been his mission for more than five years \u2014 or guarding against what he sees as financial excesses by the state Legislature as it adopts its next budget \u2014 Mr. Brown, with 18 months left in office, has stepped into a void left by Mr. Trump.In so doing, he has moved way beyond the stage of Sacramento, embracing an issue that he has been identified with since he first ran for governor and in a state that is known for championing environmental causes.\u201cI\u2019m more energized and activated than ever,\u201d Mr. Brown said, as he finished the third day of his trip. \u201cAnd I think that we\u2019re actually making more progress.\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.Still, California\u2019s confrontations with the Trump administration on climate change are risky: The state has been wary that the Environmental Protection Agency may move to revoke a waiver permitting California to set fuel economy standards that exceed federal requirements. That waiver, which has been central to the state\u2019s success at reducing emissions, was issued when Richard M. Nixon was president. If it were revoked, the state would be forced to lower its strict fuel economy standards and it would be less able to influence national environmental policy.And Mr. Brown, as a state leader, cannot command the leverage of a global leader in any United Nations negotiations on the future of the Paris accord.\u201cYou can\u2019t stop a state from doing what they want to do in this area,\u201d said Thomas Pyle, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries who worked for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team and serves as president of the Institute for Energy Research, a pro fossil-fuel research organization. \u201cThey can flex their muscles but they can\u2019t represent the U.S.\u201dFor Mr. Xi, Mr. Brown\u2019s visit could not have been better timed \u2014 allowing him to act on declarations that China would now become a global leader on climate change.It is unusual for a Chinese president to meet with an American governor in such a formal setting in Beijing. Mr. Xi\u2019s session with Mr. Brown was covered extensively by the government-controlled news media. The state broadcaster featured it as the second story on the evening news, after a segment on China\u2019s ambitions in outer space, an indication of the meeting\u2019s importance to the ruling Communist Party.At such a volatile moment in Washington, the meeting allowed Mr. Xi to focus on the common ground China shares with some American politicians. China has historically maintained relationships with leaders of parties not in power as a practical matter, in the West and in places like Myanmar and Taiwan.Gary Locke, a former American ambassador to China and governor of Washington, said Chinese leaders were \u201cwell aware\u201d that Mr. Brown was considered a \u201cstrong leader\u201d on climate change and a critic of Mr. Trump.Analysts said that Mr. Xi might have also wanted to show Mr. Trump that China was willing to work around him by strengthening ties with allies like Europe, India and California. Mr. Brown\u2019s endorsement may also serve as a buffer against critics who say that China is moving too slowly to curb emissions.\u201cHe wants to retain the positive \u2014 if oversold \u2014 image China earned by stepping up to the plate alongside the United States,\u201d said Elizabeth C. Economy, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?Chinese accounts of the meeting did not mention the Paris accord or Mr. Trump. Mr. Brown said Mr. Xi never criticized the American president.Mr. Brown, who was attending an energy conference in Beijing, arrived just days before David H. Rank, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of the American Embassy in Beijing, resigned in protest of the president\u2019s decision on the Paris agreement. Rick Perry, the energy secretary, was here as well for the energy conference, though he apparently did not meet with Mr. Xi.Mr. Xi met with Mr. Brown in an ornate room in the Great Hall of the People where he often meets visiting foreign leaders. In their 45-minute conversation, Mr. Xi was joined by his top foreign policy officials as he discussed with Mr. Brown efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote alternative energy. As a gift, Mr. Brown gave Mr. Xi a first-edition copy of \u201cThe Mountains of California,\u201d a 1894 book by John Muir, a naturalist who wrote extensively about the splendors of the California wilderness.\u201cI would say that the California-China collaboration has taken a real leap forward,\u201d Mr. Brown said as he recounted the meeting for reporters.Mr. Brown has spent the past several days traveling around China to meet with officials about efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote green technologies. He signed agreements on clean energy technological development with officials in the southwestern province of Sichuan and the eastern province of Jiangsu.California operates a cap-and-trade market, allowing companies to buy and sell greenhouse gas emission allowances, making it more costly for companies to emit at high levels. China plans to start a national emissions trading plan by the end of the year.Mr. Brown and other Democratic leaders of California have made clear that they would push ahead on the state\u2019s leading-edge efforts to reduce all emissions no matter what happens in Washington.Mr. Brown, clearly relishing the attention he was drawing to the state, said the lesson California had learned as it imposed limits on emissions was that it did not interfere with economic growth or cause hardship.\u201cSacrifice is not a term that is that popular these days,\u201d he said. \u201cI think happy-time news is what people like from their politicians, even if the news can be a little more dire than that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have to put on a hair shirt and eat bean sprouts,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI think we can have quite a rich life, but we\u2019re going to have to get going and make the transition.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Coral Davenport from Washington.

It helps explain why Donald Trump won the presidency and why his administration is such a policy train wreck, why Democrats keep losing even though the country seems to be getting more liberal, and why populist surges are likely to be with us for a while \u2014 a trifecta of rather important explanations.The survey was conducted by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, with an accompanying report written by Lee Drutman, and it assesses voter sentiment along two axes: On the horizontal, economic issues, including welfare, entitlements, trade and inequality; on the vertical, moral/identity issues, from abortion and transgender rights to views of race, gender, immigration and Islam.Three things leap out. The first is the diversity of opinion within the Trump coalition about economics. Americans who voted Republican in 2016 tend to embrace some form of social conservatism, but on economic policy they lean only slightly to the right \u2014 spreading out across the economically liberal/socially conservative quadrant as well as the consistently conservative one. Indeed, the typical Republican voter\u2019s views on economics and the safety net are relatively close to the center of public opinion as a whole.This reflects both a longstanding trend and a Trump-driven shift. The Republican Party as an institution, or at least its congressional incarnation, has long been well to the right of its own voters on economics, very few of whom vote G.O.P. for strict libertarian reasons. But Trump, by breaking more starkly than past Republican insurgents with party orthodoxy on trade, entitlements and health care, was able to first exploit this tension in the primary campaign \u2014 rallying populist Republican voters against their own establishment \u2014 and then to win over populist-leaning independents who had previously voted for Barack Obama.But this victory, in turn, made the gap between Republican orthodoxy and the party\u2019s coalition that much wider \u2026 which could have been an opportunity for the Trump administration to successfully reconfigure the party\u2019s agenda, but instead, because he\u2019s Trump, has just led to political malpractice and general disarray.This is illustrated by the spectacle in the Senate, where Republicans are apparently seriously considering passing a health care reform by hiding its details from the public \u2014 details that would almost certainly be opposed by the coalition that put Trump in power. Whether they succeed or fail, that disconnect is a big part of why Trump\u2019s approval ratings are weak in a strong economy, and why his party\u2019s majority could very easily unravel.But for that to happen the Democrats would have to deal with their rather different sort of problem: Their coalition is too ideologically homogeneous, clustering together way down at the lower-left corner of our all-explaining chart, in a quadrant where everyone is consistently and comprehensively liberal.This uniformity helps explain one of the mysteries of American politics \u2014 given that the Republican economic agenda is unpopular and the country has swung left on social issues, why can\u2019t Democrats win more elections? The answer (one of them, at least) is that as the country has moved left, the Democratic Party\u2019s base has consolidated even farther left, and in the process the party has lost the ability to speak to persuadable voters who disagree with the liberal consensus on a few crucial issues.One of the key points in Drutman\u2019s essay is that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton supporters didn\u2019t differ very much on the actual issues. This is a good sign for a certain kind of Democratic unity, but it\u2019s indicative of the party\u2019s broader challenge: Whether the Sanders or the Clinton faction rules, the demands of its large, consistently liberal core won\u2019t allow much room for the experiments in outreach that a minority party needs.Finally: After looking at the smear of red across the top two quadrants and the fist of blue in the lower left, stare a while at the chart\u2019s lower right-hand quadrant, home of social liberals and fiscal conservatives. It\u2019s astonishingly empty: The ideological groups that occupy this space \u2014 consistent libertarians, globalist Democrats, socially liberal deficit hawks, pro-choice and pro-immigration supply-siders \u2014 are vanishingly rare within the American electorate.But they are not at all rare in the country\u2019s power centers, in New York and Washington and Silicon Valley, and in similar centers across the Western world. And therein lies a taproot of every recent form of populism.On both sides of the Atlantic, if you tried to build a consensus politics based around what voters actually want, it would be very moderately culturally conservative and very moderately economically liberal, and it would sit low in the upper left quadrant of our chart \u2014 the place where Trump won voters who had previously voted for Obama.But on both sides of the Atlantic, if you sought to place the elite consensus on the same chart, it be much closer to the emptiest of quadrants \u2014 the land of austerity and open borders, free trade and the permanent sexual revolution, the Simpson-Bowles plan and Emmanuel Macron.Given populism\u2019s derangements and divisions, this elite consensus can still win elections \u2014 witness Macron\u2019s recent triumphs. But it constantly invites backlash and disillusionment. So the task of statesmanship should be to reconcile the wisdom in the elite view (of which there is some, here and there) with the wisdom of the wider public.But we have fewer today, and neither a Democratic Party isolated in its own rigorist liberalism nor a Republican Party whose elite could neither resist Trump nor adapt to Trumpism seems ready to supply it.A better center for our divided polity does exist. Maybe someday one of our leaders will succeed in claiming it.Advertisement"}

He is retiring.Perhaps you have some questions.Q. Why are you retiring?Seriously?The Haggler\u2019s work here is done. His relentless intercessions have caused every company in the United States to radically rethink its approach to service. There is nothing left to complain about and thus no more work for the Haggler.No, seriously.The dull and windy boob whose byline you see in this space has taken a new assignment with The Times in London. The Haggler will not work there. Uh-uh. He can\u2019t abide funny accents or crumpets. So he is staying in the United States, specifically in the Humbly Furnished Home for Ex-Consumer Columnists, a gated community with an unpublished address and good broadband. He will be griping on his own behalf into his dotage.What have you learned about the state of customer service in this country?Asking the Haggler this question is like gauging the nation\u2019s mood at a suicide prevention hotline. Nearly everyone who writes to the Haggler is in distress, and this profoundly skews his sample. If all you ever read was the Haggler\u2019s inbox, you would think that the service economy was at war with Americans. That is plainly not the case.Worth noting: Consumer culture in some other countries is much worse. Try renting a car in Brazil. Try opening a bank account in England.

The typical Haggler complainant has a story with a wrinkle in it, a hitch that makes it unusual.But people working for Unwitting Incompetents have no power, and their supervisors are often hamstrung, too. Great companies know exceptions are inevitable.

Bombings, food shortages and power outages occurred on a regular basis.\u201cPeople didn't love the identity of the Peruvians,\u201d says the chef Palmiro Ocampo, 32, who grew up in Lima during those years, \u201cbecause \u2018Peruvian\u2019 was terrorism. It was terror.\u201dToday, Peru has risen from what many describe as \u201cchaos\u201d and, thanks to efforts of four generations of the country\u2019s chefs, reimagined itself through a thriving gastronomical culture.

The seafood is never frozen \u2014 the scallops are delivered live, and the cocoa nibs and passion fruit are also sourced locally, benefits of the country\u2019s being surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Andes and the Amazon.With dark hair tied back into a single thick braid, Eulert finishes her shift and takes a stroll around the area, pointing out one trendy eatery after another: a sushi joint catering to Limeno youth, a bakery specializing in American pastries, a five-floor butterfly-themed concept store topped by a roof-garden restaurant. Her last stop is for a cocktail at El Mercado cevicheria, where she once worked under her longtime mentor, the acclaimed chef Rafael Osterling.Osterling, 47, is part of the second generation, many of whom were classically trained at schools and restaurants in Europe and the U.S. before returning to open their own restaurants in Peru.\u2014\u2014Osterling, 47, is part of the second generation, many of whom were classically trained at schools and restaurants in Europe and the U.S. before returning to open their own restaurants in Peru.Osterling puts Peru\u2019s food movement in the context of the social and cultural revolution that followed the country\u2019s political and economic stabilization in the early 2000s.\u201cThe first generation were the first ones to honor Peruvian food,\u201d says Osterling.\u201cThey built the conditions and the dream and the purpose and the meaning of what we did later,\u201d says Gast\u00f3n Acurio, 49, a second-generation chef and TV personality who opened his flagship Astrid y Gast\u00f3n in 1994 and is considered a national hero in Peru. He goes down a list of revered first-generation chefs: Luis \u201cCucho\u201d La Rosa. Humberto Sato. Isabel Alvarez. Teresa Izquierdo. Bernardo Roca Rey. \u201cThey were pioneers fighting for our dreams in much more difficult times,\u201d he says.The early-generation chefs created \u201cNovoandina\u201d (or \u201cNew Andean\u201d) cuisine, which fused European cooking techniques with indigenous products like quinoa, Andean potatoes and peppers.

His Miraflores restaurant, Maido, serves the Japanese-influenced Peruvian cuisine known as \u201cnikkei\u201d and is among three Lima restaurants on the 2017 World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list. \u201cEverything was from Lima. Even if you brought it, nobody would buy it.\u201dAt the same time, Acurio says that once the internet began connecting the world and diversity became \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cbeautiful,\u201d he and his peers began to question the contradictions and lack of opportunities for Peruvians.\u2014VIRGILIO MART\u00cdNEZ, CHEF AT CENTRAL\u201cGast\u00f3n was very powerful in media so he could reach people,\u201d says Tsumura, who considers Acurio one of his closest friends. \u201cGast\u00f3n started to bring people, chefs, everybody who was involved in gastronomy together, and said, \u2018Let\u2019s investigate, let\u2019s analyze what Peru really is,\u2019 because we didn\u2019t know. He made Peruvians fall in love again with their country.\u201dToday, the Surquillo market welcomes visitors with an abundance of goods, from colorful piles of hot-pink spotted olluco potatoes and golden berries to multiple varieties of quinoa and chalky bags of coarse Maras salt sourced from Incan ponds in the Andean highlands.\u201cThe new Peruvian message of food is biodiversity and the unknown,\u201d says the third-generation chef Virgilio Mart\u00ednez, who helms renowned Central in Miraflores and serves a tasting menu featuring around 200 meticulously sourced local ingredients from 18 different altitudes. For the last several years, he and Central\u2019s research group, Mater Iniciativa, have foraged for native ingredients and studied indigenous food systems in the Andes and the Amazon. Mart\u00ednez has also invited young chefs from the fourth generation to join the expeditions. \u201cIf you cook with these ideas, this cuisine is way stronger than we think it is now \u2014 it\u2019s not pisco sours, ceviches and great tasty food anymore.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Preferred Candidate Wins Again, This Time in Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump views Prince Mohammed as a crucial ally in his effort to cement a Sunni Muslim alliance in the Persian Gulf. The prince, who also serves as the Saudi defense minister, favors a confrontational line toward Iran, which dovetails with the Trump administration\u2019s hostile stance toward Tehran. And he is spearheading Saudi Arabia\u2019s embargo of neighboring Qatar, which Mr. Trump has praised because he, like the Saudis, accuses the Qataris of financing extremist groups.The young prince is also a favorite of the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Mr. Kushner began cultivating Prince Mohammed soon after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. When the prince visited Washington in March, he dined with Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, at their home. When the couple joined Mr. Trump on his visit to Saudi Arabia last month, the prince hosted Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump for a dinner at his house.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain compatibility there,\u201d said Jon B. Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThe president and his entourage think fellow billionaires who have an itch to get things done make the world go \u2018round.\u201dMr. Kushner and Prince Mohammed, senior officials said, worked closely together to choreograph Mr. Trump\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia, which yielded a renewed commitment by dozens of Arab and Muslim leaders to combat extremism in their countries and to turn off the financial spigot to extremist groups.For Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, that trip ranks as a highlight of his foreign policy so far, and they credit the prince for what one senior official described as under-promising and over-delivering.Prince Mohammed\u2019s elevated status was apparent in the earliest days of the Trump administration. Senior American officials said they wanted the United States to help Saudi Arabia with its campaign in Yemen against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, in part because the success or failure of the military campaign could affect the prince\u2019s fortunes in the kingdom\u2019s succession battle.During the prince\u2019s first visit to the White House, in March, the president welcomed him with a meeting in the Oval Office and a formal lunch in the State Dining Room. The next day, Prince Mohammed spent four hours with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis at the Pentagon.Mr. Kushner also hopes for Prince Mohammed\u2019s backing, or at least his blessing, in a peace initiative between Israel and the Palestinians. On Wednesday, Mr. Kushner made his first major foray into the process, meeting in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and in the West Bank with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority.\u201cThe United States officials and Israeli leadership underscored that forging peace will take time,\u201d White House officials said in a statement. But administration officials said the process would be helped if major Arab countries, notably Saudi Arabia, signed on to the concept of an agreement.Middle East experts said that Prince Mohammed believes Saudi Arabia should have a normal relationship with Israel in the future. But several expressed doubt that the prince would want the Saudis to be an important component of an Israeli-Palestinian negotiation.While the Trump administration clearly views Prince Mohammed as a reformer \u2014 pointing to Vision 2030, his blueprint to modernize Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy and society \u2014 others warned that the White House could be in for a disappointment. \u201cThere are other people who are more circumspect,\u201d Mr. Alterman said. \u201cThey wonder if he has the right temperament. They wonder if he has the right political skills.\u201dThat ambivalence ran through the Obama administration, which was caught off guard by the rapid rise of King Salman\u2019s favorite son. Prince Mohammed, unlike other prominent royals, was not educated in the West and had not had a track record of government service, and he was nearly unknown in Washington when he ascended to the position of deputy crown prince in 2015.He also assumed the title of defense minister and almost immediately became the public face of the kingdom\u2019s hastily launched military campaign against the Houthis in Yemen. The chaotic early months of the campaign gave him a reputation in some parts of the Obama administration as reckless and hotheaded.There was also the problem of finding someone in Washington to develop a relationship with the young prince. Prince Mohammed\u2019s natural counterpart on the American side, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, had little inclination to spend time nurturing ties to the prince.Secretary of State John Kerry assumed that mantle, inviting Prince Mohammed to his Georgetown home for an iftar dinner and meeting with the prince in May 2016 on the Serene, a luxury yacht that the prince bought from a Russian billionaire.Still, there were issues that could never be bridged. A particular point of friction was the Obama administration\u2019s attempts at rapprochement with Iran.At a meeting in Turkey in November 2015 between President Barack Obama and King Salman, the prince leapt into what American officials said was a lecture on what he saw as the administration\u2019s failures in the Middle East.There are no such differences with the Trump administration, however. Saudi officials have lavished praise on Mr. Trump for his bombing of Syria and his hawkish stance toward Iran.Prince Mohammed bin Nayef had close ties to national security officials in the Obama administration. But the political change in the United States this year brought a reversal of fortune for Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who lost many of his contacts.The March visit to the White House by Prince Mohammed bin Salman so angered Prince Mohammed bin Nayef that he made his annoyance known to the American government using unofficial channels.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finally, Something Isn\u2019t the Matter With Kansas", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe most momentous political news of the past week? For my money, it wasn\u2019t James Comey\u2019s Senate testimony, riveting as it was. It was the Kansas Legislature\u2019s decision to defy the governor and raise income taxes \u2014 a move that could well be the first step in a transformation of American politics much more far-reaching than anything that could come from Russiagate.Hear me out. Kansas, under Gov. Sam Brownback, has come as close as we\u2019ve ever gotten in the United States to conducting a perfect experiment in supply-side economics. The conservative governor, working with a conservative State Legislature, in the home state of the conservative Koch brothers, took office in 2011 vowing sharp cuts in taxes and state spending, except for education \u2014 and promising that those policies would unleash boundless growth.Finally, even the Republican Kansas Legislature faced reality. Earlier this year it passed tax increases, which the governor vetoed. Last Tuesday, the legislators overrode the veto.Not only is it a tax increase \u2014 it\u2019s even a progressive tax increase! A married couple filing jointly and earning $30,000 will pay an additional $120, which is 0.4 percent of total income, while the same couple earning $100,000 will fork over $755, or 0.755 percent. More than half of the Republicans in both houses voted for the increases.There\u2019s the background. Now, why is this a big deal?Because Republicans are not supposed to raise taxes, ever. In Washington or in the states. This goes back to President George H. W. Bush\u2019s agreeing to a bipartisan tax increase in 1990 after famously saying in his 1988 campaign, \u201cRead my lips: no new taxes.\u201d Afterward, the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, led by Grover Norquist, started making Republican candidates for Congress and state houses sign a no-tax pledge.The Republican no-tax position even bears a share of the blame for our current polarization. Republicans once recognized the principle that public purposes sometimes justified the raising of additional revenue. They might have balked at the specific number the Democrats proposed, but they accepted that taxes were negotiable.This made compromise possible. The agreement between President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill in 1983 to save Social Security? It\u2019s a famous deal, among insiders, who point to it often as they lament the lost art of the horse trade. It involved benefits cuts \u2014 an increase in future retirement ages \u2014 and increases in the payroll tax.Why can\u2019t they make those kinds of deals today, you ask, for any number of issues? It\u2019s not because there\u2019s something in the water. It\u2019s not because of cable news, or social media or even the corrupting influence of big money in politics. It\u2019s because Republicans won\u2019t agree to a penny in tax increases of any kind \u2014 income taxes, payroll taxes, the gasoline tax, anything.So here\u2019s hoping that Kansas represents a breakthrough moment. The effects of our failure to invest in ourselves are all around us. Change won\u2019t come fast \u2014 for one thing, very few Americans know the above, because no one talks about it (hello, Democrats). But at least for now we can say, for the first time in a long time, that something finally isn\u2019t the matter with Kansas.Michael Tomasky is a columnist for The Daily Beast, the editor of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas and the author, most recently, of \u201cBill Clinton.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Of the 10 tests of the system since 2004, when the Bush administration prematurely declared it operational, six have failed to destroy the target, including three of the last five tries.More revealing than the test record are the actual tests themselves. Each is highly scripted to maximize success. The timing and other details are provided in advance, information that no real enemy would provide. The weather and time of day are just right for an intercept. An adversary would use complex countermeasures, such as decoys, alongside the real missile to try to fool the defense system, but only simplistic versions of this trick have been included. Under realistic testing conditions, the program\u2019s success rate would almost certainly be lower.As a member of Congress, I held leadership positions on the subcommittee that oversaw the missile defense program. During hearings, Pentagon officials repeatedly overstated confidence in the program, understated technical limitations and dismissed concerns from physicists and other experts.This false sense of security persists today. Multiple senior military officials have recently suggested that a North Korean missile could be shot down with our existing capabilities. One prominent example came from Gen. Lori J. Robinson, the head of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, who told a Senate committee that she is \u201cextremely confident of our capability to defend the United States of America and be able to intercept an ICBM should it reach our homeland.\u201d But with so many test failures in highly scripted environments, how could anyone be confident?Outside of government, both the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and the Union of Concerned Scientists have criticized the program and suggested major changes, with the academies calling for a redesigned set of interceptors and sensors, and the union calling for the system to be subject to the demanding oversight that virtually all other Pentagon programs already face.If lawmakers are serious about defending the homeland from rogue states like North Korea, they should prioritize diplomatic action. Even if the system was 100 percent effective (a herculean prospect) and North Korea was intent on striking the United States preemptively (a dubious assessment), Pyongyang could overwhelm our system by building more missiles than we have interceptors, a more cost-effective and simpler task. The offense has the advantage in this type of arms race, a reality that some lawmakers seem to ignore.There is an adage in defense acquisition: Fly before you buy. In other words, validate the system\u2019s usefulness before purchasing and deploying it. For nearly 15 years, the Pentagon has ignored this rule with regard to homeland missile defense. Congress can fix past mistakes by fully exercising its oversight authority and demanding a more prudent approach. Expanding the program before it is proved to be effective under realistic conditions would mark the height of irresponsibility.The Missile Defense Agency might be celebrating now, but the latest test is at best a small step forward on a very long journey.John F.

{"Headline": "Fear of an End to Easy Money Prompts Sell-Off", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFears that central banks would unwind years of easy money policies rattled global markets on Thursday, prompting a sharp sell-off in European stocks and technology companies in the United States.Since the financial crisis, central banks in the United States, Europe and Japan have injected trillions of dollars into their economies in a bid to jump-start sluggish growth and halt broader deflationary trends.Now, with markets on a perpetual sugar high from so much stimulus, central bankers have become more forthright in signaling interest rate increases, or in paring bond-buying programs that have flooded the markets with cash.The initial tremors were felt in European government bonds after a cautionary speech on Tuesday by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. By Thursday, the selling had spread from the bond market to global stocks.After European stocks slumped, the sell-off extended to United States trading, particularly in technology stocks, whose rich valuations have been questioned. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 1.44 percent on Thursday.The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note, which was at 2.12 percent on Monday, had risen to 2.27 percent on Thursday. (Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.)A sign of the state of investors\u2019 nerves was an intraday spike in the index known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the VIX, which jumped 51 percent, before ending the day up 14 percent.But in calling for prudence in policy, Mr. Draghi \u2014 who, more than any other central banker, is known for his judicious choice of words \u2014 sparked an immediate sell-off in European government bonds as investors interpreted his use of the word \u201cprudence\u201d as a stepping away from the bank\u2019s commitment to keep buying European government bonds.Taken aback by the rout, central bank officials quickly said that the speech should not be seen as a statement by Mr. Draghi that he would tighten policy immediately, but investors paid them little heed.\u201cCentral bankers are saying that economies are doing well enough and conditions are loose enough that we do not need to press the pedal to the metal anymore,\u201d said Michel Del Buono, global strategist for Makena, an investment firm that caters to foundations and endowments. \u201cBut many investors are still thinking that they will be doing the maximum forever.\u201dIt is not just the European Central Bank that has, fairly abruptly, signaled a change in direction.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, another central banker known for dovish sympathies, said in a speech on Tuesday that an increase in rates might be in order just a month after he indicated that interest rates would remain low.The pound and the yield on the British 10-year note surged afterward.The swift sell-off in European stocks and bonds recalled the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when the Federal Reserve first said it would begin to taper its policy of buying mortgages and other securities in an attempt to stimulate the economy.Even though an actual rate increase was years away, stocks and bonds in emerging markets, long dependent on interest-rate sensitive capital flows, fell sharply in what would become a three-year bear market for the asset class.That Mr. Draghi and Mr. Carney moved so quickly to signal this new approach has prompted analysts to speculate that there may be some form of coordination among central bankers to warn investors who have benefited from the liquidity boom.Stock markets in the United States have hit highs and, for quite awhile, the interest rates on trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of European government bonds dipped into negative territory as global investors piled into these securities, confident that the central bank would continue to buy.In the last few weeks, some officials from the Federal Reserve have warned about overheated financial markets.On Tuesday, for example, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, described stock market valuations as being \u201csomewhat rich.\u201d Her language did not carry the punch of \u201cirrational exuberance,\u201d Alan Greenspan\u2019s phrase to refer to a runaway stock market in the late 1990s.Nevertheless it did send a clear signal to many investors that the Fed, even though it has no official mandate to guide or influence financial markets, is watching for potential bubbles. And that, perhaps, it will consider overvalued stock and bond markets when weighing its next rate increase.So in that sense, some analysts say, central bankers\u2019 recent turn to a more conservative approach should not be seen as a surprise.Of the Dow Jones industrial average\u2019s 30 members, only Goldman Sachs (up 0.9 percent) and JPMorgan Chase (up 1.48 percent) were positive for the day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Regulators Are Needed to Handle Failed Banks", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewOne of the major reforms to avoid the recurrence of the severity of the financial crisis was a set of mechanisms by which the regulators could wind down failed banks or restructure them if they were still viable.The House of Representatives is set to vote to repeal this measure and replace it with a bankruptcy that only the bankers themselves could decide to enter. These are dangerous actions that can risk turning a tumultuous bank failure into a deep and full financial crisis, like that of the 2008-9 financial panic. Bankruptcy alone cannot handle a financial crisis emanating from collapsed banks.Adding a robust bankruptcy channel makes much sense. But repealing the regulatory-led system and replacing it with bankruptcy is unwise. Replacing it with the narrow, limited bankruptcy structure moving forward in the House is exceedingly unwise.First off, the House bankruptcy-for-banks bill bars the regulators from initiating the bankruptcy; only bank management can. But bank executives have reason to \u201cgamble for resurrection,\u201d putting off a day of reckoning when they will be out of a job and disgraced, in hopes that the economy or the bank will recover first. That delay could be fatal in a crisis.If the megabank continues to sink, it could take down the economy with it. Lehman Brothers waited too long to file for bankruptcy in 2008 and ran out of cash. Its resulting disorderly bankruptcy seriously damaged the economy.The House bill\u2019s supporters trust the judgment of the failed bank executives over that of the United States to keep the economy steady. They seek to avoid a bailout but put considerable power into the hands of those it fears would be bailed out.Worse, in a broad financial crisis with many megabanks tottering, the government\u2019s response needs to be coordinated and coherent. Bankruptcy judges cannot caucus and come up with a common policy. They cannot provide liquidity to the stumbling bank and neither can other megabanks because they would all be hoarding liquidity in a crisis. Only the government can, and the only formal channel for it to do so is embedded in the regulatory-led restructuring mechanism.For megabanks with global operations, American regulators need to coordinate actions with regulators abroad. Even if the bankruptcy courts can quickly restructure a United States bank\u2019s failed American operations, creditors on the bank\u2019s London subsidiaries might still run, taking down the United States operations no matter what the bankruptcy judge does. Bankruptcy judges cannot coordinate a systemwide response and to develop international understandings. That response needs staff and financial experience, which the regulators have.The House bill aims to restructure the bank over a 48-hour weekend, by closing it on Friday evening, turning the bank complex\u2019s nondeposit debt into stock during the weekend, then reopening the bank on Monday in a stable way without a government bailout. This is the best outcome if it works; but it\u2019s at risk of failing when it\u2019s needed. To succeed, the bankrupt bank complex needs to have enough of the right kind of debt in place \u2014 debt that can be eliminated over a weekend to stabilize the bank by Monday morning.Bankruptcy judges cannot assure in advance that enough of that kind of debt is in place. The regulators can, but the House banking committee\u2019s substitution proposal would sharply cut back the regulators\u2019 official means of doing so.Such a 48-hour high-wire giant bankruptcy has never been tried, much less succeeded. But the House bill doesn\u2019t steady the situation with a backup if the bank cannot be stabilized enough to reopen on Monday morning. There is no safety net and a chaotic free-for-all would ensue, like that of the Lehman bankruptcy\u2019s initial days, with financial markets worldwide in disarray, sharply worsening the nascent recession. The economy needs a regulator backup. But the House bill does away with that one we have.There are too many unknowns about bankruptcy for banks, and they will not be resolved until there is crisis. Bankruptcy judges, for example, lack the full judicial power of the United States, so a hedge fund creditor of the bank complex about to be knocked out, who wants to be bought off or bailed out, would challenge the bankruptcy court\u2019s authority.The Monday morning headline \u2014 \u201cMegabank Restructured, but Judge\u2019s Constitutional Authority Challenged. Supreme Court to Decide Next Week.\u201d would induce creditors who can cash out to do so on Monday morning, not wait a week. They will run and bring the bank down.Financial stability in a crisis is critical enough to have two viable institutional channels for resolution. Let\u2019s add a robust bankruptcy channel. While we shouldn\u2019t expect a bankruptcy bank restructuring to become as routine as bankruptcy has become for airlines, we can get closer to that limit than we are now. But the House bill, by tying a narrow new bankruptcy channel to repealing the current regulatory one, is taking grave risks that the country may pay for if we are threatened by another financial crisis.

{"Headline": "How Europe Can Fight for Its Own Future", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIt is true that European countries do need to focus more attention on defense. For too long in Europe, we have relied on the United States for our collective security. The growing threat of an expansionist Russia, combined with President Trump\u2019s reluctance to recognize this threat and Britain\u2019s increasing retreat to isolationism, shows that Europe needs to take more responsibility for its own security.As Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, put it: \u201cThe times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over.\u201d Speaking after last week\u2019s NATO and Group of 7 meetings, she said, \u201cWe have to fight for our own future ourselves, for our destiny as Europeans.\u201dFor me, though, the real debate to be had in the coming years is not whether the 2 percent target is met by the 27 European Union countries. It is rather the fact that Europe\u2019s defense forces are riddled with inefficiencies and duplication, which have undermined the union\u2019s capabilities.Rather than obsess about a 2 percent target at all costs, European Union countries should work together to develop an effective European Defense Union. If it spent strategically, within one defense framework and one defense market, the union could theoretically afford, within the current budgetary limits and respecting the NATO commitment of spending at 2 percent of G.D.P., to sustain one of the world\u2019s most modern and powerful military forces.So far, despite some progress, it has proved extremely difficult for member states to pool their military resources and reduce the needless duplication of military capabilities. The European Defense Agency, set up precisely to share resources, has had an uphill struggle to achieve its goal.There has been some success in the integration of battle divisions within Europe. Czech units are becoming increasingly integrated with German forces, as are the Dutch, each playing to their strengths. The Eurocorps, a permanent multinational rapid-reaction force involving troops from nine member states and established for both NATO and European Union purposes, was declared operational in 1995. This model of integration could be the nucleus from which fully integrated military forces under the aegis of the European Defense Union could grow.Such a union could also enable member states to develop a credible joint defense target, which would be based on contributions to the union\u2019s operational capability, rather than an arbitrary goal for national spending.For the first time, the European Commission is preparing a budget for military spending to fund joint defense research projects, an aim I firmly welcome. Again, this could facilitate the purchase of common assets and create the economies of scale necessary to enable the European Union to build a strong, united modern military, instead of 27 parallel structures. The European Defense Fund should therefore be a start toward the more effective acquisition of joint assets and capabilities.A European Defense Union could also work to complete Europe\u2019s defense market, to ensure the strategic autonomy of the European defense industry and strengthen its global competitiveness. This would create a sustainable and integrated European defense technology and industrial base.The open and liberal character of our societies can be preserved only if our internal resilience is strengthened. That also includes reinforcing our capability to deter attacks against our territory and our ability to project power and stabilize our regional neighborhood. No European Union member state can face these tasks alone, which is why the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, should seize the initiative and present proposals for the wide-ranging European Defense Union I have outlined.The European Union should not undermine or seek to create structures parallel to NATO. The treaty organization must remain a bedrock of our common security, but a robust European pillar under NATO would ensure that we spend our limited resources efficiently, increase the union\u2019s ability to act and better guarantee the security of our citizens.Europeans have dithered about common defense for more than half a century. The election of Emmanuel Macron to the presidency in France, together with President Trump\u2019s unclear commitment to his NATO allies, provide the opportunity for us to have an honest political debate about European security and how best to realize the NATO target we\u2019ve agreed to.Guy Verhofstadt, the prime minister of Belgium from 1999 to 2008, is the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in the European Parliament and the author of \u201cEurope\u2019s Last Chance: Why the European States Must Form a More Perfect Union.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret to My Success? Antidepressants", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorA few months ago, I gave a reading at a local bookstore. A small but enthusiastic crowd attended, and I confessed to the audience filled with emerging writers that I had, in my 20s and early 30s, stopped writing for eight years, and that I had accepted I\u2019d never write again. Then someone asked, \u201cHow did you return to writing?\u201dI decided to tell the truth: Zoloft.As my obsessions accumulated, the dread throbbed more insistently, and my rituals became more complex. I counted in fives all day at school, my teeth clicking in time so much my teacher grew annoyed by the sound, and when the last school bell rang, my jaw was sore. My nightly prayers became a chant I had to recite 20, then 50 and, later, 100 times.Now that I am a mother, it astounds me that I was able to hide my rituals from my family \u2014 but I felt I had no choice. As the daughter of an Italian immigrant who survived unimaginable horrors \u2014 poverty, plague, war, domestic violence, the death of his baby sister because of a lack of basic health care \u2014 I heard one word over and over again. \u201cForte.\u201d Strength.Books were my only haven \u2014 the ultimate distraction from my obsessive fears, a release from the exhausting work of protecting myself from unseen doom. I read until my vision blurred. Until the librarian in our small town library had nothing else to suggest. I read under my bedcovers with a flashlight until the morning warbling of the forest birds sounded.When I began writing short stories in college, the escape proved even fuller. Still, by my senior year, my illness had worsened. My panic attacks grew so intense I fainted several times. I suffered weekly migraines \u2014 the pain a bittersweet break from worrying \u2014 but I refused help.Many of my favorite authors had suffered from anxiety or depression \u2014 Dostoyevsky, Fitzgerald, Plath, Woolf and Emily Dickinson, with whom I felt a special migraine-sufferer kinship. I sought out biographies of these tortured artists and underlined the details of their suffering until the pages were covered in multicolored highlighter. Surely, I told myself, their anguish was linked to their greatness. Instead of fleeing anxiety and depression (although many did douse their emotional instability with alcohol), they dived in and used their misery as inspiration for their creative work. I was convinced that killing the mad part of me with medication would also kill that which made me unique. I memorized a line by Proust: \u201cHappiness is beneficial for the body, but it is grief that develops the powers of the mind.\u201dAt 22, I saw a psychiatrist. He said I had obsessive-compulsive disorder and gave me a prescription for an antidepressant called Serzone. Perhaps it was the O.C.D. diagnosis that helped me take that slip of paper from the doctor\u2019s hand. After so many years of vague fear, imagining that there was an inscrutable sickness growing in me, I now had a concrete way to describe my suffering.The meds stopped the panic attacks. The noise in my head, the worries I imagined as an infinite loop of snakes, one biting the tail of the snake in front, quieted some. When I walked down the street on a sunny afternoon, I heard children laughing, wine glasses clinking on a neighbor\u2019s porch, piano music wafting from a curtained window. I heard life.For the next 13 years, I went on and off a variety of antidepressants, antipsychotics, even one anti-seizure medication. As soon as the obsessive fears vanished, I\u2019d wean off a medication, tired of side effects that ranged from weight gain to insomnia to hives. But each time I went off a medication, I returned to a state so unstable I couldn\u2019t recognize the irrationality of my thoughts. After I graduated from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop at 25, my first novel failed to sell and as my new husband and I struggled to find jobs and make rent in a post-9/11 economy, I entered a seven-year-long episode of severe anxiety and depression.Really I was trapped in a cycle of anxiety. How could I succeed at the marathonlike task of writing a novel when I couldn\u2019t leave my apartment most days, certain a catastrophe would befall me and my small children? High on my list was a fear of illness \u2014 flu, cancer, meningitis, flesh-eating disease. You name it, I worried over it. I am still, years later, ashamed to admit that, each night, I stopped my husband at our apartment\u2019s threshold, made him take off the clothes he\u2019d worn on his subway commute and disinfect his hands before he walked through the door.It was my newborn daughter\u2019s pediatrician who gave me my first prescription for Zoloft a few days after her birth. I have swallowed my pills faithfully since that day, partly because I have finally found a medication that helped me without side effects, but more important, because I have become a stronger person, mother, partner and writer.One specific pill is not a cure for everyone, and most people will live healthy lives without medication, but Zoloft was, and still is, my brain chemistry miracle. I haven\u2019t had a panic attack in seven years. I had the focus necessary to return to writing and I wrote my first published novel, \u201cCutting Teeth.\u201d I also possessed a new resilience that helped me cope with the long process of seeking publication \u2014 with its highs and lows, its triumphs and many rejections.There are many who claim that antidepressants stifle creativity. Years ago, at the height of my instability, my husband and I saw \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d and I thought, if John Nash can cure himself of his schizophrenia by sheer willpower, I should be able to stop obsessing. It was this cruel expectation of myself that filled my 20s and 30s with self-loathing. I try not to think of all the moments of joy I lost during that time, or the thousands of words I could not write, all because of my fear that medication would kill my creative muse.I told a shortened version of this story to the audience in the bookstore. When I finished, a poet in the front row with a cascade of red curls raised her hand. She, too, had been unable to write for years before seeking treatment for anxiety. Others chimed in, a few sharing stories about how therapy, medication or a combination of the two had helped them find confidence in their creative work. Others thanked us for our honesty.I once feared that, if I changed, the world would end. But I have stepped into a better world that continues to astonish me, that has my (still obsessive) mind seeking not just danger around every corner but also wonder.Standing in that bookstore, sharing my true self with the small audience, I can almost see the pages of the books I will someday write. I\u2019m ready and I have some catching up to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Actions Show Confidence but Are Not at Trump Speed", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As one of the longest economic expansions in American history chugs into its ninth year, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday it was raising its benchmark interest rate to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.The Fed accompanied the widely expected rate increase with a further show of confidence: a description of its plans to start reducing its portfolio of more than $4 trillion in bonds later this year. The Fed intends both measures to raise borrowing costs for businesses and consumers after almost a decade of historically low interest rates.\u201cOur decision reflects the progress the economy has made and is expected to make,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, told reporters after the announcement.Ms. Yellen may soon lose her role as the conductor of the Fed\u2019s slow, steady and successful retreat. The Trump administration is beginning to consider whether Ms. Yellen should be replaced when her term as chairwoman ends in early February. Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, is heading the search for a new leader.Ms. Yellen said Wednesday that she had not had any conversations with the administration about its plans. She declined to comment on her interest in a second term.If Ms. Yellen is replaced, she would become the first Fed leader in 40 years to serve only a single term. The last three leaders \u2014 Ben S. Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Paul A. Volcker \u2014 were renominated by a president of a different party.The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third consecutive quarter.The Fed has increased its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point over the last two years, after leaving the rate close to zero from late 2008 to late 2015.Ms. Yellen and her colleagues have concluded that the economy is growing about as fast as it can. Low rates encourage borrowing and risk-taking; the Fed is now trying to raise rates to a level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity. Most Fed officials expect that the Fed will raise rates at least one more time this year.So far, however, financial markets are not cooperating. Interest rates on auto loans have increased a little since the Fed started raising rates in 2015, but rates on mortgage loans are about the same. Rates on some corporate loans have even declined. Measures of financial conditions have loosened.The Fed added that economic growth \u201chas been rising moderately so far this year,\u201d making no mention of weakness during the winter.The Fed in recent years has been consistent in predicting faster inflation \u2014 and in being wrong. The Fed conceded it was overly optimistic in predicting stronger inflation this year. In economic forecasts published Wednesday, Fed officials predicted that prices would rise by just 1.6 percent this year, down from a forecast of 1.9 percent in March.Ms. Yellen also noted a sharp decline in the price of cellphone service is weighing on inflation. That is a good thing for consumers, and a one-time event.\u201cWe continue to feel that with a strong labor market and a labor market that\u2019s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up,\u201d she said.The Fed affirmed Wednesday that it planned later this year to start reducing its portfolio of more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.The Fed said it would initially shed $10 billion a month for three months, divided 60-40 between Treasuries and mortgage bonds. It will then raise the pace by $10 billion every three months, maintaining the same division, until reaching $50 billion a month.Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, was the only member of the Federal Open Market Committee to vote against the rate increase at Wednesday\u2019s meeting. He has argued that economic conditions remain too weak.Both men have criticized the Fed for its efforts to stimulate growth in the aftermath of the financial crisis.At times, however, Mr. Trump also has praised Ms. Yellen\u2019s efforts. When Mr. Trump first met Ms. Yellen, at the White House earlier this year, he told her they were both low-interest-rate people.Asked about the conversation on Wednesday, Ms. Yellen smiled. \u201cI have felt that it\u2019s been appropriate for interest rates to remain low for a very long time,\u201d she said.The sharper differences regard regulatory policy. Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to relax financial regulations, and the Treasury Department earlier this week released a description of its plans for doing so, which it says will increase economic growth.Ms. Yellen, by contrast, played a key role in strengthening financial regulation after the 2008 crisis, and she remains a staunch defender of the benefits of those changes.\u201cI don\u2019t think our regulations have played an important role, at least broadly speaking, in impeding credit growth and the growth of the economy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said Wednesday.While the administration is at the beginning of the search process for a new leader of the Fed, speculation among investors and other close watchers of the central bank is already in high gear.Mr. Cohn, who has the president\u2019s ear on economic issues, is widely seen as a potential candidate for the post. Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who is a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory council, is also expected to receive consideration.Ms. Yellen could choose to remain on the Fed\u2019s board even if she is not nominated to a second term as chairwoman. Her term as a Fed governor does not end until 2024.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

The department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is moving to sever the bank from the American financial system, which would severely limit its ability to work with other banks around the world.\u201cWe will follow the money and cut off the money,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said Thursday during a briefing at the White House.Mr. Mnuchin would not say if the United States had warned China about the sanctions, but he said they were not meant as any sort of message to the Chinese government.\u201cThe Department of the Treasury is committed to protecting the U.S. financial system from North Korean abuse and maximizing pressure on the government of North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWhile we will continue to seek international cooperation on North Korea, the United States is sending an emphatic message across the globe that we will not hesitate to take action against persons, companies and financial institutions who enable this regime.\u201dBy targeting the bank, the Trump administration is also hoping that China\u2019s financial sector will pressure North Korea in ways that its government has failed or been unwilling to.Anthony Ruggiero, a former official in the Treasury\u2019s Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, said that because of Thursday\u2019s move, other Chinese banks would likely be getting calls from their American counterparts to make sure that they were not engaging in illicit transactions with North Korea. He said that similar actions against bigger Chinese banks could be in store.\u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Mr. Ruggiero said. \u201cWe know there are more Chinese banks that are either wittingly or unwittingly assisting North Korea.\u201dSanctions are also being imposed on Dalian Global Unity Shipping and two Chinese citizens who the Treasury said have business dealings with North Korea related to illicit financial transactions.President Trump encouraged China, one of North Korea\u2019s only allies and a major trading partner, to pressure the North to curb its nuclear ambitions.Last week, Mr. Trump expressed his frustration on Twitter: \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out.\u201dHe added, \u201cAt least I know China tried!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Government Can\u2019t Crush Independent Journalism", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCAIRO \u2014 As we were winding up the day on May 24 at the office of Mada Masr, the news website where I work, we started to notice something strange. Our site had vanished from the internet in Egypt. After some technical tests and conversations with users of different internet service providers, we realized what had happened: Mada Masr was being blocked in Egypt.Mada Masr was born in a moment of political uncertainty. It was June 2013, when people were protesting the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood. Then the military intervened, ousted President Mohamed Morsi and appointed a government until their commander, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was elected president a few months later.Dissent \u2014 or any act resembling critique of public policy \u2014 was the casualty: endless administrative detentions for some political dissidents, hasty litigation and harsh mass verdicts for others; random killings of political opponents; systematic intimidation of activists, independent journalists and human rights defenders; legislated restrictions on the media and civil society. The authorities rendered the political space void. All other actors were pushed to the margins.Stepping into this void, a number of journalists in Egypt started publishing about all of the above. We called ourselves Mada Masr. \u201cMada\u201d is the Arabic word for \u201creach,\u201d like the horizon. We chose it as a reminder of the possibility of seeing a way out. Mada is also the spot where a gem or stone is placed on a ring, a symbol of taking a position, not succumbing to the reality of our violent exclusion from politics.Four years after its founding, and after constant news coverage, multiple investigative reports and scores of insightful articles about what Egypt has become, Mada Masr was blocked. No one has claimed responsibility for the blockade, which was conducted through an RST injection, a technology China uses to block websites as part of its infamous firewall. An RST injection is a reset command by a third party that prevents data from traveling through an internet protocol, which is the system that connects computers to the internet.News spread in state-affiliated media, which quoted anonymous security sources saying that the authorities had ordered the blocking of a number of websites in Egypt for supporting terrorism and spreading lies. In addition to Mada Masr, a number of other sites have been blocked, including Al Jazeera, the HuffPost\u2019s Arabic-language site, and the Egyptian financial newspaper Al Borsa and its English sister publication, Daily News Egypt.But still, no one from the government has spoken to us.Of course we want freedom. But we at Mada Masr \u2014 like many other groups \u2014 have learned how to thrive in precarity.I am not sure that blocking our website and other websites is the most productive way to stop the flow of knowledge. We are agile. And although the internet has morphed from an ultimately free space into one that governments and big private players have turned into their own terrain, it is still a place where we are able to emerge and re-emerge. Do those invisible powers that come up with the idea of blocking websites or sign off on such decisions know that?The state is powerful and will always be more powerful. But we have also been building power. We at Mada Masr belong to the many in Egypt today who did not disappear when we lost but instead remain in the hide-outs created by that political void. At moments of crisis, at times of direct collision with state power, those hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of us have not really drowned in despair, but rather we have been able to craft politics. And in being political, we recognize and grab moments of possibility, even if they come wrapped in crisis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chris Patten: Did Beijing Betray Hong Kong?", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 Can China be trusted?In 1992-97, the last years that Hong Kong was a British colony, I was its governor. I endured round after round of difficult negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, over the protection of human rights and the development of the first stages of democracy in Hong Kong.People often said to me, \u201cAt least once Beijing leaders reach an agreement, they stick to it.\u201d I thought then that this view was probably based on faith rather than fact. And so it has clearly proved.Hong Kong was never like Britain\u2019s other colonies. Acquired after one of many Western interventions in China during the 19th century \u2014 which still understandably rankle the Chinese \u2014 the territory was picked up on a 99-year lease. The fact that the British did not take it in perpetuity was an attempt to help the enfeebled Qing dynasty save face.After World War II, Britain\u2019s other colonies were given independence and set \u2014 or so it was hoped, though with decreasing confidence \u2014 on the road to democracy. This was not always done with good grace, but by and large, Britain withdrew from empire without too much bloodshed or turbulence.Soon, the only territory Britain still held was the trading outpost of Hong Kong, a successful free economy with a vibrant civil society and the rule of law \u2014 and a haven for people fleeing impoverishment and repression on mainland China after the communists came to power in 1949.But Hong Kong lacked democracy. In the 1940s and \u201950s, there were anxieties in both Britain\u2019s Foreign Office and Hong Kong\u2019s local administration. People were understandably worried that political arguments in Hong Kong would be dragged into the struggle between the communists and the Kuomintang on the mainland and in Taiwan.China\u2019s communist leaders warned Britain against passing democratic reforms in Hong Kong: It was anathema to encourage locals to think that they might be destined for an independent future as a nation state like Singapore.The business community in Hong Kong also convinced British colonial authorities that the locals were not interested in politics; they just wanted to get on with business. I suppose it feared that elections might produce administrations keen on income redistribution.So we British educated young Hong Kongers in their universities, encouraging them to read books about democracy and pluralism while telling them that these things were not for them.As 1997 \u2014 the year Britain\u2019s lease over the territory would run out \u2014 came over the horizon, the British and Chinese governments began discussing the terms under which Britain should hand sovereignty over Hong Kong back to Beijing.In the early 1980s, China\u2019s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, produced the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula: Hong Kong would return to the motherland but retain its autonomy and way of life. This position was then turned into a binding treaty between China and Britain, the Joint Declaration. The deal underlined the importance of beginning Hong Kong\u2019s democratization.When I arrived as governor in 1992, the pass had been largely sold on the pace of democracy. Limited changes were spelled out in the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, which had been adopted in 1990.I tried to make the proposed electoral arrangements as fair and free as possible, for example by considerably extending, not the number of directly elected legislators, but the size of the electorate that could vote for them. Yet so far as the election of the chief executive, Hong Kong\u2019s top position, was concerned, Beijing insisted on vetting all candidates for the post. A committee, largely of people handpicked by China, would then select a winner among them.The last colonial government put in place as many defenses as possible to protect Hong Kong\u2019s independent judiciary, the rule of law, human rights, freedom of speech and civil society. We passed legislation to protect Hong Kong\u2019s pluralist society, in addition to very limited measures to make the city more democratic. This was pretty modest stuff. But it was enough to bring down on my head a torrent of abuse from Chinese Communist Party officials.Back then, my greatest worry about Hong Kong\u2019s prospects after 1997 was that it would simply become the richest city in China. I never feared that the Chinese Army would march in and run things itself.Thanks to the people of Hong Kong \u2014 not least its young citizens \u2014 this has not happened. There is a real sense there of what Hong Kong\u2019s citizenship means and of the interconnections between the rule of law, pluralism and prosperity.At the same time, I have always thought it was extremely unwise to allow this feeling to morph into a campaign for independence. It would dilute support for democratic development in Hong Kong. And it would play into the hands of Beijing hard-liners.Beijing, on the other hand, has never really understood Hong Kong\u2019s way of life. It talks a lot about \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d without making much effort to understand Hong Kong\u2019s system.For a time after the handover, the worst that Beijing did was to push back against the very limited progress that had been made toward democracy. Instead of allowing people in Hong Kong to decide the arrangements for their elections \u2014 something which had been promised \u2014 the Chinese communists started taking the process into their own hands.The government of President Xi Jinping of China has gone much further in recent years. Beijing\u2019s office in Hong Kong interferes more and more with the administration of Hong Kong, which is supposed to be handled autonomously by locals.Hong Kong is a small place, but its fate will loom large over the 21st century. For what happens there will answer the question: Can China be trusted?Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, is the Chancellor of Oxford University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should You Take Advantage of a Deferred Compensation Plan?", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserTo defer, or not to defer?That is the question executives with access to deferred compensation plans at work must answer each year.The plans, made available to company officers or other high earners, let employees set aside part of their annual salary or bonus, to be paid at some point in the future. Money set aside grows tax-deferred, until paid out to the employee.Formally known as nonqualified deferred compensation plans, the plans are a way to let highly paid employees \u2014 typically, those making at least $115,000, but often much more \u2014 stash away more money than allowed under 401(k)\u2019s and similar retirement plans. Companies may pay interest on the deferred money, or allow employees to choose from a menu of investments.But the plans come with risks. By deferring money, employees are essentially accepting an i.o.u. from their employer. While funds in a 401(k) are protected if the company runs into trouble, money deferred in a nonqualified plan is not. So in case of bankruptcy, employees with deferrals become unsecured creditors of the company, and must line up behind secured creditors in the hopes of getting paid.\u201cThere is a risk you may not see the money,\u201d said Micky Reeves, a wealth adviser with Buckingham Strategic Wealth in Plano, Tex.Participation generally tracks economic sentiment, the report noted: Estimated participation dipped to as low as 40 percent of eligible employees in 2010, as the country was emerging from a downturn, before rebounding to more typical levels by 2013.The Plan Sponsor Council of America, a nonprofit lobby group for employers that offer retirement plans, recently found similar levels of participation, but noted that employers offering matching contributions on deferred money reported much higher participation (62 percent).As the economy has recovered and competition for talented employees intensifies, more companies see such plans as important for recruiting and retaining executives, human resources consulting groups say. A recent Newport Group survey of more than 100 companies in the Fortune 1000 found that 92 percent currently offer nonqualified plans, up from 78 percent two years ago.And, while the plans are more prevalent at larger corporations, consultants and financial advisers say they are seeing a trend toward more midsize companies offering the plans, as they compete with larger companies for top talent.Since highly paid employees usually max out their 401(k) contributions quickly, deferral plans can be attractive. For 2017, the maximum employee contribution to a 401(k) is $18,000, plus an extra $6,000 for those over 50.Employees consistently indicate that their top reason for participating in the plans is to save for retirement, and they turn to nonqualified plans in part because of their flexibility, said Gary Dorton, vice president for employer solutions and service with the Principal Financial Group, a provider of the plans. \u201cYou can really tailor it to your specific need,\u201d he said.Consider employees who want to retire at age 62. They are not required to start withdrawing money from their 401(k)\u2019s until they turn 70\u00bd and can maximize Social Security payouts by delaying receipt of benefits. So, they could time payouts from their deferred compensation to provide income in those early retirement years, letting their other savings and investments grow.Whether or not the plans work for a specific employee, however, depends on many variables.Dr. Peter Steckl, 59, an emergency room physician in Atlanta, also does consulting work for a malpractice insurer that offers deferral of up to half of his pay. When the plan was first presented to him, he said in a telephone interview, \u201cIt sounded attractive to me.\u201dBut after conferring with his financial adviser, he decided not to participate. After reviewing his finances, his adviser forecast that based on current tax policy, Dr. Steckl was unlikely to fall into a lower tax bracket after retirement. The insurance company is financially sound, so the risk of losing his money is remote. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have the option,\u201d he said. But with big tax benefits unlikely, he added, \u201cWhy take that chance?\u201dHis adviser, Scott Beaudin, a financial planner and founder of Pathway Financial Advisors in Burlington, Vt., said he generally recommends deferrals only if there is a compelling reason. Many people, he said, react viscerally to the idea of deferring income \u2014 it feels good to avoid the tax man, even if temporarily. But it does not always follow that clients will be better off waiting, he said, instead of taking the income when it is earned, paying taxes at current rates, and then investing the money.In addition to potential tax savings, Mr. Beaudin said, other sound reasons to defer include having children who are applying to college, to increase the chances of a financial aid award; or, to push income into the future if the client is involved in litigation or a contentious divorce (opposing lawyers tend to focus on assets available now, he said, rather than on money that is off the table until well into the future).Another potential deferral scenario is if an employee plans to relocate after retirement from a high-tax state to one with lower or no state income taxes, like Florida. Deferring the money and having it paid out later in the lower-tax state can provide a significant tax break.Mr. Beaudin said he was seeing more smaller companies, particularly in the technology sector, offering deferred compensation plans, which makes him wary. Companies like to retain cash to fund research and development, he said, but the situation may be risky for employees, who may feel pressured to participate to show that they\u2019re supporting the venture. \u201cThere may not be anything at the end of the rainbow,\u201d Mr. Beaudin said.Mr. Reeves, the wealth adviser, recalled a client who had been regularly deferring income. His company was acquired, and the buyer ended the deferred compensation plan, forcing a payout of more than $500,000 \u2014 all of which was taxed at the top 36.9 percent marginal tax bracket.The lesson? \u201cYou want to tread carefully,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.To help manage the risk, Mr. Reeves suggested limiting deferred compensation to no more than 10 percent of overall assets, including other retirement accounts, taxable investments and even emergency cash funds.Typically, employees must choose how much to defer and when they would like to receive the payout. Once they make a selection, there is usually little room to change the plan, under stricter payout rules adopted after the Enron debacle. (The company accelerated payouts of deferred money to protect some executives, just before it filed for bankruptcy protection.)The financial benefits of deferral plans are generally most advantageous when money is deferred for longer periods, said Heidi O\u2019Brien, a partner in Mercer\u2019s executive benefits group \u2014 15 years, rather than five. The trade-off, however, is that the funds are \u201cat risk\u201d for longer periods, should something happen to your employer.Joel Isaacson, a wealth manager in New York City, recommends that installment payouts stretch no longer than five to 10 years. \u201cIt\u2019s not money I\u2019d want to put off for 20 years,\u201d he said.Employees need to consider that they not only get their salary from their employer, but may also have stock grants and other compensation, Mr. Isaacson noted. So deferring large amounts may make their finances overly dependent on one source. \u201cPeople have to look at the total exposure they have to a company,\u201d he said.yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comyourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Undoing All the Good Work on Cuba", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialTo the long list of Barack Obama\u2019s major initiatives that President Trump is obsessed with reversing, we may soon be able to add Cuba. In 2014, Mr. Obama opened a dialogue with Cuba after more than a half-century of unyielding hostility, leading to an easing of sanctions. Mr. Trump promised in his campaign to return to a more hard-line approach. If he does, as seems likely, he will further isolate America, hurt American business interests and, quite possibly, impede the push for greater democracy on the Caribbean island.Soon after his election, Mr. Trump declared, vaguely but ominously, that if Cuba did not \u201cmake a better deal\u201d he would \u201cterminate deal.\u201d He gave no specifics and no decisions have been announced. But details of what a policy reversal could look like are emerging.The aim generally would be to reimpose limits on travel and commerce, supposedly to punish Cuba\u2019s despotic government, now led by Ra\u00fal Castro, brother of the revolutionary leader Fidel Castro. Among the measures being considered are blocking transactions by American companies with firms that have ties to the Cuban military, which is deeply enmeshed in the economy, and tightening restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba that Mr. Obama eased last year before his historic trip to Havana.This hard-line sanctions-based approach was in place for more than 50 years after the 1959 revolution and never produced what anti-Castro activists hoped would be the result, the ouster of Cuba\u2019s Communist government in favor of democracy. Isolating Cuba has become increasingly indefensible.Mr. Obama\u2019s opening to Havana has enabled the freer flow of people, goods and information between the two countries, even as significant differences remain over human rights. It has produced bilateral agreements on health care cooperation, joint planning to mitigate oil spills, coordination on counternarcotics efforts and intelligence-sharing. In April, Google\u2019s servers went live in Cuba and thus it became the first foreign internet company to host content in one of the most unplugged nations on earth. Mr. Obama\u2019s approach also encouraged Latin American countries to be more receptive to the United States as a partner in regional problem-solving.The White House and its allies argue that the Cuban government remains despotic and must be pressured to reform. But pressure has had a minimal impact and the human rights concerns are disingenuous, given Mr. Trump\u2019s effusive embrace of authoritarian leaders from President Vladimir Putin in Russia to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Egypt. He also pointedly told Sunni Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia last month that he has no intention of lecturing them on their repressive behavior toward their citizens.As with his decision to withdraw from the global climate agreement, Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to Cuba reflects a craven desire to curry favor with his political base, in this case conservative Republicans from Florida who are viscerally anti-Castro. That might help him get re-elected in 2020, but it would help no one else.Strengthening ties with Cuba cannot guarantee Cuban reforms, but it is the best bet.Advertisement"}

Seeks Control Over London Trading After \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank took steps Friday to ensure it can oversee trillions of euros in London trading of derivatives and other risky securities even after Britain leaves the European Union.\u201cBrexit creates a new reality where there are some clearinghouses that are outside the E.U. but critically important to the E.U.\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. The central bank needs \u201cto have enough control in time of crisis.\u201dLondon clearinghouses, which dominate trading in derivatives and other securities denominated in euros, have become even more powerful in recent years. Under new rules created to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, regulators around the world have pushed banks to carry out the trading of derivatives using clearinghouses, where the transactions can be better monitored.Previously, banks typically traded many derivatives in secret with one another, making it difficult for outsiders to know what kind of risks might be lurking in the financial system. Although the system is more transparent, the stakes are raised if a clearinghouse has problems.Although Britain has never been a member of the eurozone, London clearinghouses stand in the middle of transactions involving huge volumes of securities denominated in euros. One example is the so-called repo market, in which banks, hedge funds or other investors make short-term loans to one another using bonds or other securities as collateral.Mr. V\u00e9ron said that the European Central Bank might have an interest in encouraging trading of euro securities to remain in London. Restricting trading overseas would undercut the central bank\u2019s ambition to make the euro a global currency. Businesses and investors would be less likely to carry out transactions in euros if trading outside the eurozone were restricted.Under the proposed legislation, the central bank would not directly regulate clearinghouses that handle euro transactions. That would be the responsibility of the European Securities and Markets Authority. But the central bank would have the power to monitor clearinghouse operations and take action in a crisis.It is a battle that the central bank has fought in the past. Last year, the bank lost a court fight with Britain over whether it had the power to regulate clearinghouses. But in ruling against the central bank, the Court of Justice of the European Union said that the European Parliament could grant such powers if the central bank requested them.Advertisement"}

But with war escalating in Vietnam, President Johnson wouldn\u2019t risk a conflict in the Middle East. If Israel preemptively attacked, he warned, it would find itself without American support.Beginning on May 16, tens of thousands of Israeli reservists were mobilized. On the home front, storage rooms were turned into air raid shelters. Mass graves were dug in parks and playgrounds. The economy came to a standstill. The Israeli public \u2014 the population of only three million was composed heavily of Jews displaced from Arab countries and Holocaust survivors \u2014 reacted with existential dread and resolve.Yet the government, at first, hesitated to act, fearing a cataclysmic war that the fledgling Jewish state might lose. Even as Israeli radio played a morale-boosting song mocking Mr. Nasser\u2019s boast that he was waiting for Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Army\u2019s chief of staff, Mr. Rabin, overwhelmed with stress, succumbed to a nervous and physical breakdown. The government told the jittery public that he was suffering from nicotine poisoning, and he soon resumed preparations for war.By June 7, Mr. Rabin was celebrating victory at the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem. And by the end of the war three days later, Israel had more than tripled its territory, having captured the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Desert from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria.How, Israelis wondered, did we move from the edge of abyss to military mastery in a matter of weeks? The abrupt transition from trauma to triumph has shaped the Jewish state ever since. Consciously or not, when confronting challenges, Israelis ask themselves: Is this a May 1967 moment that demands wariness? Or is this a June 1967 moment that requires the self-confidence of victors?On the one hand, Israel today bears little resemblance to the embattled nation of May 1967. The country has peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan. And with a high-tech economy and a population of close to nine million, it is now the world\u2019s largest Jewish community.Yet Israel also faces unprecedented dangers. Hezbollah and Hamas aim tens of thousands of rockets at its population centers. Iran is attempting to create bases on Israel\u2019s border with Syria. The Iranian nuclear threat has been delayed, but only temporarily.Most of all, Israelis wrestle with competing existential fears over the Palestinian dilemma. For some, the nightmare is that there won\u2019t be a Palestinian state: The status quo will continue, and Israel will become a pariah nation, ceasing to be a democratic and Jewish-majority state. For others, the nightmare is that a Palestinian state will be established and Israel will return to May 1967 borders barely nine miles wide. Soon after, Hamas will take over the West Bank and East Jerusalem, rockets will fall on Tel Aviv, and Israel may be unable to adequately defend itself in a disintegrating Middle East.In determining their political choices, Israelis struggle with the contradictory lessons of 1967. The memory of that May warns that genocidal threats remain, that international guarantees are worthless and that, at the moment of truth, the Jews will always find themselves alone. The memory of that June counters that Israel can protect itself, that power imposes moral responsibility and that the Jewish people cannot permanently occupy another people.Over the past 50 years a pattern has emerged. When Israelis feel under siege, the traumas of the weeks leading up to the Six-Day War are reawakened and the mood turns hard-line. Yet when they sense a more sympathetic international climate, they take more risks for peace.A May 1967 moment occurred when the United Nations General Assembly voted to equate Zionism with racism in November 1975. An outraged Israeli public sought a way to respond. Thousands of supporters of the nascent settlement movement marched in a pouring rain and squatted at an abandoned Ottoman-era railway station near the West Bank city of Nablus. They staked a sign in the mud that read \u201cZionism Avenue.\u201dUntil that United Nations vote, the settlement movement was faltering. Though a handful of settlements had been established after the Six-Day War, the Labor-led government blocked most new construction, dispatching the army to uproot would-be settlers. Now, though, sensing a change in the public mood, the government permitted 30 families to move to an army base near Nablus, creating the nucleus of a future settlement and granting the settlement movement a symbolic victory.By contrast, a June 1967 moment occurred 10 years later, when President Anwar Sadat of Egypt flew to Israel. Thousands lined the streets to cheer the man who only four years earlier had unleashed a surprise attack on Israel\u2019s holiest day. The radio played a new song: \u201cI Was Born for Peace.\u201d Following the peace agreement with Egypt, the right-wing prime minister, Menachem Begin, uprooted the settlements in Sinai that had been built by his Labor predecessors.The collapse of the Soviet Union, which had led the assault on Israel in international forums, created another June 1967 moment. Eastern European and African nations, along with China and India, established relations with the Jewish state. The United Nations even repealed the noxious Zionism-racism resolution. That change in the international climate helped embolden Israel to reach out to the P.L.O. in 1992 and initiate the Oslo peace process.When the Oslo process broke down in 2000, and buses and cafes were routinely exploding in Israeli cities, the public reverted to May 1967. Israelis were especially embittered by the failure of much of the international community to hold the Palestinian leadership accountable for rejecting two Israeli offers for Palestinian statehood.Now, as the Trump administration tries to renew the moribund peace process, Israelis are deeply ambivalent. A majority of Israelis \u2014 58 percent, according to a recent poll \u2014 support renewing peace talks with the Palestinians. But only 17 percent believe that Israel has a peace partner. In other words, a majority want to be June Israelis, but feel forced by circumstance to be May Israelis.The international community can help transform the Israeli majority that supports a peace process in principle into a majority that believes it is possible. For starters, it can cease the obsessive condemnation of Israel at the United Nations. Western nations can also help reinforce the hopeful mind-set of June 1967 by speaking out against the boycotts \u2014 academic, cultural and otherwise \u2014 against Israel. Sunni leaders can greatly contribute to this process by turning a burgeoning but quiet anti-Iranian strategic relationship with Israel into a public process of recognition of Israel\u2019s legitimacy. Until now Arab leaders have conditioned that recognition on the creation of a Palestinian state. But the reverse is a precondition for success.To convince Israelis that peace is possible, they need to be reassured of their place among the nations. They need to know that the international community takes seriously threats against Israel\u2019s security and that the Jewish state will never again find itself in a May 1967 moment. Fifty years after the end of the Six-Day War, the question of Israel\u2019s legitimacy must finally be put to rest.Yossi Klein Halevi, a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute, is the author of \u201cLike Dreamers: The Story of the Israeli Paratroopers Who Reunited Jerusalem and Divided a Nation.\u201dThis is an essay in a series of articles that examine the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, a half-century on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Initial Jolt Over Qatar Tensions, Energy Markets Settle", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe flare-up in the Middle East adds to the instability in the world\u2019s most important energy-exporting region. Saudi Arabia is the biggest exporter of crude oil, while Qatar is home to substantial natural gas resources.But a diplomatic dispute will not necessarily cut into supplies, provided tensions in the region do not escalate. Amid a global glut, other countries could easily step in to fill the void.Investors seem to be calculating that. While oil prices initially spiked 1.6 percent on Monday, the markets quickly fell back to just above $50 a barrel.\u201cIn the Middle East, there is politics and then there is business,\u201d said Chase Untermeyer, who served as the American ambassador to Qatar in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd business tends to keep on going regardless of political scrapes.\u201dAt present, the markets are digesting an oversupply of crude oil, which has kept prices low for more than two years. Saudi Arabia and other major oil-exporting nations are trying to keep supplies in check, but American shale companies continue to ramp up production.A small country with only 2.2 million residents \u2014 many of whom are not citizens \u2014 Qatar occupies a strategic position, jutting into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula. Qatar has a border with Saudi Arabia and shares the world\u2019s largest natural gas field with Iran.Qatar is a relatively small oil producer with output of about 620,000 barrels a day in April, less than 1 percent of world supply. But the country is a world power in natural gas.Through partnerships with Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and other companies, Qatar has built major infrastructure for chilling natural gas into liquid form so that it can be exported on ships. Qatar was the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas last year, accounting for nearly 30 percent of supplies, according to the consultancy group Wood Mackenzie.Gas has helped make Qatar one of the world\u2019s richest countries per capita. The government has used the steady flow of cash to intervene in regional disputes and to finance activities like the broadcast network Al Jazeera, actions that often annoy its Arab neighbors.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.The diplomatic crisis comes at a difficult time for Qatar\u2019s economy. Over the last two years, Australia\u2019s mushrooming liquefied gas exports have increasingly crowded out Qatari gas meant for Japan, South Korea, China and other growing Asian markets.That squeeze \u2014 coupled with weak energy prices and exorbitant spending in preparation to host the 2022 World Cup \u2014 has driven up Qatar\u2019s debt. Last month, Moody\u2019s downgraded Qatar\u2019s credit ratings below those of several Gulf states. Even before this diplomatic row, the country\u2019s economy was expected to grow only about 2 percent this year.As Arab neighbors sever ties, the move could most immediately damage the premier national airline, Qatar Airways. The airline will no longer be able to fly over Saudi and Egyptian airspace to Europe. While alternative routes will probably be established over Iran and Turkey, added flight times will almost certainly hurt ticket sales, to the benefit of its competitor, Emirates Airlines.\u201cIf this continues for any length of time it will have implications for the Qatari economy,\u201d said Richard Mallinson, a geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm. \u201cThe question is, do calmer heads prevail and do we see work to de-escalate.\u201dNatural gas is the economic unknown.Qatar\u2019s leaders realized decades ago that they had to bring in foreign investors to gain access to the capital and technology needed to take advantage of their major natural gas deposits. Shell has pumped about $20 billion into an enormous facility, while Exxon Mobil is probably Qatar\u2019s most important partner with stakes across the country\u2019s natural gas industry.\u201cI would think both are pretty worried,\u201d said Trevor Sikorski, a gas analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based research firm.Shell and Exxon declined to comment.Any disruptions depend on whether the diplomatic rift deepens \u2014 a crucial variable as companies decide whether to invest more in Qatar.Saudi Arabia in 2011 sent troops into Bahrain to bolster the ruling family, which was facing unrest. Some analysts worry that Egypt could block Qatari exports from going though the Suez Canal.But such actions seem unlikely at this point. The Saudis, for one, are already wrestling with several foreign entanglements, particularly the war in Yemen.\u201cNobody is going to meddle with their oil and gas fields,\u201d said Sadad Ibrahim Al-Husseini, former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco. \u201cThe issue is they are not going to have any luck selling their gas within the Gulf region.\u201dQatari gas exports that previously went to Asia are expected to be diverted to Europe. But Qatar will probably be squeezed again, as American supplies are expected to rise over the next year or two as new export terminals come online.Qatar has tried to compensate for lost markets by exporting more gas to Middle Eastern markets. But the new political tension will hurt those efforts.\u201cThe prospects for future Qatari gas exports to adjacent markets have been reduced to less than zero,\u201d said Mr. Al-Husseini.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reading Erdogan\u2019s Ambitions in Turkey\u2019s New Mosques", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "FeatureA building spree of houses of worship is furthering the Islamicization of the country and providing an ongoing economic engine.Supported byBut much of typical Turkish life has been transformed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, especially when it comes to Islam and profit. Many of Turkey\u2019s 75,000 mosques were historically built and maintained by the Ministry of Religious Affairs, or Diyanet, according to a community\u2019s needs for prayer space. It was not assumed that a new neighborhood or a college campus, for example, necessarily required a mosque. Such decisions depended on both the ruling government\u2019s perspective on religion and society and the levels of urban and rural development at the time. Between 2006 and 2009 \u2014 Erdogan became prime minister in 2002 \u2014 9,000 additional mosques went up throughout Turkey. Like his bridges, airports, pastel-pastiche apartment towers and luxury shopping malls, Erdogan\u2019s mosques have themselves become engines of national economic growth, as well as symbols of his New Turkey. In 2012, roughly when Erdogan was taking a turn toward the authoritarian and just before terrorist violence began hitting Turkey, there was a ribbon-cutting for the government-commissioned, $22 million Atasehir Mimar Sinan Mosque on the eastern, Asian side of Istanbul. One of the guests, the speaker of the National Assembly in Iraq, remarked: \u201cTurkey is building a new civilization.\u201dBut while some of these mosques \u2014 like the Mimar Sinan and the nearly finished Camlica Mosque, also in Istanbul \u2014 are expressions of state and cultural power, the vast majority of them are smaller community mosques, like many of those seen on these pages in Norman Behrendt\u2019s photographs of expanding neighborhoods in Ankara and Istanbul. Such outposts, typically constructed in the imperial Ottoman style and in color combinations completely at odds with the natural environment, squat at the edges of Turkey\u2019s major cities like holy stakes in the ground. They\u2019re ostensibly meant to serve the new residential buildings rising around them, but it\u2019s hard not to see in their proliferation a leader\u2019s hope to further the Islamicization of his country by adding more houses of worship. Do all these mosques mark Turkey\u2019s priorities as Islamic and Ottoman, or capitalist and authoritarian? All of the above? Or something else entirely?By 2004, Erdogan\u2019s AK Party controlled not only the national government but also the municipalities of Istanbul and Ankara, the capital city. The party embraced a new global trend in urban management: It helped establish a series of distinct city-run corporations. At first, the public-private synergy produced real benefits; the AK Party expanded metro service throughout Istanbul and created new parks and pedestrian spaces. But as the party\u2019s power and the country\u2019s economy grew, the government began selling off empty state land to private developers, often partnering with them through the national housing commission, TOKI. Together they built apartment towers, bridges and airports, tunnels and shopping malls with valet parking. Erdogan, in a sense, came to define the public\u2019s space and its values. \u201cIn many parts of the world, the state\u2019s role is to safeguard the interests of the public when negotiating with private developers,\u201d says Sibel Bozdogan, an architectural historian who has been a lecturer at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Design. \u201cIn Turkey, the state is the biggest developer.\u201dAll this construction activity has proved to be a vote-getter for the AK Party. Many Turks, even those who will never visit, say, the Zorlu Center, a fancy Istanbul mall with its own Eataly, or who will never drive their car over a new bridge, or who already have their favorite nearby mosque to pray in, have thrilled to Turkey\u2019s progress and been filled with national pride: Their country is modernizing; their government is getting things done. That may be because Erdogan has cleverly manipulated the Turks\u2019 identity. Even if the AK Party was destroying communities to modernize the country, it was offering its people images of past and present greatness as a psychic balm. Erdogan often speaks of ancient battles won by the Ottomans, and he keeps putting up all those 16th-century-style mosques in tribute to a period when they ruled the greatest empire on earth.The Mimar Sinan Mosque, for example, was named for the Ottoman Empire\u2019s most famous architect. It draws on Seljuk and Byzantine influences, like many of Turkey\u2019s most celebrated edifices, including the Selimiye and Suleymaniye Mosques. They have dome roofs, an array of minarets, stone-portal facades, interior courtyards and decorative tiles. (While most visitors find their orblike bodies and graceful minarets to be magical, the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky memorably compared Turkish mosques to enormous frozen toads.) Likewise, Erdogan\u2019s most cherished initiative, a huge mosque on Camlica Hill in Istanbul, near the shores of the Bosporus, is a classic Ottoman mosque with one expansive dome roof, several cupolas and a total of six minarets arranged around it.Erdogan is ordering the construction of mosques much as Suleiman the Magnificent once gave orders to Mimar Sinan. But as Bozdogan points out, there were many styles of mosques throughout the Ottoman Empire; in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, Ottoman Baroque and Ottoman Neoclassical were common creative experiments. The Ottomans did not hesitate to seek out modern European influences for a Westernized future and seldom looked back to some glorious past. Erdogan, however, sees such 18th- and 19th-century mosques as a contamination, not purely Turkish like the mosques of the 16th century. Bulent Batuman, an associate professor of urban design at Bilkent University in Ankara, suggests that Erdogan\u2019s neo-Ottoman mosques are not nostalgic, which would mean an acceptance of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s demise; for Erdogan, they are \u201ca disavowal of such failure\u201d and a forward-looking attempt to restore the past\u2019s glory.Turkey is no longer the country of security and prosperity of Erdogan\u2019s first decade in office. Terrorism has battered nightclubs, soccer games, heritage sites, bus stops and pedestrian walkways. The police and their tanks and machine guns are everywhere, patrolling the streets. Since the Gezi Park protests of 2013, even parks have become off-limits for large gatherings, except for the state-sanctioned, nationalistic extravaganzas like those sponsored by the government every night after the attempted military coup. Buildings are still going up around Turkey, but it\u2019s unclear if anyone will occupy them. The economy is faltering. Parts of Istanbul and Ankara are beginning to resemble the suburbs of Dublin after the real estate crash in 2009. In Turkey, in addition to \u201cghost neighborhoods,\u201d there may soon be ghost airports, ghost malls and ghost mosques, like the ones in Behrendt\u2019s photographs.Yet Erdogan somehow always outmaneuvers fate. Earlier this year, he again unveiled new plans for a Taksim mosque, which some regarded as a political move to generate support for the April referendum when voters decided whether his powers should be greatly expanded; his victory opened the door to his remaining president until 2029. In 2014, after Turkey\u2019s economy began to suffer, Turkey deepened its involvement in the wars in Syria and Iraq, and Erdogan later restarted another with the Kurds in Turkey\u2019s east. At home, he fills his empty TOKI towns with Syrian refugees, while some of the country\u2019s destroyed Kurdish areas have already been zoned for urban renewal. In the contexts of Syria and Iraq, he talks up his construction skills as if to ask: Who else would be better at rebuilding a country shattered by war? And so the Turkish mosque, with its hunchback dome, spearlike minarets and ground-floor bodegas, might yet find a hundred new homes in Raqqa and Mosul and Cizre, whether or not there is anyone left to pray in them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Softball Brings Washington Together Again, for a Night", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The capital power brokers filed into an elementary school lot, beyond barricades covered in wrinkled advertisements. On the diamond, the players warmed up beside a giant-headed Abraham Lincoln mascot with a slightly menacing smile. Off it, heavily armed security guards lined the grounds.\u201cIt has that small-town feel to it,\u201d said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida and a semi-reluctant outfielder in Wednesday evening\u2019s annual softball game between the women of Congress and the women of the Fourth Estate. \u201cIt just feels like Anytown, U.S.A.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t, exactly.But for a moment, in this city of irrepressible cynicism and occasionally rose-colored outfield sunglasses, it could look like it, at least for the game\u2019s truest believers.For the second time in two weeks, a collection of proudly self-identifying members of the Washington establishment \u2014 elected officials, journalists and generally well-meaning creatures of the Trump-era swamp \u2014 gathered at a ball field for a showdown that felt more meaningful than usual.The game last week amounted to a brief catharsis, perhaps a very brief one, mixing cheers and tears and bipartisan beer-guzzling in the name of collective anguish.The contest Wednesday was different, the emotions considerably less raw. Neither team had been shot at the day before.But one week out, the shooting has kept the capital suspended in a moment of broader reckoning \u2014 not uncommon, distressingly, in recent years. It called to mind the aftermath of tragedies past, like the Sandy Hook massacre of 2012 and the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, then a congresswoman from Arizona, in 2011. Ms. Giffords was herself a member of the softball team when she served in the House.\u201cI think people are feeling very \u2014 what\u2019s the right word? \u2014 almost wrung out,\u201d said Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, an outfielder and a pitcher. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much violence. It\u2019s a climate of hate.\u201dSince its inception in 2009, the softball game has distinguished itself from the men\u2019s affair by placing Republicans and Democrats on the same team, pitting them against members of the news media. (A disclosure: Three New York Times journalists \u2014 three talented and competitive New York Times journalists \u2014 play for the team, and a fourth coaches.)The event raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, an advocacy group for women with breast cancer; one of the game\u2019s co-founders, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, is a breast cancer survivor. Organizers said it had raised more than $300,000 this year.\u201cThere are only 535 of us,\u201d Ms. Wasserman Schultz said of Congress as a country singer, Kalie Shorr, completed a sound check for the midgame entertainment: a performance of \u201cFight Like a Girl.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201dThere are more important things than softball going on in Washington, not least the discussions over a closely guarded Senate health bill that is set to be unveiled this week, with its attendant effects on about one-sixth of the American economy.But for years, lawmakers have spoken of this athletic tradition in near-reverent terms, recalling friendships deepened and legislative partnerships forged in a Capitol often bereft of bygone comity.The shooting last week, said one team member, Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, \u201creminded us of why we do this.\u201d\u201cIt matters,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand added. \u201cAnd it has always mattered.\u201dThe accommodations have long been considerably more modest than those of the men\u2019s game, which is played in a major league stadium.On Wednesday evening, among moldering football practice equipment and overstuffed bleachers, the sides played before a near-sellout crowd of more than 2,500.\u201cHi, ladies,\u201d Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said, clasping hands with a volunteer in a highlighter yellow shirt. \u201cMucho fun.\u201dSpeaker Paul D. Ryan strolled behind home plate, warmly greeting members of the journalists\u2019 team. (It was, as ever, a complicated day for politician-press relations at the Capitol: Earlier on Wednesday, a new Republican member, Representative Greg Gianforte of Montana, was sworn in, less than two weeks after pleading guilty to assaulting a reporter.)Other boldfaced names, at least by Washington standards, dotted the park: Kellyanne Conway, the White House adviser; Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California.\u201cHere comes Steny Hoyer!\u201d fans were told via loudspeaker at one point. The game\u2019s commentary came from Andrea Mitchell of NBC, Dana Bash of CNN and Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who could be seen poring over the rosters from a tent between home plate in the early innings.The heartiest ovation may have come for Crystal Griner, the Capitol Police officer shot in the ankle at the men\u2019s practice last week.

{"Headline": "Criticism Builds as Theresa May Prepares to Form New Government", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain still hangs by a thread.The D.U.P. has 10 elected members of Parliament, and Mrs. May needs them for a majority on vital votes of no-confidence and the budget if her minority government is to survive.The deal is now likely to be completed on Thursday, when Mrs. May is to meet with the party leaders of Northern Ireland, including Sinn Fein. In large part, she will try to reassure them that the government, even with the D.U.P. as a member, will remain impartial toward policies in the province.But Mrs. May suffered something of a blow when a former Conservative prime minister, John Major, urged her to avoid any deal with the unionists because of the potential for destabilizing Northern Ireland and harming the Good Friday agreement, the 1998 deal that brought relative peace to Northern Ireland, especially at a moment when power-sharing in Belfast has broken down.\u201cThe danger is that however much the government tries, they will not be seen to be impartial if they are locked into a parliamentary deal in Westminster with one of the Northern Ireland parties,\u201d Mr. Major said.And some of her own more liberal-minded Conservatives, like Ruth Davidson, the popular and openly gay leader of the Scottish Conservatives, are unhappy about dependence on a party that opposes abortion and gay marriage. Ms. Davidson has already sought special assurances from Mrs. May that social policy in the rest of Britain would not be altered or held hostage because of any deal with the D.U.P.But Mrs. May has no other options if she is to have a government that provides a semblance of stability, as she has promised, with negotiations on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit, looming as early as next week.There was trouble building on that score, too. Her predecessor, David Cameron, who held the referendum on a British exit and quit after he lost it, used his first public comments since last Thursday\u2019s election to urge Mrs. May to consider \u201ca softer Brexit,\u201d describing \u201can opportunity to consult more widely with the other parties on how we best can achieve it.\u201dWhile Mrs. May was correct to remain in office, Mr. Cameron said, he warned that \u201cover Brexit, she is going to have to talk more widely, listen to other parties\u201d \u2014 not just the Scottish Conservatives, who are eager for an exit that allows free trade, but also the opposition Labour Party.Mrs. May will not regard those comments as helpful, and she has already said that she wants an exit that will take Britain out of the European Union\u2019s single market and customs union. Only that way, she has argued, can Britain control immigration and make its own trade deals free of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.But in a weakened position, she has also had to retain Philip Hammond as her chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Hammond has emphasized that he wants a deal that does the most to protect British jobs and trade. He would prefer that Britain at least remain in the customs union.But that position, which seems roughly to be that of the Labour Party, is anathema to the \u201cleave\u201d supporters in Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet and her own party. So here, too, she is stuck, without the obvious authority to force everyone into line.There is a logical problem with a softer British exit, of course. To remain in the single market, Britain would have to accept freedom of movement and labor for all European Union citizens, which is exactly the issue that drove the leave campaign to victory in the referendum \u2014 to \u201ctake back control\u201d of immigration.The customs union is a lesser association, but it covers only free trade in goods, not services, which make up nearly 80 percent of the British economy. And even the customs union does not allow Britain to make its own trade deals with other countries in the world, as the Brexit supporters demand \u2014 it has to follow European Union trade arrangements.What drives the other European Union member states slightly crazy is this continuing delay by Britain, which, after all, initiated the process of leaving. The referendum was a year ago. The official notice of leaving was given on March 29, meaning that Britain will be out, deal or no deal, on March 29, 2019.The clock is ticking, but given Mrs. May\u2019s humiliating loss of her parliamentary majority, will Britain be thrown into another national debate about what kind of exit it wants?On Tuesday evening, Mrs. May traveled to Paris to meet Europe\u2019s triumphant new president, Emmanuel Macron of France. The meeting centered on antiterrorism policies and concluded with both leaders watching a France-England soccer match, which England gracefully lost, 3-2.But the real issue, of course, is Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc. France wants to get on with it and restore its cooperative relationship with Germany as the essential dual motor of the European Union. Brexit, then, is a distraction, and while both France and Germany want to preserve good economic and military relations with Britain, the cohesion of the bloc is paramount for them.Mrs. May said there was \u201ca unity of purpose\u201d in Britain on Brexit. Mr. Macron did not even raise his eyebrows. But asked in English whether there would be \u201copen doors\u201d in Brussels should Britain change its mind on leaving, he answered carefully and deliberately in French.Until the negotiations end, he said, \u201cof course there is always the possibility to reopen the door.\u201d But once they begin \u2014 and they are scheduled to start next week \u2014 \u201cwe all should be well aware that it is much more difficult to turn back.\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Troubles at a Midsize Italian Bank Worry the E.U.", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Some banks go to the international markets when they need money for a big deal. Monte dei Paschi di Siena, one of Italy\u2019s biggest lenders, tapped its own loyal customers.\u201cThe bank has always been a gold mine and the pride of the city,\u201d said Paolo Emilio Falaschi, a lawyer in Siena who represents several aggrieved clients.As the bank runs low on cash, the Italian government is stepping in to help, with plans to inject as much as 20 billion euros into Monte dei Paschi and other troubled lenders. European regulators gave their preliminary approval to the Monte dei Paschi deal on the condition that the bank go through an in-depth restructuring and its finances pass muster.Much of the reform instituted after the 2008 financial crisis was intended to prevent banks from becoming so big and so risky that they could hold the global economy hostage. Politicians and policy makers didn\u2019t want taxpayers to be on the hook for the banks\u2019 mistakes.Under the new rules, national governments are not supposed to inject fresh taxpayer money into a bank if it is deemed insolvent. When a bank gets into financial trouble, shareholders and bondholders, assumed to be sophisticated investors aware of the risks, are supposed to take the hit and bear the losses.The health of Monte dei Paschi \u2014 which will be assessed by the European Central Bank as a condition of the deal \u2014 will be a crucial measure to ensure the bailout follows the rules. But the finances of Monte dei Paschi are open to significant interpretation, putting the rescue in a regulatory gray area.Monte dei Paschi is the first case in which the European Central Bank has exercised its oversight role under new bank bailout rules. The central bank is responsible for determining whether Monte dei Paschi can be saved and how much capital it needs.If authorities stretch the definition of solvency for a midsize Italian lender, a fraction the size of JPMorgan Chase or Deutsche Bank, the case could raise questions about whether the world was any safer from a really big bank failure.\u201cThis is the first serious test for the European banking union,\u201d said Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, an economic research institute in Munich.\u201cIf the bail-in rules are violated without very good reasons,\u201d Mr. Fuest said, \u201cthe credibility of the banking union will be damaged.\u201dMonte dei Paschi declined to comment.Monte dei Paschi\u2019s problems have been festering for nearly a decade. Founded in 1472 and still based in a fortresslike medieval building, the bank for centuries was a sleepy regional lender. The local foundation that owned the bank showered its profit on Siena and the surrounding region, subsidizing things as diverse as the local professional soccer team and Siena\u2019s famous Palio horse race.The bank\u2019s troubles began in 2008, when it acquired Antonveneta, a small regional player. The price of \u20ac9 billion, all in cash, was considered alarmingly high.Stretched, the bank used a series of dubious transactions to raise money. Among them was the sale of \u20ac2 billion in bonds to customers, employees and other middle-class savers.Weakened by the purchase, Monte dei Paschi was acutely vulnerable to the shocks that followed the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in late 2008 and the European debt crisis in 2010. Prices plunged for the bank\u2019s holdings of Italian government bonds. The amount of problem loans surged, as Italy\u2019s sputtering economy hurt small businesses and left many unable to repay their debts.Monte dei Paschi managers made the problems worse by trying to conceal growing losses from shareholders and regulators, in part using derivatives devised with the help of Japanese bank Nomura and Deutsche Bank. After the losses were exposed in 2013, the bank needed a \u20ac3.9 billion bailout from the Bank of Italy to stay afloat.A succession of new top managers tried to fix Monte dei Paschi by pushing thousands of bank workers into early retirement, selling problem loans and asking shareholders to put up new capital. The measures were not enough.Last July, stress tests by European bank regulators determined that Monte dei Paschi\u2019s capital would be wiped out in the event of a severe economic crisis. No other bank tested fared so poorly.The bank tried to raise more capital. But the company failed to persuade private investors.The crisis comes at a particularly sensitive time. New elections are expected later this year, or next spring.Leaders in Rome are worried that forcing small-time investors to take a hit would make them susceptible to appeals by the populist Five Star Movement or the right wing Northern League. The Five Star Movement has organized noisy demonstrations in front of Monte dei Paschi\u2019s headquarters.\u201cYou can expect Five Star and the Northern League to play this card,\u201d said Silvia Merler, an affiliate fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.Sergio Burrini, a retired Monte dei Paschi employee who is secretary of group representing small investors, expressed anger at \u201ca terrible political and managerial class that did not prevent this mayhem from happening.\u201d But Mr. Burrini expressed no sympathy for the Five Star Movement.Local lawyers in touch with bondholders doubt that their clients would turn to populist parties. Most of the investors are relatively well-to-do people unlikely to support such movements, the lawyers said.The debate about the bailout has reopened familiar fault lines between Italy and countries like Germany that insist on strict adherence to the letter of the law. Early in the process, the German government raised objections to a bailout.But it may be reluctant to put up obstacles now. The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel faces an election in September, and Germany may need to save its own troubled institution, the state-owned HSH Nordbank.On Thursday, the Finance Ministry in Berlin declined to comment on the decisions by European authorities to approve the bailout.Ms. Merler of Bruegel argued that Italy is not violating European rules by helping Monte dei Paschi. Europe\u2019s bank resolution law allows countries to provide temporary aid to banks in order to avert a financial crisis, provided the bank has not already collapsed.Some analysts are concerned that Monte dei Paschi\u2019s troubles could spread to other Italian banks. Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca both asked for state aid last month, but European regulators may be reluctant to give them arrangements similar to Monte dei Paschi\u2019s.While the details of Monte dei Paschi\u2019s deal are still being finalized, Italian taxpayers are expected to the bear the brunt of the cost. The Italian government is expected to kick in \u20ac6.6 billion, with the remaining \u20ac2.2 billion of its capital shortfall covered by senior bondholders. As part of the plan, the ordinary folks who bought bonds would be compensated in some manner.The justification for repaying the small-time investors in full is that they were victims of false marketing. But critics say consumer fraud issues should be treated separately from the bailout.\u201cThey can sue the bank for selling them something they did not want to buy,\u201d said Mr. Fuest of the Ifo Institute. \u201cI cannot see that financial stability depends on bailing out all retail investors.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, Gaia Pianigiani from Rome and Chad Bray from London.

{"Headline": "Video Review: After 15-Year Break, Lincoln Continental Returns With Style", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenThe Continental name carries gravitas. So much, in fact, that it\u2019s easy to forget that Lincoln hasn\u2019t used the nameplate since 2002. It\u2019s like realizing that Team Flakes hasn\u2019t been available in the grocery store for years.Unlike the breakfast cereal, Continental is back. After a 15-year sabbatical, this luxury sedan arrives looking toned, confident and, well, familiar. When the concept debuted in 2015, Luc Donckerwolke, Bentley\u2019s design director at the time, famously asked the Lincoln team on Facebook, \u201cDo you want us to send the product tooling?\u201d The production car retains a Bentley Flying Spur silhouette, and the Revel speaker grilles carry an uncanny resemblance to their Burmester counterparts in a Mercedes.As others before me have said, \u201cGood artists copy; great artists steal.\u201dThere is original character, especially the exterior door pulls integrated into the chrome window beltline. Touch the electronic pad inside them and the doors open with a slight spring-loaded pop. Top-tier models get a power mechanism that gently cinches the doors closed the last inch or so. They\u2019re not the rear-hinged doors of the 1960s Continentals, but they attract attention.Lincoln wisely decided not to out-German the Germans. Instead, it focused on updating the Continental\u2019s American pampering abilities.Before diving further into this 10th generation (the \u201cMark\u201d designation is no longer used), a quick Continental primer. The original 1939 model was commissioned by Edsel Ford to be his personal vehicle. Frank Lloyd Wright was so smitten, he bought two. In 1956, the Mark II Continental cost an eye-popping $10,000, and it was a star driven by the stars. Warner Bros. thanked Elizabeth Taylor for making the film \u201cGiant\u201d by giving her one in a custom color that matched her dazzling eyes.The ninth-generation Continental had become a warmed-over Ford. The new one\u2019s sole visual cue to its Ford origins is the Sync 3 user interface. The chassis structure may be adapted from the Fusion/MKZ platform, but that\u2019s out of sight. The Lincoln deservedly gets its own knobs with a ribbed look and feel.There are three V6 engine choices. I drove the most powerful, a twin-turbocharged 3-liter with 400 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque. Choosing it demands all-wheel drive that sends varying power to each wheel. Buyer\u2019s note: It\u2019s more sophisticated than the all-wheel-drive mechanics paired to the turbocharged 2.7-liter engine. Base-model Continentals are front-wheel drive.The six-speed transmission operates with push buttons near the dashboard LCD screen. This layout is simplicity defined, but I hesitated every time I engaged it. Could it be too straightforward? Drive modes adjust the steering weight, suspension firmness, and throttle and transmission response. Altering the modes, though, means diving a couple of pages into the menu.The 3-liter moves out smartly with 0- to 60-mile-an-hour excursions taking a brief five seconds. The muted growl is pleasant. The cabin, aided by noise cancellation technology, is hushed in the expected way.Motoring to the grocery store in comfort mode, the Continental mostly shrugs off big bumps and potholes while quelling float and wallow. No need to shop for Dramamine. In its most athletic mode, the big Lincoln hustles through turns in dignified form. It lacks the athletic dynamisms of a Cadillac CT6, but the Lincoln insulates passengers from rough roads more effectively. Given the current state of highways, the Lincoln arguably provides a better real-world dynamic.Continental doesn\u2019t provide the creaminess of a BMW 5 Series or Mercedes E-Class, but it\u2019s more affordable. The base Continentals begin at $45,645. The fully optioned Black Label edition can rise past $81,000. My tester, a well-equipped Reserve model, retails for about $72,600. It comes with a $4,215 technology package that includes automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, head-up display and semiautonomous parking.The Environmental Protection Agency rates the turbo 3-liter\u2019s fuel economy at 16 miles per gallon in the city, 24 highway and a 19 m.p.g. average. That brings up the rear in this class. At least it runs on standard-grade gas.The cabin has the right ambience for a Continental, though it is on the shiny side. Keep a set of sunglasses aboard; there\u2019s enough brightwork and glossy wood to trim a yacht. Run a hand across the dashboard, though, and it feels rubbery; touch the door pulls and the sensation is distinctly vinyl. Perhaps upgrading to the Black Label level puts buttery leather in those places. For $1,500, you get 30-way adjustable seats. Who knew there were 30 ways to tweak a chair?Of course, the back seat is spacious \u2014 it\u2019s a Lincoln Continental. Equipped as mine was with an $850 climate package, it offers passengers their own temperature zone, toasty seat cushions and a power rear sunshade. Those who are driven should spring for the $4,300 back seat package that adds all sorts of amenities and a richer Bentley-esque atmosphere. (The rear armrest on my car had plastics more suited to a Focus.)The well-trimmed but modest trunk has the same useful size as a Honda Civic\u2019s. Fortunately, the seats split and fold.Team Flakes may be gone for good, but the Lincoln team did a commendable job of returning the Continental to market. It has been updated to meet modern luxury demands. Shunning retro design and a harsh sporty ride, the Continental feels comfortable in its own skin, even if it\u2019s not a completely original one.Advertisement"}

And to advice columnists like Ayawawa, who can detail the techniques for dating and marrying a man.The columnists have their critics, who accuse them of reinforcing gender stereotypes, but the columnists counter that they are simply acknowledging reality.\u201cOur world has been hijacked by political correctness,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cI\u2019m criticized for telling the truth about the differences between men and women.\u201dShe compared managing a relationship to taking an examination. \u201cIf there\u2019s something wrong with the exam, it\u2019s not my job to change how it works, but to tell my followers how to take the exam and score a high grade under the existing circumstances.\u201dMs. Liang wishes she\u2019d paid attention earlier. \u201cThen I\u2019d have understood the importance of a woman\u2019s M.V. and P.U.,\u2019\u2019 she said.She elaborated: \u201cA man\u2019s M.V. is determined by his age, height, looks, wealth, I.Q., emotional quotient, sexual capacity and willingness to make a long-term commitment.\u201d The eight elements in a woman\u2019s M.V. are her \u201cage, looks, height, bra cup size, weight, academic degrees, personality and family background.\u201dAs for P.U., Ayawawa said, \u201cIn human evolutionary history, a man\u2019s great concern is that he cannot be certain if he is the father of his partner\u2019s child.\u201d So she advises her female readers: \u201cDon\u2019t wear revealing clothes. Don\u2019t be always posting pictures of yourself drinking in a bar. Be a lady, speak softly, be modest.\u201dHer suggestions to women include letting the man take the lead. Don\u2019t call him for the first few dates. Don\u2019t have sex for the first few months. In response to one young woman\u2019s request for advice about a suitor, she counseled, \u201cHold back. Make him invest more in you,\u201d meaning both time and money.Ms. Liang credits Ayawawa\u2019s advice with rescuing her romantic life. She\u2019s now engaged to marry.Many of Ayawawa\u2019s fans consider her the personification of the success they crave for themselves: attractive, married to a man she describes as a loving husband, the mother of two children.\u201cChinese schools don\u2019t offer a proper education in love and relationships,\u201d Mr. Lu said in an interview. \u201cPeople get their ideas mostly from TV dramas.\u201dAsked whether he really believed there were rules governing love, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t measure love, of course, but there are some rules that apply to all relationships and social interactions.\u201dHe expounds on some of these in taped lectures he sells online, on such subjects as: \u201cTeaching women to solve relationship problems in a scientific way. Overcoming lingering feelings from a former relationship. Fighting a \u2018little third\u2019\u201d \u2014 a Chinese term for a third party in a relationship.Mr. Lu is also famous for sharing his doctrines on Weibo.\u201cFor women, spending more time with a man deepens her love. But for a man, the longer he stays with a woman, the less he loves her,\u201d Mr. Lu posted this month.He said he wanted to empower women by teaching them to be pragmatists about what they want from men.\u201cIn traditional China, women had an easier life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need to work hard and have a career, though, of course, they lacked certain rights. Feminism has made women\u2019s lives harder, not easier. I\u2019m teaching women how to get ahead.\u201d\u201cBoth of them advise women to manipulate men to gain material benefits,\u201d Ms. Lu said. \u201cThe question is, Why in China is it women who scheme to get men to commit to marriage? Why, when it comes to marriage, are women the sellers and men the buyers? It\u2019s because women don\u2019t have the space to develop themselves.\u201dShe said economic progress in China had not been accompanied by progress on gender relations.\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see, when the economy has produced so many more opportunities, that more and more women believe that getting married is superior to working hard and achieving a successful career,\u201d she said.Ms. Liang shrugs off such criticism of the advice she credits with helping her find a new husband. Sometimes Ayawawa fans meet on weekends to discuss how to improve their M.V. Ms. Liang, for example, is trying to lose weight and improve her makeup skills and is practicing baking.As for the charge that the online advisers promote a backward view of gender relations, she said: \u201cThe differences between men and women are inborn. I take these ideas seriously because I want a better life for myself, not because I\u2019m eager to make the world better for women.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Puerto Rico\u2019s Debt Crisis, Worries Shift to Virgin Islands", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLOTTE AMALIE, V.I. \u2014 The United States Virgin Islands is best known for its powdery beaches and turquoise bays, a constant draw for the tourists who frequent this tiny American territory.Yet away from the beaches the mood is ominous, as government officials scramble to stave off the same kind of fiscal collapse that has already engulfed its neighbor Puerto Rico.Now, a combination of factors \u2014 insufficient tax revenue, a weak pension system, the loss of a major employer and a new reluctance in the markets to lend the Virgin Islands any more money \u2014 has made it almost impossible for the government to meet its obligations. In January, the Virgin Islands found itself unable to borrow and nearly out of funds for basic government operations.The sudden cash crunch was a warning sign that the financial troubles that brought Puerto Rico to its knees could soon spread. All of America\u2019s far-flung territories, among them American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, appear vulnerable.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can say it\u2019s a crisis, but they have challenges \u2014 high debt, weak economies and unfunded pensions,\u201d said Jim Millstein, whose firm, Millstein & Company, advised Puerto Rico on its economic affairs and debt restructuring until this year and has reviewed the situation in Guam and the Virgin Islands. He called the combination of challenges in the territories \u201ca recipe for trouble in the future.\u201dFor decades, these distant clusters of islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific have played critical roles as American listening posts, wartime staging grounds, practice bombing ranges and even re-entry points for astronauts splashing down in the Pacific.The military presence buoyed their small economies, and a federal tax subsidy made it relatively easy for them to issue bonds. Over the years, they have collectively borrowed billions of dollars to build roads, run schools, treat drinking water and fund hospitals.Now the G.A.O. auditors are back, re-examining the debt and repayment ability of each territory, amid concerns that other crushing debt burdens may have escaped notice. An agency spokesman, Fuller O. Griffith, said it would report by the end of the year on \u201cfederal options to avert the future indebtedness of territories.\u201d It is not clear what those options will be.\u201cWashington can\u2019t appropriately manage its relationship with the states, much less the territories,\u201d said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics.Even the states are not immune, despite their legal status as sovereigns. Illinois, stuck in political gridlock, is just days from entering its new fiscal year without a balanced budget, in violation of its own constitution. The ratings agencies warn that Illinois\u2019s bond rating is in peril of being downgraded to junk. Once that happens, as the territories show, hedge funds move in and economic management becomes a series of unpleasant choices.American Samoa, one of the smallest territories, lost one of the biggest engines of its economy in December when a big tuna cannery closed after being required to pay the federal minimum wage. Moody\u2019s Investors Service then put the territory\u2019s debt under negative outlook, citing its fragile economy.In the Northern Mariana Islands, the depleted public pension fund was wreaking such fiscal havoc in 2012 that the territory declared it bankrupt, but the case was thrown out. The government then tried cutting all retirees\u2019 pensions 25 percent, but the retirees have been fighting the cuts, and the fund is nearly exhausted anyway.Even Guam, which enjoys the economic benefit of several large American military installations, has been having qualms about its debt after Puerto Rico\u2019s default.\u201cPuerto Rico\u2019s troubles provide a teachable moment for Guam,\u201d said Benjamin Cruz, the speaker of the legislature, who recently helped defeat a proposal to borrow $75 million to pay tax refunds. \u201cSpending borrowed money is too easy.\u201dBut the debt dilemma is now most acute in the Virgin Islands \u2014 the three main islands are St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John \u2014 where the government has been struggling ever since a giant refinery closed in 2012, wiping out the territory\u2019s biggest nongovernment employer and a mainstay of its tax base.Its troubles began to snowball last July, when Puerto Rico defaulted on most of its debts.In August, Fitch downgraded the Virgin Islands\u2019 debt to junk, citing the territory\u2019s chronic budget deficits and habit of borrowing to plug the holes, like Puerto Rico.More downgrades followed, and in December, Standard & Poor\u2019s dealt the territory a rare \u201csuperdowngrade\u201d \u2014 seven notches in one fell swoop \u2014 leaving it squarely in the junk-bond realm. That scared away investors and forced it to cancel a planned bond offering in January.The failed bond deal meant there was not enough cash to pay for basic government operations in February or March. As a stopgap, the territory diverted its workers\u2019 pension contributions.The Virgin Islands\u2019 governor, Kenneth E. Mapp, said he had no intention of defaulting on any bonds.\u201cI didn\u2019t ask anybody for debt relief, so don\u2019t put me in the debt-relief boat,\u201d Mr. Mapp said in an interview at Government House, the ornate seat of the territorial government, perched on a hillside overlooking the lush palms and bougainvillea of the capital, Charlotte Amalie, on St. Thomas.Still, Mr. Mapp is contending with many of the same problems that proved too much for Puerto Rico, driving it in May to seek bankruptcylike protection under a new law for insolvent territories, known as Promesa. Puerto Rico is now embroiled in heated negotiations over how to reduce its roughly $123 billion in debts and unfunded pensions.When Congress drafted the Promesa law last year, it made it possible for the other American territories to seek the same kind of help.Now, even though the Virgin Islands maintains it has no intention of defaulting on its debts \u2014 and has even given creditors new protections \u2014 the mere prospect of bankruptcy has spooked the markets, putting borrowed money beyond the territory\u2019s reach and greatly limiting its options.In something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, by giving territories the option to declare bankruptcy, Congress seems to have made such an outcome more likely.\u201cThat innocuous provision, when sent to the bond market, said, \u2018Here\u2019s an escape valve for your debt obligations,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mapp said. \u201cThat changed the whole paradigm.\u201dThe problem is that in Puerto Rico, Promesa is turning out to shred the many legal mechanisms that governmental borrowers use to make their debts secure. These include liens and allowing creditors access to the courts.\u201cUnder Promesa, all the security structures are dissolving,\u201d Mr. Fabian said.Investors who thought they were secured creditors before now find themselves holding moral obligation pledges, which are not enforceable.After the Virgin Islands\u2019 bond offer fell through in January, the fuel supplier to its electric authority stopped shipments, saying it had not been paid; the authority was already in court with its previous fuel supplier, which had not been paid either.Then came the House of Representatives\u2019 plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Mapp saw the federal money that the Virgin Islands relies on for its public hospitals going up in smoke.Mr. Mapp scrambled. He reactivated a five-year economic plan that had been languishing and pushed higher taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and soft drinks through the legislature. He fought for a permanent electric rate increase. He got $18 million in new federal funds for health care. He struck a deal to tax Airbnb rentals.He hired collection agents to go after delinquent property and income taxes. He scheduled auctions for delinquent properties. He hired a team to work on the pension system, which is in severe distress, with only about six years\u2019 worth of assets left.Until recently, the pension system was chasing high returns by investing in high-risk assets, like a $50 million placement in life viaticals \u2014 an insurance play that is, in effect, a bet that a selected group of elderly people will die soon. It also made loans to an insolvent inter-island airline, a resort that went bankrupt, and a major franchisee of KFC restaurants. The territory\u2019s inspector general has declared the loans illegal.Mr. Mapp said he hoped to start restructuring the pension system in the fall. Already, he said, the government had stopped diverting the workers\u2019 pension contributions, as residents began filing their tax returns and payments in April. The tax payments eased the immediate liquidity crisis.Recently, he met with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, to discuss possible incentives to attract tech business to the Virgin Islands. And he hopes to return to the capital markets.\u201cThe fact that we didn\u2019t complete the sale in January gives the impression that our market access is constrained,\u201d said Valdamier O. Collens, the territorial finance commissioner.Investors have nothing to worry about, the governor said. For decades, the Virgin Islands has used a lockbox arrangement that makes default all but impossible.Merchants collect sales taxes and send the money to a trustee for the bondholders. Not a cent goes to the territorial government, including the pension fund, until the bond trustee gets enough to make all scheduled bond payments for the coming year.\u201cWe have no access to the moneys before the bondholders are paid,\u201d Mr. Mapp said. \u201cThese moneys are taken out of the pie before the pie is even in the oven. Our debt has never been in jeopardy.\u201dBut in Puerto Rico, such lockbox arrangements have turned out to be one of the thorniest disputes of the bankruptcy proceedings. And Mr. Collens, the finance commissioner, is all too aware that the same dynamic could upend the Virgin Islands, too.\u201cWe know that there has been a contagion effect with Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Collens said. \u201cThe market saw that by the stroke of a pen, Congress could create a Promesa for the rest of the territories.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Election: What the D.U.P. Is, and What It Wants", "Date": "2017-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore the polls opened on Thursday morning, the D.U.P. \u2014 a socially conservative, fundamentalist Protestant bloc that is fiercely loyal to dreams of Britain\u2019s lost empire \u2014 was merely the largest party in a small, inward-looking and mostly neglected backwater of the United Kingdom.On Saturday, Mrs. May\u2019s office said it could \u201cconfirm that the Democratic Unionist Party have agreed to the principles of an outline agreement to support the Conservative government.\u201dThe D.U.P. later said, however, that talks were continuing, and Downing Street clarified its earlier statement to say that the details of any deal had yet to be finalized.An agreement could put the D.U.P., led by Arlene Foster, 46, in the co-pilot\u2019s seat for Mrs. May\u2019s negotiations to take Britain out of the European Union, a process known as Brexit. So as the world strives to make sense of the election and its implications for Europe and beyond, the tiny D.U.P. has improbably become a factor in global geopolitics.Robin Wilson, a commentator on Northern Ireland and European affairs, has a stark vision of the D.U.P. as bigoted, xenophobic, homophobic, isolationist and corrupt.\u201cTheir idea of what Britain is today is so completely out of kilter with modern multicultural Britain and the secular character that it has today,\u201d he said. \u201cThey believe that most of the modern world is morally decrepit and degenerate, whether it\u2019s abortion or gay marriage or even just trying to form any kind of relationship with Catholics. They find these things very difficult.\u201dThe Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971 as a radical, hard-line Protestant political faction in the Troubles, the 30-year-long sectarian conflict that began in 1968. The conflict was mainly fought between Catholics who wanted a republic that encompassed all of Ireland and Protestants determined to keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, along with Scotland, England and Wales.At least 3,532 people, most of them civilians, lost their lives to paramilitary killings and terrorist bombings, with the violence at times spilling over into England and the Republic of Ireland.The party\u2019s founder was Ian Paisley, a self-made evangelical preacher whose virulently sectarian speeches, and sometimes violent demonstrations, helped stoke interfaith tensions in the early years of the Troubles.Yet for all Mr. Paisley\u2019s anti-Catholic rhetoric (which moderated later in his life), the religious conflict that truly defined the birth, growth and eventual triumph of his movement was not the struggle between Protestant and Catholic, but the bitter local rift between rival Protestant traditions.Results and analysis from the British general election.The patrician Ulster Unionist party, which ruled Northern Ireland after its creation in 1922, was dominated by wealthier, gentrified members of the Church of Ireland, the local branch of the Anglican Communion. Mr. Paisley\u2019s supporters came from dissenter stock: Presbyterians, Methodists and evangelical Protestants whose British ancestors colonized Catholic Ireland during the 17th-century wars of religion.His followers were uncompromisingly hostile to Catholicism and liberalism, and resentful of the Church of Ireland\u2019s ruling class, which had discriminated against their dissenter ancestors, yet they were fervently loyal to the military myths of the fading British Empire. These rank-and-file Protestants became increasingly distant from the more moderate Ulster Unionists and from the British government, which sought compromise among all factions.Years later, the D.U.P. proved to be the main beneficiary of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which ended the Troubles. The deal stipulated that the largest Protestant and Catholic parties should jointly share power in Northern Ireland. But it soon became apparent that this would push voters from both sides to the political extremes, for fear of losing local influence to religious rivals.The process appeared to reach its completion last week, when the Democratic Unionists took the last Westminster seats held by the rival Ulster Unionists. (Sinn Fein, the political wing of the disbanded Irish Republican Army, finished off the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party.)For some, this was a poor outcome to a quarter-century of building peace in Northern Ireland.\u201cI think it\u2019s a disaster for Ireland in that we are now back in the old sectarian swamp in the north, with one party effectively representing Protestants and another representing Catholics, and nothing moderate or nonsectarian in between,\u201d said Andy Pollak, a former director of the Center for Cross Border Studies.Others take a more sanguine view of the party. Paul Bew, an emeritus professor of history at Queens University Belfast, said many senior D.U.P. members and party cadres, including their leader, were Church of Ireland members who once belonged to the Ulster Unionists. For Protestants who want to work in politics in Northern Ireland, he says, the D.U.P. is now the pragmatic choice of party.\u201cThey are not Attila the Hun,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing deals with Sinn Fein for 10 years now. Some people who are not paying attention think they are as they were 30 years ago. I\u2019m not saying they are now liberals, but they\u2019ve come a long way since then.\u201dThe D.U.P. has vetoed attempts to bring same-sex marriage legislation into effect in Northern Ireland since a referendum in the Republic of Ireland legalized gay marriage in 2015.A similar law was passed in Westminster in 2013, but the D.U.P. blocked it in Northern Ireland. The party has also blocked attempts to extend Westminster\u2019s 1967 Abortion Act \u2014 which legalized abortion in the rest of the United Kingdom \u2014 to Northern Ireland.Although the D.U.P. supported Brexit in last year\u2019s referendum, few Irish observers, north or south, think the D.U.P. really wants a \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2014 a total separation from European markets and customs unions.This would almost certainly require the reintroduction of border controls between northern and southern Ireland, damaging their economies and perhaps rekindling violence.Beyond that, the price that the D.U.P. would demand for supporting a new British government remained a matter of conjecture.\u201cThey don\u2019t really need anything,\u201d Professor Bew said. \u201cA bit more investment, maybe.\u201dHe added, \u201cNorthern Ireland gets 10 billion pounds a year from the U.K. Exchequer, and that needs to continue. Everything else is peanuts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New History Recalibrates the Villains of the Russian Revolution", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.On the afternoon of July 4, 1917, thousands of soldiers, sailors and workers converged on a former royal palace, a sprawling Palladian structure in the Russian capital, then called Petrograd. The palace was serving as the seat of the Petrograd Soviet \u2014 or council \u2014 of workers\u2019 and soldiers\u2019 deputies, a group of mostly radical revolutionaries that was sharing power with the country\u2019s provisional government. Four months had passed since the so-called February Revolution forced Czar Nicholas II from the throne, and the democratic socialists and liberals who had taken control were locked in a mounting power struggle marked by shifting alliances, palace intrigues and occasional street fighting. Denouncing them as bourgeois \u201cminister-capitalists,\u201d the mobs now demanded that the Soviet take full command of the country.The protesters were acting on the orders of the small but militant Bolshevik wing of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Party, which had been busy propagandizing military units and factory workers. Although the Bolsheviks had called for a peaceful demonstration, their real plan was to seize power in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. With gangs in armored cars and trucks roaming the city, they were already in de facto control. Vladimir Lenin was inside the palace waiting to proclaim a new government. When a leading minister stepped outside to calm the crowd, a worker raised a fist to his face, shouting, \u201cTake power, you S.O.B., when they give it to you!\u201d Others seized him and dragged him into a car. But the Bolshevik plan soon fizzled.Whether due more to a loss of nerve than bad planning, the mobs dissipated and the Bolshevik leaders were arrested. With evidence that they were being lavishly financed by Russia\u2019s wartime enemy Germany, the provisional government prepared to dispatch the traitorous radicals. \u201cNow they are going to shoot us,\u201d Lenin warned his co-conspirator Leon Trotsky before shaving his beard and fleeing to Finland. He would not be seen again in public until the Bolsheviks staged a second coup attempt nearly four months later, this time resulting in the cataclysmic October Revolution, which, according to Sean McMeekin\u2019s estimates, ultimately caused 25 million deaths, radically transformed Russian society and polarized global politics for more than half a century.Striking as the Bolshevik reversal was in July 1917, the provisional government\u2019s response to the failed coup was even more stunning. Even with public and political sentiment turning against the Bolsheviks, Alexander Kerensky \u2014 the ambitious 36-year-old lawyer who had emerged as the government\u2019s leader \u2014 dropped treason charges against them, freed their leaders and even allowed them to rearm. The next time they saw an opportunity, the Bolsheviks wouldn\u2019t pass it up. During the successful coup of Oct. 25, the Red Guards arrested the ministers of Kerensky\u2019s liberal government and seized control. What could Kerensky have been thinking?That\u2019s one of the chief questions posed by McMeekin, the latest historian to tread the well-worn path of revolution scholarship in a new book published to coincide with the event\u2019s centenary this year. A professor at Bard College, McMeekin argues that one of the seminal events of modern history was largely a matter of chance. Well-written, with new details from archival research used for vivid descriptions of key events, \u201cThe Russian Revolution\u201d comes nearly three decades after Richard Pipes\u2019s masterpiece of the same name.Pipes\u2019s monumental work rejected the traditional view of the revolution as somehow the result of social movements from below, characterizing the outcome instead as a coup by \u201cidentifiable men pursuing their own advantages.\u201d McMeekin takes that line further. For Pipes, the revolution reflected the gradual breakdown of Russia\u2019s distinct autocracy, shaped by a centuries-old tradition of collectivism and patrimonial rule, but McMeekin disputes Pipes\u2019s arguments, seeing virtually no difference between the Russian empire and its European rivals. Significantly shorter than Pipes\u2019s study, or Orlando Figes\u2019s worthy \u201cA People\u2019s Tragedy\u201d (1998), McMeekin\u2019s history follows the main events and players, though without much of Pipes\u2019s sweeping context and analysis of Russian and European history.Far from the hopeless backwater depicted in most histories, McMeekin argues, Russia\u2019s economy was surging before the war, with a growth rate of 10 percent a year \u2014 like China in the early 21st century. \u201cThe salient fact about Russia in 1917,\u201d he writes, \u201cis that it was a country at war,\u201d yet he adds that the Russian military acquitted itself well on the battlefield after terrible setbacks in 1915, with morale high in early 1917. \u201cKnowing how the story of the czars turns out, many historians have suggested that the Russian colossus must always have had feet of clay,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut surely this is hindsight. Despite growing pains, uneven economic development and stirrings of revolutionary fervor, imperial Russia in 1900 was a going concern, its very size and power a source of pride to most if not all of the czar\u2019s subjects.\u201dNicholas II \u2014 rightly characterized as an incompetent reactionary in most histories \u2014 is partly rehabilitated here. His fundamental mistake, McMeekin says, was to trust his liberal advisers, who urged him to go to war, then conspired to remove him from power after protests over bread rations led to a military mutiny. Even the royal family\u2019s trusted faith healer Rasputin, the ogre of conventional wisdom, largely gets a pass for sagely advising the czar that war would prompt his downfall.Although McMeekin agrees the real villains are the ruthless Bolsheviks, he reserves most criticism for the hapless liberals. Leaving Kerensky\u2019s motivations during the July events largely unexplained, he only hints at the common rationale for Kerensky\u2019s refusal to prosecute the Bolsheviks: Deeply unpopular among the liberals, he needed the leftists on his side, believing the greater threat to his government came from right-wing leaders aiming to restore Nicholas to the throne. The Bolsheviks, meanwhile, cunningly pursued Lenin\u2019s master plan to \u201cturn the armies red,\u201d encouraging mutinies and desertions with their promise to end the war and redistribute land. \u201cIn view of Kerensky\u2019s impotence, the only really surprising thing about the course of events is how long it took the Bolsheviks to act,\u201d McMeekin writes.Having taken power, the Bolsheviks turned on the unwitting soldiers and peasants who were among their most fervent supporters, unleashing a violent terror campaign that appropriated land and grain, and that turned into a permanent class war targeting ever-larger categories of \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d Unconcerned about Russia\u2019s ultimate fate, they were pursuing their greater goal of world revolution.McMeekin depends on a surprisingly narrow focus to make his overarching argument, eschewing analysis of the deeper social and political forces required for any comprehensive study of the revolution and its lessons for us today \u2014 when radical political groups are again relying on subterfuge and populism to force a fundamental change of the world order. Yes, Russia was rapidly reforming at the turn of the century while its economy was growing \u2014 and revolution was far from inevitable. But there were reasons the empire had so much catching up to do, which involved uniquely Russian characteristics like its sprawling landmass, terrible climate and poor soil. These made scratching out a living difficult, and governing unwieldy. The symbolic role of the boss \u2014 whether in the form of a village elder or the czar \u2014 provided crucial stability for a society in which most saw individual freedoms as a threat to group survival.Of the three-quarters of the population classified as peasants by a government census in 1897, the vast majority were illiterate \u2014 very conservative people with a long tradition of highly centralized rule for whom drastic change mainly in the urban centers was deeply destabilizing. McMeekin leaves no doubt that chance certainly played a significant role in the Bolsheviks\u2019 ascent, but it was no mere coincidence that following the revolution\u2019s dramatic destruction of the ruling elite, the Bolsheviks\u2019 extreme centralization succeeded in re-establishing Russia\u2019s traditional political culture by the 1930s.That pattern repeated itself six decades later. After the Soviet collapse in 1991 ushered in 10 years of destabilizing westernizing reform, another autocratic leader who took power by chance succeeded in consolidating it by returning the country to its longstanding political roots. A hundred years after the revolution, Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia still faces many of the same fundamental problems: rigid authoritarianism, widespread poverty and deeply rooted corruption. Little wonder the Kremlin has been at pains to play down celebration of the revolution\u2019s centenary this year.What are the lessons of this history a century on? McMeekin points to what he calls a resurgence of Marxist-style philosophy, warning readers to be wary of \u201copenly avowed socialists\u201d like Bernie Sanders \u2014 as if right-wing ideologies played no part in the 20th century\u2019s convulsions. This is an especially bizarre conclusion when mounting nationalism and a global shift to the right are threatening the postwar liberal order today. With Putin and Donald Trump again exploiting popular insecurities, the Russian Revolution\u2019s real lesson must surely be that however unlikely their rise, populist tyrants ultimately succeed when rapid social change, even in times of relative peace and prosperity, alienates the masses enough to rebel against their ruling elites.Gregory Feifer is the author of \u201cRussians: The People Behind the Power.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dior Homme Stays in Its Safe Space", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion ReviewPARIS \u2014 A decade into his stint at Dior Homme, Kris Van Assche is plainly doing something right. Even before the days of revolving-door designers, a term of employment that long might have qualified Mr. Van Assche for a gold pocket watch.It happens that Christian Dior spent the same amount of time at the storied house that bears his name. In those years the designer completely altered the history of postwar 20th-century fashion.Mr. Van Assche, by contrast, has effected surprisingly little change, either in the broader culture or even his own style. Season after season he creates commercial men\u2019s wear that alludes to risks he largely sidesteps, makes obligatory reference to a youth culture at some distance from his actual customers and all but shuns color in a house that, more than any other, was built on its magic.Still, the formula must be working. The suits the designer claimed to be reinventing in a monochrome show held inside the bombastic 19th-century Grand Palais \u2014 made over with sod and pendant black plastic fronds to evoke a nighttime field into which some young rowdies are headed \u2014 will most likely look pretty much like those from last season once they hit the selling floor. That must work for the Dior Homme consumer.There were waistcoats over this season\u2019s ubiquitous gym shorts, notched at the sides and cut as high as the ones you wore in fifth grade; sleeveless vest jackets; figure-eight suits seamed to follow the lines of the body; binding tape woven with the rue de Marignan address of Dior\u2019s men\u2019s wear atelier worn as scarves, ribboning jackets, turned into an overall pattern and, in a flash of wit, left as labels sewn on the outside of jacket sleeves.If the familiar is a safe space for Mr. Van Assche, a more adventurous designer like Olivier Rousteing, of Balmain, explores cultural d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a thrilling danger zone. For a show so chauvinistic in its orientation it was a wonder he didn\u2019t screen Jerry Lewis movies afterward, Mr. Rousteing seemed determined to remind everyone of his deeply rooted Frenchness.Yet what does it mean to be French at a time when a brilliant young technocrat is elected president on his promises to restore a flagging economy and mend a fragmented polity? Can the inclusive and modernized country imagined by Emmanuel Macron be found compatible with the nostalgic France the innovative French chef Alain Senderens once derided as stuck in \u201ctra-la-la and chichi\u201d?Mr. Rousteing seemed to choose for the latter in a show whose soundtrack featured hoary tunes by Brigitte Bardot and Serge Gainsbourg and models of either sex strutting the catwalk in fussily ornamented clothes that, even when they overtly referred to Americana, did so in a way that brought to mind Top 40 hits in nutso translation.It was delightful, if mystifying, the designer\u2019s largely monochrome array of leather tunics, semitransparent Breton stripe sweaters, Old Glory tunics, studded motorcycle jackets, steel tip boots and stretchy black jeans with meek peekaboo slits at the knees. As a demonstration of French craftsmanship it was impressive. As an example of image-making it seemed strangely anachronistic, yet another attempt at resuscitating the giddy look of Paris night life circa 1978, when people still frequented spots like le Palace, le Bronx or le Sept. As someone who danced away part of his youth in those very places, I understand Mr. Rousteing\u2019s impulse. Though at 31 he would know better than I, my hunch is the kids don\u2019t party that way anymore.\u201cWe show our women\u2019s here and it feels right to be here for men\u2019s,\u201d Sarah Burton, the Alexander McQueen designer, said before a show of couture-style men\u2019s wear returning the male side of this label\u2019s business to the Paris schedule and its show to a 19th-century orangery set inside the Luxembourg Gardens.Her stated theme was pioneers and explorers, Ms. Burton said, its inspiration some recent travel to Iceland. Summer in the north must be mighty nippy if it calls for quilted puffer jackets, exquisite lipstick-red leather topcoats, fur motorcycle vests bristling with zippers, overcoats of paneled camel\u2019s hair, knitted hoodies, sweaters with elbows made from the heels of socks, or woolen coats inspired by rugs.In Ms. Burton\u2019s supremely skilled hands, endless night becomes day, summer calls for winter woolens and men\u2019s fashion steals a march on women\u2019s. Alongside the usual tra-la-la and chichi of Fashion Week in Paris, a fair amount of blah-blah was heard about the potential merging of the sexes on runways and the end of a separate men\u2019s wear season altogether.If the case that Ms. Burton\u2019s McQueen show made for separating the two were not enough, further assurance came from Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive of Kering, which owns the label, as well as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Stella McCartney, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga.\u201cIf it\u2019s forced,\u201d Mr. Pinault said in the minutes before the McQueen show started, speaking of coed fashion seasons, \u201cboth parts are losing.\u201dslide showslide showslide showAdvertisement"}

Technology evolves very rapidly.\u201dMr. Patchett said the city would have to be nimble, citing a $30 million initiative to promote the cybersecurity industry that was projected to create 3,500 jobs. \u201cIt may be that our vision for cybersecurity in two or three years needs to change radically to focus on other industries,\u201d he said.Other initiatives (several of which were underway) include a plan to promote the creation of freight distribution centers in the city (2,000 jobs) and a $750,000 expansion of a program that connects health care providers with technology companies (1,100 jobs).Many initiatives are long on jargon and short on specifics. A proposed suite of \u201cprogrammatic interventions\u201d to promote the craft beer and alcohol industry contained no estimate of cost or the number of jobs created.Asked how many jobs that position would create (other than the ambassador job itself, which did not count toward the total because it would be a public-sector position), Mr. Patchett and the deputy mayor for economic development, Alicia K. Glen, said that they did not know.\u201cNight-life ambassador is not the biggest job driver,\u201d Mr. de Blasio quipped.\u201cWe do have a number,\u201d Ms. Glen said. But later in the day a spokeswoman was unable to provide an estimate for jobs that would be directly created by the ambassador\u2019s activities.Officials said that they were taking a rigorous approach and would count only jobs directly created by city action. To be counted, the jobs must pay at least $50,000 a year \u2014 or be expected to pay that much eventually.Ms. Glen said that the plan was projected to cost about $1.35 billion, almost entirely in capital spending, over the 10-year period \u2014 but added that the number could change. Tax incentives would also be used to spur job creation, she said, but she was unable to provide a price tag beyond $300 million in tax subsidies designated for a life sciences hub.Mr. de Blasio said the job plan reflected his philosophy that \u201cthe role of government is to make smart investments that build a better society.\u201dDespite the current economic boom, Mr. de Blasio said, New York needs to dedicate tax dollars to creating jobs to ensure that the city becomes a center for emerging fields like cybersecurity.\u201cPrivate-sector folks do key off of government signals and government actions and government investments,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not think that if private-sector dynamics were left to their own devices, we would get there in a highly competitive economic world.\u201dJesse Laymon, the policy director of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition, a nonprofit group, noted the difficulty in determining whether jobs were created as the direct result of government programs. \u201cThe aspirational part was believing that these jobs were all going to be jobs that wouldn\u2019t have existed without city intervention,\u201d he said.Indeed, the city has added an average of about 100,000 private-sector jobs a year over the last three years, and the unemployment rate, at 4.3 percent, is near a 40-year low.Advertisement"}

But now that President Trump has announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, it seems all but impossible.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European commissioner for climate action and energy, denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, brandishing a copy of the agreement as he spoke to reporters in Brussels on Friday. \u201cThe fight against climate change cannot depend on the result of elections in one country or another,\u201d he said.\u201cWe put 28 percent reductions by 2025 as a goal because you could still draw a plausible path from there to deep decarbonization by midcentury,\u201d said Andrew Light, a senior climate change adviser at the State Department under President Barack Obama. \u201cIf we don\u2019t hit that, the whole game plan becomes much harder.\u201dYet even if Hillary Clinton had become president, the 2025 pledge would have proved difficult to meet. Although emissions are falling in America\u2019s electricity sector, pollution from cars, trucks and heavy industry remains stubbornly tough to suppress. Changing that, the Obama administration argued, would require a flurry of new policies to cut emissions and a doubling of federal research funding into newer, cleaner technologies like advanced batteries.In announcing his decision to exit the Paris accord, President Trump scorned the Green Climate Fund. Does the United States contribute an outsize share?But that outcome is far from assured, and experts say that deeper emissions cuts past 2025 will prove only more difficult unless policies for a far-reaching energy transition are laid down today.While scientists are careful to stress that 2 degrees is not a bright line between climate safety and danger, they do note that as temperatures pass soar past that mark, the risks increase significantly, including the destabilization of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, rising sea-levels, more destructive heat waves and droughts, and the loss of vital ecosystems like coral reefs.\u201cAt some point it may become hard to deny that 2 degrees is unavoidable,\u201d Mr. Peters said.

{"Headline": "Otto Warmbier Came Home in a Coma. Travel Company Says North Korea Is \u2018Extremely Safe!\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany questions remain about Mr. Warmbier\u2019s precipitous decline in health, including whether he had been repeatedly beaten, as one senior American official suggested, citing recent intelligence reports, or slipped into a coma after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill, as North Korean diplomats asserted. It is also unclear why North Korea kept Mr. Warmbier\u2019s condition a secret for so long and chose to release him now.But the case has prompted fresh scrutiny of the agencies \u2014 many of them based in China \u2014 that take foreign tourists to North Korea and calls for new restrictions on travel to the country, where three other American citizens are still being held on charges of ill-defined crimes against the authoritarian state.After Otto Warmbier was medically evacuated to the United States, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said the administration was considering restrictions on American travel to North Korea.Young Pioneer Tours is one of a handful of companies authorized to organize trips to North Korea. Its website says it is based in the Chinese city of Xi\u2019an and run by people from several countries including Australia, Britain, China and New Zealand. It advertises \u201cbudget tours to destinations your mother wants you to stay away from,\u201d including \u201cthe first North Korean booze cruise and beer festival.\u201dTroy Collings, North Korea tour manager for Young Pioneer, said his company\u2019s \u201cgreatest wish is for a full recovery for Otto.\u201d While the company wished it could have prevented what happened, Mr. Collings wrote in an email, \u201cwe didn\u2019t see any signs of concern until it was too late.\u201dThe company intended its website\u2019s statement about North Korea\u2019s safety as a reflection of the lack of crime or terrorist attacks, he wrote.\u201cWe believe our current pretour procedures are more than adequate for informing our guests how to have a safe trip, something reflected by the fact we have taken more than 8,000 tourists into North Korea over the last 10 years with only one arrest,\u201d he wrote.But Young Pioneer\u2019s website presents a cheerier view of travel to North Korea than many of its competitors, describing it as \u201cprobably one of the safest places on Earth to visit.\u201dUnlike some competitors, it makes no mention of the United States State Department\u2019s travel advisory that \u201cstrongly warns\u201d Americans against traveling to North Korea because of the \u201cserious risk of arrest and long-term detention.\u201d Instead, the website asks: \u201cI\u2019m American. Is this a problem?\u201d and answers, \u201cNot at all!\u201dAdam Pitt, a British citizen who lives in Dubai and traveled with Young Pioneer to North Korea in 2013, said people on the tour drank excessively and asked inappropriate sexual questions of a female North Korean guide. The company\u2019s co-founder, Gareth Johnson, did nothing to stop the behavior and was also drinking, he added.\u201cNorth Korea is not a budget destination,\u201d Mr. Pitt said by email. \u201cIt\u2019s not a place where you cut costs, and it\u2019s not a place where you want to take risks.\u201dAnthony Ruggiero, a former State Department and Treasury Department official who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said the United States should sanction tour companies that promote travel to North Korea as safe and impose limits on visits by Americans.\u201cNorth Korea is essentially kidnapping Americans, detaining Americans for no real good reason,\u201d he said.Others argue that freedom of movement is an important right, and that tourism fosters mutual understanding that could help ease tensions between the United States and North Korea.\u201cI truly believe that the North Korean people will benefit from any contact they get, however small, with those that come from the outside world,\u201d said Ron Lish, an American businessman who visited North Korea in February. \u201cIt\u2019s my belief that these glimpses of the rest of the world provide them with information that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise get.\u201dAndrea Lee, who runs the United States-based Uri Tours, called what happened to Mr. Warmbier \u201ctruly unfortunate and saddening\u201d but said that tourism to North Korea \u201cis safe so long as you follow the rules of the tour.\u201d\u201cWe have safely taken thousands of Americans to North Korea,\u201d Ms. Lee said by email. \u201cThese trips are often a moving life-changing experience for both foreigners and locals who are able to interact as human beings and gain a different perspective of the so-called \u2018enemy.\u2019\u201dDiplomats say the North Korean authorities generally treat ethnic Koreans more harshly than other foreigners in detention.Cheong Seong-chang, senior North Korea analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank in South Korea, said the North may have decided to release Mr. Warmbier \u201cbefore things got worse, considering the backlash and sanctions it could expect should he die while he was in its custody.\u201dMr. Cheong said that North Korea may be trying to open a channel of dialogue with the United States ahead of a summit meeting later this month between President Trump and South Korea\u2019s new president, Moon Jae-in. By releasing Mr. Warmbier, he said, \u201cNorth Korea opened the possibility of releasing the other American detainees as well.\u201dBut the severity of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s condition, and the mystery surrounding it, complicates the prospects for talks. At the news conference on Thursday, Mr. Warmbier\u2019s father said his son had been \u201cbrutalized and terrorized\u201d during 18 months of captivity.Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center said they found no sign of botulism or of beatings.They said Mr. Warmbier\u2019s brain damage was most likely caused by cardiopulmonary arrest. Based on two M.R.I. scans sent by the North Koreans, they concluded that he had sustained his brain injury sometime before April 2016.\u201cI know you have many questions about what transpired,\u201d Mr. Warmbier\u2019s father said to reporters Thursday. \u201cSo do we.

{"Headline": "ISIS Reverts to Insurgent Roots to Pose Long-Term Threat, Study Says", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Islamic State has carried out nearly 1,500 attacks in 16 cities across Iraq and Syria after they were declared freed from the militants\u2019 control in recent months, providing new evidence that the group is reverting to its insurgent roots and foreshadowing long-term security threats.\u201cPushing the Islamic State out as the formal governing party in a territory is not a sufficient development when it comes to ending the group\u2019s ability to enact violence against individuals in Iraq and Syria,\u201d the 20-page report said.American diplomatic and military leaders say an even greater challenge than ousting the Islamic State, or ISIS, from its self-declared religious state, or caliphate, in eastern Syria and northern and western Iraq may well be the daunting political and economic reconstruction in the years ahead.Counterterrorism specialists said the new study illuminates a trend that has been emerging for several months, as American-backed ground forces in Iraq and Syria have steadily rolled back territorial gains the Islamic State achieved in 2014 and used as the basis for its global appeal to Muslims to come join the caliphate. Now, its strongholds of Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, its self-declared capital, are besieged, and senior leaders have fled as opposing forces close in.\u201cISIS has anticipated the loss of its government for over a year,\u201d said William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cThe ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State.\u201d \u201cThey are prepared to wage a war from the shadows to reclaim it.\u201dThe report\u2019s authors, Daniel Milton and Muhammad al-Ubaydi, say their findings aim to draw a more accurate picture of the military challenges in Iraq and Syria, especially in maintaining security in cities large and small that have been reclaimed from the Islamic State.\u201cDespite all of these positive connotations, the liberation of cities in Iraq and Syria has proved to be much more of a mixed bag for those living in the aftermath,\u201d the report said. \u201cPart of this is the challenge of governing post-liberation areas where city infrastructure has been destroyed and where security threats still remain.\u201dThe report cites the example of Falluja, which was freed by Iraqi forces in June 2016.Many months later, news media reports suggest that residents still face an array of challenges, such as destroyed buildings, live Islamic State munitions buried in the rubble and the continuing threat of Islamic State attacks, the report said.In March 2017, the mayor of Falluja was still living in Erbil, a city in Iraqi Kurdistan in northern Iraq, and traveling to Falluja only on certain days for work.The report draws on Islamic State claims that it carried out 1,468 attacks in 16 cities \u2014 11 in Iraq and five in Syria \u2014 from the time insurgents were driven out of those cities until April.In some cases, violence dropped off sharply once the militants were routed, with the Islamic State either unwilling or uninterested in carrying out harassing attacks ranging from small-arms ambushes to suicide attacks. But in other cities, the threat of violence remains pervasive.The eastern part of Mosul, in northern Iraq, has had the highest number of attacks per month, 130, since Iraqi forces drove out Islamic State fighters. Baiji, Iraq, has the second-highest number of monthly attacks, at 21.Islamic State fighters have employed a variety of tactics against cities they once controlled.Attacks that occur from a distance, employing weapons such as rockets and sniper rifles, were used in 56 percent of all strikes, while suicide bombings were used in only about 5 percent of operations, the report found.In the western Iraqi city of Ramadi, the Islamic State used a large number of improvised explosives, particularly those called \u201csticky\u201d bombs because assailants usually attached them to a car or truck using adhesive.Suicide operations, while less common over all, have been used consistently to terrorize cities after they were freed from Islamic State control.But the relative difficulty of preparing and carrying out such attacks, including finding makeshift armor and retrofitting vehicles with it and building bombs, still makes them a selective weapon of choice.\u201cMore complex suicide bombings, particular those involving vehicles, cannot be assembled on the spot,\u201d the report concluded.Insurgent activity in cities after the Islamic State\u2019s defeats varies in the two countries (more in Iraq than in Syria), with researchers suggesting a correlation between proximity of the liberated city to the front lines.For instance, Ramadi is 32 miles closer to Islamic State territory than Falluja. Falluja\u2019s average number of monthly attacks is just over one, while Ramadi\u2019s is nearly 11, the report found.Researchers also found that the Islamic State maintained the resources and expertise to carry out strikes against areas in which it was defeated, but seemed focused on avoiding operations that would exhaust its strengths in those areas, and on its ability to fight there in the future.Enduring security, however, has not guaranteed political reconciliation. \u201cEven in locations where the Islamic State is driven out and relative peace is restored, difficult political challenges remain,\u201d the report said.In March in Manbij, Syria, the report noted, United States forces intentionally drove through the streets of the city to prevent fighting between the two American allies \u2014 the Turkish Army and the Arab and Kurdish fighters that made up the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Documenta Kassel: Using Art as Their Witness", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byart reviewKASSEL, Germany \u2014 Given a choice between a well-ordered exhibition with a soft center, like this year\u2019s Venice Biennale, or a messy one with some hard, fibrous edges, I\u2019ll go for edges any day, which is why, despite some gripes, I had a positive experience at Documenta 14, the immense international art blowout that happens every five years in this uncharismatic industrial city north of Frankfurt.Good doesn\u2019t mean easy. This Documenta is the first to be divided between two locations, Kassel and Athens. And the German half, I\u2019ve been told by people who\u2019ve seen both, is at least as hard to navigate as its Greek counterpart. In Kassel, it\u2019s installed at some two-dozen sites across town, from malls, parks and clubs to museums. It was common, during the opening days, to run into muddled visitors wandering the streets, clutching maps and looking grumpy.Some art travelers scorn the whole biennial/triennial/etc. phenomenon. \u201cFestivalism\u201d has become a common term of disparagement, and it\u2019s not unearned. More and more of these events feel like tourist bait, like commercial art fairs with a few brains. Yet it\u2019s thanks largely to these shows that, starting in the 1990s, the planetary scope of contemporary art, previously unknown to the Western market, including curators, finally became visible.To a large extent, this remains true. And it\u2019s true of this Documenta, with its roster of 160 participants made up of mostly non-marquee names, and its focus on political issues that Western Europe has recently been feeling the brunt of firsthand: racism, resurgent nationalism, metastatic capitalism and the violence fueled by all three.Kassel, like Athens, is an immigrant city, geographically divided by ethnicity and class. Active in weapon production during the Third Reich, it was reduced to rubble by Allied bombings. And to rev up a postwar economy, it welcomed cheap labor from Turkey, Africa and Eastern Europe. At present, refugees from the Middle East are arriving unbidden. Over time, many transplants have settled in the Nordstadt section of town, with a major thoroughfare, the Kurt-Schumacher-Strasse, unofficially dividing that neighborhood from the city\u2019s commercial core.And a little ways into Nordstadt itself, Documenta has opened one of its largest exhibition venues, the Neue Neue Galerie. Carved out of a repurposed post office, it has high-ceilinged spaces conducive to the big-effects art that international shows like the Venice Biennale sell themselves on. But in this case, spectacle seriously disappoints. Over-scaled painting, sculpture and wall projections feel stretched thin. The smaller work, which requires more time and attention to take in, makes the stronger impression.Many of these artists, like this Documenta as a whole, use art instrumentally, sociologically, to political ends. If you\u2019re looking for a soak in speaks-for-itself beauty, you might as well stay home.With the fate of the world currently at the mercy of a few itchy fingers and unstable egos, and 65 million dispossessed wanderers looking for safe places to land, we have serious things to think about. Art, that soft, silly thing, wouldn\u2019t seem to be one of them. This scattered, uneven, relentlessly unspectacular show argues otherwise. In the end, it\u2019s as good as the time and attention you\u2019re willing to give to it.Advertisement"}

This seems to be something that Australians themselves, separate from me, continue to debate.On Twitter in particular, there was some resistance to the idea that there might be Australian constrictions on creativity, the idea that some element of \u201ctall poppy syndrome\u201d might undermine the expression and celebration of bold creativity that breaks with convention.

Bankstown, SydneyI\u2019m not from Sydney originally and I\u2019ve spent all of my time here in a bit of an inner-city bubble, being fed certain (negative) tropes about what the western suburbs are like. But Bankstown was such a lively and bustling place, and everyone seemed to be out in the sun having a chat and a coffee and browsing all of the amazing food and produce. It really changed my perspective on which parts of the city truly live the \u201cgood life.\u201d\u2014 Niklas van den Vlekkert4. The State of OriginMy most recent memorable Australian cultural experience was seeing New South Wales thrash Queensland in game one of State of Origin 2017.I believe traditional institutions that impart \u201cculture\u201d such as symphony orchestras or art galleries need to start thinking outside the box rather than staying in their traditional box of old tricks ... like playing Beethoven Symphony 6 for the hundredth time to a hall of pretentious old farts. Community engagement and education is the key to cultural enrichment in this country.\u2014 Michael Webb5. South Bank, BrisbaneOne thing that has always intrigued me about Brisbane is the public graffiti-like art that covers wall spaces in and around the city, especially near South Bank. Though when looking at it through the lens of the \u201ctall poppy,\u201d something strikes me, which is \u2014 a good chunk of this art \u2014 on support posts under bridges, on supporting walls that separate a lower road from a higher/hillier residential property or telephone switch boxes are very Australian \u2014 as in, the art may shout, it\u2019s graphic, it\u2019s bold, it\u2019s even provocative. BUT it\u2019s always UNDER something or receding into the larger landscape.While there are plenty of public sculpture examples of art living out in the open \u2014 it\u2019s interesting that the most visually arresting art pieces are in quiet spaces \u2014 you could be on top of them (on the bridge) and never know what\u2019s underneath.\u2014 Ann Strini______A Chinese-Australian of Cantonese heritage, Kylie Kwong, and her restaurant Billy Kwong \u2014 a Sydney institution \u2014 are surely no better icons of Australian multiculturalism. I first went to Billy Kwong for a birthday dinner, convinced I was finally going to convince my sister to eat tofu! At the original Surry Hills location, seated around a small circular table in the Chinese tradition of shared dining, we tucked into a feast that was not only the best Chinese food I had tasted outside of China, but also a phenomenal use of Australian \u201cnative\u201d ingredients.\u2014 Georgia Sands2.

Some snakes have been reported in the media as being up to 175 m long.

{"Headline": "The End of the Left and the Right as We Knew Them", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStewart Patrick, the director of the International Institutions and Global Governance Program at the Council on Foreign Relations, elaborated on these trends in an email:The most salient political division today is not between conservatives and liberals in the United States or social democrats in the United Kingdom and France, but between nationalists and globalists. The victory of the Leave campaign in Britain, the triumph of Trump, and the unprecedented success of Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front (albeit in a losing effort) were underpinned by economic and cultural anxiety that transcended traditional ideological lines \u2014 and a rejection of conventional parties and a political establishment that had too long ignored those concerns.Trump accelerated a realignment in the electorate around racism, across several different measures of racial animus \u2014 and that it helped him win. By contrast, we found little evidence to suggest individual economic distress benefited Trump. The American political system is sorting so that racial progressivism and economic progressivism are aligned in the Democratic Party and racial conservatism and economic conservatism are aligned in the Republican Party.On the surface, the success of the British Labour Party in the elections two weeks ago would appear to stand apart. But Labour\u2019s gains were not based on improved margins in traditionally Labour leaning constituencies. Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party actually lost ground on its home turf, but it more than made up for those setbacks by prevailing in Conservative constituencies.In other words, the Labour Party in England can no longer be considered a labor party in the traditional sense of representing the working class. In this respect, there is a growing demographic convergence between the Democratic Party, the Labour Party in England, Macron\u2019s En Marche in France, the voters who elected Van der Bellen president of Austria and those who voted for the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy in the Netherlands.In each of these plebiscites, education emerged as the strongest predictor of votes for a right populist option, where the less educated chose it more often than those with degrees.According to Stewart Patrick of the Council on Foreign Relations, globalization and the Great Recession of 2007-9 have resulted in a \u201cpervasive anxiety\u201d that providesfertile grounds for populists who promise a reassertion of control and national sovereignty, including over borders, as well as a renewed focus on those left behind in the global economy.Patrick shares with a number of internationalists the hope that Macron and En Marche represent a viable political solution to contemporary conflicts that could be applied in other countries:Macron\u2019s genius has been to argue that he can thread the political needle, by embracing globalization and reinforcing social protections to compensate those exposed to its downside. In the process, he has obliterated traditional parties of the left and the right, while promising a synthesis tailor made for the twenty-first century. If he can bring it off, he will become a model for other leaders to follow \u2014 including in the United States.Even more striking, among all voters, Clinton won 52-42 among the college-educated while Trump carried those without degrees 51-44.The \u201cascendant militant wing\u201d \u2014 a colorful, if controversial, description of the Sanders-Warren wing of the party \u2014 has the moral high ground within Democratic ranks but the votes they want the party to seek are those of some of the least reachable constituencies \u2014 white men and women whose views on immigration, race and political correctness are in direct conflict with liberal idealism. It would be an extraordinary challenge to get these particular voters to join with minorities and progressive activists.Liberals must take seriously Americans\u2019 yearning for social cohesion. To promote both mass immigration and greater economic redistribution, they must convince more native-born white Americans that immigrants will not weaken the bonds of national identity.In practical terms, Beinart writes, \u201cit means celebrating America\u2019s diversity less, and its unity more.\u201dThe hard partis backing tough immigration enforcement so that path to citizenship doesn\u2019t become a magnet that entices more immigrants to enter the U.S. illegally.Beinart cites Karen Stenner\u2019s 2005 book, \u201cThe Authoritarian Dynamic,\u201d in which she wrote:Exposure to difference, talking about difference, and applauding difference \u2014 the hallmarks of liberal democracy \u2014 are the surest ways to aggravate those who are innately intolerant, and to guarantee the increased expression of their predispositions in manifestly intolerant attitudes and behaviors. Paradoxically, then, it would seem that we can best limit intolerance of difference by parading, talking about, and applauding our sameness.Americans, Beinart contends,know that liberals celebrate diversity. They\u2019re less sure that liberals celebrate unity. And Obama\u2019s ability to effectively do the latter probably contributed to the fact that he \u2014 a black man with a Muslim-sounding name \u2014 twice won a higher percentage of the white vote than did Hillary Clinton.What we are seeing now is the replacement of class-based politics, a trend apparent in the United States and Europe. This gives us a more racialized and xenophobic politics, on one hand, and a politics capitalizing on increasing levels of education and open-mindedness in the electorate on the other. If the building of a viable left coalition is possible, it is likely to require some thoughtful and humane co-optation in the form of deference to our limits and boundaries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Considers Rolling Back Obama\u2019s Opening With Cuba", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump wants to announce the changes in Miami as early as June and deliver on a campaign promise that remains a cherished demand for the politically conservative Cuban-American exile community, according to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But he has not made a final decision on the steps he will take because of internal disagreements within his administration over how far to go in unwinding one of President Barack Obama\u2019s most significant foreign policy achievements.Clamping down on engagement with Cuba would be a high-profile way for Mr. Trump to showcase a stark break with his predecessor and to fulfill a pledge, delivered during a speech in Miami in September, to a crucial constituency that disproportionately supported him. It would also enable the president to reward the loyalty of Cuban-American lawmakers who have been agitating for a harder line on Cuba, including Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, both Republicans of Florida.But as the White House has sought to formulate a series of steps for Mr. Trump to announce, a split has emerged over rolling back a policy that many senior officials privately agree has been an improvement on the Cold War dynamic that shaped relations with Cuba in the past. In addition to the revival of diplomatic relations for the first time in a half-century and liberalized rules for trade, travel and commerce, the new approach has paved the way for cooperation in intelligence-sharing, drug interdiction, scientific research and a host of other areas.The dilemma is a familiar one for the president, who built his campaign and political persona around bold, contrarian policy pronouncements like building a wall on the southern border, instituting a Muslim ban and canceling the Paris climate accord, only to see his hopes for quick and simple action scuttled by thorny questions of law and policy, and resistance from the business community.\u201cI am confident the president will keep his commitment on Cuba policy by making changes that are targeted and strategic and which advance the Cuban people\u2019s aspirations for economic and political liberty,\u201d said Mr. Rubio, who has met with and talked to Mr. Trump and his top aides several times on the matter.\u201cIt is my duty to advocate for the issues that are important to my constituents, and I will not apologize for using every available avenue to effectively resolve them,\u201d Mr. Diaz-Balart said in a statement.\u201cThis is a return to the old playbook of creating ambiguity and uncertainty so that nobody knows what is permissible and what isn\u2019t, and it would add another level of legal exposure to doing business in Cuba,\u201d said Robert L. Muse, a Washington lawyer who specializes in American law regarding Cuba. \u201cIt would add one more obstacle to the obstacle course, which is already pretty complex.\u201dReversing it, or intensifying enforcement to require travelers to show evidence that their trips are legal, would probably slow the recent influx of American tourism to Cuba to a trickle, leaving airlines that have started direct flights there with fewer customers to serve.And the president is weighing an increase in funding for the United States Agency for International Development for programs that promote democracy in Cuba, initiatives that the Castro government has long condemned as covert efforts to overthrow it.The changes are far more limited than those sought by Cuba hard-liners, who have pressed Mr. Trump to reimpose all the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration and cut off diplomatic relations unless Cuba, a military dictatorship, quickly schedules democratic elections, institutes an independent judiciary and shows progress on settling American financial claims and returning American fugitives to the United States.Forged in secret by Mr. Obama\u2019s top aides along with senior officials in the government of President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba during more than a year of clandestine talks, the official thaw between the United States and Cuba began with a surprise announcement in December 2014 and was then followed by a series of diplomatic and regulatory changes designed to be difficult to unravel.At a high-level meeting on the policy changes led by the National Security Council in May, officials from a wide array of agencies said they supported continuing the aspects of the policy that pertained to their departments, people familiar with the discussion said, as Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative affairs operation, which tracks the president\u2019s private commitments to lawmakers, made the case for changes.Without a consensus, an announcement that had initially been anticipated on May 20, Cuban Independence Day, never materialized. A White House official said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has yet to receive any recommendations for how to move forward, and while he would like to announce his new policy in June, there is no guarantee that he will do so, and no milestone date driving the process.In seeking to justify his changes on human rights grounds, Mr. Trump would be taking an approach far different from the one he has applied to other parts of the world, where he and his advisers have viewed human rights considerations as an impediment to trade and partnerships that create jobs in the United States.\u201cGiven their complete lack of concern for human rights around the world, it would be a tragic irony if the Trump administration uses that to justify policies that harm the Cuban people and restrict the freedom of Americans to travel and do business where they please,\u201d said Benjamin Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama who negotiated the 2014 announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Cuban and American people want to move forward, and nothing can change that reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Santander Rescues Troubled Rival in Test of Europe\u2019s New Rules", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the global financial crisis, Europe built a system designed to contain the collateral damage from failing banks. That new system appeared to pass its first test on Wednesday, as authorities efficiently dispatched a troubled Spanish lender.The relative lack of drama after the failure of Banco Popular, Spain\u2019s fifth-biggest bank, highlighted the large strides made by the eurozone compared with a few years ago, when the problems of even small lenders had the potential to rock financial markets and raise existential questions about European unity.Bank stocks rose in Europe after authorities in Frankfurt and Brussels declared that Banco Popular was essentially a lost cause and sold it to Banco Santander, Spain\u2019s largest bank. The swift action by European Central Bank and European Union officials defied critics who said a system for winding down sick banks, put into place at the end of 2014, was too unwieldy to deal with a fast-moving crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s very positive for establishing the new banking policy framework,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cIt will demonstrate to a number of people that the framework is working better than many doubters expected.\u201dThe rescue is the first in which the European Central Bank has determined that a eurozone lender has failed or is about to fail. The central bank assumed authority over eurozone banks in 2014 as part of changes intended to prevent banking crises like that of 2008.But the failure of Banco Popular, felled by its exposure to toxic mortgages left over from a housing boom, was nevertheless a reminder that, nearly a decade after the financial crisis, the eurozone\u2019s banking system remains vulnerable.Many banks in Italy, Germany and elsewhere in the 19-country euro area suffer from piles of bad loans, thin capital cushions and meager profits. The woes of banks continue to weigh on economic growth in the bloc.For Monte dei Paschi to qualify for government aid, the European Central Bank must determine that it is solvent. But by some measures, the Italian lender is in worse shape than Banco Popular. Monte dei Paschi fared significantly worse than the Spanish lender in assessments of bank health last year. The central bank could be accused of playing favorites if it clears the way for Monte dei Paschi to receive a taxpayer rescue.The path of the two banks also serves to illustrate the diverging economic fates of Spain and Italy.Spain, one of the countries hardest hit by the eurozone debt crisis in 2010, has since cleaned up many of its domestic banks \u2014 though clearly not Banco Popular \u2014 and taken politically unpopular steps to improve the functioning of the economy, like making it easier for companies to fire unwanted workers. Spanish unemployment is dropping from catastrophic levels and growth is among the fastest in the eurozone.By contrast, Italy is only beginning to institute such reforms, the economy is barely growing, and many Italian banks remain fragile. The government in Rome has not been willing to risk letting a big bank fail and perhaps creating a broad market panic.Italian authorities also feared the political ramifications if Monte dei Paschi collapsed. Without government aid, the bank would be forced to impose losses on thousands of middle-class savers who bought the bank\u2019s bonds. There is fear the public backlash would benefit populist parties and add to political turmoil in the country.In Spain, the government signaled it did not want taxpayers to rescue Banco Popular, even though investors would bear some of the pain.If, as is likely, the European Central Bank allows the rescue of Monte dei Paschi to proceed, it can argue the situation is different than in Spain. By requesting approval to provide capital to Monte dei Paschi, the government triggered different procedures than apply to Banco Popular.Still, Mr. V\u00e9ron of Bruegel predicted that Banco Popular\u2019s collapse would prompt lawsuits by people who own its bonds and are losing their money.The Spanish bank\u2019s problems stem from the large mortgage portfolio it built up during the country\u2019s housing boom. When the European banking crisis struck in 2012, several lenders had to take emergency action, and Banco Popular opted to raise capital multiple times over the next four years.But its mortgage problems mounted, and it reported an annual loss of \u20ac3.5 billion in 2016. In February, it hired a new chairman, Emilio Saracho, to help lead a turnaround.Mr. Saracho set about selling nonstrategic assets and began looking for new ways to raise financing, before announcing in April that his bank might instead seek a merger. He eventually hired outside bankers to organize an auction, but Banco Popular said last week that it had failed to receive any formal offers.Shares of Banco Popular had dropped by more than half in the past week over concerns that the bank would need additional capital as it struggled under the weight of billions of euros in bad real estate loans.Officials at the European Central Bank, which is responsible for supervising eurozone banks, had been closely monitoring Banco Popular. By Tuesday, as it became clear that the bank could no longer borrow money from other banks and was running out of cash, the European Central Bank had determined that the lender was \u201cfailing or likely to fail.\u201d\u201cThe significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due,\u201d the central bank said.Responsibility for winding down Banco Popular then passed to the Single Resolution Board in Brussels, which sold the bank to Santander. The multilayered system had been criticized as too cumbersome, but functioned in this case.The combined business of Banco Popular and Santander will be led by the current management team of Santander Spain with Rami Aboukhair as chief executive, Santander said.Still, while the acquisition averts a banking crisis, it also increases Santander\u2019s dominance of the Spanish banking market and reduces competition, which could eventually be bad for customers.The takeover of Banco Popular comes five years after the near-collapse of a giant Spanish mortgage lender, Bankia. That forced the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to negotiate a huge European banking bailout. In the end, Spain needed \u20ac41 billion of bailout money.Chad Bray reported from London, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt. Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oracle Arena vs. Quicken Loans: Like Night and Day (or Warriors and Cavs)", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCLEVELAND \u2014 Sports arenas for successful franchises can sometimes seem interchangeably generic, all noise and flash and money. But if there are two places that can be said to reflect the character and ethos of the teams that play within them, they are surely the basketball arenas in Oakland, Calif., and Cleveland.You might start with their names: Oracle Arena, named after a multinational computer technology company based in the rich community of Redwood Shores, Calif.; and Quicken Loans Arena, named after a national mortgage company based in downtown Detroit. (Some people in Cleveland call it the Q, but Quicken Loans it is.)As is so often the case with places in California, Oracle is situated right off the highway. It\u2019s hard to get there without driving or using public transportation. In Cleveland, by contrast, Quicken Loans is right downtown, next to the Cuyahoga River.Speak to Warriors fans at a home game, and they\u2019ll tell you straight out how much they love their team and who wouldn\u2019t? Have the same conversation in Cleveland, and Cavaliers fans will answer with passionate reveries about their love for their city, and how city and team are symbiotically linked.They\u2019ll mention Cleveland\u2019s old reputation as a symbol of backwater parochialism and Rust Belt decline, and how all that has changed with a resurgent economy, the improved fortunes of the Cavaliers and also the Indians, and the Republican National Committee\u2019s decision to hold its convention here last year.\u201cBut now the city is really wonderful,\u201d Smart said.The contrast between the two arenas has become only more striking now that they are the sites for this year\u2019s finals. Last Sunday, when Golden State was pounding Cleveland in Game 2 \u2014 the Warriors now lead the series, three games to one \u2014 the mood at Oracle Arena was brash, self-congratulatory, unsurprised, as if the Warriors\u2019 dominance was as much a natural right as the shiny presence of the Teslas, Priuses and Porsches that dotted the parking lot outside.Oracle Arena can have a kind of improvisational feel, as if it just now happens to be home to the endless party that is the world\u2019s best basketball team. But it never lets you forget that its fans live in Northern California, with all its attendant preoccupations.\u201cA lot of people want gluten-free hot dogs or burgers,\u201d said Delilah Gaden, who works at an Oracle concession stand featuring (healthy) grilled food. \u201cOr they\u2019ll ask what kind of oil is in the popcorn, or if we use real butter.\u201d The veggie burgers are the same kind you can get at Whole Foods, Gaden noted, adding, \u201cJust because they\u2019re fans, doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t also be vegetarians.\u201dThat makes sense, said Mark Figueiredo, 46, a businessman and longtime Warriors fan who was buying Chinese food (MSG-free) at Oracle during Game 2 on Sunday.\u201cA lot of people are allergic to gluten,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between the Bay Area and the Midwest. Vegans, vegetarians, fruitarians, pescatarians \u2014 we have it all here.\u201d (That, and Larry Page of Google, who was sitting in front of him at Game 1, he said.)At Quicken Loans, even the food stands were Cleveland-themed. Cleveland on the Rocks was the name of a bar in the concourse, with \u201con the\u201d written in tiny letters, inside the \u201co\u201d in Rocks. Another stand featured \u201cThe Best Chefs in the Land\u201d and their signature dishes, including \u201cChef Heather Haviland\u2019s Reuben Balls,\u201d basically Reuben sandwiches shaped into balls, coated with bread crumbs and deep fried.\u201cSure, people here might ask about the ingredients if they have a peanut allergy or are vegetarians,\u201d said John Kitko, a salesman for a company selling erosion-control geotextile products, who was raising money for charity by volunteering at the Quicken Loans Quaker Steak and Lube concession stand. (\u201cLube,\u201d in this context, means beer.) \u201cBut in Cleveland you\u2019re going to get some nice cooked kielbasa and pierogies.\u201dThe songs blaring from the loudspeakers before Game 3 included \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019 \u201d by Journey and \u201cDream On\u201d by Aerosmith. When the drum fill in Phil Collins\u2019s \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d came on, a whole hallway of Cleveland men began reflexively air-drumming.The Warriors have their share of passionate fans who stuck around during the ignominious years and are now reveling in their current great fortune. But the come-lately fans from the Bay Area\u2019s high-tech world, old-time fans say, have changed the experience, pricing out some of the locals. Tickets for the finals, they said, can easily resell for $5,000.Some fans wistfully recalled the days when you could buy a family package \u2014 four seats, four meals \u2014 for under $100. \u201cIf you\u2019re a middle-class kid, you can\u2019t afford it anymore,\u201d said Albert Blackwell, 60, a doorman in his 17th season as a fan, whose Game 2 ticket was a gift from a friend.At Oracle, people were not spending a ton of time thinking about Cleveland. But in Cleveland, at least in the fans\u2019 minds, the contrast was striking.\u201cThey\u2019re shiny and glossy and fueled by tech money and start-ups,\u201d said Pradeep Giri, 33, a manager at PricewaterhouseCooper. \u201cBut we\u2019re a lunch-pail, blue-collar team. They have Eddy Cue and the Apple and Google execs down on the floor. Here we have the guy who owns 20 car dealerships.\u201d\u201cThe popular television show \u2018The Drew Carey Show\u2019 was set in Cleveland,\u201d you read above one of the arena gates. \u201cCleveland\u2019s Willard Park is home to the world\u2019s largest rubber stamp,\u201d it says atop one of the women\u2019s bathrooms on the main concourse. And down the hall: \u201cCleveland\u2019s own Arthur Lovett invented the first padded bicycle seat in 1897.\u201dAs heartbroken as they were after the loss in Game 3, Cleveland fans said there was no need to lose faith in a city that has more than proved its worth to the rest of the country.\u201cWe\u2019ve had such a good run,\u201d Giri said. \u201cWe won the finals last year. The fact we made it this far, this is gravy.\u201dSo the Cleveland fans streamed out of the Q, dejected but not despairing. Their faith in the Cavaliers would more than pay off in Game 4 on Friday night. And besides, they also have the Indians. (Plus the Browns, a fixer-upper team that managed to win just one game last year, losing the other 15.)\u201cCleveland has an identity, a brotherhood \u2014 we\u2019ve been through so much,\u201d said Joel Bailey, 55, an executive in an electric company. (\u201cDon\u2019t hold that against me.\u201d) \u201cWe\u2019re Charlie Brown, and one day the Great Pumpkin will come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Green Energy Revolution Will Happen Without Trump", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Advertisement\nStates supportingParis agreementCities supportingParis agreementR.I.Del.In the wake of President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, a dozen states and more than 300 cities have pledged to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in line with the Paris targets.The move suggests a possible future for climate change policy in the Trump era: States and cities are taking on the brunt of climate responsibility, building green energy capabilities and meeting ambitious climate targets in the process.There is no replacing the federal role in setting the larger climate agenda, without which the country is unlikely to meet more ambitious targets. But states and cities should still do all they can to fight for sensible climate policy in the absence of a sensible president. In many cases, that work is already underway and shows no signs of slowing.Despite the president\u2019s focus on bolstering the coal industry, the sector faced persistent declines over the past decade. This is important for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions since coal produces more carbon dioxide than other common forms of energy and is one of the leading causes of global warming.Megawatt-hours of electricity production, by energy source2b1.5bCoalNatural gas1bNuclear500mHydro-electricWindOther0199019952000200520102015Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0Megawatt-hours of electricity production,by energy source2b1.5bCoalNaturalgas1bNuclear500mHydro-electricWindOther0199019952000200520102015Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0States have been lured away from coal by cheaper alternatives and an abundance of cleaner natural gas \u2014 market forces that are not easily manipulated by Trump\u2019s policies.

The price of solar cells, for example, plummeted in recent years, allowing states like California \u2014 a role model for climate policy at the state level \u2014 to substantially increase investment in that technology.An analysis by the University of Texas Energy Institute found that for most of the country, natural gas and wind power are the cheapest forms of new energy capacity. But when other factor costs like health, availability of water and government regulations are factored in, solar, wind, nuclear and other greener energies prove even cheaper in some parts of the country. The institute based its findings on 2015 data, and some of those technologies are probably even more cost effective now.Cheapest source of potential new electricity, by county...but that changes when considering local rules, conditions, health costs and pollution costs:If counties were looking to add electricity-generating capacity, natural gas and wind turbines would be the cheapest option for many of them...Solar (large arrays or rooftop)WindNatural gasCoalNuclearNuclearNatural gasWindNatural gasNote: These maps use 2015 estimates for solar panel prices, which have dropped since then.

Trump cited this among his justifications for leaving the Paris accord.\u201cThe Paris Agreement handicaps the United States\u2019 economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country\u2019s expense,\u201d Trump said in his speech from the White House Rose Garden.But findings from the Sierra Club, an environmental organization, showed clean energy account for more than double the number of jobs from coal, oil and gas combined. The growth is led by California, which has nearly half a million people employed in solar, wind and other clean energy jobs.Jobs by energy sector, 2016Clean energy*2.8mOil533.8kGas398.2kCoal160.1k*Includes solar, wind, storage, energy efficiency and smart gridSource: The Department of Energy; The Sierra ClubJobs by energy sector, 2016Cleanenergy*2.8mOil533.8kGas398.2kCoal160.1k*Includes solar, wind, storage, energy efficiency andsmart gridSource: The Department of Energy; The Sierra ClubAt the state level, there\u2019s growing evidence that cutting carbon dioxide emissions can be accomplished while accelerating gross domestic product. The Brookings Institution found more than 30 states have done this in recent years. The process, known as \u201cdecoupling,\u201d has also happened in at least 35 countries \u2014 including the United States.While the G.D.P. rose higher in states where CO2 increased, the ability to grow the economy while reducing harmful pollutants is a reality for many states.

I wondered.And then I wondered, How did we get here?It is a question others are asking, and for many liberal Indians, last weekend was when the vessel spilled over.\u201cHe has forgotten the fundamentals of the Constitution that he was supposed to uphold, which is the right to life,\u201d Mr. Pande said. \u201cThe fact that he did not come out openly and condemn the Dadri murder, that is when I decided this man does not deserve to be here.\u201dThe message seemed to have penetrated the highest levels of government, because on Thursday, in an address at the ashram where Gandhi established his nonviolence movement, Mr. Modi issued a rare condemnation of the vigilante killings. He said that cows must be protected, but within limits.\u201cDo we get the right to kill a human being?\u201d he said. \u201cIs this devotion to the cow? Is this cow protection? This cannot be the path of respected Bapuji,\u201d he said, referring to Gandhi.\u201cToday, when I hear that in the name of the cow someone has been killed, I say the law should take its course; human beings have no right to take the law into their hands,\u201d he said.Unlike Hindu-Muslim riots, which have become less frequent in recent decades, lynchings are not counted systematically in India, nor are the death tolls dramatic enough to register to most Indians as a national crisis.\u201cThey are pretty indifferent,\u201d said Shivani Kasumra, 20, a university student, of her own middle-class relatives. \u201cThey say this is retribution, that they are terrorists, and that they will convert Hindus to Islam. This is a common Hindu sentiment. Somehow they feel wronged.\u201dIn Delhi, the activists gathered on a street set aside for public protest, and they listened as Mohammad Asaruddin, a relative of the 15-year-old killed last week, read a letter in Hindi, which he said contained a last message to the victim\u2019s mother.\u201cDear Ma, I am home,\u201d it said. \u201cYou wanted me to buy new clothes from Delhi, but fate has landed me in heaven, where you don\u2019t have marauding mobs. I am home. Yours, Junaid.\u201dMany reporters had not visited the street for several years, since the vast anticorruption movement that helped sweep the Indian National Congress party out of power. Among the protesters were a number of figures shut out from the new right-wing order, including Swami Agnivesh, a Hindu holy man staunchly associated with Congress party causes; a transgender woman who introduced herself as Vqueeram; and Tehseen Poonawalla, a political trend-watcher and the debonair son of an industrialist. Two hours later, they filed out into the humid darkness, murmuring hopefully to one another about the movement they hoped would grow out of the event.\u201cIt does no damage whatsoever to Modi and his party, because what this protest says is, \u2018Muslims are getting lynched,\u2019 and a lot of Hindutvas out there will say, \u2018That\u2019s the point,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Vij said, referring to far-right Hindus. \u201cSociety at large is turning right-wing. How long that crest is going to be is the most interesting question, and the fact is nobody knows. Not anytime soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Slump in Tech Stocks That Leaves Some Investors Mystified", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe laws of gravity apparently apply to technology stocks after all.No one trigger related to the fundamentals of these companies spurred the snap back. As has been the case for years now, these technology giants sit on trillions of dollars in cash, are growing at a breakneck pace and, compared with companies in earlier tech frenzies, do not have absurd valuations.Yet it has been this lack of an identifiable cause \u2014 a disappointing earnings result or a major investor\u2019s unloading stock, for example \u2014 that has been worrying some market specialists.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dOn Monday, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was also slightly lower, off 0.1 percent.Netflix helped lead the way, declining 4.2 percent. Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.In the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.The declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.To the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500\u2019s return of more than 8 percent this year.The bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.UBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.While traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors \u2014 given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market \u2014 will stick with them.According to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today\u2019s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.Hedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer \u201cFaamg,\u201d substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)Compared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins \u2014 exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges \u2014 that is a very small figure.To a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.In the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.Credit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.In the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Queen\u2019s Speech to U.K. Parliament Outlines Theresa May\u2019s Scaled-Down Agenda", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on Wednesday, Mrs. May jettisoned much of her policy agenda, putting forward a slimmed down legislative program intended to minimize the risk of defeats in Parliament while focusing on Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, a process known as Brexit.Having already postponed by two days the Queen\u2019s Speech to Parliament, in which the monarch outlines the government\u2019s coming legislation, Mrs. May proceeded without an accord with the D.U.P., and in the knowledge that any contentious bill risks defeat.Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s role in presenting the agenda is a significant ceremonial duty. Buckingham Palace announced Wednesday morning that the queen\u2019s husband, Prince Philip, had been hospitalized Tuesday night \u201cas a precautionary measure, for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition.\u201d Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, accompanied the queen to Parliament in place of Prince Philip for a ceremony that was, by British standards, relatively light on pomp.The speech she delivered, meanwhile, was noteworthy less for what it contained than for what it omitted or played down. Those included moves to expand the number of grammar schools, which admit pupils after tests; several promises to remove some financial privileges for affluent elderly voters; a pledge to reopen Britain\u2019s debate on fox hunting; and a push to consider a price cap on energy costs, which appeared to have been toned down.Mrs. May\u2019s next crucial test will be winning a vote next week on the Queen\u2019s Speech.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, promised to use \u201cevery opportunity to vote down government policies that failed to win public support.\u201d\u201cThis is a government without a majority, without a mandate, without a serious legislative program, led by a prime minister who has lost her political authority, and is struggling to stitch together a deal to stay in office,\u201d Mr. Corbyn told lawmakers.While Mrs. May\u2019s medium-term position remains fragile, she is likely to secure some sort of support from the D.U.P. A party with strong Protestant roots, the D.U.P. worries that without its help, Mrs. May\u2019s government could fall and one way or another, power could pass to the Labour Party and its left-wing leader, who has a history of close ties to Irish republicans.It remained unclear whether the D.U.P. would support the government on crucial confidence motions, or would enter a broader arrangement to guarantee the passage of other important bills, including those on finance.Even if Mrs. May prevailed and won approval for the Queen\u2019s Speech, as expected, she would still struggle to pass every piece of contentious legislation, hence her decision to drop some measures that were once at the heart of her political thinking.That approach presents its own perils, however, because the general election failed to deliver an endorsement of the clean break with the bloc that she wanted \u2014 one that prioritizes control of immigration over economic interests.Although the Labour Party accepted the outcome of the referendum on withdrawing from the European Union, it wants to keep closer economic ties to the bloc and it could try to obstruct crucial parts of the government\u2019s exit-related plans.Yet if Mrs. May softens her stance on withdrawing from the bloc to accommodate pro-Europeans worried about the British economy \u2014 including some members of her own cabinet \u2014 she risks a rebellion from leading supporters of the withdrawal.That would include possible successors like Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and David Davis, the cabinet minister responsible for negotiating Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.How long Mrs. May can survive is unclear. George Osborne, the former chancellor of the Exchequer who was fired by Mrs. May last year and is now a newspaper editor, has described her as a \u201cdead woman walking.\u201dFew analysts believe that Mrs. May will be allowed to lead the Conservatives into another election, but there seems little appetite for an immediate contest to replace her.In recent decades some weakened governments in Britain have continued longer than expected, after prime ministers appeared to lose authority. That situation befell another Conservative leader, John Major, in 1992, after Britain crashed out of the European Union\u2019s exchange rate mechanism \u2014 yet he survived until 1997.When he finally did seek re-election, however, Mr. Major led his Conservative Party to a landslide defeat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Kind of Tech Job Emphasizes Skills, Not a College Degree", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byROCKET CENTER, W.Va. \u2014 A few years ago, Sean Bridges lived with his mother, Linda, in Wiley Ford, W.Va. Their only income was her monthly Social Security disability check. He applied for work at Walmart and Burger King, but they were not hiring.Yet while Mr. Bridges had no work history, he had certain skills. He had built and sold some stripped-down personal computers, and he had studied information technology at a community college. When Mr. Bridges heard IBM was hiring at a nearby operations center in 2013, he applied and demonstrated those skills.Now Mr. Bridges, 25, is a computer security analyst, making $45,000 a year. In a struggling Appalachian economy, that is enough to provide him with his own apartment, a car, spending money \u2014 and career ambitions.\u201cI got one big break,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I needed.\u201dThis skills-based jobs approach matters at a time when there is a push to improve the circumstances of those left behind in the American economy, many of whom voted for President Trump.\u201cWe need new approaches, or we\u2019re going to leave more and more people behind in our economy,\u201d said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft.It is unclear whether a relative handful of skills-centered initiatives can train large numbers of people and alter hiring practices broadly. But the skills-based approach has already yielded some early and encouraging results in the technology industry, which may provide a model for other industries.These jobs have taken off in tech for two main reasons. For one, computing skills tend to be well defined. Writing code, for example, is a specific task, and success or failure can be tested and measured. At the same time, the demand for tech skills is surging.In just two years, TechHire\u2019s network has grown to 72 communities, 237 training organizations and 1,300 employers. It has helped place more than 4,000 workers in jobs.TechHire\u2019s mission is partly to chip away at \u201cthe cultural hegemony of the bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d said Byron Auguste, president of Opportunity@Work.Nichole Clark of Paintsville, Ky., heard a radio ad last year for TechHire Eastern Kentucky. The program offered six months of training in software programming that included working with a company while being paid $400 a week. That was not much less than what Ms. Clark, now 24, was making as a manager at Pizza Hut.Without a college degree, Ms. Clark said, her horizons seemed confined to low-wage jobs in fast-food restaurants, retail stores or doctors\u2019 offices. The TechHire program, she said, could be \u201ca doorway to a good-paying job, which is everything here.\u201dAfter four months of taking all-day classes on the basics of writing software and two months of working in an internship alongside Interapt developers, Ms. Clark was hired by Interapt in May. As a member of the team that performs software quality assurance and testing, she is now paid more than $40,000 a year, about double what she made at Pizza Hut.Ms. Clark is growing confident about her employment future. \u201cThere are endless roles you can play, if you have these skills,\u201d she said.In Colorado, Skillful is working to improve the flow of useful information among job seekers, employers, educators, governments and local training groups. The organization focuses on jobs in tech, health care and advanced manufacturing.Ninety companies have worked with Skillful\u2019s staff and partners to refine and clarify their descriptions of skills. That data has contributed to an online \u201ctraining finder\u201d tool \u2014 built by researchers at LinkedIn \u2014 that shows salary ranges, skills required, training programs and nearby openings for different occupations. (Microsoft acquired LinkedIn, a Skillful partner, last year.)Ron Gallegos Jr., 31, has benefited from Skillful\u2019s program. For years, he worked as a facilities manager overseeing cleaning crews in retail locations. Restless, he wanted to pursue a tech career.He had a side gig fixing televisions, gadgets and PCs. But he was self-taught, had no college degree and needed training and credentials.So in late 2015, Mr. Gallegos quit his job to study full time to gain training and certifications as a computer support technician, and later in network security.At his local community college, Skillful representatives offered tips on job searches, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, financial support and networking. At one event, Mr. Gallegos learned of a state grant available for a security course he wanted to take.The program\u2019s career coaches also emphasized the so-called soft skills of speaking concisely, working cooperatively and attending industry and professional gatherings to meet people, Mr. Gallegos said.Not content to just look for jobs, Mr. Gallegos created one for himself, setting up Mile High IT Services last fall. Now he works as a technology-support contractor for small businesses, and his one-man company is gaining traction, with his income exceeding $50,000 a year.\u201cIt\u2019s all pretty bright for me now,\u201d he said.In Rocket Center, where rocket engines were once built and some composite materials for American fighter jets are manufactured today, IBM occupies a few buildings and employs 350 people, including Mr. Bridges. They are working on cloud computing, cybersecurity, application development and help desks.In the last two years, nearly a third of IBM\u2019s new hires there and in a few other locations have not had four-year college degrees. IBM has jointly developed curriculums with the local community college, as well as one-year and two-year courses aligned with the company\u2019s hiring needs.For companies like IBM, which has 5,000 job openings in the United States, new-collar workers can help it meet its work force needs \u2014 and do it inexpensively if those workers are far away from urban centers, where the cost of living and prevailing wages are higher.\u201cIt makes sense for our business, for the job candidates and for the communities,\u201d said Sam Ladah, IBM\u2019s vice president for talent.The company, which stopped disclosing its American employment in 2007 and regularly cuts jobs in declining businesses, declined to say whether it was increasing its total domestic work force.But at the West Virginia center, IBM plans to hire up to 250 people this year, including more like Mr. Bridges.\u201cNow, we\u2019re recruiting for skills,\u201d Mr. Ladah said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Skunks the Democrats", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 YOU know who is really sick and tired of Donald Trump winning, to the point where they beg, \u201cPlease, Mr. President, sir, it\u2019s too much\u201d?Democrats.The Democrats just got skunked four to nothing in races they excitedly thought they could win because everyone they hang with hates Trump.If Trump is the Antichrist, as they believe, then Georgia was going to be a cakewalk, and Nancy Pelosi was going to be installed as speaker before the midterms by acclamation. But it turned into another soul-sucking disappointment.\u201cIt\u2019s Trump four and us zero,\u201d says the Democratic congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio. \u201cI don\u2019t want to admit that. When it comes out of my mouth, it bothers me. But Trump does robo calls. He tweets. He talks about the races. He motivates his base, and he moves the needle, and that\u2019s a problem for us. Guys, we\u2019re still doing something wrong here because a) he\u2019s president and b) we\u2019re still losing to his candidates.\u201dThe 43-year-old Ryan, who failed to unseat Pelosi as House minority leader last year, says that the Democrats\u2019 brand is toxic, and in some places worse than Trump\u2019s. Which is beyond pathetic.The Republicans have a wildly unpopular, unstable and untruthful president, and a Congress that veers between doing nothing and spitting out vicious bills, while the Democratic base is on fire and appalled millennials are racing away from Trump. Yet Democrats are stuck in loser gear.Trump\u2019s fatal flaw is that he cannot drag himself away from the mirror. But Democrats cannot bear to look in the mirror and admit what is wrong.\u201cWe congenitally believe that our motives are pure and our goals are right,\u201d Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, told me. \u201cTherefore, we should win by default.\u201d But, he added dryly: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to run a good campaign. In elections, politics matter. Oooh, what a surprise.\u201dAs Ryan sighs: \u201cIf you don\u2019t win, you don\u2019t have power, and you can\u2019t help on any of these issues we care about.\u201dDemocrats cling to an idyllic version of a new progressive America where everyone tools around in electric cars, serenely uses gender-neutral bathrooms and happily searches the web for the best Obamacare options. In the Democrats\u2019 vision, people are doing great and getting along. It is the opposite of Trump\u2019s dark diorama of carnage and dystopia \u2014 but just as false a picture of America.With Jon Ossoff, as with Hillary Clinton, the game plan was surfing contempt for Trump and counting on the elusive Obama coalition. Heavy Hollywood involvement is not necessarily a positive in Georgia, though. Alyssa Milano drove voters to the polls but couldn\u2019t bewitch the Republicans. And not living in the district is bad anywhere.Democrats are going to have to come up with something for people to be for, rather than just counting on Trump to implode. (Which he will.) The party still seems flummoxed that there are big swaths of the country where Democrats once roamed that now regard the Democratic brand as garbage and its long-in-the-tooth leadership as overstaying its welcome. The vibe is suffocating. Where\u2019s the fresh talent?In a new piece in The Atlantic, Emanuel and Bruce Reed \u2014 who engineered their party\u2019s last takeover of Congress in 2006, the first since 1994 \u2014 argue that Democrats need to channel their anger and make 2018 a referendum on Trump\u2019s record, not his impeachment.In dwindling swing districts, Emanuel told me, Democrats need to choose candidates who are pro-middle class, not merely pro-poor.They can\u2019t just waltz in and win seats held by Republicans. And they can\u2019t go full Bernie. They have to drum up suburban candidates who reflect their districts, Emanuel says, noting that they wrenched back control of Congress by recruiting a football player in North Carolina, an Iraq veteran in Pennsylvania and a sheriff in Indiana.It\u2019s shocking that Hillary couldn\u2019t be bothered to come up with an economic message or any rationale other than \u201cIt\u2019s My Turn.\u201d \u201cHillary never got a real message out,\u201d Michael Bloomberg, who eviscerated Trump at Hillary\u2019s convention, told Anderson Cooper. \u201cIt was \u2018Don\u2019t vote for that guy\u2019 and the gender issue. Whereas Donald had us saying \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 \u201dRyan says Democrats need to stop microtargeting. \u201cThey talked to a black person about voting rights, a brown person about immigration, a gay about gay rights, a woman about choice and on and on, slicing up the electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they forgot that first and foremost, people have to pay their mortgages and get affordable health care.\u201dHe also urged his fellow Democrats to stop obsessing about Trump and Russia and start obsessing on globalization, automation and wage stagnation.\u201cThe crazy thing is that there\u2019s a great opportunity here, because neither party has figured out how to thrive in the new economy,\u201d he said.Carrier and Boeing, where Trump visited to boast about saving jobs, announced layoffs last week, and Ford is shifting some production to China. And news flash for Donald: King Coal has been dethroned.\u201cTrump leveraged his wealth to convince working-class people that he could deal with these changes,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut just saying, \u2018The Chinese rent from me,\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s figured this stuff out.\u201dTrump may be nuts enough to blow up the world. But the Democrats are nuts if they think his crazy is enough to save them.Advertisement"}

What we passengers need are more choices to fly to specific locations. We have those choices on international flights, albeit from major cities.The four major airlines \u2014 American, United, Delta and Southwest \u2014 control most of the flights within the continental United States, and I doubt that the rather small \u201cultra low cost\u201d carriers can significantly affect the Big Four.What we need are a few major international established airlines to be authorized to compete with the Big Four within the continental United States. That competition is what will bring the necessary changes to service, comfort and pricing.To the Editor:Are you wondering why air travel is uncomfortable these days? If so, look in the mirror.The airlines offer a wide range of classes of service: first class, business class, economy plus, economy and now basic economy. Many consumers vote with their wallet for the cheapest available ticket, which is of course the one with the least space per person and the fewest amenities.Buying the cheapest ticket and complaining that the seat is not spacious or comfortable is like going to a supermarket and buying the cheapest hunk of meat and complaining that it is fatty and tough. What did you expect?JAMES G. RUSSELL, MIDLOTHIAN, VA.To the Editor:We remember when flying was fun, when if you called United and it had no seats, the clerks would call American for you to see if it had any available seats. Those were the days when flight attendants went out of their way to be helpful, when meals and baggage were free and there was plenty of legroom in economy.To the Editor:Even as a young child I was skeptical of adults who spoke of the good old days, and have no doubt that the problems Mr. Smith described existed. But nostalgia has little to do with the problems of air travel today.Although the four companies controlling the American market participate in schemes like overbooking flights and outsourcing staff, the real problem is the shrinking power of workers and consumers.Unless we stand up to the airlines, and urge our elected officials to do the same, the airlines will continue to consolidate, rake in billions, underpay their workers and give customers the brushoff.Advertisement"}

Yet prominent media coverage of the story has slowed to a trickle in recent weeks.I understand why it\u2019s happened. Republican leaders have taken the radical approach of writing a major bill behind closed doors, with no hearings, public markups or any of the usual legislative process. It\u2019s hard to cover a story without public developments. Meanwhile, the Russia scandal has offered almost continuous fireworks, with Jeff Sessions\u2019s testimony being the latest.But the media is still making a mistake. It\u2019s our job, after all, to distinguish between the obvious and the important. Russia is both obvious and important.

{"Headline": "Why Boutique Hotels Are So Big in Not-So-Big Cities", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetJane and Greg Hills were visiting New York City when they grabbed a drink in the lobby bar of the Dream Downtown, a boutique hotel in Chelsea. As the full room pulsed with music and guests, the couple had an epiphany: Dream should run their new hotel in Durham, N.C.\u201cWe had been talking to all the major brands, but we wanted someone innovative, creative and entrepreneurial,\u201d Ms. Hills said of Dream, a relatively small company that operates 16 hotels. \u201cThe banks wanted us to go with someone more well known, but Dream was the right match for us.\u201dThe result is Unscripted Durham, a hotel that will have its soft opening this month and the official opening in July in the center of a revitalizing downtown. With its rooftop pool and five restaurants on the premises \u2014 a considerable number given that there are just 74 rooms \u2014 it is the latest in a wave of new boutique hotels in the nation\u2019s smaller cities.The Trump Organization, for example, recently announced plans for Scion, a boutique brand that will open its first location in Cleveland, Miss. And industry giants like Marriott and Hilton have aggressively moved into boutique hotels, sometimes called lifestyle hotels. The hotels usually highlight a property\u2019s unusual architecture or history, have no more than a few dozen rooms and offer special guest services or amenities.\u201cIn this industry, when one person thinks it is a good idea, everyone piles on,\u201d said Jan D. Freitag, a senior vice president at STR, a hotel research firm. \u201cThe industry is firing on all cylinders on the supply side.\u201dThe boutique hotel push is driven by travelers\u2019 increasing desire for \u201cgenuine\u201d experiences, said Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University. Many travelers want something fresh and different, instead of the standardization of the large hotel brands.Expanding beyond large areas like New York and Los Angeles largely comes down to cost. In New York, for instance, construction and labor costs have outstripped increases in room rates, making it difficult to generate attractive returns on investment.Building a luxury hotel in New York costs about $1.5 million per room, Mr. Hanson said, compared with just $500,000 in many smaller cities.\u201cCosts have increased dramatically in gateway markets, and many brands need to continue growing, so they are looking outside the typical cities,\u201d Mr. Hanson said.Websites like Trip Advisor also make it easier for boutique hotels to find and market their rooms to guests. Their reviews and photographs give guests greater comfort in booking these boutique properties, according to Aran Ryan, the director of lodging analytics at Tourism Economics.\u201cThere is also more value in staying at boutique hotels than before, since guests can post their distinctive experiences on Instagram or Facebook,\u201d he said.Marriott, one of the country\u2019s largest hotel chains, is introducing numerous boutique hotels under its Autograph Collection. Known as soft brands, these boutique hotels have access to Marriott\u2019s booking service and loyalty program, but retain their own identity rather than becoming full franchises. The locations include the Empire Hotel in Birmingham, Ala. and the Elizabeth Hotel in Fort Collins, Colo. The company also has a brand of boutique hotels known as Edition Hotels.Hilton, which is pursuing the same strategy with Curio, counts among its properties the Asheville Foundry Inn in Asheville, N.C., and the Hoodoo Moab in Moab, Utah.With so many new rooms, there are some concerns about oversupply. For instance, the growth in a common industry metric, revenue per available room, is expected to slow this year. After rising 3.2 percent last year, it is expected to grow 2.2 percent this year, according to Mr. Ryan.The new level of competition is playing out in Durham. Across the street from the Unscripted Durham is another boutique hotel, 21c Museum Hotel, which has historic architecture and a rotating collection of artwork on display.Ms. Hills, whose company Austin Lawrence Partners is Unscripted Durham\u2019s developer, insists that the two properties are distinct and that there is sufficient demand in the city to sustain them both.The Dream Hotel Group hopes Unscripted Durham will be the first in a string of Unscripted hotels. A second property is scheduled to open in Flower Mound, Tex., in 2019, and discussions are underway for other locations including Phoenix; Austin, Tex.; and Long Island City, Queens.With Unscripted Durham, Austin Lawrence Partners is the developer and managing general partner and will pay the Dream Hotel Group a fee to manage it\u201cIt used to be that boutique hotels worked in the coastal cities like New York, but now the center of the country is also looking toward this lifestyle,\u201d said Jay Stein, the chief executive of the Dream Hotel Group. \u201cWe are excited to become part of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Senators Might Not Realize It, but Not One State Supports the Republican Health Bill", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthOur research indicates that is not the case. To get a sense of support by state, we combined recent polls to estimate support for the A.H.C.A. in every senator\u2019s home state. Our estimates indicate that not one state favors it.We found that Republicans have produced a rare unity among red and blue states: opposition to the A.H.C.A.For example, even in the most supportive state, deep-red Oklahoma, we estimate that only about 38 percent of voters appear to support the law versus 45 percent who oppose. (Another 17 percent of Oklahomans say they have no opinion.) Across all the states that voted for President Trump last year, we estimate that support for the A.H.C.A. is rarely over 35 percent. A majority of Republican senators currently represent states where less than a third of the public supports the A.H.C.A. By comparison, President Trump received 33 percent of the vote in Massachusetts.With this said, it\u2019s hard to know just how politically damaging supporting the A.H.C.A. would be. On the one hand, no major bill this unpopular has passed in decades, but some voters might forget about the A.H.C.A., or change their opinions, by the time some senators face re-election.But the picture of public support is bleak in the home states of many reported G.O.P. swing votes on the bill. In Susan Collins\u2019s Maine, Lisa Murkowski\u2019s Alaska, Mr. Flake and John McCain\u2019s Arizona, Cory Gardner\u2019s Colorado, Bill Cassidy\u2019s Louisiana, Rob Portman\u2019s Ohio, Lindsey Graham\u2019s South Carolina and Mr. Heller\u2019s Nevada, we estimate that public support is under a third, and clear pluralities oppose.With A.H.C.A. support in the subbasement, Republican senators have indicated they hope to make changes to the law. Although we can\u2019t be sure exactly what they will change or how it might influence public support, the YouGov data indicate that Republicans in the House had little success softening the public\u2019s opposition with their own modifications. In fact, support for the A.H.C.A. was even lower in the three YouGov polls after the House made its changes than in the two YouGov polls conducted before it.Advertisement"}

On Friday, he wrote in an email to clients that the organization was \u201cvery confident\u201d the policy \u201cwill not impact the fall trips to Cuba.\u201dUnder the new regulations, individual Americans travelers will no longer be able to visit the island on what are known as people-to-people trips, a popular mode of travel introduced as part of Mr. Obama\u2019s historic thaw. People-to-people trips will now be permitted only for groups and must be organized by a licensed tour operator.Americans will also be barred from transactions with companies run by the Cuban military \u2014 a potentially significant restriction, given that many of Cuba\u2019s branded hotels are managed by a military-owned conglomerate.Exactly how far those restrictions go, however, is unclear. Could a tour organizer rent a bus from a military-run company? What about purchases from a military-run retail store?Tour operators and Cuba experts predicted that the Cuban government would find loopholes. John Caulfield, who was chief of the United States diplomatic mission to Havana from 2011 to 2014, said the government could move tourism assets into the control of civilian ministries.\u201cIn an economy like Cuba\u2019s, they can rename things and change things around,\u201d he said.Still, even if the new rules were workable, travel representatives said, tighter regulation would put off Americans from traveling to a country still struggling with its tourism infrastructure.\u201cWe were finally getting to a point where there was a sense of normalcy; people felt it was legal to come to Cuba,\u201d Mr. Laverty said. \u201cNow this is pushing us back to a point where Americans don\u2019t know if it\u2019s legal. That will dissuade a lot of Americans.\u201dTwo sectors that were left apparently unscathed by the new policy were cruises and flights: Fees paid by cruise lines and airlines will be exempt from restrictions on doing business with the military.The Havana Sheraton announced on its website on Friday that it would require each guest to complete an affidavit at check-in certifying authorization to travel in Cuba. Marriott said in a statement on Thursday that it was \u201cstill analyzing\u201d the policy directive, and its \u201cfull effect on our current and planned operations in Cuba.\u201dThe consensus is that those who will suffer most are smaller-scale businesses that rely on individual travel \u2014 private bed-and-breakfasts, cafes, restaurants, tour guides and taxis. And fewer individual travelers would also affect commercial airlines, who last year began operating dozens of daily flights to Cuba.The company said in a statement on Friday that it was \u201creviewing what this policy could mean for this type of travel\u201d but was pleased that it would be able to continue to \u201csupport Airbnb hosts in Cuba.\u201dBut those hosts are likely to see a decline in demand, travel representatives said.He added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to have an effect.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Ruthlessly Smart Immigration Policy", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIf it seems weird that Mr. Trump would propose Canada as a model for anything, that\u2019s understandable. Americans, especially conservatives, love to mock their northern neighbor: for its accent, its apologetic manners, its food (oh, poutine) \u2014 and above all, for its supposedly softheaded, pinko style of government. And no wonder: With its liberal, tattooed prime minister, its universal health care, its enthusiastic embrace of pot and gay marriage and its generous refugee policies, Canada can sometimes seem downright Scandinavian.Yet when it comes to immigration, Canada\u2019s policies are anything but effete. Instead, they\u2019re ruthlessly rational, which is why Canada now claims the world\u2019s most prosperous and successful immigrant population.Indeed, their contributions go all the way to the top. Two of the last three governors-general \u2014 Canada\u2019s ceremonial heads of state \u2014 were born abroad (one in Haiti and one in Hong Kong), and the current cabinet has more Sikhs (four) than the cabinet of India.But Canada\u2019s hospitable attitude is not innate; it is, rather, the product of very hardheaded government policies. Ever since the mid-1960s, the majority of immigrants to the country (about 65 percent in 2015) have been admitted on purely economic grounds, having been evaluated under a nine-point rubric that ignores their race, religion and ethnicity and instead looks at their age, education, job skills, language ability and other attributes that define their potential contribution to the national work force.No wonder this approach appeals to President Trump. He\u2019s right to complain that America\u2019s system makes no sense. The majority (about two-thirds in 2015) of immigrants to the United States are admitted under a program known as family reunification \u2014 in other words, their fate depends on whether they already have relatives in the country. Family reunification sounds nice on an emotional level (who doesn\u2019t want to unite families?). But it\u2019s a lousy basis for government policy, since it lets dumb luck \u2014 that is, whether some relative of yours had the good fortune to get here before you \u2014 shape the immigrant population.The result? Well, contrary to popular myth (and Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric), immigrants to the United States also outperform native-born Americans in some ways, including business creation and obedience to the law. But their achievements pale next to those of first-generation Canadians.Mr. Trump has spoken about adopting a merit-based system before, and done nothing. And his speech in Iowa was short on specifics (he had more details on his idea for putting solar panels atop his border wall). But if he\u2019s truly serious about reform, the president could do a lot worse than look north for answers. He wouldn\u2019t even have to admit where he got them from. Canadians are a modest, unassuming lot, used to being overlooked and overshadowed. They won\u2019t mind keeping his secret.Jonathan Tepperman is the managing editor of Foreign Affairs and the author of \u201cThe Fix: How Countries Use Crises to Solve the World\u2019s Worst Problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mihai Tudose, Once Accused of Plagiarism, Is Romania\u2019s New Prime Minister", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA little-known former economy minister who surrendered his Ph.D. after plagiarism accusations was confirmed by Parliament on Thursday as Romania\u2019s prime minister, a decision that disappointed reformers.The party\u2019s leader, Liviu Dragnea, is widely seen as Romania\u2019s de facto leader, though he is ineligible to be prime minister because of a fraud conviction.Mr. Tudose, a member of Parliament since 2000, served two stints as economy minister since 2014, but remains a relatively obscure figure despite his time in public service.The appointment of Mr. Tudose and his cabinet disappointed some observers, who had in mind a requirement announced by the country\u2019s president, Klaus Iohannis, for the prime minister to be a figure of integrity and competence.\u201cPlagiarism, fraud, no connection whatsoever with the field that they are supposed to manage,\u201d Oana Suciu, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, said in assessing the new government.In Mr. Tudose, Mr. Dragnea has found a prime minister who is seen as malleable, one who will allow him to lead from behind the scenes. That arrangement, however, could make the government vulnerable to continued infighting among the Social Democrats.\u201cThere is a structural tension that leads to the sort of situation that we saw, the conflict between Dragnea and Grindeanu,\u201d said Paul Ivan, a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center, a Brussels think tank.A case in which Mr. Dragnea is accused of abusing power and instigating forgery will continue in September.But before Mr. Tudose\u2019s government was confirmed, his new finance minister, Ionut Misa, caused alarm by proposing a new income tax. He also hinted at changes to the country\u2019s pension program, only to be quickly contradicted by Mr. Dragnea.Analysts were immediately skeptical. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to raise money from new sources because they promised that they were going to increase salaries and realized that they didn\u2019t have the money,\u201d Ms. Suciu said.Observers predicted that the change in power would have minimal impact on the economy, which relies heavily on funding from the European Union and foreign investment. \u201cWhile the political turmoil is a cause of worry, Romania offers a combination of low wages, a good business infrastructure and consumers with strong affordability, which are usually hard to match,\u201d said Oru Mohiuddin, an analyst with Euromonitor, a market research firm.So far, however, the handling of the new tax and pension proposals suggests that opponents are watching closely and are ready to react. \u201cGiving people the impression that you are going to take the money they\u2019ve saved is never a good idea,\u201d Mr. Ivan said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Resigned to Trump\u2019s Woes, G.O.P. Keeps Working on Legislative Goals", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe\u2019re working,\u201d said Mr. Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, though he conceded that the president\u2019s travails \u201cmake it tougher.\u201dFor their part, his Republicans colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee made it clear at Mr. Comey\u2019s hearing that they had no appetite to confront the president, saving their criticism for Hillary Clinton and spending much of their time focused on the fact that Mr. Trump himself was not under investigation.As they have traveled through the various stages of grief over the unpredictability of their president and the realization that Mr. Trump is unlikely to change, congressional Republicans appear to have landed at acceptance, basically hoping that the president does not get in their way.They have largely ceased defending or explaining Mr. Trump\u2019s more ostentatiously reckless remarks or Twitter posts, and at their most critical they casually chide his behavior \u2014 as did Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who told Mr. Comey at the hearing that Mr. Trump \u201cnever should have asked you, as you reported, to let the investigation go.\u201dThe House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, seemed to chalk up Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to pressure Mr. Comey into backing off an investigation into his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, to the incompetence of a newcomer. \u201cThe president\u2019s new at this,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday.Realizing that Mr. Trump has served as neither a strong advocate for their positions \u2014 indeed he often criticizes them \u2014 nor a focused student of public policy, Republicans are letting Democrats serve as Mr. Trump\u2019s loudest critics while trying to establish the president as inept, perhaps, but not criminal.\u201cIf being crude, rude and a bull in a china shop was a crime, Trump would get the death penalty,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201dWith Mr. Trump still broadly popular among rank-and-file conservatives, Republican lawmakers are uneasy about aggressively criticizing the president and potentially angering their voters. So even while deeply critical of Mr. Trump in private, readily questioning his fitness for office, many of them leap to his defense before the cameras.\u201cTheir calculation is that there\u2019s no percentage in being public,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican strategist and Trump critic. \u201cNow I know what Vichy France must have felt like. Everybody is a patriot after 6 o\u2019clock in the privacy of their own living room.\u201dFew Republicans who were interviewed on Thursday thought that Mr. Trump was immediately imperiled by Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony. But there is growing fear that the drumbeat of questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct, the prospect of a loss in a highly anticipated special House election this month in Georgia, and months more of legislative inaction could debilitate Republicans going into the 2018 midterm elections.In contrast to the Republicans in the capital who offered a defense of Mr. Trump, the party\u2019s candidate in the Georgia House race was far more measured.\u201cI will look at the facts and let the facts take us to where the appropriate action should be,\u201d Karen Handel, the Republican nominee, said in a debate that took place just as Mr. Comey\u2019s hearing began. Ms. Handel, running in a district that Mr. Trump narrowly carried last year, noted that she was \u201cnot an extension of the White House.\u201dRepublicans in blue states are trying to execute even more limb-testing contortions. Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois, who is facing re-election next year, drew attention this month for a local TV interview in which he declined to mouth Mr. Trump\u2019s name and ignored five successive questions about whether he had even voted for the president.How Republican officials at all levels handle Mr. Trump will be similarly shaped by their own political interests, depending on whether they represent the president\u2019s more enthusiastic backers or a more skeptical constituency.Should Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity continue to fall, as it has in consecutive polls over the last few months, some congressional Republicans may reconsider their support, especially if it is not yielding an accomplished agenda. In the long term, elected officials will also care deeply about the findings of Robert S. Mueller III, a special prosecutor investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.But even as his overall approval ratings fall, the president is retaining support among bedrock Republicans. A Quinnipiac survey this week that showed Mr. Trump\u2019s job approval ratings slipping to just 34 percent also indicated that 81 percent of Republicans still approved of the president\u2019s performance.With the economy continuing to add jobs and the stock market growing, most Republicans believe there is little in the short term that could dislodge the party\u2019s grass roots from their support of Mr. Trump. The only caveat to this assessment is if there is a national crisis of some kind.\u201cThey know he understands business and thus jobs and the economy,\u201d said State Senator Jim Merritt of Indiana, a Republican who represents a district in the Indianapolis suburbs. \u201cThey feel that\u2019s why they elected him. But if something happened on our soil, they\u2019d be curious about how he would perform.\u201dFor Republican candidates eyeing the prospect of contested primaries next year, their assumption is plainly that Republican voters expect them to rise to Mr. Trump\u2019s defense.\u201cThe Republican base is strongly for President Trump,\u201d said Attorney General Bill Schuette of Michigan, who is planning to run for governor in 2018. Not so subtly invoking one of his potential Republican rivals who abandoned Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, Mr. Schuette noted, \u201cThe base knows very clearly who was with Trump and who wasn\u2019t.\u201dLocal party leaders, while shrugging off the Russia investigation, concede there is a rising frustration that Republicans have yet to advance their legislative agenda. But in a sign of how much latitude they are giving Mr. Trump, Republican activists are more inclined to point a finger at Congress.\u201cThere\u2019s some frustration with the faithful not so much with the president, but with the House and Senate for dragging their feet on issues,\u201d said Mark Lundberg, who was the longtime Republican chairman in Sioux County, Iowa, where Mr. Trump memorably bragged last year that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan, Short on Babies, Reaches a Worrisome Milestone", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Since Japan began counting its newborns more than a century ago, more than a million infants have been added to its population each year.No longer, in the latest discomforting milestone for a country facing a steep population decline. Last year, the number of births in Japan dropped below one million for the first time, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said on Friday.The shrinking of the country\u2019s population \u2014 deaths have outpaced births for several years \u2014 is already affecting the economy in areas including the job and housing markets, consumer spending and long-term investment plans at businesses.But the real decline has barely begun.About 40 percent fewer children were born in Japan last year than in 1949, at the peak of the country\u2019s post-World War II baby boom. The number had not fallen below one million since 1899, when comprehensive record-keeping began. At that time, Japan\u2019s population was smaller than it is today, but individual families tended to have more children.For some, the latest numbers offer advantages. Unemployment was 2.8 percent in April, the lowest in decades, and construction in Japan\u2019s famously crowded cities has slowed.Yet the prevailing view of Japan\u2019s demographic future is grim.In a speech to business leaders this week, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for a \u201cnational movement\u201d to address Japan\u2019s demographic challenges. The government has taken steps to keep older workers in their jobs longer, and to encourage companies to invest in automation.\u201cThe labor shortage is getting serious,\u201d he said. \u201cTo overcome it, we need to improve productivity.\u201dJapanese governments have been promising to tackle the population decline for decades, but with little apparent effect.Official efforts to encourage women to have more children have had only modest results, and there is little public support for large-scale immigration \u2014 something that has helped to stabilize populations in other wealthy countries with low birthrates.Birthrates have, in fact, risen slightly compared with a decade ago. But with women marrying later \u2014 in part, specialists say, to avoid pressure to give up their careers \u2014 prospects for a more decisive turnaround look remote.And as the population decline accelerates, economic growth will be harder to pull off. How much the population size will fall is difficult to predict, but the basic trajectory is clear, demographers say.Japan\u2019s birthrate has long been lower than what demographers call the \u201creplacement rate.\u201dAs a result, rates have been low long enough that each new generation of potential mothers is also smaller, compounding the downward pull.Individual Japanese will not necessarily be poorer just because the economy is smaller. But some economists argue that traditional definitions of growth and prosperity will need to be rethought.\u201cA lot of the things we\u2019re used to in Japan are really products of an era of population growth, like single-breadwinner families and mandatory retirement ages,\u201d said Takaaki Tahara, research director at the Japan Institute for Labor Policy and Training. \u201cThe mind-set will have to change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley Billionaires Remaking America\u2019s Schools", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedIn San Francisco\u2019s public schools, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, is giving middle school principals $100,000 \u201cinnovation grants\u201d and encouraging them to behave more like start-up founders and less like bureaucrats.In Maryland, Texas, Virginia and other states, Netflix\u2019s chief, Reed Hastings, is championing a popular math-teaching program where Netflix-like algorithms determine which lessons students see.In the space of just a few years, technology giants have begun remaking the very nature of schooling on a vast scale, using some of the same techniques that have made their companies linchpins of the American economy. Through their philanthropy, they are influencing the subjects that schools teach, the classroom tools that teachers choose and fundamental approaches to learning.The involvement by some of the wealthiest and most influential titans of the 21st century amounts to a singular experiment in education, with millions of students serving as de facto beta testers for their ideas. Some tech leaders believe that applying an engineering mind-set can improve just about any system, and that their business acumen qualifies them to rethink American education.But the philanthropic efforts are taking hold so rapidly that there has been little public scrutiny.Tech companies and their founders have been rolling out programs in America\u2019s public schools with relatively few checks and balances, The New York Times found in interviews with more than 100 company executives, government officials, school administrators, researchers, teachers, parents and students.Furthermore, there is only limited research into whether the tech giants\u2019 programs have actually improved students\u2019 educational results.One of the broadest philanthropic initiatives directly benefits the tech industry.Mr. Hastings of Netflix and other tech executives rejected the idea that they wielded significant influence in education. The mere fact that classroom internet access has improved, Mr. Hastings said, has had a much greater impact in schools than anything tech philanthropists have done.\u201cIn our society as a democracy, I think it is healthy that there is a debate about what are the goals of public education,\u201d Mr. Hastings added.Captains of American industry have long used their private wealth to remake public education, with lasting and not always beneficial results.What is different today is that some technology giants have begun pitching their ideas directly to students, teachers and parents \u2014 using social media to rally people behind their ideas. Some companies also cultivate teachers to spread the word about their products.Such strategies help companies and philanthropists alike influence public schools far more quickly than in the past, by creating legions of supporters who can sway legislators and education officials.\u201cWe should be asking a lot more questions about who is behind the curtain,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Mr. Benioff, the billionaire behind Salesforce, had a blunt message for San Francisco\u2019s mayor and its schools superintendent.It was 2013, and the two city officials had approached Mr. Benioff hoping to persuade him to pony up a few million dollars to install Wi-Fi in schools and buy some classroom laptops. But the request seemed too penny-ante to the software mogul.\u201cThat\u2019s when I had to say, \u2018You guys need to think bigger!\u2019\u201d Mr. Benioff recalled in an interview in his San Francisco home. He urged the superintendent to imagine \u201cwhat nirvana would look like\u201d in his schools, if money were no object.With that conversation, Mr. Benioff set in motion a transformation of the relationship between philanthropist and public education. He has emerged as a kind of personal venture capitalist to the city\u2019s public schools \u2014 one intent on remaking a traditional school bureaucracy in Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurial image.Mr. Benioff ultimately pledged $100 million over a decade to the San Francisco Unified School District through his company\u2019s nonprofit arm, Salesforce.org. Unlike conventional benefactors, he is hands-on: School district administrators now submit an annual grant wish list to the Salesforce.org board for review. And Mr. Benioff dispenses not just money, but also management prescriptions.\u201cHe\u2019s almost a public-sector V.C.,\u201d said Richard A. Carranza, who was then the superintendent of San Francisco schools.Mr. Benioff rejected the notion that his approach to education philanthropy was venture-capitalist-like. \u201cWe are not giving them a new religion,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are trying to work with them in a smart way and augment what they are doing.\u201dThe partnership with the district kicked off in 2012 when San Francisco\u2019s mayor, Edwin M. Lee, asked Mr. Benioff to help the city\u2019s middle schools. The mayor wanted to give students a better chance at landing tech jobs. And he wanted Mr. Benioff to pay for it.\u201cI would like to give our kids the opportunity, when they graduate, to see themselves working at those tech companies,\u201d Mr. Lee recalled telling Mr. Benioff.But Mr. Benioff\u2019s \u201cthink bigger\u201d mandate also led to culture clashes. Chief among these: He established a Principal\u2019s Innovation Fund, which awards annual unrestricted grants of $100,000 to the principal at each of the district\u2019s 21 middle and K-8 schools.Administrators subsequently asked principals to select projects that fit with the district\u2019s priorities. Principals have used the grants to start robotics clubs, provide English-tutoring programs for immigrant students and redesign a school library with hangout zones where children can sit with their laptops.Mr. Benioff said he knew that his methods pushed some administrators beyond their comfort zones. \u201cYou\u2019d have the same issue at Salesforce if somebody from the outside came in and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to help you to blah-blah-blah,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBureaucrats would try to stop them.\u201dSo far, Salesforce.org has provided about $20 million to the schools. By hiring additional teachers, schools reduced the average class size across eighth-grade math to 24 students from 33 \u2014 enabling teachers to give more individualized instruction, district officials said.\u201cPeople think school districts are too bureaucratic, can\u2019t be nimble and can\u2019t innovate,\u201d Mr. Carranza said. \u201cWe are proving that this is just not true.\u201dThere are limits to Mr. Benioff\u2019s approach: Most school districts will not be able to secure their own billionaire benefactors. But Mr. Benioff said he intended to keep working with local schools for decades to come.\u201cThis is not just a sea gull strategy where we are dumping a bunch of money and leaving town,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are in the trenches.\u201dThey also share a guardian angel: Mr. Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive.In 2009, he heard about a start-up that used artificial intelligence to adapt math lessons to students. The math program worked a bit like the software Netflix used to customize its video recommendations.\u201cIt is probably fair to say I recognized the power of personalization maybe more than other people, because I had seen it in my own working life,\u201d Mr. Hastings said in an interview at Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles office.There was just one problem: DreamBox Learning was running low on cash. So Mr. Hastings stepped in, donating about $11 million to a nonprofit charter-school fund so it could buy the math platform.Today, more than two million students use the program for supplemental math instruction.DreamBox takes elements from animated video games, with some math lessons populated by aliens that whoosh about and animals that cluck. When students complete a math lesson successfully, they earn points that they can use to unlock virtual rewards.Administrators in some districts said that students so enjoyed the math program that some had begged their parents to let them play DreamBox even during trips to the supermarket. But four parents with children in public schools in Baltimore County, Md., said the program was so stimulating that they had curbed its use at home.\u201cIt really can suck a kid in,\u201d said Brenda Peiffer, a former school counselor, whose son, a third grader, was assigned DreamBox for homework. After noticing that he seemed more interested in spending points to customize his avatar than in actually doing math, she put the kibosh on DreamBox. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing it at home,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect solution for everyone,\u201d she said.And some experienced teachers said it was preposterous to think that algorithms could be better than skilled teachers at adapting to students\u2019 abilities. \u201cWhat you are seeing right now is a heavy push to disrupt and diminish the role of teachers as experts,\u201d said Arienne Adamcikova, a high school teacher in San Mateo, Calif.Mr. Hastings saw it differently.DreamBox Learning tracks a student\u2019s every click, correct answer, hesitation and error \u2014 collecting about 50,000 data points per student per hour \u2014 and uses those details to adjust the math lessons it shows. And it uses data to help teachers pinpoint which math concepts students may be struggling with.Mr. Hastings described DreamBox as a tool teachers could use to gain greater insights into their students, much the way that physicians use medical scans to treat individual patients. \u201cA doctor without an X-ray machine is not as good a doctor,\u201d Mr. Hastings said.Is DreamBox effective?DreamBox is among the minority of digital learning start-ups that have allowed independent academic researchers to examine and publicly report on their data. Still, the platform\u2019s effectiveness is difficult to gauge.Even so, Ms. Woolley-Wilson, DreamBox\u2019s chief executive, described the study as good news, saying it confirmed encouraging reports from teachers. She pointed out that, unlike DreamBox, many other education start-ups lacked research to prove even the most basic assumption: that their apps did not harm students\u2019 educational results.\u201cThat sounds like a low bar,\u201d Ms. Woolley-Wilson said. \u201cBut with the history of education technology, it is not.\u201dMr. Hastings (who is a company director but has no financial interest in the math company) said he was enthusiastic about DreamBox\u2019s potential and predicted wider classroom use for the technology as artificial intelligence improved.Still, he emphasized that he did not view technology generally as a panacea for education. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little cynical and jaundiced about technology,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe tech can help, but it is often oversold.\u201dIf Facebook\u2019s Mr. Zuckerberg has his way, children the world over will soon be teaching themselves \u2014 using software his company helped build.It\u2019s a conception that upends a longstanding teaching dynamic. Now educators are no longer classroom leaders, but helpmates.In public remarks and Facebook posts, Mr. Zuckerberg has described how it works. Students cluster together, working at laptops. They use software to select their own assignments, working at their own pace. And, should they struggle at teaching themselves, teachers are on hand to guide them.\u201cWhen you visit a school like this, it feels like the future \u2014 it feels like a start-up,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told an audience last fall in Peru. \u201cYou get the feeling this is how more of the education system should work.\u201dHe is well on his way to achieving this vision. In 2015, 19 American schools introduced the software that Facebook helped develop. This school year, more than 100 schools use it. Next fall, Mr. Zuckerberg said, he expects that \u201cmany hundreds of more schools will upgrade.\u201dThe effort began a few years ago with visits by Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician who is his wife, to Summit Denali, a middle school in Sunnyvale, Calif. There, classrooms lack walls, and students with laptops often zoom around on caster chairs.Mr. Zuckerberg, she said, admired the software that Summit had created for its schools. He offered Ms. Tavenner a team of Facebook engineers to further develop it and make it available free to schools nationwide.Summit developed its student-directed learning approach after administrators there discovered that their teachers had been so supportive of students, Ms. Tavenner said, that many of its graduates were struggling in college, unprepared to pace themselves or seek help.That is how Summit\u2019s platform came to show students every lesson they will need to complete for the year. They may tackle lessons in any order. At the end of each unit, they take a 10-question multiple-choice test.Not all educators agree. Four former Summit teachers said they found the system problematic. They asked that their names be withheld, saying they feared repercussions for their careers.At Summit, they said, they were required to teach students cognitive skills (like how to construct an argument) while making students responsible for teaching themselves underlying lesson material (like how diverse plants and animals coexist). But some students raced through lessons without actually understanding basic facts, the teachers said, making it difficult to help them structure arguments on specific topics, like climate change.Ms. Tavenner of Summit, however, said that was exactly the point: to make students discover for themselves that they cannot succeed on applied projects without learning the fundamentals.Students think to themselves, \u201c\u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to actually go back and deeply understand it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Tavenner said. \u201cThose are the habits of success that we are trying to instill in kids that simply don\u2019t get instilled in the normal system.\u201dIt can be a steep learning curve.\u201cKids were self-pacing to failure,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.Teachers remedied that by helping students set realistic goals. The school is now happy with the program, she said, and has expanded it to the seventh grade. Even so, Ms. Fisher said, \u201cWe definitely have a concern about the quality of the assessments in the curriculum and whether it actually promotes deeper learning.\u201d\u201cOur hope over the next decade is to help upgrade a majority of these schools to personalized learning and then start working globally as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told the audience. \u201cGiving a billion students a personalized education is a great thing to do.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "For Britain, Political Stability Is a Quaint Relic", "Date": "2017-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In a little more than two years, Britain has had two general elections and a nationwide referendum. Each time, the politicians, pollsters, betting markets, political scientists and commentators have gotten it wrong.Far from settling the fierce divisions exposed by last year\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, the election on Thursday only made them worse.In the early hours of Friday, flushed with his party\u2019s surprising showing, Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, proclaimed: \u201cPolitics has changed! And politics is not going back into the box where it was before.\u201dBut where British politics is going is less clear. Traditional party loyalties have broken down, and the country\u2019s divisions are becoming clearer for all to see \u2014 between young and old, urban and rural, south and north, digital and industrial, cosmopolitan and nationalist.As Britain struggles to find cohesion now on how it plans to leave the European Union, its politics is becoming more and more European. But Britain lacks the common European proportional voting system that allows smaller parties to thrive. This can also lead to coalition governments, requiring political compromise. In Britain, hung Parliaments are the new norm.A year after the referendum to leave the European Union and a week before the scheduled start of negotiations with Brussels on how to do it, Britain has a weak government, a likely lame-duck prime minister and no negotiating position that could command a parliamentary majority, let alone national consensus.European negotiators are ready, the clock is ticking, and a first set of meetings can be easily held around Britain\u2019s divorce settlement. But they know, as Mrs. May must know, that she is unlikely to be the prime minister to see the meetings to fruition, and there is the unsettling prospect of another leadership fight and another British election before March 29, 2019, when Britain is out of the bloc, deal or not.\u201cBritain doesn\u2019t feel stable anymore,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cWe\u2019re a European country, with voters becoming more volatile over time. People don\u2019t have the same tribal loyalties that they used to. Voters are more consumerist, much more willing to switch depending on the offer.\u201dVoters must be wooed by programs and personalities, no longer content with the old, predictable divisions of class and regional identity. Robert Tombs, a historian at St. John\u2019s College at Cambridge, described the breakdown in tribal loyalty this way: \u201cThe electorate is no longer an army. It\u2019s a crowd.\u201dMany governments have achieved stable majorities with much smaller voting percentages. In every election back to 1970, the Conservative vote share, 42.4 percent, would have guaranteed a clear majority. And so would have Labour\u2019s 40.0 percent. In 2005, Tony Blair won a large majority for Labour in the House of Commons with 35 percent of the vote.But each of Britain\u2019s 650 voting constituencies has its own, winner-take-all election, so piling up votes in safe seats is comforting but inefficient. The outcome simply displayed the country\u2019s increasing geographic and urban-suburban divisions.While both parties together received nearly 82 percent of the votes, they are politically further apart now than at almost any time since 1983, when Labour was also more openly socialist. Britain has simply become much more fiercely divided ideologically, with the cross-party consensus of pro-European neo-liberalism in tatters, along with the now derided \u201cthird way\u201d of Mr. Blair, the last Labour leader to win an election, let alone three in a row.Mr. Corbyn has pulled the party back to the harder left, promising more state ownership and economic intervention. His passionate campaign consolidated his leadership and the dominance of the \u201cCorbynistas,\u201d although many Labour legislators fear that a hard-left party cannot win enough votes across the country to regain power.With the British economy already heading into the doldrums, in part because of looming Brexit costs, low productivity and a national debt approaching 90 percent of gross domestic product, the Labour platform frightened the middle class and businesspeople and was, to some degree, a fantasy, given that even Labour leaders did not expect to win the election.Still, despite Labour\u2019s better performance and its success in denying Mrs. May a majority, the party has lost its third general election in a row. With its strong showing among a newer generation, and normal voter fatigue with any party in power, Labour may eventually find its way back to Downing Street, more likely with a minority government. But as now, the party will have difficulty finding willing coalition partners with enough seats of their own to push it over the top.Divisions over Brexit \u2014 the 2016 referendum vote was 52 percent to 48 percent \u2014 were only enhanced by this election. The Conservatives, promising a hard Brexit, with Britain out of the European single market and customs union, garnered votes and some seats in areas like the north and West Midlands, that voted heavily to quit the European Union and gave the U.K. Independence Party large votes in 2015. But that tough stance also put off some who had voted to remain.Labour, which also committed to Brexit but in a vaguer, softer way that would try to preserve free trade with Europe, did well in big cities and the south, which voted predominantly to remain. And it also kept the votes of some former Labour voters who were more put off by Mrs. May\u2019s austerity plans and poor campaign than by their cultural and political discomfort with Mr. Corbyn.In the new media culture, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics, \u201cpeople are switching loyalties, not tribally, but like consumers.\u201dIn the 1950s, some 96 percent of voters chose one of the two main parties, which were class based. About 45 percent always voted Labour or Conservative, and only 6 percent moved back and forth, he said.The two major parties\u2019 vote share fell to about 65 percent in the previous two elections, with the rise (and now the fall) of the Liberal Democrats and UKIP. But the resurgence this time, Mr. Travers argued, \u201cis not just a resuscitation of the two-party system,\u201d but also a sense among voters that they need to pick between them to have some hope of voting for a winner.\u201cPeople are not tribal, but switch loyalties depending on which of the two parties most represent what I want to achieve,\u201d he said, whether the goal be a judgment on Brexit, or foreign policy, or tax or tuition. \u201cThat makes it very complicated for political parties, for pollsters and for political scientists \u2014 let alone Britain\u2019s allies.\u201dBut in the next election \u2014 which could, given the current chaos, come within the year \u2014 \u201cthe voters could churn again, back to another majority party or off to a minor party,\u201d said Philip Cowley, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.\u201cTraditional politics are disrupted,\u201d Professor Bale said. \u201cVoters are no longer so easy to please. And we shouldn\u2019t see this as an aberration. This is the new normal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As with all funding we receive, these funds will be used in line with the humanitarian principles of neutrality, humanity and independence.\u201dUnicef and other humanitarian groups have expressed growing alarm about the rapid spread of cholera in Yemen, the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, where the health care system has collapsed because of the war. A Saudi-led coalition began bombing the country more than two years ago after Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels seized the capital and evicted the Saudi-backed government.The bombing campaign, which Crown Prince Mohammed has overseen as defense minister, has made only limited progress.At the same time, the Saudis have faced growing criticism from human rights groups, which have accused them of indiscriminate bombings and air and sea blockades that have destroyed what is left of Yemen\u2019s economy and worsened the humanitarian disaster there.As many as 300,000 Yemenis could be infected with cholera in the coming weeks, half of them children, Unicef officials have said. Since the outbreak was declared two months ago, more than 1,265 people have died, Unicef\u2019s resident representative in Yemen, Meritxell Rela\u00f1o, told reporters in a conference call on Friday.Mr. Cappelaere said it was the worst cholera outbreak he had seen in Yemen and \u201cjust comes on top of what already was an incredibly daunting situation.\u201dYemen is also facing a famine and a growing population of young children with severe malnutrition problems.Cholera, once a common scourge of poor countries, is a bacterial disease spread by contaminated water that can cause fatal dehydration if left untreated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steady Jobs, With Pay and Hours That Are Anything But", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMirella Casares has what used to be considered the keystone of economic security: a job. But even a reliable paycheck no longer delivers a reliable income.Like Ms. Casares, who works at a Victoria\u2019s Secret store in Ocala, Fla., more and more employees across a growing range of industries find the number of hours they work is swinging giddily from week to week \u2014 bringing chaos not only to family scheduling, but also to family finances.And a new wave of research shows that the main culprit is not the so-called gig economy, but shifting pay within the same job.Monthly swings in income can vary widely depending on how much you makeThis volatility helps unravel a persistent puzzle: why a below-average jobless rate \u2014 4.4 percent in April \u2014 is still producing an above-average level of economic anxiety. Turbulence has replaced the traditional American narrative of steady financial progress over a lifetime.Ever-changing schedules at Victoria\u2019s Secret, for example, make it difficult for Ms. Casares, 27, to find care for her 2-year-old and 6-year-old and to cover the bills. \u201cThe lowest hours I\u2019ve gotten is 15 and the highest I\u2019ve gotten is 39,\u201d said Ms. Casares, who started in October, earning $10 an hour. The schedule is usually posted a month in advance, she said, but there are frequently last-minute changes.Few people can comfortably ride out the inevitable financial bronco ride. \u201cOnly households that earn $105,000 or more a year are secure against the volatility they are exposed to,\u201d said Diana Farrell, the institute\u2019s president and chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the unemployed or the poor.\u201dMiddle-income households, for example, saw their monthly expenses deviate by nearly $1,300, the equivalent of a month\u2019s rent or mortgage payment. And one uh-oh expense \u2014 usually in the form of a medical, tax or car repair bill \u2014 can wreck a family\u2019s balance sheet for a year or more.Even a single month\u2019s volatility can have a cascading effect. One month, a family copes by using the money earmarked for, say, the utility bill to cover the cost of replacing a busted water heater. The next month, it\u2019s the telephone company that goes unpaid as the family struggles to make up the missed utility bill plus late fees and interest \u2014 and so on. Emergencies are not the only source of expense spikes. So are bridal showers, Christmas gifts and outgrown winter coats.May turned out to be an expensive month for Tomika Waggoner, 44, a nursing home aide in Newport, Ky. Her daughter was graduating from high school, and she needed a few hundred dollars to pay for her cap and gown, commencement fees, a prom ticket and a dress.Ms. Waggoner\u2019s work schedule depends on her ability to find care for her 15-year-old son, who has epilepsy. So sometimes she works a weekend at $17 an hour and sometimes three $15-an-hour weekdays.For the Waggoner family, and many others with low and moderate incomes, a tax refund offered a once-a-year lifeline. That $700 check and a contribution from her mother covered most of the graduation costs and helped pay off the debt on some furniture. (Doctor\u2019s visits and medical payments are frequently scheduled to coincide with tax refunds, according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute.)\u201cI also went to a couple of food pantries,\u201d Ms. Waggoner added. \u201cWe ate a lot of bologna.\u201dRather than causing jolts in income, the gig economy is, for many people, what smooths them out. Only about 0.5 percent of the labor force is working in the gig economy. And while bonuses, extra commissions and overtime bump up a worker\u2019s average income, unwelcome reductions in hours, particularly at the lower end of the income ladder, more often shrink an expected paycheck.\u201cStable, predictable work schedules are essential to economic security,\u201d said Susan J. Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago who is studying new data supplied by the General Social Survey, a respected national survey that began asking in-depth questions about work schedules only last year.The latest data shows that 41 percent of all hourly workers say they are not given more than a week\u2019s notice of their schedule; nearly half have little or no say on their work hours.\u201cIt\u2019s not just service, or female-dominated jobs, but some of the most challenging schedules are production and construction jobs,\u201d Ms. Lambert said.The ubiquity of the phenomenon has frequently been masked by annual measures of income and spending or one-time snapshots of savings and debt that fail to capture fluctuations week to week or month to month.Ms. Casares said that when she had to turn down an inconvenient shift at Victoria\u2019s Secret, like staying until midnight to close, her schedule the following week would suffer. \u201cI would be facing fewer hours,\u201d she said.To supplement the light weeks, Ms. Casares started picking up a shift as a part-time server at Olive Garden ($5.39 an hour plus tips).To Mr. Morduch and his co-author, Rachel Schneider, the rise in income volatility is an indication of how businesses in an era of advancing technology and global competition have shifted risk onto employees.Consider the cost of saving for retirement and medical care. When health insurance premiums for employers soared between 2003 and 2013 (before the Affordable Care Act went into effect), workers picked up 93 percent of the extra cost.Asked whether her job at Victoria\u2019s Secret provided benefits, Ms. Casares said it did: \u201cWe\u2019re given three bras and a bottle of Bombshell, their No. 1 selling perfume.\u201d Health or retirement contributions are not part of the package.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hard Life Among the Dead in the Philippines", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispatch From ManilaMANILA \u2014 Manila North Cemetery, opened in 1904, is one of the oldest and largest in the Philippines. Its elaborate mausoleums and endless rows of humble, stacked tombs are home to an estimated one million of the dead \u2014 and a few thousand of the living.The final resting place of presidents, movie stars and literary icons, the cemetery is also inhabited by some of Manila\u2019s poorest people. Many live in the crypts and mausoleums of wealthy families, who pay them a stipend to clean and watch over them.Others find different ways to engage the economy of death and burial. \u201cThere is really no work here inside the cemetery, so I taught myself how to do this in 2007,\u201d Ferdinand Zapata, 39, said as he chiseled the name of a dead man into an ornate marble headstone.\u201cThis is the best job in the cemetery because you don\u2019t have a boss,\u201d said Mr. Zapata, who grew up in the cemetery and has raised two children here. \u201cThe masons who make the niches and mausoleums can earn more, though.\u201dAs many as a quarter of Manila\u2019s 12 million people are \u201cinformal settlers.\u201d Those in the cemetery prefer its relative quiet and safety to the city\u2019s dangerous shantytowns. The resourcefulness needed to live a life of such insecurity is on full display here.In mausoleums, and in makeshift structures built over tombs, families go about their days. They chat, play cards and watch soap operas on TVs mounted near headstones or ornamental crosses.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s difficult living here,\u201d said Jane de Asis, 26, who lives in a classically designed mausoleum with a son, two sisters, her sisters\u2019 children and her mother, who is paid to take care of it. \u201cWe don\u2019t always have electricity and have no running water. It\u2019s especially hard in the summer, when it\u2019s so hot.\u201dAt night, people sleep on the tombs. The thought of that may be jarring, but for the residents it is a practical choice. And many in this devoutly religious country see the boundary between the living and the dead as porous.Isidro Gonzalez, 74, likes to talk to his mother, he said as he sat with his back to her tomb, working on a crossword puzzle. \u201cMaybe she can answer me, but so far, she has not!\u201dElectricity in these converted homes is jury-rigged, and most residents don\u2019t have running water. At the few public wells, people line up with carts loaded with empty water bottles, waiting to fill them up.Amid all of this, the normal business of a cemetery goes on. On a busy day there can be as many as 80 funerals.Some cemetery residents, like the 54-year-old man who calls himself Father Ramona, are paid by visiting families to lead prayers at a grave. Father Ramona sometimes wears a T-shirt bearing the face of Jesus.The cemetery is so dense with tombs and crypts that a hearse often can\u2019t reach its destination. Mourners must then carry the coffin the rest of the way, clambering over other tombs and through passageways between mausoleums.Glen Bale\u00f1a, 26, was interred on a Sunday, which is always a busy day. Mr. Bale\u00f1a died of a brain infection, his relatives said.Tombs are generally rented for five years. After that, if the relatives stop paying, the cemetery administrators will exhume the remains, after a grace period. Discarded bags of skulls and bones, some tangled in the threads of the clothes they were buried in, are a common sight.People leave offerings of snacks, drinks and sometimes cigarettes at their relatives\u2019 gravesides. Family members can often be seen there, saying prayers, lighting candles or just chatting.On a recent morning, the acrid smell of burning methamphetamine \u2014 or shabu, as Filipinos call it \u2014 wafted through a remote corner of the cemetery. It led to a middle-aged woman smoking the drug from a piece of foil, as her daughter held a newborn. Teenage boys nearby slept off their highs on tombstones or in hammocks.Residents say drug use and crime have been on the rise in recent years; Mr. Zapata, the headstone carver, dated it to roughly 2000, when slum clearance nearby led to a wave of new residents. President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s bloody crackdown on drug dealers and addicts has also been felt at Manila North. In September, three men were killed here in what the police called an antidrug sting operation; they were said to have been trying to sell $10 worth of shabu.Virginia Javier, 90, said residents now locked the gates to their tombs, which wasn\u2019t the case several years ago. \u201cSince Duterte become president, every time there is a police raid here I go home to my children, usually,\u201d Mrs. Javier said as she tended potted plants outside one of the 10 mausoleums she is paid to take care of. As dusk fell, many people advised an interpreter and me to leave, saying it wasn\u2019t safe to be walking around after dark.During the day, new homes are built from modest tombs, as workers add makeshift concrete walls and roofs of corrugated iron, often scavenged from somewhere else.The dead are a constant presence here, in one way or another. \u201cWhen there are moments that I hear noises or voices, I just keep quiet, and I know it is the voices of the dead,\u201d Mrs. Javier said. Her husband, Felix, said ghosts were \u201cjust something you see in the movies.\u201dThe cemetery\u2019s many children, playing happily among the tombs, seem unconcerned about ghosts.Here and there are makeshift stores, selling snacks and basic necessities like soap. They also sell candles, for visitors who want to pay their respects at the grave of a loved one.Some of the stalls have karaoke machines, which are popular in the evenings.As the heat of the day dies away, boys and young men play basketball on improvised courts, or a version of billiards that\u2019s popular in the slums of the Philippines.Night often finds Mr. Gonzalez, the 74-year-old who was working on a crossword in his family crypt, sleeping there. But he is not a resident \u2014 he owns a condominium in Manila. His neighborhood, though, is more dangerous than the cemetery. As he put it, \u201cThe dead can\u2019t harm you.\u201dDispatch From ManilaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Both Climate Leader and Oil Giant? A Norwegian Paradox", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSLO \u2014 On an unseasonably warm day in May, Norway\u2019s climate minister, Vidar Helgesen, strolled through a vast parking lot for electric cars, counting Teslas.\u201cTwo, three, four, five,\u201d the minister marveled. And that was just one aisle.There are big perks to buying a Tesla \u2014 or any electric car \u2014 in Norway. The government waives the high taxes it imposes on sales of other cars. It lets electric cars cruise up bus lanes. Toll roads are free. Parking lots like this one offer a free charge, and new charging stations are being built on the nation\u2019s highways.In fact, Norway hopes that only electric cars will be sold in the country by 2025 \u2014 a surprising goal, given that it means kicking the nation\u2019s powerful oil industry in the shins.But Norway\u2019s big electric push on cars does not mean the nation is abandoning fossil fuels, revealing what critics call a notable contradiction in its climate policy.Spurred by attractive state subsidies, the Norwegian oil company Statoil is chasing after new oil and gas fields in the Arctic. Nearly all of the supply is destined for export \u2014 and to show up in the carbon emissions of countries that burn Norwegian oil and gas.As governments wrestle over what they should do to keep the planet from heating up to dangerous levels, critics contend that Norway should curb the supply of fossil fuels, rather than just trimming demand among its own people.It\u2019s one of the problems built into the Paris climate accord that President Trump promises to leave, Mr. Erickson argued: Countries are measured by how much they reduce their own emissions, within their own borders, not by the impact they have on the planet as a whole.And while there may be a global effort under the Paris agreement to reduce emissions, that certainly has not stopped the international race for Arctic oil. Norway is in the vanguard of that scramble, trailed by Russia, Canada and the United States.In May, Statoil began work on five new exploration wells in the Barents Sea, and the company is bullish on the prospects. It says that it explores only in ice-free waters. (Cleaning up an oil spill in ice is next to impossible, environmentalists say.)\u201cThere will be demand for oil and gas even in a 2-degree scenario going forward,\u201d Mr. Eek said.In any case, he pointed out, it can trade its emissions allowances across Europe, as part of the European Union\u2019s emissions cap-and-trade system, meant to create incentives to reduce a company\u2019s carbon footprint.\u201cThe world might not need our oil,\u201d she said.Oil drilling can be a politically contentious topic for Norwegians. A proposal to explore for oil near the Lofoten Islands, an ecologically sensitive cod breeding ground, was bitterly opposed by environmentalists and fishermen \u2014 and shelved until after national elections this fall.On a recent bright, hot day \u2014 \u201cThis would be a great day in July, and it\u2019s only May,\u201d said Norway\u2019s environment minister, Mr. Helgesen \u2014 the minister emphasized that his country was aggressively trying to curb demand for oil and gas. He drives an electric Volkswagen Golf. It can carry on for nearly 100 miles on a full charge, though in the bitter Norwegian winters, he concedes, it conks out much sooner.Mr. Helgesen hopes there will soon be a pilot project with an electric-powered passenger plane to handle a short-distance flight in the north of the country. With stepped-up demand for electric vehicles, he says battery companies are finding Norway an attractive destination.Norway has sought to reduce its carbon footprint in other ways, too. It has divested its enormous sovereign wealth fund from coal. It donates heavily to a global fund to save forests. It was one of the first countries to sign the Paris deal, alongside France itself.Now, Mr. Helgesen says his country is facing the inevitable. \u201cWe are readily saying, \u2018Oil and gas will not be the driver of our economy in the future,\u2019\u201d he argued. \u201cWhile we are still drilling, we are identifying ways to build more legs for the Norwegian economy to stand on.\u201dThat is an existential challenge for the country. The oil industry is politically powerful. Oil exports create wealth. Oil drilling creates jobs. Passing up opportunities in the shallow waters of the warming Arctic is difficult.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "C.E.O.s Say They\u2019re Confident, but Merger Numbers Don\u2019t Lie", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookYet there is a remarkable divergence between what chief executives have been saying aloud and what they are actually doing in practice. They may not be as confident as they say they are.On Wall Street, there is one barometer that is considered the ultimate truth serum when it comes to reflecting C.E.O. confidence: merger and acquisition activity.Corporate chieftains do deals when they are confident about their own business and the trends in the economy. When they are nervous about the future, they usually pull back from deal making and focus inward.If you can\u2019t remember reading about a big deal announced recently, that\u2019s because there hasn\u2019t been one. The reality is that since Mr. Trump was elected, mergers have fallen off a cliff.The numbers tell the story: So far this year, the number of deals and their size are at the lowest level since 2013. Total deal making in the United States in the first quarter was off nearly 40 percent from its peak during the same period in 2015, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.How to make sense of the disconnect?\u201cC.E.O. and consumer confidence is clearly up,\u2019\u2019 said John Waldron, co-head of global investment banking at Goldman Sachs. \u201cBut management teams and boards seem to be waiting this out,\u201d especially on mega-transactions. He cited \u201cuncertainty around Trump policies being enacted,\u201d ticking off \u201ctaxes, infrastructure, deregulation,\u201d as well as a view that despite the headlines, \u201cregulatory scrutiny hasn\u2019t abated yet.\u201dHe also said that some companies worry about a backlash from the Trump administration if a deal were to rely on \u201csynergies\u201d \u2014 a euphemism for layoffs \u2014 to make the numbers work.Yes, the prospect of an early morning Twitter tirade from Mr. Trump may be holding back deal making. And that\u2019s not confidence inducing.None of this is meant to suggest that chief executives don\u2019t genuinely feel more optimistic; they probably do. Maybe it requires a bit of an armchair psychological diagnosis, but that optimism has yet to manifest itself in its most visible form: big acquisitions.In an admittedly unscientific survey of more than a dozen chief executives, bankers and lawyers \u2014 who work for some of the nation\u2019s largest companies and maintain a pipeline of potential deals \u2014 told me that while mega-transactions have slowed, they were hopeful that the current sense of optimism would translate into more deal making.\u201cFor mergers and acquisitions to do well requires the first two years after closing a transaction to give you an economic tailwind, not a headwind,\u2019\u2019 said Blair Effron, a co-founder of Centerview Partners, a boutique investment bank that has worked on some of the largest transactions of the last several years. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the question mark right now.\u201dMr. Effron pointed out that it isn\u2019t just merger activity that has trailed off. Companies have also slowed buybacks of their shares \u2014 a practice this column has long argued is too often used as a financial engineering maneuver to increase earnings per share and compensation based on such metrics. But it also suggests that companies are less confident in their future stock prices than they once were.Perhaps that is simply a reflection of the fact that stock prices are already so high, but it may also say something about executives\u2019 true feelings about the state of the economy.\u201cIf people think we\u2019re going to be in a good place in the next two years, you\u2019ll see transaction activity pick up,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Effron said, noting that the growth rate hasn\u2019t actually changed much in the last five years.Surprisingly, deal making outside the United States is up, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Even with all the geopolitical risks and Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, deal making in Europe, for example, has increased by 23 percent in the first quarter of the year.Tobias Levkovich, the chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup, has a more dire view of what the lack of deal making means here at home: He\u2019s worried it portends a potential pullback in the stock market.On Friday, he sent his clients a chart overlaying merger activity and the stock market. It showed that merger activity is often a good forward indicator of the stock market \u2014 and right now the lines are out of whack given that the market is up and mergers are down.\u201cIn some respects, one of the scariest charts to look at currently is the number of announced mergers and acquisition deals over the past year or two,\u201d Mr. Levkovich wrote in a note.He continued: \u201cM&A lawyers argue the \u2018uncertainty\u2019 factor, which has come about recently, given some unpredictable aspects of the new Trump administration, has been the issue.\u2019\u2019But Mr. Levkovich said he also thought it may say something more profound about the possibility of an overvalued stock market. \u201cIt only may explain the last six months, but the trend has been poor for about two years or more,\u2019\u2019 he said.Perhaps we will look back on this moment as the calm before a storm of more deals. But in the meantime, the next time a chief executive says he or she is more confident ever, remember the adage: Watch what they do, not what they say.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "FeatureAndrew Left sniffs out corporate fraud \u2014 and gets rich doing it.Supported byIn the finance world, Left, 46, is what is known as an \u201cactivist\u201d short-seller. After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company\u2019s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries \u2014 Tesla, Valeant, GoPro \u2014 and though he makes mistakes, he has an unusually high success rate.For a year he had been assembling a file on Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefits manager with $100 billion in revenue. Pharmacy-benefits managers occupy an eye-glazingly complex netherworld in the prescription-drug supply chain, serving as intermediaries between drug makers and insurers. Express Scripts ostensibly exists to keep drug prices low, by negotiating with drug makers on behalf of insurers, but Left believed that the company was actually inflating them, because higher prices meant larger rebates from the drug makers, which meant more profit. He believed that this was true of all pharmacy-benefits managers, but especially of Express Scripts, the most powerful. Its second-largest customer was the Department of Defense; downward pressure on drug pricing from the government could seriously threaten its bottom line.By rights, then, Trump\u2019s threat in the interview should have tanked Express Scripts\u2019 stock. That the price remained unchanged indicated to Left that many people on Wall Street had no clue what a pharmacy-benefits manager does. Trump, he thought as he pulled out of the Madison Club, had given his stale, year-old story a fresh hook. (A spokesman for Express Scripts denied Left\u2019s claims, noting that \u201croughly 90 percent of rebates go directly to our clients.\u201d)Fifteen minutes later, Left was driving west on Interstate 10 in his black Bentley Continental GT. From the car, he placed a call to a hedge-fund manager, a man who was already short Express Scripts and therefore had a stake in providing Left with information. Express Scripts, this man reminded Left, did not disclose the amount it made in rebates, while some of its operating metrics exceeded those of Apple; something seemed wrong.Left heard \u201crebates\u201d and thought \u201ckickbacks.\u201d Express Scripts was, in Left\u2019s mind, \u201cthe man behind the man\u201d; it was \u201cthe mob.\u201d If he went public with a short position tomorrow, he wagered, he could sour Wall Street\u2019s perception of the company, transforming it from a sure thing into a noisy, chaotic mess. That attention might in turn attract regulators, further driving down the share price. He called his web designer, Mike Leznik, and told him that he wanted to buy a domain name to host his research on Express Scripts. An hour later the road snaked above Studio City, and he arrived at Mulholland Estates, his gated community in Beverly Hills.The next morning, Left stood in his home office and put CNBC on the television. The anchors were discussing the \u201cTrump bump,\u201d as the recent stock rally was being called. \u201cThey sit around all day long without ever knowing anything,\u201d Left said. \u201cIt\u2019s so annoying to watch them.\u201d Seated beneath the TV was Leznik, a sweet-natured Angeleno in jeans and blue-suede sneakers. Leznik lacked the macho swagger that made Left, with his money and filthy mouth, the center of a room. Nowhere was this truer than in his office. A giant desk dominated the back half. On the credenza sat cigar boxes from Enron and Madoff Securities \u2014 a short-seller\u2019s version of trophy antlers.\u201cWhat should I register the domain name as?\u201d Leznik asked.\u201cYour mother is a whore dot com?\u201d Left said.\u201cThe real story of \u2014 \u201d Leznik suggested.\u201cThe real story of your mother being a whore?\u201d Left said.Leznik settled on TheRealExpressScripts.com, then asked Left for his credit card to buy the URL.\u201cWhat are you, my wife?\u201d Left said.There were several obvious comebacks to this \u2014 \u201cYou wish\u201d being the absolute minimum \u2014 but none occurred to Leznik, who after fumbling for a moment said, \u201cI could be, if you had enough room.\u201d A whiff. The room was silenced.At 10 a.m., having placed his bet against the stock the night before, Left put out his first tweet, which he misspelled and deleted four times. Such is his mystique in the world of finance, however, that one of his followers assumed that the misspellings and deletions were part of a premeditated scheme to exploit Twitter\u2019s visibility algorithms. Finally the corrected version of the tweet came out from Left\u2019s handle, @CitronResearch, followed moments later by another: \u201cWhen @RealDonaldTrump goes after $ESRX,\u201d it read, using the ticker symbol for Express Scripts, \u201cheads will roll.\u201d We sat back and waited, eyes on CNBC. Twenty minutes passed. Suddenly a news flash interrupted the show. \u201cExpress Scripts shares are falling sharply on a spike in volume,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cCitron Research, run by Andrew Left, tweeted about the stock. They\u2019re now down by 9 or 10 percent, about 9.2 million shares so far.\u201d Left\u2019s tweet appeared in the corner of the screen. In the office, the atmosphere went taut.We watched as the stock came down, dollar after dollar, from 75 to 74 to 73; 72, 71, 70. Left wrote two more tweets, including a promise to appear on television with further revelations. Soon, the phone started ringing \u2014 reporters calling. Linette Lopez from Business Insider texted for quotes. CNBC booked him for 2 p.m. that day. \u201cThe question is,\u201d Left told a journalist from Bloomberg, \u201cis the new administration serious? He\u2019s going to rein in drug pricing. O.K., Mr. Trump, here\u2019s my advice: I know the industry. Go after Express Scripts.\u201d\u201cDo you have a short position?\u201d the reporter from Bloomberg asked.\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Left said.\u201cExpress Scripts, as we\u2019re talking, continues to drop,\u201d the anchor on CNBC said.In 15 minutes, $6 billion of market capitalization vanished. (Five months later, the stock price is still down 13 percent.) Left considered the circus around him. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201csome guys know this stuff better than me. But I know how to put it in [expletive] tweets.\u201dAt any given moment, someone, somewhere, has a short position in whatever stock you can think of \u2014 99 percent of all stocks in the world, by some estimates. Blue-chip stocks like Apple and Google are being shorted. Shake Shack is being shorted to an unhealthy degree: Almost half its shares are borrowed. As you read this, people are short on The New York Times. Almost uniquely among Wall Street maneuvers, short-selling entails what traders call infinite downside. While potential profit is constrained by the distance between the current share price and zero, the potential loss is not, because the shares, once borrowed, can rise in price indefinitely, which means the cost of returning them can, too. It\u2019s unsurprising that short-sellers tend to be aggressive men who are convinced that they see what other people miss and are comfortable with \u2014 or addicted to \u2014 risk.For many years that risk was taken on in secret: Short-sellers would make their bets and passively wait for the market to move in their direction. The figure of the activist, who goes public with his positions, emerged into prominence in recent years. One crucial event in Wall Street history provided the foundation. In 2001, James Chanos, a hedge-fund manager, discovered an accounting scandal at Enron, then a little-known energy company in Texas, and shared his information with journalists from Fortune. The journalists got a best seller, Chanos got his money and Jeffrey Skilling, Enron\u2019s chief executive, got 24 years at the Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Ala.Short-sellers of Left\u2019s generation are following this example but cutting out the middleman. You don\u2019t need an office in a flashy building in the Battery, they have realized, or the validation of the press. If you build enough of a reputation, all you need are some Twitter followers and a website. Left has emerged at the forefront of this new guard. Unlike Chanos, who managed billions of dollars of other people\u2019s money, Left invests his own, which exempts him from disclosing his holdings to the public. And now that his work has brought him national attention, he has found that others are willing to make it easier, by leaking documents to him and passing tips. In many cases, Left\u2019s dossiers against his targets are not wholly his own but built using information from a confidential source. He is, in this sense, a bit like a journalist.He also makes it look easy. One result of Left\u2019s fame is that today\u2019s younger traders believe that they, too, could be him. Wuyang Zhao, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who wrote his dissertation on activist short-selling, told me: \u201cPeople read Andrew Left, and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, my God, it\u2019s not impossibly difficult. It\u2019s not a lot of work, and you can bring down a big company.\u2019\u2009\u201d One of Left\u2019s friends recalled a visit Left made to a university to give a lecture. In the hallways afterward, the students swarmed him. \u201cIt was like he was Mick Jagger,\u201d the friend said.From 2006 to 2015, the number of activist short campaigns rose by 1,300 percent, to 1,289. In the past three years, the number of activist short-sellers working globally has nearly doubled, to 72 from 39. Very few have a positive track record. Left does. On average, the value of companies he writes about drop 10 percent in a year, and some drop as much as 95 percent.One morning last spring, Left and I stood in his lush backyard while he smoked a Marlboro Light. Beyond the swimming pool, the land fell sharply into the valley, and Los Angeles lay prone in the heat. We could see DJ Khaled\u2019s recently purchased house over the fence to our left. Tan and unshaven in loafers, Left possessed the vaguely louche charisma of a club promoter, which is what you might mistake him for were it not for his eyes \u2014 green, wet, melancholy eyes, which, because they cannot but project sincerity, are his greatest tools on television. His eyes are the reason he could stand in his million-dollar lawn and say to me, without irony, \u201cI\u2019m an investigative journalist who trades on his information.\u201dI observed that most investigative journalists could not count DJ Khaled as a neighbor.\u201cThe difference between this and journalism is you can make millions of dollars,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut you can lose millions of dollars, too.\u201dWhen I found him at the airport, he was wearing distressed jeans and a golf shirt, barking into an iPhone. He had just flown back from a vacation in Florida. During the 45-minute drive to his house, Left, never hanging up, floated and discarded a variety of plans. They were: exposing a jewelry chain as a subprime lender in disguise; shorting a maybe-fraudulent media company in Canada; and withdrawing a million-dollar cashier\u2019s check from his bank, made out to a pharmaceutical company, to be offered as a donation to the charity of its choice if it could prove to him the efficacy of a drug for multiple sclerosis, still in trials, which Left had on authority from the \u201crabbi of M.S.\u201d didn\u2019t work.The man on the other end of the line was a hedge-fund manager, this one a very close associate of Left\u2019s, at the center of his circle of sources. His relationship with Left was completely informal. His role was to trade ideas back and forth, sometimes shorting the companies they discussed. In exchange for sharing his insight and institutional muscle, Left\u2019s source avoided the legal liability that came from going public with a position. (A short campaign based on faulty information leaves you open to accusations of market manipulation, something Left has never been charged with in the United States.) Left has a number of sources on Wall Street, and during the months I spent reporting on him, he took care to keep their names from me, lest he burn them.Left also got tips as many journalists do, in large quantities, most of them useless. Business-school wannabes emailed him to get noticed. E-Trade cowboys offered schemes \u201cfor your eyes only.\u201d Hedge funds sent him research and ideas, most often because they wanted him to catalyze a short position they already held, by taking it public. What many of these people failed to grasp was that a bad company wasn\u2019t necessarily a good story. One morning, I watched him read his emails. \u201cGildan T-shirts,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThat idea does nothing for me. Who gives a [expletive] about Gildan?\u201dThen there was a third set of sources he used: tips of no discernible origin. In March 2012, for instance, a package without a return address landed on his doorstep. Inside were 68 pages of research claiming that a Chinese real estate company, Evergrande, was perpetrating an accounting fraud and would collapse. An odd tone pervaded, as if a very strait-laced stock analyst were trying to loosen up and channel Left\u2019s combative voice (\u201cChairman Hui\u2019s pet projects are comically off-strategy ... the endgame is nearing ... a maze of Ponzi-esque debt\u201d). Left hired a fact-checker, became convinced that the claims were accurate, updated some figures and published. The stock instantly dropped 7 percent. He covered a portion of his position two hours later, taking $280,000 in profit.But the profit was only the beginning of the story. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission sued Left for \u201cfalse and misleading claims,\u201d a failure to adequately support his accusations with evidence. The judge found him guilty and barred him from trading on the Chinese markets for five years. (Left objects to the decision on free-speech grounds and is appealing the ruling.) He refused to give up the name of his fact-checker. As to the identity of the anonymous sender, there was nothing to give up: Left had no idea who it was, except someone who almost certainly had a short position in Evergrande and made a fortune off the publication without the hassle of appearing in court. That was the point of using physical paper. Courts can subpoena your emails, but good luck tracing the mail backward from your gated community in Beverly Hills.As careful as Left must be to fact-check, hesitation hurts, too. If you\u2019re slow, other shorts can scoop you, which is exactly what happened with the online postage seller: A competitor had published a version of Left\u2019s thesis on a finance blog, and the stock\u2019s price had fallen too far to short. Back at his home office, Left tried to work, but the atmosphere was lazy, diffuse. He called a source. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he said, asking about the postage stock. \u201cWill it bounce?\u201d The source replied that it would not.Left squinted at CNBC. Then he roared. It began as a self-mocking \u201cWhy me?\u201d exasperation but expanded into something more unhindered, a primal American shriek. \u201cUugghHHAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH\u200bHHHHHHHHHH.\u201dWhen he was through, he said, almost to himself, \u201cThere has got to be an easier way to make money.\u201dRecognizing his ability to dazzle an audience at a young age, Black wanted her son to become a lawyer or a rabbi. Instead, he was accepted at Northeastern and chose political science. Boston confronted him for the first time with people who had always had money. They knew that Beverly Hills was an actual place in California, not a made-up city on TV. They wore black. They didn\u2019t drink Bartles & Jaymes.After graduating in 1993, Left responded to a newspaper ad from an outfit called the Universal Commodity Corporation, offering $100,000 a year for work in what the advertiser knew not to call a boiler room. Boiler rooms are cold-call centers for stocks, where men in bare-walled offices put the screws on unsophisticated marks. (As in: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Mrs. Jones. I\u2019d hate to see your husband miss out.\u201d) Roberta Karmel, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regulator who policed the Long Island boiler rooms in the 1980s, described to me a typical employee. \u201cHe tended to go to lesser schools for college,\u201d she said. \u201cOr not go to college at all. And a lot of them were kind of scrappy personalities who thought: Well, I\u2019m just as smart as the people at the white-shoe firms. I can make a lot of money, too.\u201dMaybe \u2014 if you\u2019re good at it. Left was not. He would meander off script and lose the sale. He quit after nine months, ejecting himself into the mid-\u201990s froth, where there was very little oversight and, almost everywhere you looked, a thick layer of scumminess. These were the years when the future \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d author Jordan Belfort ran a brokerage firm on Long Island, taking small companies public. Left started flipping penny-stock I.P.O.s, including Belfort\u2019s \u2014 he would call up the \u201cbucket shops,\u201d or storefront stock exchanges, ask for shares before a company went public and then sell them later at a profit.At the time, the Long Island bucket shops were pumping obscure stocks to whoever would buy them. The typical scam involved inflating the price by lying to your customers, then selling your own shares as close to the peak as possible before those customers got wiped out. (In 1999, a judge sentenced Belfort to four years for fraud. He served 22 months.) In the back of Left\u2019s mind, a realization glimmered. With the money he had saved from a few successful trades, he started shorting Belfort and the others, covering his positions after the price bottomed out \u2014 in effect profiting from their fraud. He was just getting the hang of it when the market crashed. He moved to California.In the mid-\u201990s, traders were just beginning to publish their theses online. An idea occurred to Left: Take the short positions he wielded against the Long Island companies and aim them up at big companies, the more elite the better, using the internet to disseminate the research. Instead of writing in the mode of a traditional stock analyst, he would distill his arguments down to internet-friendly length. The word \u201cblog\u201d was just starting to enter the lexicon. Left registered a domain name. He decided to stay in California. He would come to talk about frauds the way surfers talk about waves.To its fans on Wall Street, Valeant represented a brand-new model for the drug business. It didn\u2019t spend money on research and development, as most drug companies did. Instead, it bought valuable patents for drugs that others had developed, then jacked up the prices. To critics, Valeant was an abusive acquisition machine that produced nothing of value and would choke on its own debt. Senator Bernie Sanders lambasted it. Shares traded above $200.On Sept. 28, 2015, Left released his first report on the company. \u201cThis article is not for you hedge-fund managers who think that this quarter\u2019s profit is more important than human decency,\u201d it read. \u201cThis article is for the millions of Americans who together can mandate change.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhile the whole country is in an uproar about Turing Pharmaceuticals, a one-drug start-up pharma company attempting to raise prices on a single AIDS drug, the real issue is a $100 billion monster only Wall Street could love \u2014 an extremely leveraged company that set the standard for this type of abuse, while being cheered on by a cadre of Wall Street high-rollers too wealthy to fret over their own personal health care costs, and its posse of hedge-fund operators.\u201d A second report followed, demanding that Congress subpoena Valeant\u2019s executives.Pearson called the comparison \u201cerroneous\u201d and asked the S.E.C. to investigate Left. But as any public-relations agent knows, if you\u2019re denying, you\u2019re already on the back foot. By the time the company announced an emergency news conference the following morning, the stock was down 40 percent. \u201cAndrew erased the idea that buying Valeant was a smart strategy,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI just thought it was a good story. Andrew knew it was a ball of gasoline-soaked rags. He threw a match on it.\u201dAmong those who smelled smoke was the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. In November 2016, he indicted two men on charges of wire fraud and kickbacks: Gary Tanner, a senior executive at Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, the chief executive of Philidor. For all intents and purposes, the indictment alleges, Philidor was not an independent company. That much Left had suspected. What was shocking was the nature of the relationship between the businesses. It was not simple channel stuffing, the indictment alleges, but theft. According to the document, Tanner would sell Davenport millions of dollars of drugs. Then Davenport would share with Tanner the incentive payments he received from Valeant, moving the money through a shell company. Meanwhile Tanner misled his Valeant colleagues into believing that a competitor wanted to buy Philidor. The ultimate goal, the indictment claims, was to inflate Philidor\u2019s value until Valeant acquired it at a huge markup, at which point the two would split the millions that Davenport would earn from the sale as Philidor\u2019s largest stakeholder. (Through a representative, Valeant said it was the victim, not the perpetrator, of the fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note the indictment involved one former employee,\u201d the company wrote, adding that it has increased R.&D. investment by 26 percent.)We rode the elevator to a silent floor, where the receptionist clocked him as he entered. \u201cHey, Andy.\u201d Desks sat empty; the morning crew was here to shoot the 9:30 spots for the New York market, but in Los Angeles the day hadn\u2019t started. A tech came out to lead us to the studio. He was a gentle man in middle age, soft-featured, wearing cargo pants and thick black sneakers, a big brown mustache, warm eyes. He knew Left from the Valeant short and liked to watch him stick it to the Wall Street bosses. All day, people came through the studio rattling off finance acronyms, Ebitda this and Gaap that. Left spoke English.The tech set Left up on a director\u2019s chair. A screen behind his head projected a slightly more outdated version of the skyline than was visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows off-camera to the left and right. Left opened his notes and put his earpiece in. A few seconds into the interview, the anchor fell into a trap. \u201cHow much do you think Express Scripts makes off rebates off a high-priced drug?\u201d he asked.The tech was looking at Left. \u201cYou\u2019re our best guest,\u201d he said. \u201cOur most controversial guest.\u201d\u201cBut not the handsomest,\u201d Left said.\u201cWe\u2019re in West Hollywood,\u201d the tech apologized. On-screen, the anchors moved on to the morning\u2019s next story, the appointment to the Trump administration of the president of Goldman Sachs. Left rode the elevator down to the lobby and slipped outside, where the blue glass tower dwarfed him.Claire Stovall, a researcher at the industry analyst Activist Shorts, told me that the situation was not necessarily to be feared. \u201cThe market is often quicker than the government at catching frauds,\u201d Stovall said. And most successful activist short campaigns produce no regulatory action anyway. But Zhao took a dimmer view. \u201cIf you create a deregulated boom not supported by fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will have a disaster. The activist short-sellers will make a fortune. But sometimes, as a member of society, you don\u2019t want to have a total collapse.\u201dIn retrospect, it is not coincidental that 2015 was the year Left became famous. His tactics matched our mood. Most of us do not care about a random pharmaceutical company meeting its debt covenants. We care about getting medicine at a price we can afford. We don\u2019t care about organic versus inorganic growth, but we worry that our kids will have no coverage if the Trump administration repeals Obamacare. Left\u2019s very timely gift is to connect our daily human concerns to the convoluted operations of the economy, wrapping financial analysis in a moral, populist language that is calibrated precisely to draw maximum attention in a media environment in which screaming is the only way to be heard.As for those being screamed at, the banks and the business schools that feed them, Left represents at best an interesting character and at worst a nuisance. American high finance is extraordinarily good at absorbing attacks on it. Just a few months ago, Left delivered a keynote speech at Harvard Business School\u2019s annual investment conference, where students who could afford the $72,000 tuition calmly imbibed Left\u2019s strategies, which were once considered fringe. He texted me a photo of himself in Harvard Yard, looking comfortable and middle-aged, smiling, his eyes closed.An article on June 11 about a short-seller referred incorrectly to Daraprim, the drug whose price was increased 56-fold by Turing Pharmaceuticals. The company bought the marketing rights, not the patent, to the drug.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Cyberattack Was Meant to Paralyze, not Profit, Evidence Shows", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The day started like most for Roman N. Klimenko, an accountant in Kiev who had just settled in at his desk, typing at a computer keyboard and drinking coffee. He was unaware that concealed within his tax preparation software lurked a ticking bomb.Both had the appearance of hacker blackmail assaults known as ransomware attacks: screens of infected computers warn users their data will be destroyed unless ransoms are paid.But in Ukraine\u2019s case, a more sinister motive \u2014 paralysis of the country\u2019s vital computer systems \u2014 may have been at work, cybersecurity experts said on Wednesday. And many Ukrainians cast their suspicions on Russia.Cybersecurity experts based their reasoning partly on having identified the group of Ukrainian users who were initially and improbably targeted: tax accountants.All are required by law to use a tax preparation software such as that made by a Ukrainian company, M.E.Doc. The software that runs on Microsoft Windows-based computers was recently updated. Microsoft issued a statement on Wednesday saying it \u201cnow has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate M.E.Doc updater process.\u201dCybersecurity experts said that whoever launched the assault \u2014 on the eve of a holiday celebrating Ukrainian independence \u2014 must have known that M.E.Doc software, which is integrated into Ukrainian government computers, was their gateway.\u201cYou don\u2019t hit the day before Constitution Day for no reason,\u201d said Craig Williams, the senior technical researcher with the Talos division of Cisco, the American technology company, which helped pinpoint the origin of the Tuesday attack.Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and computer operations at Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, the country\u2019s equivalent to the National Security Agency, said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the money.\u201d\u201cThis attack is about disabling how large companies and governments can operate,\u201d he added. \u201cYou get a double whammy of the initial cyberattack and then organizations being forced to shut down their operations.\u201dFor Mr. Klimenko, the software update seemed to go fine \u2014 until hours later. \u201cThe screen became red,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cA warning appeared, and everything on the hard drive was scrambled.\u201dMr. Klimenko quickly realized he had lost all past-year filings, a catastrophe for an accountant. \u201cNow I cannot confirm that I filed,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t understand what happened.\u201dYet to be determined is the source of the virus. But Russia was seen as the prime suspect because it has been engaged in overt and covert warfare with Ukraine since the 2014 revolution that deposed a Kremlin-friendly government. A Russian role has yet to be proven and may never be. Nevertheless, analysts said on Wednesday that if the attackers\u2019 object was to sow chaos at the highest levels in Ukraine, M.E.Doc provided an ideal way. Its software is not only widely installed at government agencies and banks, but is mandatory at many Ukrainian businesses and government agencies.M.E.Doc said in a statement that it could not confirm whether the virus had been distributed through the update, but that it was \u201ccooperating with Ukraine\u2019s cyberpolice on the investigation.\u201dIn another indication that Ukraine was a prime target, the national police said on Wednesday that more than 1,500 companies had filed complaints or appealed for help because of computer intrusions. That was far more than in other countries, although Russia seemed to be the second-most widely affected.While analysts remained cautious about assigning blame, there was little reticence in official circles in Ukraine, particularly as it became clear that the country was the primary target. The timing was an especially clear sign of political intent, they said.Adding to their suspicions, just a few hours before the computer strike, a Ukrainian military intelligence officer, Maksim Shapoval, was killed by a car bomb in Kiev. It was the latest in a string of assassinations of opponents and critics of Russia in the Ukrainian capital.\u201cWar in cyberspace, seeding fear and horror among millions of personal computer users, and inflicting direct material damage from destabilizing the work of businesses and the state, is just one part of the hybrid war of the Russian empire against Ukraine,\u201d Anton Gerashenko, a member of Parliament, wrote on Facebook. The assassination of Mr. Shapoval is another, he wrote. Mr. Gerashenko called the spread of the virus the \u201cmost massive computer attack in the history of Ukraine.\u201d He said it was only \u201cmasked as an effort to extort money from computer users,\u201d with the real goal economic disruption.The timing of the attack was suspect in another way, coming after a rare stretch of upbeat news in Ukraine. Last week, the European Union waived visa requirements for Ukrainians, at least those few fortunate enough to have the means to travel. That was a euphoric moment for many Ukrainians, some of whom could be seen celebrating with raised fists after gliding through immigration lanes in European airports.President Petro O. Poroshenko met in Washington with President Trump, undermining what politicians here say is an overarching Russian goal of weakening Ukraine by highlighting the incompetence and corruption of the government.The attack also comes in the context of a long-running trade war between Russia and Ukraine, on the sidelines of the actual shooting war in eastern Ukraine between the government and Russian-backed separatists.In recent months, the authorities in Kiev have banned Russian software imports and blocked coal shipments from areas under rebel control. The coal embargo cut off a vital financial lifeline in the east, forcing Russia to take some of the coal.The police have established a computer headquarters with the domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., and Cisco to analyze the attack in hopes of tying it to Russia. Though cybersecurity experts have not linked the malware to any particular state or criminal group, a Russian computer attack targeting Ukraine\u2019s economy would be consistent with the recent economic skirmishing, analysts say.\u201cIf you look at Ukrainian cyberspace, M.E.Doc is an excellent carrier for a virus,\u201d Ivan Lozowy, director of the Institute of Statehood and Democracy, said in a telephone interview. The software is used by businesses large and small, and it can transmit a virus to government computers, where it is designed to file returns. \u201cThe Russians are interested in Ukraine having as many problems as possible,\u201d he said.Mark Scott contributed reporting from Rome, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Ideas and coalitions get the same treatment: Irving Kristol observed in the 1990s that \u201cthe American welfare state has had a feminine coloration from the very beginning\u201d; Orrin Hatch once called the Democrats \u201cthe party of homosexuals.\u201dThese days, the preferred insult is a new addition to the canon: \u201csnowflake.\u201d It is simultaneously emasculating and infantilizing, suggesting fragility but also an inflated sense of a person\u2019s own specialness and a na\u00efve embrace of difference. It evokes the grade-school art classes in which children scissor up folded pieces of construction paper and learn that every snowflake is unique, and every person is, too. But in the Trump era, it feels as if the classroom bully has tipped over the craft table and is wielding the scissors triumphantly in the air.This derogatory \u201csnowflake\u201d has its roots in a 1996 novel, \u201cFight Club,\u201d by Chuck Palahniuk, whose narrator, beaten down into a shell of a man by his office-drone job and cookie-cutter condominium, finds himself by joining an underground men\u2019s street-fighting cult. Club members repeat a mantra that begins: \u201cYou are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.\u201d A 2005 afterword by Palahniuk said the book \u201cpresented a new social model for men to share their lives,\u201d one that would give them \u201cthe structure and roles and rules of a game\u201d but not be \u201ctoo touchy-feely.\u201d In the years since, a similar model has flourished in the online \u201cmanosphere,\u201d a constellation of men\u2019s-rights activist sites, pick-up-artist guides and bodybuilding forums that serves as a caldron for far-right politics.Even recently, the ideal of traditional conservative masculinity has still been mediated by notes of femininity: a manly man who was soft around the edges, especially to women and children. Reagan was a grandfather figure; George W. Bush a \u201ccompassionate conservative.\u201d Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared in countless films as a muscled killing machine, but he also humanized his image with movies that placed him in classically feminine roles, like \u201cKindergarten Cop\u201d and \u201cJunior,\u201d in which he is actually pregnant. These days, the flagship model of the old-school G.O.P. man may be Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 an earnest patriarch who calls his wife \u201cMother\u201d and won\u2019t dine alone with other women.Talk of \u201csnowflakes\u201d \u2014 like \u201ctriggering\u201d and \u201csafe space\u201d \u2014 conflates the school campus with progressive politics generally, as if the whole worldview were suspended in childhood. It also revives the idea of a culturewide wussification that must be fought with a return to aggression, physicality and ego. This is what the insult argues for \u2014 a rough-and-tumble world in which raw power reigns and nobody ever asks for help or complains of ill treatment. This pose isn\u2019t merely aesthetic: There are those who truly believe that set free from etiquette, care and cooperation, they would prevail over others. The alt-right has even picked up the word \u201canti-fragile\u201d and whipped it into a political strategy \u2014 embracing chaos and conflict because they think they\u2019re better suited to thrive in those conditions than weaker people are.Are they, though? The truth is that people who use \u201csnowflake\u201d as an insult tend to seem pretty aggrieved themselves \u2014 hypersensitive to dissent or complication and nursing a healthy appetite for feeling oppressed. (Hence the delight people take, lately, in making \u201csnowflake\u201d jokes whenever figures on the right claim to have been victimized or treated poorly; when the conservative activist Cassandra Fairbanks sued a journalist who said she had made a \u201cwhite power\u201d hand symbol, citing emotional distress, one headline read \u201cPro-Trump Snowflake Triggered by Tweet.\u201d)Today\u2019s tough-guy posturing seems rooted, paradoxically, in threat and fear: fear of defeat, fear of lost status and fear that society is growing increasingly ill suited to tough-guy posturing in the first place. The narrator of \u201cFight Club,\u201d source of that \u201csnowflake\u201d mantra, was a delusional man coping with modernity by inventing a hypermasculine alter-ego, imagining himself as the man-cult leader Tyler Durden. But making an entire alternate masculine identity is a lot of work.

Instead, he said, he seeks to examine not only the aesthetics of what we build, but how it functions in a community, how it shapes and defines where we live and work and play, and how it brings us together or pushes us apart. \u201cTo write about architecture is really to write about how we live, and the places we make. And that is inextricable from the economic and social circumstances of places we make, and also the environmental ones,\u201d he said.Much of the Pearl River Delta sits only a meter or two above sea level, so the encroaching South China Sea puts a massive manufacturing center at risk. \u201cEverybody who depends on the industry and the economy of that new megacity,\u201d Mr. Kimmelman said, will be affected. \u201cThe threats there from rising seas to a trillion-dollar infrastructure a meter above sea level will be felt by you and your pocketbook.

{"Headline": "Mexico Agrees to Sugar Trade Deal, but U.S. Refiners Remain Unhappy", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico agreed to demands from the United States to cut exports of refined sugar, striking a deal on Tuesday in a contentious trade negotiation that was closely watched as a prologue to talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.The dispute stemmed from complaints by American sugar refiners that Mexico was taking advantage of unfair trade practices to dump refined sugar in the American market and at the same time limit the amount of raw sugar it exported to American refineries.The preliminary deal heads off the threat of punitive tariffs and maintains Mexico\u2019s access to the American market. Mexico was forced to make significant concessions, but the American sugar industry, which had pushed for much tighter restrictions on Mexican sugar, opposed the deal.Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross, speaking at a news conference in Washington alongside Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico\u2019s economy minister, said, \u201cWe have gotten the Mexican side to agree to nearly every request made by the U.S. sugar industry to address flaws in the current system and ensure fair treatment of American sugar growers and refiners.\u201dMr. Ross continued, \u201cUnfortunately, despite all of these gains, the U.S. sugar industry has said it is unable to support the new agreement, but we remain hopeful that further progress can be made during the drafting process.\u201dTalks could begin as early as August.\u201cConducting the negotiation on sugar trade against the background of a broader renegotiation of Nafta gave the United States significant bargaining leverage,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a trade expert at Cornell University. \u201cA ratcheting-up of trade tensions could well have poisoned the broader negotiations, an outcome that Mexico clearly wanted to avoid.\u201dThe outlook for the coming Nafta talks did play a part in the calculations of the Mexican sugar industry, said Juan Cortina Gallardo, the president of Mexico\u2019s sugar chamber.\u201cWe definitely gave up a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides it making sense for the Mexican industry to sign the agreements, it also makes sense for Mexico to finish the agreement in a successful manner because of Nafta.\u201dMexico\u2019s economy ministry tried to present the deal in a positive light, noting that the volume of sugar exports to the United States would remain the same and that Mexico\u2019s cane growers would continue to receive the same price.The American Sugar Alliance, which represents large United States refiners, said Tuesday that the agreement contained a loophole that would allow Mexico to continue what it called unfair trade practices. Phillip Hayes, a spokesman for the alliance, said in a statement that the refiners would discuss how to close the loophole with Mr. Ross.\u201cIt is important to note that the U.S. sugar industry has made substantial compromises throughout the negotiations,\u201d Mr. Hayes said.In an interview with Televisa of Mexico on Tuesday morning, Mr. Guajardo said regular contact with Mr. Ross over the sugar dispute had helped build a relationship of \u201ccredibility and confidence.\u201dThe deal also lifted the threat of Mexican retaliation against $500 million in American exports of high-fructose corn syrup, a substitute sweetener. If Washington had imposed the duties, Mexican sugar refiners said, they would have filed an antidumping claim against fructose.\u201cWe think it\u2019s very important that the U.S. sugar industry be protected from subsidized dumping,\u201d said John Bode, the president of the Corn Refiners Association.Still, if Mexican sugar were shut out of the American market, the United States would still need to import sugar from elsewhere, and the fructose industry would be punished.\u201cThe interest of the U.S. sugar industry is not necessarily the best definition of the U.S. public interest,\u201d Mr. Bode said.The American sugar industry has long been protected by a price guarantee that is held in place by import quotas and other mechanisms. But under Nafta, Mexico won unrestricted access to the American market beginning in 2008.After a bumper crop in 2013 that doubled Mexican exports, American producers filed a complaint of unfair trade practices. In response, the Commerce Department imposed punitive duties as high as 80 percent.To avoid those duties, Mexico accepted limits on the price and volume of its exports in agreements signed at the end of 2014. But the American sugar industry, led by several large refining companies including the ASR Group in Florida and Imperial Sugar, argued that the agreements did not do enough to protect them.The agreement struck Tuesday keeps the 2014 agreements in place but lowers the percentage of refined sugar Mexico can send to the United States to 30 percent of its exports, from 53 percent. It also lowers the level of purity at which Mexican sugar can be sold as refined sugar.In response, Mexico has the option to supply 100 percent of any excess demand from the United States each year. The American Sugar Alliance said its objection to the accord was related to the conditions under which Mexico would meet that excess demand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hyundai Faces Tough Times as Buyers Go Big", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAndrew DiFeo can remember a time, just four years ago, when he could hardly keep enough cars on the lot at his Hyundai dealership in Florida. Gasoline was selling for $3.50 or more a gallon, Americans were looking for good fuel economy, and Hyundai seemed to have the answer.The feature-loaded Sonata sedan and the smaller Elantra were pulling buyers away from Toyota, Ford and other competitors. A shipment of Sonatas to Mr. DiFeo\u2019s lot in St. Augustine would be bought up in a week or two. Hyundai\u2019s American market share hit an all-time high, about 5 percent, and the company was setting its sights even higher.\u201cWe had a lot of things going right in that time frame,\u201d Mr. DiFeo said.It is a far different story today. With gas prices lower, consumers have turned to roomier models like trucks and sport-utility vehicles. Cars and compacts are less in demand \u2014 and Hyundai\u2019s fortunes have fallen sharply.On Thursday, Hyundai said sales in May had tumbled a surprising 15 percent. After rising eight years in a row, overall sales at the company have fallen 4.8 percent this year, and its share of the market declined to 4 percent in May.Over all, auto sales in May fell 0.9 percent, to 1.5 million cars and light trucks. It was the fifth consecutive monthly decline and further underscored that the auto industry is slowing down after seven straight years of growth.Michael J. O\u2019Brien, Hyundai\u2019s vice president of corporate and product planning in the United States, acknowledged that the company\u2019s car-heavy model line was out of step with consumer tastes.\u201cWe have work to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very well aware of where the market is.\u201dHyundai attributed last month\u2019s sales decline to a reduction in sales of cars to fleet customers like rental car companies. But sales of its Santa Fe S.U.V. also slumped.And in a clear sign of a soft sales market, the company is offering heavy discounts. This week, for example, Grappone Hyundai in Bow, N.H., was advertising a fully loaded 2017 Sonata for $26,346 \u2014 more than $9,200 below its list price. Other models had discounts of $4,000 to $6,000, price cuts that would have been unimaginable five years ago.\u201cThis seems to be resonating with the public,\u201d said Larry Haynes, president of the Grappone Automotive Group. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely helping us.\u201dSome of the discounts are aimed at helping dealers with an unusual problem: A number of 2016 models remain unsold in dealer inventories. Mr. DiFeo\u2019s franchise still has six.The price-cutting is taking a toll, though. The company blamed sales incentives in the United States for a sharp drop in earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016, and cited them as a factor when it reported another decline in the first quarter of this year.The American consumer\u2019s swing toward bigger vehicles is one of the biggest changes automakers have seen in decades. Just four years ago, vehicles classified as light trucks, which include S.U.V.s and most crossovers, made up half of the American market. In the first five months of this year, 62 percent of all new vehicles sold were from the category.The trend is roiling big parts of the industry. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles stopped making small and midsize cars last year and is converting two idled car plants to make Jeeps and trucks. A year ago, Ford Motor announced it would build a new small-car plant in Mexico, then canceled the plan in January. The company came under heavy criticism from President Trump for investing in Mexico, but finally said it no longer needed the additional production capacity because of falling demand for small cars.Hyundai, based in South Korea, has taken hits in two ways. The company\u2019s affiliate, Kia, also relies on small and midsize cars for most of its sales. So far this year, Kia\u2019s sales in the United States have fallen 9.8 percent. Hyundai owns a large stake in Kia. They develop new models jointly and share a factory in West Point, Ga.Hyundai\u2019s troubles may also linger for some time.Other automakers caught flat-footed by the shift have spent the last few years adding more S.U.V.s, especially the lighter crossovers. Volkswagen, for example, has long relied on sales of its Jetta and Passat sedans. But it added a redesigned Tiguan S.U.V. last year, is rolling out a hulking model called the Atlas this year and has a compact crossover coming next year.In contrast, Hyundai has invested in the wrong direction. The new models it is now rolling out include two luxury sedans sold under the Genesis brand name; the Ioniq, a hybrid compact; and a redesign of the midsize Sonata, due next year.All are in segments whose sales are declining. In the first three months of the year, luxury car sales fell 12 percent, according to the researcher Autodata. Sales of midsize sedans like the Sonata fell 17 percent.The new cars will sell well, Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s still plenty of volume in the sedan area,\u201d he said. He added that the company was working to increase production of its existing S.U.V.s \u2014 the Tucson, Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport.It typically costs about a billion dollars to develop a car from the ground up. The Ioniq was designed to compete with the top-selling hybrid, the Toyota Prius. The Ioniq is rated to go 55 miles on a gallon of gasoline \u2014 three more than the Prius.Even so, the Hyundai car faces considerable headwinds because fewer Americans are interested in hybrids. Prius sales are down 17.8 percent this year.\u201cDid somebody guess wrong?\u201d Mr. DiFeo said. \u201cPerhaps.\u201dNevertheless, he said he felt Hyundai was poised for a resurgence. A new small S.U.V., the Kona, should arrive next year, followed by a redesign of the Santa Fe Sport then and a new large S.U.V.\u201cI think those vehicles will really make an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we just have to stay focused until we get to that point.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Health Care Bill Includes Deep Cuts to Medicaid", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, who for seven years have promised a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, took a major step on Thursday toward that goal, unveiling a bill to make deep cuts in Medicaid and end the law\u2019s mandate that most Americans have health insurance.But the measure landed in rough seas ahead of a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wants next week. Four conservative senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, announced that they would oppose it without changes \u2014 more than enough to bring it down.\u201cIt does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs,\u201d the four wrote in a joint statement.Other Republican senators, like Dean Heller of Nevada and Rob Portman of Ohio, expressed their own qualms, as did AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the Association of American Medical Colleges.But the Senate bill would make subsidies less generous than under current law. It would also lower the annual income limit for receiving subsidies to cover insurance premiums to 350 percent of the poverty level, or about $42,000 for an individual, from 400 percent.Older people could be disproportionately hurt because they pay more for insurance in general. Both chambers\u2019 bills would allow insurers to charge older people five times as much as younger ones; the limit now is three times.The Senate measure, like the House bill, would phase out the extra money that the federal government has provided to states as an incentive to expand eligibility for Medicaid. And like the House bill, it would put the entire Medicaid program on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that now exists.The bill, drafted in secret, is likely to come to the Senate floor next week, and could come to a vote after 20 hours of debate.The premise of the bill, repeated almost daily in some form by its chief author, Mr. McConnell, is that \u201cObamacare is collapsing around us, and the American people are desperately searching for relief.\u201dMr. Trump shares that view, and passage of the Senate bill would move the president much closer to being able to boast about the adoption of a marquee piece of legislation, a feat he has so far been unable to accomplish.Democrats and some insurers say Mr. Trump has sabotaged the Affordable Care Act, in part by threatening to withhold subsidies paid to insurers so they can reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for millions of low-income people.And President Barack Obama, who has been hesitant to speak up on political issues since leaving office, waded into the debate on Thursday, saying the Senate proposal showed a \u201cfundamental meanness.\u201dIn a message to his supporters, Mr. Obama urged people to demand compromise from their lawmakers before senators vote on the Republican bill next week.In the Senate, Democrats are determined to defend a law that has provided coverage to 20 million people and is a pillar of Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. The debate over the repeal bill is shaping up as a titanic political clash, which could have major implications for both parties, affecting their electoral prospects for years to come.A real-time count of every senator\u2019s position.Mr. McConnell faces a great challenge in amassing the votes to win Senate approval of the bill, which Republicans are trying to pass using special budget rules that would allow them to avoid a Democratic filibuster. But with only 52 seats, Mr. McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie.Democrats have assailed Republicans for putting the bill together without a single public hearing or bill-drafting session.Republican leaders still must contend with internal divisions that will be difficult to overcome. Numerous Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid are concerned about how a rollback of the program could affect their constituents, and they face pressure from governors back home.Some Republican senators, like Susan Collins of Maine, said they were waiting for an analysis of the bill to be issued soon by the Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper on Capitol Hill.A comparison of the Senate health care with the Affordable Care Act.Under the Senate bill, the federal government would continue paying crucial subsidies to health insurance companies through 2019, alleviating the uncertainty caused by litigation and by mixed signals from the Trump administration. Without this money, many insurers have said, they will sharply increase premiums or pull out of the marketplaces in many states.The Senate bill would also cap overall federal spending on Medicaid: States would receive a per-beneficiary allotment of money. The federal payments would grow more slowly than under the House bill starting in 2025. Alternatively, states could receive an annual lump sum of federal money for Medicaid in the form of a block grant.State officials and health policy experts predict that many people would be dropped from Medicaid because states would not fill the fiscal hole left by the loss of federal money.\u201cThe Senate bill creates an illusion of being less draconian than the House bill, but is arguably more so\u201d on Medicaid, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.The Senate bill would make it much easier for states to opt out of insurance standards in the Affordable Care Act, including the requirement for insurers to provide certain \u201cessential benefits.\u201dRepublicans said the bill would still guarantee access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. But consumers could be exposed to new medical costs if, for example, insurers did not have to cover certain expensive new drugs or medical procedures.\u201cAn individual with a pre-existing condition could be insured, but the services needed to treat that condition might not be covered because of a waiver,\u201d said Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor of health law at Washington and Lee University.The Senate and House bills would both provide tax credits to help people buy health insurance, but Senate Republicans said they tried to direct more of the assistance to lower-income people. Under the House bill, the tax credits would be based mainly on a person\u2019s age. Under the Senate bill, they would be based on a person\u2019s income and age, as well as local insurance costs.The Senate bill, like the House bill, would cut off federal Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for one year. The money reimburses clinics for birth control, cancer screenings and other preventive care. About half of Planned Parenthood patients are on Medicaid.Also like the House measure, the Senate bill would repeal taxes imposed on high-income people by the Affordable Care Act, including a payroll tax increase that helps finance Medicare.The bill would delay a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance \u2014 the so-called Cadillac tax \u2014 to 2026. It is currently scheduled to take effect in 2020. Employers and labor unions detest the tax and would have nearly a decade to try to kill it.The Senate bill would provide $50 billion to help stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums from 2018 through 2021. The money would be distributed by the federal government to insurance companies that apply. The bill would provide $62 billion in grants to states for similar purposes from 2019 to 2026.In addition, the Senate bill would provide $2 billion next year in federal grants to help states respond to the opioid crisis.The bill would generally prohibit consumers from using federal tax credits to help buy insurance that includes coverage for abortions. Democrats plan to challenge this provision as a violation of Senate rules being used to speed passage of the repeal bill.Jennifer Steinhauer and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Will Withdraw U.S. From Paris Climate Agreement", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced on Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, weakening efforts to combat global warming and embracing isolationist voices in his White House who argued that the agreement was a pernicious threat to the economy and American sovereignty.In a speech from the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said the landmark 2015 pact imposed wildly unfair environmental standards on American businesses and workers. He vowed to stand with the people of the United States against what he called a \u201cdraconian\u201d international deal.\u201cI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,\u201d the president said, drawing support from members of his Republican Party but widespread condemnation from political leaders, business executives and environmentalists around the globe.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the agreement for environmental action signed by 195 nations is a remarkable rebuke to heads of state, climate activists, corporate executives and members of the president\u2019s own staff, who all failed to change his mind with an intense, last-minute lobbying blitz. The Paris agreement was intended to bind the world community into battling rising temperatures in concert, and the departure of the Earth\u2019s second-largest polluter is a major blow.Mr. Trump said he wanted to negotiate a better deal for the United States, and the administration said he had placed calls to the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Canada to personally explain his decision. A statement from the White House press secretary said the president \u201creassured the leaders that America remains committed to the trans-Atlantic alliance and to robust efforts to protect the environment.\u201dBut within minutes of the president\u2019s remarks, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement saying that the Paris climate accord was \u201cirreversible\u201d and could not be renegotiated.The decision was a victory for Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, and Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who spent months quietly making their case to the president about the dangers of the agreement. Inside the West Wing, the pair overcame intense opposition from other top aides, including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson.Ms. Trump, in particular, fought to make sure that her father heard from people supportive of the agreement, setting up calls and meetings with world leaders, corporate executives and others. But by Thursday, aides who pushed to remain part of the agreement were disconsolate, and it was Mr. Pruitt whom the president brought up for victory remarks at the Rose Garden event.The president\u2019s speech was his boldest and most sweeping assertion of an \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy doctrine since he assumed office four months ago. He vowed to turn the country\u2019s empathy inward, rejecting financial assistance for pollution controls in developing nations in favor of providing help to American cities struggling to hire police officers.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.\u201cIt would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic affairs,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In Mr. Trump\u2019s view, the Paris accord represents an attack on the sovereignty of the United States and a threat to the ability of his administration to reshape the nation\u2019s environmental laws in ways that benefit everyday Americans.\u201cAt what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won\u2019t be.\u201dBut business leaders like Elon Musk of Tesla, Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs said the decision would ultimately harm the economy by ceding the jobs of the future in clean energy and technology to overseas competitors.\u201cClimate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\u201d he said.By stepping away from the Paris agreement, the president made good on a campaign promise to \u201ccancel\u201d an agreement he repeatedly mocked at rallies. As president, he has moved rapidly to reverse Obama-era policies aimed at allowing the United States to meet its pollution-reduction targets as set under the agreement.\u201cWe are getting out,\u201d Mr. Trump said Thursday. \u201cBut we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that\u2019s fair. And if we can, that\u2019s great.\u201dIn his remarks, Mr. Trump listed sectors of the United States economy that would lose revenue and jobs if the country remained part of the accord, citing a study \u2014 vigorously disputed by environmental groups \u2014 asserting that the agreement would cost 2.7 million jobs by 2025.But he will stick to the withdrawal process laid out in the Paris agreement, which President Barack Obama joined and most of the world has already ratified. That could take nearly four years to complete, meaning a final decision would be up to the American voters in the next presidential election.Republican lawmakers hailed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, calling it a necessary antidote to the overreach of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies aimed at reducing planet-warming carbon emissions.\u201cI applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration\u2019s assault on domestic energy production and jobs,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.But Mr. Trump\u2019s call for new global negotiations about the planet\u2019s climate drew derision from Democrats in the United States and other heads of state.President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada each issued rebukes to Mr. Trump. \u201cMake our planet great again,\u201d Mr. Macron said.On Twitter, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for climate, said that \u201ctoday\u2019s announcement has galvanized us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership.\u201dThe United States has emitted more planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other country. Now it is walking back a promise to lower emissions.Mr. Obama, in a rare assertion of his political views as a former president, said, \u201cThe nations that remain in the Paris agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.\u201d\u201cEven in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I\u2019m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Obama said.In recent days, Mr. Trump withstood withering criticism from European counterparts who accused him of shirking America\u2019s role as a global leader and America\u2019s responsibility as history\u2019s largest emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gasses.After a fierce debate inside the administration, the White House on Thursday took on the trappings of a celebration. The Rose Garden was packed with reporters, activists and members of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. Scores of staff members lined the sides of the Rose Garden as a military band played soft jazz.Supporters of the Paris agreements reacted with pent-up alarm, condemning the administration for shortsightedness about the planet and a reckless willingness to shatter longstanding diplomatic relationships.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?\u201cRemoving the United States from the Paris agreement is a reckless and indefensible action,\u201d said Al Gore, the former vice president who has become an evangelist for fighting climate change. \u201cIt undermines America\u2019s standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity\u2019s ability to solve the climate crisis in time.\u201dCorporate leaders also condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s action.On its website, I.B.M. reaffirmed its support for the Paris agreement and took issue with the president\u2019s contention that it was a bad deal for American workers and the American economy.\u201cThis agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country,\u201d the company said. \u201cI.B.M. believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it.\u201dMr. Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, took to Twitter to say he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision. \u201cClimate change is real,\u201d he said. \u201cIndustry must now lead and not depend on government.\u201dBut Mr. Trump was resolute.\u201cIt is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; and Pittsburgh, Pa., along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time to make America great again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: How California Helps the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, a reporter based in the Bay Area.On Friday, the United States recorded its 80th consecutive month of job growth, which is the longest streak on record and has pushed the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent from 10 percent in the depths of the recession. After a long and painful recovery, the nation is nearing full employment \u2014 and California has played an outsize role.Over the last five years, California has outperformed the nation in just about every important economic metric. Yes, the state is big, accounting for about 12 percent of the nation\u2019s population. But its share of economic growth has been even bigger.California accounted for 17 percent of job growth in the United States from 2012 to 2016, and a quarter of the growth in gross domestic product.\u201cWhat these numbers say is that California is crucial to U.S. growth, far beyond what we could expect from our population alone,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.California was hit hard by the housing bust and recession, so it makes sense that the state would have a stronger rebound.

Hollywood has done well, too: As cable channels and companies like Netflix and Amazon have ramped up their original programming, Southern California has seen a surge in production jobs.The downside to all this success is that the state now has quite a lot to lose.

{"Headline": "\u2018Like We Don\u2019t Have Enough Problems\u2019: Trash Piles Up in Athens", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The peak tourist season is beginning in Athens, but visitors to the ancient city on Thursday were confronted with a monument to modern-day Greece: the mountains of garbage festering on the streets of the capital, where a strike by state sanitation workers over job security entered its 13th day amid an oppressive heat wave.This is not the first time that Greeks have been forced to circumnavigate piles of trash on sidewalks because of a protracted strike. But the unseasonably high temperatures, which topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday and are expected to climb higher over the weekend, have created an exceptionally stifling and fragrant atmosphere for Athenians and for tourists.\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute nightmare, like we don\u2019t have enough problems,\u201d said Maria Saranti, 62, a retired teacher, as she gingerly added a bag of garbage at the foot of a pile in Pangrati, a neighborhood near central Athens. \u201cGod knows what\u2019s under all that, mice, snakes, it doesn\u2019t bear thinking of,\u201d she added.Union leaders agreed on Thursday to end the strike, but it is expected to take at least three days to clear the decaying, reeking piles that have been left behind. For two weeks, striking workers blocked the entrances to garbage truck depots and landfills in Athens and around the country, and thousands of tons of refuse piled up around trash bins, rotting in the scorching heat.Before the announcement that the strike was over, the head of the garbage collectors\u2019 union Poe-Ota, Nikos Trakas, said workers had already achieved a victory because \u201cthe people are on our side.\u201dNot all Athenians agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous how they think they can hold us hostage like this,\u201d said Andreas Markatos, 21, an economics student. \u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s fault too \u2014 they should have solved this problem years ago \u2014 but the unionists make me sick,\u2019\u2019 he said.\u201cThey\u2019ll have to clean it all up in a few days either way,\u201d he added.The strike prompted warnings about the threat to Greeks, both physical and financial. The country\u2019s health watchdog warned about a public health risk posed by tons of garbage rotting in the sun, and the tourism minister, Elena Kountoura, had warned of \u201cugly consequences\u201d if the situation was not resolved quickly.Tourism is one of the few dynamic sectors in the Greek economy, which has contracted by a fifth since the country signed its first international bailout in 2010.Even though the strike is over, there may be further headaches for the government before the problem is solved.Last month, a top Greek court ruled against government plans to extend short-term contracts for state sanitation workers. And the country\u2019s international creditors, who have overseen drastic cuts to state spending over the last seven years, are unlikely to accept the new hirings without demanding cuts in other sectors. That could prompt a fresh round of protests, and more upheaval.Advertisement"}

Three changes of clothes, two wigs and multiple touch-ups later, she was still at it, singing snippets of the song over and over.\u201cMore energy,\u201d a producer called out from behind a camera inches from her face.\u201cHow am I supposed to be happy? It\u2019s not a happy song,\u201d Ms. Shay said, sighing into the lens.\u201cA little more attitude,\u201d the producer said.\u201cAttitude?\u201d Ms. Shay asked.\u201cYes. Sassy, sexy, all that.\u201dAcross town, her painstaking efforts to build a following over the years were paying off \u2014 for someone else.At a sewer-side market, dozens of customers lined up with their smartphones and flash drives, eagerly handing over cash to pirates with laptops to load up on Ms. Shay\u2019s songs. She earned nothing from the sales.\u201cOut here, nobody cares about the rules,\u201d Ms. Shay said. \u201cEverything is kind of cowboy.\u201dArtists across the world battle illegal sales of their work. But Nigeria\u2019s piracy problem is so ingrained that music thieves worry about rip-offs of their rip-offs, slapping warning labels on pirated CDs to insist that \u201clending is not allowed.\u201dIn Lagos, Africa\u2019s biggest city, legitimate music stores are rare, streaming services haven\u2019t caught on and fans are flocking to markets like Computer Village, with its rows of yellow umbrellas shading young men selling illegal downloads. Throughout the city, thousands of pirated CDs are churned out each day, and some artists even pay to appear on them, hoping the exposure will somehow be worth it.But now, members of the country\u2019s music industry are trying to put a stop to all the pilfering, hoping they can finally turn the growing popularity of Nigerian music to their advantage.Nigerian music \u2014 Afrobeats in particular \u2014 is having a moment. It blares in hotel lobbies, airport lounges, nightclubs and the dozens of bedroom recording studios where young men and women dream of stardom in this clogged, overheated city.While many countries have courts or jurists focused on intellectual property cases, artists in Nigeria have only in recent years begun to pursue copyright protection. They complain that laws to protect them are so seldom invoked that some judges don\u2019t even know they exist.Recording artists are pressing cellphone companies for more money to use their songs, the Nigerian government recently announced a new push to protect intellectual property, and the national copyright commission created an institute to train musicians, and judges, about artists\u2019 rights.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to change people\u2019s perception about the use of music,\u201d said Chinedu Chukwuji, chief executive of the Copyright Society of Nigeria. \u201cMusic is everywhere, but they don\u2019t know it\u2019s proprietary.\u201dIndustry executives are trying to use Nigeria\u2019s economic malaise as a rallying cry, arguing that legitimate sales not only benefit musicians, but could also help an economy that has plunged into recession amid low oil prices.\u201cWe\u2019re no longer getting revenue from oil, so we\u2019re arguing that content is the new crude,\u201d said Aibee Abidoye, general manager at Chocolate City Group and 5ive Music, which seeks royalties on behalf of three Lagos-based record labels.In recent decades, music from abroad \u2014 mainly American and British hip-hop and R&B \u2014 often dominated the Nigerian scene. Yet international music distributors largely ignored the nation and its nascent middle class as a potential market. With few ways of buying the overseas music that was so popular here, illegal sales flourished.\u201cAmerican artists would come here to do a show and were stunned to find thousands of people singing their songs back to them,\u201d said Efe Omorogbe, owner of Now Muzik, a local label.The open piracy, and few meaningful efforts to stop it, left little incentive for anyone to set up legitimate music sales or invest in streaming services. Local musicians, struggling to be heard above the international competition, often gave away their work.\u201cThe music industry has been its own biggest enemy,\u201d said Mr. Omorogbe, a business partner of the musician 2face Idibia. \u201cIt\u2019s descended to a point where people who use your material almost feel like you should celebrate them. They\u2019re doing you a favor.\u201dThe appetite for Nigerian music is clear. International labels such as Sony Music Entertainment are setting up shop in Lagos. Musicians like Ms. Shay, who spent much of her childhood in Britain with her Nigerian parents, are being lured back.But for many artists, the more popular they become, the more their music is stolen. Bootlegged Nigerian music is stacked alongside the thousands of other counterfeit CDs at the Alaba International Market in Lagos.\u201cThere isn\u2019t exactly a proper structure for us to make money,\u201d said Falz, a Nigerian rapper and songwriter.Apple Music offers streaming in Nigeria, but the service has been plagued with problems because of the nation\u2019s currency crisis. Even concerts, profitable for artists anywhere, are being pared back here as corporate sponsors feel the pinch of the souring economy.In Nigeria, musicians have rarely sought royalty payments. Artists complain that even the nation\u2019s Nollywood film industry routinely uses songs in movies without permission or payment.\u201cWhen you create your content and put it out, it\u2019s scattered,\u201d said Harrysong, a Nigerian singer known for his hit, \u201cMandela.\u201dThe sellers of pirated music know the artists receive nothing.\u201cTo get the songs off the internet, it\u2019s free,\u201d said Ola Mide, who stared into his laptop at Computer Village as customers lined up behind him for songs from local artists like Tiwa Savage, D\u2019Banj and Ms. Shay. \u201cThen people come to me and give me money for them.\u201dHenry Onunary, another vendor of illegally downloaded music, explained how the musicians might benefit, if at all. \u201cWhat they get from us,\u201d he said, \u201cis popularity.\u201dThe Copyright Society of Nigeria has filed lawsuits, staged protests, hosted conferences and handed out fliers to businesses explaining copyright law. Its leader, Mr. Chukwuji, said the group was currently battling the nation\u2019s major mobile phone company, MTN, which pays artists to use snippets of their songs.Mobile phone use in Nigeria has exploded in recent years, and ringback tunes \u2014 the few bars of music paid for by customers that play while a call is being connected \u2014 are hugely popular. As a result, MTN, with its skyscraper headquarters in Lagos, has become one of the biggest sources of revenue for Nigerian artists. In fact, Nigerian ringback tunes like Harrysong\u2019s \u201cMandela\u201d are more popular than songs by Snoop Dogg or other American artists, according to MTN.\u201cMusic has always been part of the fabric of Lagos. What has changed is the ability to monetize it,\u201d said Richard Iweanoge, general manager of consumer marketing at MTN, considered the largest distributor of online music in Nigeria. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege for us as a Nigerian company to support local artists.\u201dBut the copyright society has accused MTN of not giving artists a fair cut from the sales. MTN officials acknowledged that the company recently renegotiated ringback deals to better favor the artists.\u201cThings change,\u201d Mr. Iweanoge said. \u201cIt\u2019s always in our interest to make sure the artist gets a fair share.\u201dPlenty of musicians in Lagos are still willing to sacrifice money to get noticed. Across a polluted channel from the Lagos mainland, past a sugar refinery belching smoke, is Snake Island, a serpent-shaped piece of land dotted by tilting tin huts.Inside one of them, Sam Seyi, 24, was dreaming of stardom, sitting on a bed with Winnie the Pooh sheets as he sang into a microphone. Friends filed into his generator-powered bedroom studio as babies screamed and chickens clucked just outside the open window.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe in yourself,\u201d he sang, eyes closed and arms pumping. \u201cThis is my time to make it.\u201dMr. Seyi, whose stage name is SamSeyi Yango, has paid music blogs to feature his songs, and spent $16 this year to be allowed onstage to perform before a small audience.\u201cI\u2019m paying my dues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect them to pay you a million dollars when you\u2019re not a superstar.\u201dAcross the water, on Lagos\u2019s affluent Victoria Island, already famous artists were getting ready to perform in a chandeliered banquet hall at the luxury Eko Hotel. Some of Nigeria\u2019s biggest music stars gathered in the green room: Harrysong, Falz, Lil Kesh, Vector and the hip-hop duo Skuki.None of them were being paid, even though the audience included hundreds of paying fans. The local comedians onstage were the big draw, and the musicians agreed to perform for free, hoping to be exposed to a new market.Upstairs in a hotel room, a makeup artist was layering foundation on Ms. Shay, the room a mess of glittery blue eye shadow, shimmery lotion, fake eyelashes and a pair of Oscar de la Renta flowery high-heeled shoes carefully positioned on a shelf. She sneezed inside a tiny cloud of powdered makeup.Even Ms. Shay has paid to be heard, forking over cash to various music blogs. She once allowed her song to be used for free as the soundtrack for a popular video game.But now fans fawn over Ms. Shay when she walks into a nightclub, taking selfies and cooing over her. She lives in an apartment in a gated community, and a driver ferries her around town.Her entourage includes a personal assistant who calls himself a \u201cbody man\u201d and a wig stylist. She recently flew to South Africa for performances and has scored an endorsement deal with a Chinese telecom company. Her face has been on Pepsi billboards along main roads in Lagos. Not long ago, she was signed to the British-American label Island Records.Trying to relax at a Tex-Mex restaurant in Lagos after a recent show, Ms. Shay was sipping a margarita when a bartender interrupted repeatedly to ask how his music could get noticed. She told him to email her a demo.\u201cYou have to put in the work,\u201d she advised. \u201cNobody is going to do it for you.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the genre of West African pop music that is booming now in Nigeria. It is Afrobeats, a contemporary style influenced by Caribbean, hip-hop and electronic music, not Afrobeat. Though the two terms are often used interchangeably in Nigeria, Afrobeat more precisely refers to a genre with soul and jazz influences that became popular in the 1970s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Portugal Fire Survivors Recount Confusion Amid a Search for Escape", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut finding the road that cuts through their hamlet, Mosteiro, engulfed by fire, they turned back and began to hose down their house instead.\u201cPeople fought to save their houses,\u201d Mr. Gracieta said. \u201cI knew that, with the road completely cut and the whole forest on fire, firefighters were never going to get here quick enough to help us.\u201dAt least 64 people were not as fortunate, perishing in the wildfire, many of them while in their cars trying to flee. With 135 people injured, the authorities warned that the death toll could still rise from the fire, which started on Saturday, apparently ignited by lightning strikes.Driving from Porto in the north on Monday, I entered a ravaged landscape of blackened ground that exhaled smoke and seemed to be struggling for breath. Every few miles, I passed burned-out carcasses of cars on the side of the road. In what remained of a door frame, fresh pink flowers were laid in tribute to one car\u2019s victims.As I approached signposts on secondary roads, they offered their own testament to the extent of the disaster: Many had been melted by the heat.Already, the fatalities have made the wildfire the worst in half a century in a small country where deadly blazes have become increasingly severe and routine, as longstanding land management problems collide with changes in climate that produce hotter, drier summers.On Monday, crews were still struggling to tame the deadly blaze in central Portugal, even as more than 2,000 firefighters battled separate fires around the country amid strong winds and scorching temperatures.Given those circumstances and the country\u2019s history, some were already beginning to question why Portugal had not done more sooner to improve its land practices and fire-warning systems, and whether the authorities did enough to inform people trying to escape the blaze.\u201cI understand that it\u2019s very hard to control such a fire, but I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so hard to coordinate the movement of people,\u201d said Aires Henriques, who ended up driving for several hours along back roads to circumvent the fire area.He and his wife, Maria Lourdes, were driving home on Saturday afternoon to their village of Troviscais from Porto when a friend called to warn them about the blaze. The police stopped them on IC8, the road that crosses this area, and told them to take another route, without specifying which one.While he knows the area well, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got tourists and others who probably had no idea where they were going.\u201dFor now, an atmosphere of national tragedy and mourning stifled much of the impulse for finger-pointing. Portugal\u2019s political parties for the most part heeded a call by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to first deal with the emergency before discussing its circumstances.\u201cNow is the time for the authorities to act, not the time for politicians,\u201d Pedro Passos Coelho, leader of the main center-right opposition party, said over the weekend.Once the flames have been extinguished, however, there will no doubt be an investigation into why so many victims apparently died after finding themselves cut off, encircled by fire and stranded along roads they took while trying to flee by car.Around the Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande area, several residents said they were largely left to their own devices in terms of working out whether to drive off \u2014 and where to.As roads got cut off, firefighters, too, struggled to reach isolated hamlets. In Mosteiro, for instance, residents said firefighters \u2014 who had traveled from the city of Porto de M\u00f3s, about an hour\u2019s drive away \u2014 arrived long after the fire had already crossed the hamlet.Manuel Nunes, who walks with a crutch, said he survived probably because his leg made him decide to stay put. He watched from his home as the flames crossed Nodeirinho. \u201cI cannot describe what happened here,\u201d he said.In Nodeirinho, an area dotted with orchards and olive groves, and surrounded by a vast forest, 11 people \u2014 about a quarter of the hamlet\u2019s inhabitants \u2014 perished in the flames.There and in other small villages, survivors gathered on Monday outside their houses, looking at one another dazed, struggling to come to terms with this tragedy.\u201cYou survive a fire tornado, something terrifying, but then you start later to realize that your relatives and friends died in their car, outside their home or wherever,\u201d Silva C\u00e9u, a teacher, said. \u201cThere are no words for how I feel.\u201dMs. C\u00e9u survived by staying inside her home as the fire, fickle in dispatching its fate, raced through the hamlet, burning down some houses, mainly on its edges, but leaving others intact.Susana da Costa, a cleaner who lives in Luxembourg, normally returns to spend vacations in her family home near Nodeirinho. On Monday morning, she returned not to relax but to survey her home, and she was unable to muster the courage to see if it was in ruins, as she feared. Her husband\u2019s grandmother was one of those who died, she said.\u201cOne day you have everything here that you love, and the next you\u2019ve got nothing left,\u201d she said, holding back tears.As he saw the fire advancing, Ant\u00f3nio Dios dos Santos made a desperate bid to save his mule, Carissa. He crossed a field and reached his barn but could not open the doors because the barn was already engulfed in flames.\u201cIt was just a huge ring of fire, complete hell,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, of course, all care about people dying, but she really was my companion.\u201dAround the town of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande, firefighters were trying to put out the last pockets of fire on Monday, with the support of firefighting planes, amid fears that the dry weather conditions could easily rekindle the flames.Maintenance workers were removing fallen road signs, as well as electricity and phone lines dangling across secondary roads. Volunteers and charity workers were crisscrossing the region in minivans, delivering water and food to the residents who survived the weekend inferno.At a gas station, a group of firefighters sat next to their vehicles, visibly exhausted. \u201cThis is just a very, very, very big tragedy,\u201d one of them said.Arsonists have been blamed for many of Portugal\u2019s recent fires. But on Sunday, Portugal\u2019s police chief concluded that the blaze had \u201cvery clearly\u201d started from natural causes, probably the result of a dry thunderstorm, in which there are lightning strikes but no rainfall.Such a weather phenomenon does occur in Portugal, but generally only in the final stages of the summer, after months of very hot weather, according to experts.While climate change may help explain the severity and speed of the weekend blaze, environmentalists also said it reflected longstanding forest management issues.A significant problem, some environmentalists said, has been the proliferation of the planting of eucalyptus trees for profit, to be farmed for paper pulp. Eucalyptus offers a far quicker return on investment after its plantation than pine and many other kinds of wood. But it also contains flammable oil.The surface area covered by eucalyptus trees has more than doubled in Portugal since the 1980s. Eucalyptus is now the most grown tree in the country, covering about 26 percent of forested land, ahead of cork oak, whose exports have long formed a pillar of Portugal\u2019s economy. Some environmentalists said the fire showed the need for a cap.Further fire dangers, they said, have been caused by socioeconomic changes in Portugal, with an aging and dwindling farming population migrating to cities and coastal areas, leaving much land dangerously untended.In the aftermath of other recent fire disasters, Portugal\u2019s Parliament started to debate last year an overhaul of its forestry laws.Among proposed changes, the Socialist government wants to identify clearly the owners of forest land, in a country where about 92 percent of forests are in private hands. The change would also set up a system of fines for owners deemed to be neglecting their trees.\u201cWe have a country where we often don\u2019t know which land belongs to whom,\u201d said Miguel Bugalho, a university researcher on forest ecology and a forest and biodiversity adviser to the World Wildlife Fund in Portugal.In some regions of Portugal, he added, \u201cwe face a situation of complete abandonment of the forest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Imminent Cuba Problem", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSoon \u2014 maybe as early as Friday \u2014 President Donald Trump, with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, is expected to announce a presidential initiative that will roll back the Obama-era efforts that loosened the 56-year-old United States embargo on Cuba. How far will the president go?Key, too, will be the reaction of the Cuban government. For the past half-century, the gerontocratic Cuban regime has survived because the embargo has not just isolated the Cuban people from their closest neighbor of more than 300 million \u2014 including close to two million fellow Cubans \u2014 but also provided a convenient excuse for the regime\u2019s economic failure.Despite the assertions of its advocates, the embargo\u2019s harshness has never correlated with improvements in human rights. The worst crackdown in modern Cuban history was in April 2003, when the Cuban government rounded up 75 human rights activists and independent journalists and sentenced them to an average of 20 years in prison. That was precisely when the embargo was at its tightest, under George W. Bush\u2019s administration, when even Cuban-Americans were restricted in how often they could travel to the island to visit relatives or send them money. (Most political prisoners were released in 2010-11 through a deal brokered by the Vatican.)Before heading to Miami, President Trump will need to weigh his options carefully. He wasn\u2019t elected by a small sliver of the Cuban-American population in Florida, and his actions would allow the government in Havana to use the rollback as an excuse to stay stuck in the Cold War.The Cuban government will need to avoid overreacting to the overheated rhetoric and denunciations that will accompany the changes. But it is not likely to be able to resist. If history is any measure, the Cuban government will respond by taking advantage of the newfound antagonism \u2014 as it did in 2003 \u2014 by clamping down on the pockets of independence and information that have taken seed in the past four years. After all, what autocrat can resist being a victim and blaming outsiders for political and economic failures?Christopher Sabatini is a lecturer at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs and the director of Global Americans.Advertisement"}

Climate Change May Take a Toll on Air Travel", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Excess heat in Phoenix grounded more than 40 flights in recent days, and scientists say a warming climate could also mean more turbulent rides.Supported byIn recent days, American Airlines has been forced to cancel more than 40 flights in Phoenix. The reason: With daytime highs hovering around 120 degrees, it was simply too hot for some smaller jets to take off. Hotter air is thinner air, which makes it more difficult \u2014 and sometimes impossible \u2014 for planes to generate enough lift.As the global climate changes, disruptions like these are likely to become more frequent, researchers say, potentially making air travel costlier and less predictable with a greater risk of injury to travelers from increased turbulence.\u201cWe tend to ignore the atmosphere and just think that the plane is flying through empty space, but of course, it\u2019s not,\u201d said Paul D. Williams, a professor in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading in Britain who studies climate change and its effect on aviation. \u201cAirplanes do not fly through a vacuum. The atmosphere is being modified by climate change.\u201dThe problem in Phoenix primarily affected smaller jets operated by American\u2019s regional partner airlines. \u201cWhen you get in excess of 118 or higher, you\u2019re not able to take off or land,\u201d said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines, referring to the smaller aircraft.Bigger jets like Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s have higher operating thresholds (126 and 127 degrees, respectively), he said. All three of those maximum temperatures are specific to the Phoenix airport; aircraft have different maximum operating temperatures depending on a variety of factors, including airport elevation.But even though bigger planes weren\u2019t affected, Mr. Feinstein said, American decided to give passengers on any flight to or from Phoenix between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. \u2014 the hottest part of the day \u2014 the option to change their trips.

Mann & Company, said that although airlines were working to become more efficient now, they were not doing much to prepare for the longer-term effects of climate change. \u201cIn a world where they\u2019re focused on near-term issues, the glacial rate of environmental change is not within their fleet-planning horizon,\u201d he said.Researchers are just beginning to explore how climate change affects aviation and planes\u2019 ability to fly. Because there is so little data available and so many factors at play \u2014 aircraft design, airport size and location, the weight of passengers and cargo, to name just a few \u2014 it can be hard to attribute any one service disruption to global warming.Depending on their locations, airports may experience the effects differently. High-altitude airports like Denver have thinner air by nature, so lift is even more affected by higher temperatures.La Guardia Airport in New York could also be affected, even though it is at sea level. La Guardia has a short runway relative to other major commercial airports, and on particularly hot days that can be a problem: Planes might not have enough distance to achieve the speed and lift needed to get airborne.\u201cTypically in the hotter days of the summer, you may have to bump payload, which includes cargo and/or passengers,\u201d said David Wilhelm, a senior dispatch manager at Southwest Airlines. Reducing weight allows a plane to take off with less lift.La Guardia, because of its short runway, already forces many planes to reduce their weight, regardless of the weather. A Boeing 737, for example, has to cut its maximum payload by a thousand pounds for a successful departure. That restriction increases on hotter days, up to 15,000 pounds when the temperature hits 91.4 degrees.Restrictions like these are determined by individual airports and airlines, and not by a standardized industry regulation. American Airlines consults National Weather Service data and plugs it into a formula to calculate air density to determine if conditions at a given airport are suitable for takeoffs and landings.Already, since the 1980s, airports have seen an increasing number of weight-restricted summer days, their research found. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s become abundantly clear,\u201d Dr. Horton added, \u201cis this is an underexplored area.\u201dThe study examined conditions at four airports: La Guardia; Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which also has relatively shorter runways; Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport; and Denver International Airport. Some airports, like Denver, could counteract rising temperatures by extending their runways. That option is less workable for a location like La Guardia, however, as it is hemmed in by the East River.As global temperatures continue to rise, some of the heaviest planes on the longest flights may eventually be unable to depart during the hottest part of summer days, Dr. Horton said. Like an ocean liner waiting for the right tide to leave port, airplanes may be grounded until the air is cool and dense enough for takeoff at full capacity.Extreme heat on the ground also affects airport workers; loading and unloading luggage and servicing planes between flights could become more onerous. In Phoenix this week, American Airlines set up cooling stations \u2014 air-conditioned tents on the tarmac \u2014 for its employees.Places like Phoenix, already known for summer heat, are measurably warming up. Data from the National Centers for Environmental Information show that every year since 1976 has been hotter than the city\u2019s historical average. Seven of the 10 hottest years on record there have been in the past decade.With forecasts predicting record-breaking temperatures in Phoenix on Tuesday \u2014 and some flights being canceled pre-emptively \u2014 many passengers stayed away from the airport entirely. Security lines had almost no wait. The terminals were so empty, one traveler was spotted riding his bike through the airport.Allison Thomas, a 28-year-old college student, said she had endured three flight cancellations as she tried to return home to Seattle. \u201cI\u2019m so tired!\u201d she said, but added that she felt lucky that she had family in town. \u201cOther people had to go to hotels.\u201dAfter her third cancellation, Ms. Thomas finally gave up. She decided to drive to San Diego to try to catch a flight there \u2014 despite the risk that planes might not take off there, either.One of the most important changes for global travel involves the jet stream, the powerful upper-atmosphere winds that aircraft must navigate. Jet stream patterns influence flight routes, travel time and airline fuel economy because long-distance air corridors are designed to take maximum advantage of prevailing weather patterns, which give a tailwind to eastbound flights and a headwind to westbound ones.Jet stream winds at high altitudes are getting more intense, researchers say, which not only makes flights bumpier but also potentially affects travel times. Dr. Williams pointed out that from Jan. 8 to Jan. 12, 2015, a strong jet stream forced some flights from Europe to the United States to make unscheduled refueling stops on the East Coast before reaching their final destinations, even though they should have had enough fuel to make it all the way.On the other hand, flights in the other direction during that time with the jet stream at their backs made the trip faster than usual. In fact, a British Airways flight broke the conventional passenger jet trans-Atlantic speed record, making the trip in 5 hours and 16 minutes, Dr. Williams pointed out. Only the supersonic Concorde has done it faster.Extremely hot days are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades, potentially disrupting our everyday lives.Transcontinental flights over the United States may in the future have to make midroute stops more frequently, too. On a calm-weather day, a nonstop flight from New York to Los Angeles already approaches the maximum range of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320, common aircraft on that route and others like it.Airlines, of course, could also use jets with longer ranges on such routes. But as Dr. Williams points out, \u201cIt might be preferential to break it up into two shorter segments.\u201dAlthough modern aircraft are better able to respond to turbulence than their predecessors, passengers may still notice bumpier rides in the future. Since the 1980s, Dr. Williams said, \u201cthe number of serious injuries being caused by turbulence has a clear upward trend.\u201dManufacturers are working to make aircraft more adaptable to bumpy rides, and to provide technology that can better predict and detect clear-air turbulence.An article on Wednesday about how a warming climate may affect air travel in the future referred incorrectly in some editions to the recent American Airlines policy allowing passengers traveling to or from Phoenix on several days to change their trips without a fee. It applied to flights arriving at or departing from the airport between 3 and 6 p.m., not to all flights.Rebekah Zemansky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Antitrust Ruling", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle suffered a major blow on Tuesday after European antitrust officials fined the search giant a record $2.7 billion for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals.The penalty, of 2.4 billion euros, highlights the aggressive stance that European officials have taken in regulating many of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, going significantly further than their American counterparts.\u201cIn Europe, companies must compete on the merits regardless if they are European or not,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules.\u201dThe apparent focus on Silicon Valley has prompted accusations from some in the United States that the European Union is unfairly targeting American companies. Officials in the bloc vigorously deny those assertions.In targeting the activities of these digital giants, experts say, European authorities are laying down a marker for more hands-on control of how the digital world operates. And while the $2.7 billion fine announced on Tuesday is tiny compared with Google\u2019s $90 billion in annual revenue, it highlights the region\u2019s willingness to dole out sizable penalties.Shares of Google fell for a second straight day on the news. The stock declined 2.5 percent on Tuesday, a steeper decline than the broader Nasdaq.Europe\u2019s latest efforts to rein in technology companies stem from continuing unease that Silicon Valley has come to dominate how the continent\u2019s 500 million citizens interact online.\u201cEurope is setting the agenda,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like that.\u201dIn her statement on Tuesday, Ms. Vestager said that Google held a dominant position in online search, requiring the company to take extra measures to ensure that its digital services did not crowd out those of rivals.The antitrust decision related to Google\u2019s online shopping service, which the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said had received preferential treatment compared with those of rivals in specialized search results.Analysts say such so-called vertical search products \u2014 also including those for restaurant and business reviews \u2014 represent a fast-growing percentage of Google\u2019s annual revenue. The company does not break out earnings figures for this unit in its financial reports.The search company is facing two separate antitrust charges in Europe related to Android, its popular mobile software, and to some of its advertising products. Google denies the accusations.Google rebuffed the European Union\u2019s claims on Tuesday, saying that its services had helped the region\u2019s digital economy grow. It has also said that significant online competition remains in Europe, including from companies like Amazon and eBay.Despite Google\u2019s denials, the record fine \u2014 the previous high, against Intel in 2009, was \u20ac1.06 billion \u2014 represents a bloody nose for a company that holds a market share of more than 90 percent in online search in Europe.Several other antitrust complaints related to other specialized search results have been filed in Europe against Google, and Ms. Vestager said Tuesday\u2019s announcement could \u201cbe used as a framework\u201d in those investigations.That may eventually lead to further fines if European authorities find wrongdoing. The complaints include many from other American technology companies, including Oracle, News Corporation and Yelp, which have been vocal advocates of large fines against Google.Google has 90 days to respond to the European Commission\u2019s demands, or face penalties of up to 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, its parent company. European officials said on Tuesday that they would regularly monitor the company\u2019s activities to ensure that it was complying with the ruling.Under European rules, the company \u2014 and not the regulator \u2014 must come up with proposals to guarantee that it treats competitors fairly when people make online search queries. The authorities can demand that Google make further changes if they are not satisfied with the initial proposals.Analysts and many of Google\u2019s competitors have called for an independent monitor to oversee the company\u2019s digital services in Europe, which could include oversight of its search algorithms, some of Google\u2019s most important intellectual property. The company is likely to fiercely oppose such a move.Google has other options, including the removal of some of its specialized search services from Europe, or returning them to how they operated before the European Union\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.Whatever the outcome, analysts say they expect a protracted legal battle that will continue for several years as both Google and its rivals fight to define how search services are provided in Europe and elsewhere.\u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a co-founder of Foundem, a British comparison-shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google. \u201cLeft unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bonds Continue Decline as Central Banks Signal Waning Stimulus", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA sell-off in global bonds continued on Friday, as the realization set in that the end is near for policies that have kept interest rates exceptionally low for a decade.A speech this week by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, signaled at best a very small change in the direction of monetary policy. But a confluence of upbeat utterances by Mr. Draghi and other top central bankers, along with growing optimism about the long-suffering eurozone, added up to an aha moment for financial markets.Investors and traders seemed to suddenly realize that the era of ultracheap money is coming to an end. The revelation led to a wholesale reassessment of the relative prices of stocks and bonds.Markets, which had been sleepy most of the year, awoke with a start. Yields on government bonds in Britain, Germany and the United States have all moved higher.The comment that investors picked up on, however, was convoluted and open to interpretation.\u201cAs the economy continues to recover,\u201d Mr. Draghi said, \u201ca constant policy stance will become more accommodative, and the central bank can accompany the recovery by adjusting the parameters of its policy instruments \u2014 not in order to tighten the policy stance, but to keep it broadly unchanged.\u201dSome analysts interpreted the cryptic sentence to mean that the European Central Bank will dial back its stimulus as the economy improves. That is not exactly news. Mr. Draghi said as much at a news conference this month.But markets are acutely sensitive to any sign that the central bank will begin reducing the size of its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a process known as tapering. Mr. Draghi\u2019s remark was seen as a slight departure from his previous signals, and European Central Bank officials were quick to try to temper market reaction.\u201cPersonally,\u201d V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, the central bank\u2019s vice president, said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in the speech that would be different from, say, the previous two main interventions about monetary policy done by the president.\u201dStill, bond markets took notice. Yields for 10-year bonds in Britain and Germany, which move inversely to price, have risen in the past week, indicating expectations that interest rates and inflation will rise.The yield on the 10-year German government bond, the benchmark debt for the eurozone, has increased to 0.457 percent, from 0.253 percent a week ago. Britain\u2019s 10-year bond yield has also risen, to 1.246 percent, from 1.031 percent, while yields on 10-year Treasury bonds were up, as well.In the United States on Friday morning, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 were both slightly higher after losses the previous day. Earlier, Asian stocks fell, while shares in Europe were little changed.\u201cIt is the opening for the E.C.B. to move toward tapering,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Bank in Frankfurt.Mr. Brzeski said he thought the market reaction was overdone. \u201cApparently there are still market participants who thought this stimulus would last forever,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Looks to Capitalize on Clean Energy as U.S. Retreats", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "China, which has a considerable hold on solar and wind businesses, wants to use its technological expertise to help other countries meet their climate goals.Supported byToday, these muddy plains are home to a potent symbol of China\u2019s new ambition: to bypass the United States and cement its dominant role in clean energy.On a lake created by the collapse of abandoned coal mines, China has built the world\u2019s largest floating solar project, enough to provide light and air conditioning to much of a nearby city. The provincial government wants to expand the effort to more than a dozen sites, which collectively would produce the same amount of power as a full-size commercial nuclear reactor.The project reflects China\u2019s effort to reshape the world order in renewable energy as the United States retreats. Such technological expertise will form the infrastructure backbone needed for countries to meet their climate goals, making China the energy partner of choice for many nations.The wave-proof solar panels are an affordable and viable option for power-hungry countries. Delegations from Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore and elsewhere have come to study the project while the maker, Sungrow, prepares to license the technology for overseas sale.China has already started an expensive campaign at home and abroad to solidify its considerable hold on solar, wind and other energy-saving businesses. If successful, China would win the economic and diplomatic spoils that the United States and some European countries have long enjoyed from dominating businesses like software, computer chips and airplanes.China\u2019s sway will be on display in Beijing this week at the Clean Energy Ministerial, a gathering of top energy officials from two dozen countries and the European Union that represent producers of three-quarters of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. While the United States will be there, its representatives reflect the country\u2019s deep split. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, an enthusiastic supporter of fossil fuel industries, will attend, along with Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a vocal supporter of renewable energy.And the race in renewables hasn\u2019t been won. The United States and European Union accuse Beijing of unfairly subsidizing its green industries and have raised trade barriers against Chinese-made goods. American companies and local governments are set to continue their clean-energy push despite Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris accord.As with much in China, the clean-energy drive is much more about economic advantage, national security and political stability than an idealistic commitment to saving the earth.\u201cIt\u2019s different from traditional energy, which is dominated by Western countries,\u201d said Li Tao, the technical director at JA Solar, the Chinese supplier of Sungrow\u2019s panels. \u201cChina has an opportunity to surpass Western countries in new energy.\u201dCoal is getting far less attention. While China is still building some coal-fired power plants, it has canceled plans for others. Many existing ones are running well below capacity.\u201cCoal is over,\u201d said Li Junfeng, a longtime renewable-energy official at the National Development and Reform Commission, China\u2019s top economic planning agency. \u201cEvery year, it will be gradually reduced, city by city.\u201dChina\u2019s green campaign is still in the early stages.The solar industry employs more than one million workers in everything from making panels for export to installing them domestically, though solar accounts for only 2 percent of its electricity needs. By contrast, China has four million coal miners to supply the power plants that generate 70 percent of the country\u2019s electricity.But the clean-energy effort is already transforming coal country.For decades, Yang Xuancheng, a former coal miner in Liulong, here in Anhui Province in east-central China, toiled for 12-hour days in sweltering heat. A natural gas explosion killed half his 20-member drilling team.When mines emptied of coal began collapsing underground, the land subsided and his boyhood village disappeared into a 25-foot-deep hole. The hole soon filled with rainwater and groundwater, creating a mile-wide lake.The lake is now the home of Sungrow\u2019s floating solar power project. Mr. Yang, 57, wires together the plastic tubes that carry the connective wiring for the panels.\u201cThis aboveground work is so much more pleasant than the hot air down in a coal mine,\u201d Mr. Yang said.Such solar efforts have put China at the leading edge of renewables.Chinese players like JinkoSolar and Trina Solar, the world\u2019s biggest makers of solar panels, invested heavily in production. Their highly automated plants churn out vast numbers of panels with consistent quality at ever-falling cost.GCL Group, a large manufacturer in Suzhou, now relies on robots for much of its production, from melting the raw materials for the silicon to assembling the final equipment. The company has nearly doubled production in the past four years even while cutting its work force nearly in half.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the factories as a manufacturing base, then new ideas and technical innovation will stay in the air and not amount to anything,\u201d said Lu Jinbiao, an executive vice president at GCL.That technical know-how is helping Chinese companies capture sales in some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing solar panel markets, like India and Saudi Arabia. China is tailoring the technology for developing markets that will need innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet their climate goals.JA Solar is redesigning some panels for very hot, dry deserts and others for very humid jungles. Doing so will make them cheaper to manufacture than a module created to withstand extreme heat and extreme humidity.The panels at the lake in Liulong are made to be waterproof. Xiao Fuqin, the chief engineer at Sungrow\u2019s floating solar panel project, said delegations arrive almost daily from around China and across Asia to examine the nitty-gritty specifications, like how to lay large power cables underwater to connect many panels.\u201cThis technology shows that China is keeping the leading role in solar, as it has for many years,\u201d Mr. Xiao said. \u201cWe have been the pioneers, and pushed our industry another small step forward.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Reverses Pieces of Obama-Era Engagement With Cuba", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 President Trump announced on Friday that he was reversing crucial pieces of what he called a \u201cterrible and misguided deal\u201d with Cuba and will reinstate travel and commercial restrictions eased by the Obama administration in an attempt to obtain additional concessions from the Cuban government.During a speech in Little Havana, the epicenter of a Cuban exile community that enthusiastically supported him in last year\u2019s election, Mr. Trump said he was keeping a campaign promise to roll back the policy of engagement begun by President Barack Obama in 2014, which he said had empowered the communist government in Cuba and enriched the country\u2019s repressive military.\u201cWe will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the Manuel Artime Theater, named for a former supporter of Fidel Castro who became a leader of Brigade 2506, the land forces that spearheaded the United States-led Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.\u201cEffective immediately, I am canceling the last administration\u2019s completely one-sided deal with Cuba,\u201d Mr. Trump said.But Mr. Trump\u2019s action fell well short of doing so. After the speech, he signed a six-page directive that ordered new travel and commercial restrictions while leaving in place some key Obama-era measures that eased sanctions.As part of the new policy, Americans will no longer be able to plan their own private trips to Cuba, and those who go as part of authorized educational tours will be subject to strict new rules and audits to ensure that they are not going just as tourists. American companies and citizens will also be barred from doing business with any firm controlled by the Cuban military or its intelligence or security services, walling off crucial parts of the economy, including much of the tourist sector, from American access.\u201cWe do not want U.S. dollars to prop up a military monopoly that exploits and abuses the citizens of Cuba,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Despite his grandiose description, the policy represents a middle ground between hard-liners in Congress, including Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Mario D\u00edaz-Balart, both Florida Republicans who have called for a complete reversal of Mr. Obama\u2019s Cuba policy, and business leaders, human rights groups and many of Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers who wanted to preserve it.It drew swift condemnation from diverse quarters, from congressional Democrats and a handful of Republicans who support greater engagement with Cuba, to business-minded conservatives like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which argued the move would hurt American businesses and jobs.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s action allowed him to claim credit for taking a tough stand while leaving in place many of the changes made by Mr. Obama, which polls have shown are broadly supported, including by most Republicans.Under the directive, embassies in Washington and Havana will stay open and cruises and direct flights between the United States and Cuba will be protected under an exception from the prohibition on transactions with military-controlled entities.Nor does the measure affect the ability of Cuban-Americans to travel freely to the island and send money to relatives there, or a broad array of rules the Obama administration put in place aimed at making it easier for American companies to do business in Cuba.But Mr. Trump\u2019s speech was a stinging rejection of Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement in 2014 that he and President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba would begin normalizing relations between the two countries. Mr. Trump\u2019s speech evoked, instead, the Cold War thinking that dominated the United States government\u2019s stance toward Cuba for a half-century.\u201cTo the Cuban government, I say: Put an end to the abuse of dissidents,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cRelease the political prisoners. Stop jailing innocent people. Open yourselves to political and economic freedoms. Return the fugitives from American justice.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Trump sought to revive that struggle, listing the misdeeds of the Castro government over more than five decades. \u201cWe will never, ever be blind to it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe remember what happened.\u201dHis audience of Cuban exiles and their families, including Mr. Rubio and Mr. D\u00edaz-Balart, roared its approval. \u201cPresident Trump will treat the Castro regime as the malevolent dictatorship that it is,\u201d Mr. D\u00edaz-Balart said.But critics argued that Mr. Trump was returning to a strategy that had been a proven failure.Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser for Mr. Obama who led secret negotiations with Cuban officials that led to the rapprochement, said Mr. Trump\u2019s moves would undermine his stated objectives, pushing the Cubans into the arms of the Chinese and Russians, who have no restrictions on their dealings there, and emboldening hard-liners in the country who are opposed to moving toward democracy.\u201cIf you want Cuba to change and reform, we are doing the opposite of what would be most likely to bring about reforms inside of Cuba,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said.But some Cuban dissidents who had backed Mr. Obama\u2019s thaw in the hopes it would lead to greater openness on the island said the opposite had occurred. Among them was Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer Garc\u00eda, head of the Cuban Patriotic Union, the largest opposition group in Cuba, who was among the dissidents Mr. Obama met last year in Cuba.\u201cWe believe that this is the moment for a maximum reversal of some policies that only benefit the Castro regime and does very little or nothing for the oppressed people,\u201d Mr. Ferrer wrote in an open letter to Mr. Trump last week. \u201cIt is time to impose strong sanctions on the regime of Ra\u00fal Castro.\u201dUnder Mr. Trump\u2019s directive, the Treasury and Commerce Departments will have 30 days to begin writing new travel and commercial regulations. They are instructed to reverse a rule that Mr. Obama put in place last year to allow Americans who are making educational or cultural trips to initiate their own travel to Cuba without special permission from the United States government and without a licensed tour company, as long as they kept records of their activities for five years.Such trips will now only be possible through a United States government-approved tour company, as was the case before 2016. The move shuts down what amounted to a backdoor way to allow American tourism in Cuba, despite the decades-old embargo that prohibits it.Mr. Trump is also directing a broad prohibition against Americans doing business with companies controlled by the military, intelligence or security services in Cuba, which own large segments of the economy through the military\u2019s business arm known as Grupo de Administraci\u00f3n Empresarial S.A., or Gaesa.A senior White House official said the administration\u2019s intent was not to disrupt existing business. It was also not clear how the new travel rules would affect Americans who have already planned their own trips to Cuba.Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona and a sponsor of legislative efforts to lift the travel ban, which has 55 supporters, took to the Senate floor on Friday to lament that \u201cwe seem to be going in the other direction.\u201d\u201cBy denying Americans the freedom to travel to Cuba, we will be denying them customers, and they will be worse off,\u201d he said of the Cuban people.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s a look at what happens next.The Trump administration plans to invoke the accord\u2019s formal withdrawal mechanism, a winding legal process that will take four years to complete and would lead to an official exit on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the next presidential election. A future administration could, if it chose, rejoin.One possibility is that, with the world\u2019s second-largest emitter pulling out, other countries may feel less pressure to step up their own plans to curb greenhouse gases. \u201cOther governments and industries could say, if the United States is being less ambitious, why should we take on these extra costs?\u201d said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?Not everyone is so pessimistic, however. Luke Kemp, a climate policy expert at Australian National University, suggests that the shock of the United States withdrawing could spur other countries to redouble their climate efforts. \u201cIn the short term you could see a galvanizing effect,\u201d he said.And, so far, no country has said it will cut emissions by an additional amount in order to offset weaker action by the United States. \u201cEveryone\u2019s just saying that they will stay the course,\u201d said Oliver Geden, a climate policy expert at the University of Oxford. But that course, he notes, is now even further from the goal of avoiding 2 degrees of warming.A future American administration could always change direction on climate policy \u2014 and even try to rejoin the agreement once Mr. Trump is out of office. \u201cOther countries are constantly judging each other\u2019s positions in the world,\u201d said David G. Victor, a professor of international relations at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIf it looks like this administration is only going to last for four years, you might see other countries continue to push along on climate and not give up on the U.S. just yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Thanks to a new law in New York City, signed last month by Mayor Bill de Blasio and set to go into effect in early November, Wall Street \u2014 and most other private employers in the city \u2014 will no longer be able to ask prospective employees about their salary history and other compensation. Nor will employers be able to search public records to discover a candidate\u2019s payment history. (How that is enforced remains to be seen.) Any candidate who thinks a prospective employer has violated the new law can file a complaint with the city\u2019s Commission on Human Rights, which can impose fines of up to $250,000 per violation.The idea behind the new law, which was sponsored by the New York City public advocate, Letitia James, is to try to prevent pay inequality between men and women. According to an August 2016 study commissioned by Ms. James, women in New York State get paid, on average, only around 87 percent of what men get paid. Women in New York State earn collectively some $20 billion less annually than do men. In New York City, women get paid nearly $6 billion less than men annually.This inequity gets memorialized not only when a woman starts a job but also when she switches jobs because until now employers were able to ask prospective employees how much they have been paid in the past. The pay inequity gets perpetuated year-to-year, person-to-person across industries.\u201cBeing underpaid once should not condemn one to a lifetime of inequity,\u201d Ms. James said in April when the City Council passed the law.After November, all that a prospective new employer can do is what Kris Dunn, the chief human resources officer at Kinetix, a recruitment process outsourcing company, calls \u201csalary framing.\u201d The conversation would be along these lines: \u201cHey Sally, based on where you are in your career, if you end up being the right candidate for this job, the offer is likely to come in somewhere in the $75,000-a-year range. If we get to the end of the process, will that type of offer work for you?\u201dThe new law annoys Wall Street. For one thing, executives don\u2019t like anyone meddling with their hiring. And the idea of \u201csalary framing\u201d would appear to run counter to a long-established ethos of Wall Street, where anyone can be bought for a price \u2014 and that price is knowable.Recently, the two co-chairmen of the Partnership for New York City \u2014 Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, and Michael L. Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup \u2013 let the mayor\u2019s representatives know the extent of their unhappiness.Employee compensation is generally the largest single expense faced by Wall Street each year \u2014 and in 2016 contributed close to $24 billion into the New York City economy, according to the city comptroller. Given that, many Wall Street executives, in addition to Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Corbat, have been complaining to Alicia K. Glen, deputy mayor in charge of housing and economic development, that the new law will make it harder for them to recruit and to pay the best people because they no longer will be able to have the typical compensation discussion.They don\u2019t like the city telling them what they can and can\u2019t do when it comes to deciding what to pay people. They also have made the somewhat specious argument that the new law will have the unintended consequence of lowering the pay for men as opposed to increasing the pay for women \u2014 thus lowering New York City\u2019s tax revenue.Once upon a time, it wasn\u2019t that easy for a partner in a private Wall Street firm to move from one firm to another. There were issues related to getting invested capital back and handling potential continuing liabilities. Such moves rarely happened. That\u2019s why none of the Lehman brothers left Lehman Brothers or why none of the Goldmans or the Sachses left Goldman Sachs for another firm or why Andre Meyer and Felix Rohatyn stayed at Lazard for their entire professional banking careers.But today, given that nearly every firm on Wall Street is an international publicly traded behemoth, it is a relatively simple matter for a partner at Goldman Sachs to pick up and move.After November, however, the rules of engagement will have changed, for the better.\u201cWe have to break the cycle of pay discrimination,\u201d Ms. Glen, a former Goldman executive, told me. \u201cEvery firm is grappling with how to retain and promote more women into their senior leadership \u2014 this is part of the solution. Having spent more than a decade on Wall Street, I fundamentally believe this industry will be stronger when women up and down the ladder are compensated fairly.\u201dAnd in the end, Wall Street will do what it always does: pay up for the talent it wants to attract or to keep, regardless of gender.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Killing Currency, Modi Takes a Leap With India\u2019s Biggest-Ever Tax Overhaul", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 For the second time in less than a year, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is putting India through a revolution in the way the country does business.Now, it is instituting the country\u2019s biggest tax overhaul since independence. On Saturday, a nationwide sales tax replaces the current hodgepodge of business taxes that vary from state to state and are seen as an impediment to growth. It is expected to unify in a single market 1.3 billion people spread over 29 states and seven union territories in India\u2019s $2 trillion economy.India, long one of the fastest growing economies in the world, has begun to lag in recent years. Mr. Modi came to office in 2014 with a promise to recharge the economy with the same business-friendly policies he introduced so successfully as the leader of Gujarat State. But he has been increasingly criticized for falling short, taking half-measures and shying away from the tough issues of overhauls to labor and land.Even the prime minister\u2019s ban on India\u2019s largest currency notes, while a daring step, has come under criticism as growth has slowed to 6.1 percent in the first quarter of this year, down from 7.9 percent a year earlier.With the introduction of the new goods and services tax, the government is hoping not just to streamline the myriad levies on businesses but to quiet the critics who say Mr. Modi has failed to deliver on his policy promises.\u201cThis would be almost a test for Modi himself,\u201d Harsh Pant, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank, said of the new sales tax. \u201cIf it goes really badly, he\u2019ll be in for trouble\u201d in national elections in 2019.Now, with the new tax system about to take effect, some are questioning whether it will live up to its billing as a radical simplifier of business taxes that will spur growth, or whether it will turn out to be just as complex as the one it is supposed to be simplifying.India has been discussing the idea of substituting a broad sales tax for the jumble of federal and state levies for much of the past decade. The previous, Congress Party-led government supported the idea, and Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party made the new sales tax part of its manifesto.In many ways, the idea makes perfect sense. Facing an array of taxes from the central government and states, Indian businesses have a hard time building a nationwide business. Almost everyone seemed to agree that these taxes \u2014 excise, value added, sales and service levies, among others \u2014 should be replaced with a single sales tax.Experts estimated that moving to a single tax would add a hefty two percentage points to India\u2019s growth rate.But in practice, getting the goods and services tax adopted proved a dizzying challenge. It required not only a constitutional amendment in Parliament but also approvals from India\u2019s 29 states and seven union territories, many ruled by political parties with widely divergent interests.To win approval, the central government assured the states that it would make up any deficit in tax revenue they experienced for the next five years. The government also pledged to keep new tax rates as close as possible to existing rates, but that seemingly simple objective presented a host of obstacles.Take wood, for instance. In its various manifestations, wood finds its way into every tax bracket. There is a 5 percent tax on wood chips and particles, for example, while the rate is 18 percent on sawed lumber.Tax rates can also vary depending upon the wholesale price. For example, the kurta shirts at Rizwan Siddique\u2019s air-conditioned store in Crawford Market in Mumbai are to be taxed at 5 percent if their price is under 1,000 rupees, or $16, and 12 percent if they are priced higher.Add to that a requirement that businesses make 37 online filings a year, and it is not hard to see why some businesses are complaining.Santosh Dalvi, a partner at KPMG India, an accounting firm, said confusion was widespread. \u201cThings have become very unmanageable, everywhere,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere are a lot of open areas, a lot of gray areas. From a business perspective, people need to take a decision. It\u2019s becoming quite challenging.\u201dOthers say that in a country as complex as India, it is unrealistic to expect a simple tax system.\u201cIf we came out with one flat tax on everything, there would have been protests in the streets,\u201d said Archit Gupta, founder and chief executive of ClearTax, one of India\u2019s biggest companies selling software to file tax returns online. \u201cWe\u2019re such a complex country.\u201dGiven the stark inequality in India, taxes on items used by the poor need to be lower than luxury items, Mr. Dalvi said. So carbonated drinks that only the middle and upper classes can afford are taxed at 28 percent under the new system, with an additional 12 percent levy. Tea and coffee, consumed by rich and poor alike, are taxed at 5 percent.The new tax code applies to businesses with annual revenue above 2 million rupees, or about $31,000. And in a country legendary for tax avoidance, the system encourages compliance by reducing taxes for businesses if they can show taxes were paid earlier in the production or selling chain.\u201cI have strong incentive to buy from G.S.T.-compliant companies,\u201d Mr. Gupta said, referring to the goods and services tax. Companies that do so can pay less money in taxes by claiming credit for taxes paid along the production process, he said.In the short term, at least, most agree that the new system will impose a hardship on small businesses, many of whose owners have never operated a computer and will have trouble complying with the requirement to file 37 times a year online.In Chandni Chowk, one of the biggest markets in New Delhi, traders held three days of protests this week over the new system.\u201cG.S.T. is like a mountain of sorrows for us,\u201d said Mukesh Sachdeva, 61, the third generation in his family in the fabric business.\u201cThere are not many educated people in this trade,\u201d Mr. Sachdeva said. \u201cIn our shops, we don\u2019t have space to keep a computer and computer operator.\u201dAt Crawford Market, one of Mumbai\u2019s largest, Subash Jain, 62, was similarly concerned.\u201cI\u2019m fully convinced that I\u2019ll be facing difficulties in billing, sales and paperwork,\u201d he said, chatting in a friend\u2019s store a few doors down from his shop, previously run by his father, which sells fabric for suits and shirts.\u201cI have to hire an accountant plus a tax advocate and a computer,\u201d Mr. Jain said. \u201cI have to hire a computer operator who will take a salary.\u201dThere is one business that is booming, and that is India\u2019s online tax filing companies. ClearTax, for one, has developed software for filing the new sales tax paperwork and is holding 11 training sessions daily that are attended by roughly 2,000 people, Mr. Gupta said.Many attendees are accountants who are desperately trying to understand the new code.All of the change is likely to slow down business and add to costs, at least in the short run, many experts say. But they say that if it all goes well, businesses, and India, stand to grow in the medium and long term.Nobody has more riding on this than Mr. Modi. Small-business owners, who formed his political base in the last election, are already upset by the hit their largely cash-based businesses took during the currency ban last year.The government, said Mr. Pant, the Observer Research Foundation fellow, may be relying too heavily \u201con the prime minister\u2019s popularity.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m quite confident it\u2019s not going to be seamless,\u201d he said.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ten Years After Going Public, Blackstone Stock Hasn\u2019t Budged", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIn a sense, Blackstone is back where it started. On June 22, 2007, at what turned out to be a market peak, Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson took their private equity firm public in a ballyhooed transaction that inspired rivals to do the same. A decade on, the firm\u2019s units are trading just above their $31 price ahead of their New York Stock Exchange debut. A better result over the next 10 years could require Blackstone to financially re-engineer itself.Even including dividends, assumed reinvested to derive a total return, Blackstone\u2019s performance has been just ordinary. At about 7 percent a year since the initial public offering, its stock has fared no better than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, and at a much higher risk. The firm has roughly $360 billion to deploy into buyouts, real estate and credit on behalf of pension and sovereign wealth funds, and that has historically generated at least twice as much return for the investors in the funds Blackstone runs.Inside 32-year-old Blackstone, the stock performance isn\u2019t the main measure of the I.P.O.\u2019s success. Simply going public conferred a certain brand status, particularly overseas. Selling a big slug of the new units to China Investment Corporation also paid off. China Investment gritted its teeth through a share-price decline of nearly 90 percent at one stage and helped Blackstone forge relationships with other pools of capital in the People\u2019s Republic. Over the years, the firm has sold more than $30 billion of its holdings, including stakes in Hilton Worldwide and the European warehouse owner Logicor, to Chinese buyers. And Mr. Schwarzman established a unique scholarship program at Tsinghua University.The units also provided a currency to reward employees and expand the firm. For example, less than a year after the listing, Blackstone used units to help fund the acquisition of GSO Capital Partners, which significantly enlarged its credit-investment arm. Since going public, Blackstone has quadrupled its assets under management while increasing its work force less than threefold, to about 2,100.That\u2019s a measure of the economies of scale Mr. Schwarzman and his right-hand man, Tony James, have produced, with the right people to help them. They\u2019re not alone, though. Over the same span, Larry Fink\u2019s far larger BlackRock has nearly quintupled the amount it oversees, to some $5.1 trillion, with two and a half times the staff, now numbering 13,000.Opening its books to public scrutiny also may have made it easier for Blackstone to get a credit rating. That in turn has allowed it to borrow and to entice incoming fund investors with an extra demonstration of its financial robustness.Nevertheless, it is the stock market perceptions of Blackstone that perplex Mr. Schwarzman, who routinely complains about them. Merely putting its profit on the broad average price-to-earnings multiple would make it a roughly $50 stock, he recently argued. If instead of its recent dividend yield of about 8 percent the units were priced on the S.&P. 500 average payout of a little over 2 percent, they\u2019d fetch over $100 apiece, he claimed. With Blackstone\u2019s current market capitalization at about $40 billion, that would represent a huge markup for investors.Despite years of trying to educate outside investors, and the subsequent I.P.O.s of rivals such as Apollo, Carlyle and KKR, portfolio managers are reluctant to ascribe much value to private equity\u2019s secret sauce, which is generating profit on investments and collecting a cut. Instead, it is steady management fees of 1 to 2 percent on assets that are coveted.This attitude favors investment managers who worry more about gathering assets than making money for those who invest in them. Blackstone did say from the start that its main goal would be making money for limited partners in its funds, a group that includes its own senior people, rather than for investors in the firm\u2019s publicly traded units. The trouble is that when the profit does flow through to unit holders, they don\u2019t value it as highly as they might.Such an unchanging mind-set suggests that if Blackstone is genuinely eager to see its stock rise more strongly in the next decade, it may take more than Mr. Schwarzman thumping the table. One option could be to pay a fixed annual dividend rather than a variable one based on performance. It\u2019s a solution that could perversely mean giving back less to unit holders than the firm has of late, but it might help assuage investor fears about the lumpiness of returns.Any excess funds stockpiled also could be used to buy back units, thus enabling Blackstone, in theory at least, to nudge up their price. One case study is not encouraging so far, though. KKR unveiled such a plan in October 2015 and has not benefited much in terms of its stock price.An even bigger Blackstone makeover might have a greater effect. Converting the firm from a partnership to a more conventional sort of corporation would garner considerable attention. For one thing, it would make its stock eligible for entry into indexes, thus attracting many index-following funds that would be forced to buy them. Investors who are currently put off by the firm\u2019s complex partnership structure and paperwork might consider putting their money into a simpler Blackstone that has shares, not units, and pays regular corporate taxes rather than passing untaxed income through to unit holders.Making such a radical restructuring financially worthwhile, however, could require a reduction in business tax rates in the United States . In one of his other roles, Mr. Schwarzman is serving as a consigliere to President Trump, who says he is eager to cut taxes. The association may provide a modest advantage. More likely, Blackstone and its leadership team will have to find one for themselves.An earlier version of this article misstated its author. It is Jeffrey Goldfarb, not Rob Cox.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Bridges: Rising High, but Buried in Debt", "Date": "2017-06-10", "News": "China has built hundreds of dazzling new bridges, including the longest and highest, but many have fostered debt and corruption.Supported byCHISHI, China \u2014 Soaring over a lush valley in southern China, the Chishi Bridge is a 1.4-mile-long marvel of concrete and steel. Four piers, like graceful tuning forks as tall as skyscrapers, secure cables suspending a four-lane expressway 610 feet above fields of corn and rice.Squinting up from a dirt road below, Gu Tianyong, a 66-year-old farmer, pondered the colossus, which is a shortcut linking southwestern China with the east coast.\u201cThe government wouldn\u2019t have built it if it was useless,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does nothing for me, but must be useful for the country.\u201dThe Chishi Bridge is one of hundreds of dazzling bridges erected across the country in recent years. Chinese officials celebrate them as proof that they can roll out infrastructure bigger, better and higher than any other country can. China now boasts the world\u2019s highest bridge, the longest bridge, the highest rail trestle and a host of other superlatives, often besting its own efforts.The eye-popping structures have slashed travel times in some areas, made business easier and generated a sizable slice of the country\u2019s economy, laying a foundation, in theory at least, for decades of future growth.But as the bridges and the expressways they span keep rising, critics say construction has become an end unto itself. Fueled by government-backed loans and urged on by the big construction companies and officials who profit from them, many of the projects are piling up debt and breeding corruption while producing questionable transportation benefits.Leaders defend the infrastructure spree as crucial to China\u2019s development.Indeed, the new roads and railways have proved popular, especially in wealthier areas with many businesses and heavy commuter traffic. And even empty infrastructure often has a way of eventually filling up, as early critics of the country\u2019s high-speed rail and the Pudong skyscrapers in Shanghai have discovered.But if the jury is still out on the bridges\u2019 benefits, one can still admire their engineering prowess.Of the world\u2019s 100 highest bridges, 81 are in China, including some unfinished ones, according to Mr. Sakowski\u2019s data. (The Chishi Bridge ranks 162nd.)A primary motive is economic growth: Infrastructure spending surged as part of a huge stimulus program after the 2008 global financial crisis. Each bridge can cost billions and employ hundreds of workers for several years.But the endless construction has also created a self-perpetuating gravy train, feeding corruption and distorting priorities.And as gleaming expressways and majestic bridges spread into less populated areas, the cost-benefit ratio of each new mile of asphalt drops sharply.They were certainly roads to riches for Mr. Chen and his colleagues. In the past six years, anticorruption inquiries have toppled more than 27 Hunan transportation officials.The Chishi Bridge was among the tainted projects. But the bridge and hundreds like it \u2014 overpriced, underused and sinking in debt \u2014 are squeezing governments across China.The projects are often financed by loans from state-owned banks to companies owned by local governments, which collect tolls to repay the loans. But on many routes in less populous inland regions, tolls are not keeping pace with the costs, setting off a spiral of mounting debt and rising expenses.But provincial officials say they are trapped. They cannot afford to lower tolls to attract more drivers to the Chishi Bridge and the 70-mile expressway it connects, but raising tolls would reduce traffic.Thanks to government backing, the state-owned company building the bridge is unlikely to default or go bankrupt. But bridges like Chishi leave local governments and developers struggling with debt, and those who live below nonplused.\u201cIf you don\u2019t build roads, there can\u2019t be prosperity,\u201d said Huang Sanliang, a 56-year-old farmer who lives under the bridge. \u201cBut this is an expressway, not a second- or third-grade road. One of those might be better for us here.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Killed Half a Million Indians?", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTuberculosis has killed many more Indians in a year than decades of insurgencies and incidents of sectarian violence. Of the 10.4 million people in the world who had TB in 2015, three million were Indians. Across the globe, 1.8 million patients died from TB in 2015, and almost half a million of them died in India. A staggering number of Indians \u2014 over 400 million \u2014 are estimated to be infected with TB.Within three decades of its conception, India\u2019s Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (R.N.T.C.P.) has become one of the world\u2019s largest public TB programs. It aspires to provide free TB treatment to all Indians. To do so, it has established a network of laboratories and clinics throughout the country as well as a robust community health worker program to provide rapid testing and standardized treatment for TB.The R.N.T.C.P. is familiar with unfunded mandates, and despite the stretching of every rupee, bills rack up quickly in TB programs. Take the program\u2019s intention of modernizing the country\u2019s TB testing, for instance. Diagnosing TB using microscopy is a common technique that dates to the 1880s. Unfortunately, microscopy requires specialized labor and is prone to error. Incubating sputum in the laboratory is more sensitive but takes weeks.Tests like the Xpert MTB/RIF could theoretically decentralize and accelerate TB diagnostics in India and help turn the tide of the epidemic. But each test cartridge costs roughly $10. Even if testing is extremely targeted to, say, the three million Indians most at risk, that\u2019s $30 million. What if we have to test 10 people to diagnose one case? That would be $300 million, exceeding the entirety of India\u2019s 2016 TB budget.To eradicate TB, finding active cases is necessary along with rapid initiation of TB treatment and ensuring the completion of therapy. Additionally, contacts of TB patients must be located, tested and treated if necessary. Enlarging India\u2019s corps of community health workers will be important for these activities.Millions of Indians have died of TB, and millions more have seen the disease stifle their hopes of a better tomorrow. It is time for the Indian government to cough up the money needed to end the suffering.Pranay Sinha is a physician in his final year of residency in the department of internal medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital.

{"Headline": "Culture Clash at a Chinese-Owned Plant in Ohio", "Date": "2017-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMORAINE, Ohio \u2014 When a giant Chinese glassmaker arrived here in 2014 and began spending what would become more than a half-billion dollars to fix up an abandoned General Motors plant, it seemed like a tale from opposite land: The Chinese are supposedly stealing American jobs \u2014 as no less an authority than President Trump has pointed out.But now the Chinese were suddenly creating them. More than 1,500 jobs, in fact.And it was not alone.But with the explosion of investment has come unexpected trouble. At Fuyao, a major culture clash is playing out on the factory floor, with some workers questioning the company\u2019s commitment to operating under American supervision and American norms.The investment has even prompted hand-wringing in China, where comments by the company\u2019s chairman, a self-made billionaire named Cao Dewang, stirred a debate over the country\u2019s competitiveness. \u201cCao Dewang behaved like a traitor,\u201d wrote one person on Weibo, the popular Chinese microblogging site. \u201cYou set up a factory in the U.S. to solve employment there.\u201dSolving employment is, of course, the promise that Mr. Trump rode to office. Since his victory, foreign companies like Bayer, SoftBank and Infosys have moved to align themselves with that goal \u2014 and avoid an America-first backlash \u2014 by promoting plans for thousands of United States-based jobs. But the experience of the Fuyao plant shows the potential pitfalls along the way.The union, which began meeting with workers in 2015, escalated its public efforts in April with a fiery meeting highlighting arbitrarily enforced rules and retaliation against those who speak up.An employee named Lisa Connolly complained that Fuyao disciplined workers for absences if they didn\u2019t request their paid time off far enough in advance, while a former employee named James Martin said the company had exposed him to harsh chemicals that blistered his arms and diminished his lung capacity. (Mr. Martin lost his job for excessive absences while on workers\u2019 compensation leave in January.)Fred Strahorn, the Democratic minority leader of the Ohio House of Representatives, told the audience that Fuyao\u2019s operation felt like \u201ca little bit of a hostage situation\u201d and pledged to \u201cshow Fuyao that we do things a little bit different in Dayton, Ohio.\u201dThe company reached an agreement in March that reduced the amount to $100,000 and required corrective measures.Eric Vanetti, the vice president for human resources, conceded an element of turmoil at the plant late last year. But he said that the atmosphere had improved significantly in the past few months and that many of the new safety measures were underway before the OSHA settlement. The company also recently gave hourly production employees a $2-an-hour raise.One complication at Fuyao is the relative novelty of Chinese \u201cgreenfield\u201d investments in the United States, in which foreign companies build new facilities rather than acquire existing ones.The approach has advantages for both sides. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t invest in the Dayton area, it\u2019s very unlikely anyone would invest any more in the automotive glass industry in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Cao said.Kristi Tanner, a senior official at JobsOhio, the private economic development corporation for Ohio, which helped lure Fuyao to the state, said in a statement that the company \u201chas transformed a long-vacant former G.M. assembly plant and provided an economic lift.\u201dBut projects can suffer when investors are unfamiliar with the American regulatory and political environment, as is true for many executives in China, where labor standards tend to be less strictly enforced.At Fuyao, workers say there have been safety improvements, though some cite continuing problems. One employee, DeAnn Wilson, complained that her area lacks proper ventilation even though she works around machines that emit smoke. (John Crane, Fuyao\u2019s health and safety director, said the smoke was vapor that resulted from warm air entering a chilled room.)Other workers said that despite the company\u2019s insistence that it wanted to hand the plant over to American managers, it had increased the proportion of Chinese supervisors in recent months.That contention is consistent with the legal complaint of David Burrows, who was ousted as a vice president for the plant in November, along with the plant\u2019s president, John Gauthier.\u201cSince those two have been fired, it has more of a Chinese feel than what it was before,\u201d said Duane Young, a worker at the plant. He said the Chinese had little interest in training, sharing responsibility with or even engaging with American employees.In an interview in Beijing, Mr. Cao said he had replaced Mr. Burrows and Mr. Gauthier because \u201cthey didn\u2019t do their jobs but squandered my money.\u201d He lamented that productivity at the plant \u201cis not as high as we have in China,\u201d adding that \u201csome of the workers are just idling around.\u201dAthena Hou, the chief legal officer for Fuyao Glass America, called Mr. Burrows\u2019s suit \u201clegally meritless.\u201d Mr. Gauthier and Mr. Burrows did not respond to requests for comment.To some extent, cultural norms may explain the tensions.Workers at the Fuyao plant say Chinese managers seem to elevate production goals above all else. When employees have trouble with equipment and ask to shut it down, said Nicholas Tannenbaum, a Fuyao worker who was fired in late May, \u201cthe Chinese look at us and say, \u2018No need.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re jumping on moving conveyors to fix it as the line is running,\u201d he added.Mr. Vanetti, the head of human resources, said the company had not sacrificed safety to meet production targets. But he conceded that \u201cthe fundamental difference between Chinese and Americans is that the Chinese have a bias toward speed; Americans like to process things, think it through from all angles.\u201dMr. Vanetti said that Fuyao remained committed to its original four-to-five-year timetable for handing the plant to a predominantly American management corps, and that it recently hired two more American vice presidents.But Weiyi Shi, a professor of political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said Chinese overseas investments in Africa and Asia showed a pattern of reluctance to transfer operations to local control.\u201cAt the managerial level, you see that the technical staff tends to be from China,\u201d she said. \u201cThe one local employee they hire at a senior managerial level would be the human resources director.\u201dFollow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberNoam Scheiber reported from Moraine, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Europe and Japan Near Trade Deal as U.S. Takes Protectionist Path", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe deal, which brings together two giants encompassing a quarter of the world\u2019s economy, would be a potent symbol of free trade during a time of populist backlash over globalization.The agreement would give both parties better access to core industries like cars and machinery, while laying down new rules for resolving investment disputes and removing structural barriers to trade, according to a partial draft of the agreement obtained by The New York Times.The negotiations have hinged on some everyday \u2014 and quintessentially European \u2014 items.Europe is seeking a rollback in Japan\u2019s high tariffs on food imports, which include 30 percent on imported cheese, 10 percent on chocolate and 9 percent on canned tomatoes. Japan is pushing Europe to eliminate a 10 percent tariff on Japanese automobiles. Final changes to tariffs were being laid out in appendixes and were not in the partial draft.The draft deal showed a softer stance on environmental issues, such as illegal timber and overfishing, compared with other recent trade negotiations like a stalled Pan-Asian pact that involved the United States and Japan. The approach has raised concerns that a retreat from the trade arena by the United States \u2014 which under President Barack Obama was a champion of environmental causes \u2014 is damping the willingness of other countries to tackle contentious topics.The European Union-Japan trade talks, which began in 2013, could still hit last-minute stumbling blocks. Any deal must still be ratified by national and some regional parliaments across the European Union and by the Japanese Legislature.The partial draft of the deal between the European Union and Japan was first obtained by the environmental group Greenpeace, which shared the document with The Times, the German public broadcaster ARD and the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.The Japanese Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the documents, but it said in a statement that \u201ca broad agreement is within reach.\u201d Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is preparing to work out the final details with Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, and a deal could be announced as early as next week, according to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK.The European Commission would not comment on the document. In an emailed statement, the commission said, \u201cThe negotiators are now in permanent contact at all levels to conclude an agreement as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cIn the current international environment, an ambitious E.U.-Japan deal would send a powerful signal to the rest of the world that two of the largest economies are resisting protectionism and that openness to trade and investment remains one of the best tools to harness and shape globalization and create more economic growth and jobs,\u201d the statement said.The rest of the world is moving ahead with trade alliances as the Trump administration pushes a nationalistic \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda. Mr. Trump has called for higher tariffs in a broad defense of American manufacturing jobs against low-cost imports.\u201cBut now, the E.U. is managing to move more quickly,\u201d he said, with substantial benefits. European farmers, for example, could gain better access to the lucrative Japanese market. \u201cIt shows the world doesn\u2019t stand still,\u201d he added.While Japan and the European Union have been negotiating for years, Japanese officials have been eager to pick up the pace at trade talks in the aftermath of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to leave the Pan-Pacific trade deal. They have similarly pushed to keep that deal going despite Washington\u2019s absence.America\u2019s nationalistic stance could also leave the door open for China to further its trade diplomacy. China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, has been pursuing its own ambitious deal with 16 countries in Asia and the Pacific, including Japan, an enormous group with more than three billion people.With a combined economic output of roughly $20 trillion, the deal between the European Union and Japan would create a trading bloc roughly equal in size to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nafta includes the United States, Canada and Mexico and is now the world\u2019s largest free trade zone. Mr. Trump has also vowed to renegotiate that deal.Environmental groups worry that the deal between Europe and Japan falls short on a number of issues, including curbing the illegal timber trade and tackling overfishing. The European Union, as well as the United States under Mr. Obama, has sought commitments related to the environment and labor as part of trade deals.The draft deal\u2019s provisions on the control of the trade in illegal timber are significantly weaker than those in the Pan-Asian pact. As part of the T.P.P., Japan, which has been criticized by forestry groups for its relatively lax timber laws, agreed to adopt new laws to tackle the trade in illegally harvested wood. The draft of the deal between Japan and the European Union is less specific, saying that the two parties \u201crecognize the importance\u201d of the issue.The draft also contains no reference to Japan\u2019s commercial whaling program. Environmental groups have long criticized that industry and urged Tokyo\u2019s trading partners to help end it.The deal, if reached, \u201craises significant concerns for environmental protection,\u201d said Kees Kodde, Greenpeace\u2019s trade policy campaigner.Mr. Meltzer of the Brookings Institution agreed that the draft deal\u2019s environmental terms were \u201cmuch weaker\u201d than those in previous trade talks, like the T.P.P. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot less substance in this agreement,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Disgraceful Exit From the Paris Accord", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOnly future generations will be able to calculate the full consequences of President Trump\u2019s incredibly shortsighted approach to climate change, since it is they who will suffer the rising seas and crippling droughts that scientists say are inevitable unless the world brings fossil fuel emissions to heel.But this much is clear now: Mr. Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 the latest of which was his decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change \u2014 have dismayed America\u2019s allies, defied the wishes of much of the American business community he pretends to help, threatened America\u2019s competitiveness as well as job growth in crucial industries and squandered what was left of America\u2019s claim to leadership on an issue of global importance.The only clear winners, and we\u2019ve looked hard to find them, are hard-core climate deniers like Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency and the presidential adviser Stephen Bannon, and various fossil fuel interests that have found in Mr. Trump another president (George W. Bush being the last) credulous enough to swallow the bogus argument that an agreement to fight climate change will destroy or at least inhibit the economy.Mr. Trump justified his decision by saying that the Paris agreement was a bad deal for the United States, buttressing his argument with a cornucopia of dystopian, dishonest and discredited data based on numbers from industry-friendly sources. Those numbers are nonsense, as is his argument that the agreement would force the country to make enormous economic sacrifices and cause a huge redistribution of jobs and economic resources to the rest of the world.In truth, the agreement does not require any country to do anything; after the failure of the 1997 Kyoto Accord, the United Nations, which oversees climate change negotiations, decided that it simply did not have the authority to force a legally binding agreement. Instead, negotiators in Paris aimed for, and miraculously achieved, a voluntary agreement, under which more than 190 countries offered aspirational emissions targets, pledged their best efforts to meet them and agreed to give periodic updates on how they were doing.Paris did not, in short, legally constrain Mr. Trump from doing the dumb things he wanted to do. Which he already has. In the last few months, and without consulting a single foreign leader, he has ordered rollbacks of every one of the policies on which President Barack Obama based his ambitious pledge to reduce America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 \u2014 most prominently, policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants, automobiles and oil and gas wells.But if withdrawing from the agreement will not make Mr. Trump\u2019s domestic policies any worse than they are, it is still a terrible decision that could have enormous consequences globally. In huge neon letters, it sends a clear message that this president knows nothing or cares little about the science underlying the stark warnings of environmental disruption. That he knows or cares little about the problems that disruption could bring, especially in poor countries. That he is unmindful that America, historically the world\u2019s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, has a special obligation to help the rest of the world address these issues. That he is oblivious to the further damage this will cause to his already tattered relationship with the European allies. That his malfeasance might now prompt other countries that signed the accord to withdraw from the agreement, or rethink their emissions pledges.Perhaps most astonishing of all, a chief executive who touts himself as a shrewd businessman, and who ran on a promise of jobs for the middle class and making America great again, seems blind to the damage this will do to America\u2019s own economic interests. The world\u2019s gradual transition from fossil fuels has opened up a huge global market, estimated to be $6 trillion by 2030, for renewable fuels like wind and solar, for electric cars, for advanced batteries and other technologies.America\u2019s private sector clearly understands this opportunity, which is why, in January, 630 businesses and investors \u2014 with names like DuPont, Hewlett Packard and Pacific Gas and Electric \u2014 signed an open letter to then-President-elect Trump and Congress, calling on them to continue supporting low-carbon policies, investment in a low-carbon economy and American participation in the Paris agreement. It is also why Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric vehicle maker Tesla, was resigning from two presidential advisory councils after Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal from Paris.Yet Mr. Trump clings to the same false narrative that congressional Republicans have been peddling for years and that Mr. Trump\u2019s minions, like Mr. Pruitt at the E.P.A. and Ryan Zinke at the Interior Department, are peddling now (Mr. Pruitt to the coal miners, Mr. Zinke to Alaskans) \u2014 that environmental regulations are job killers, that efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions will hurt the economy, that the way forward lies in fossil fuels, in digging still more coal and punching still more holes in the ground in the search for more oil.As alternative realities and fake facts go, that argument is something to behold. For one thing, it fails to account for the significant economic benefits of reducing greenhouse gases, avoiding damage to human health and the environment. And it ignores extensive research showing that reducing carbon emissions can in fact drive economic growth. Partly because of investments in cleaner fuels, partly because of revolutionary improvements in efficiency standards for appliances and buildings, carbon dioxide emissions in this country actually fell nearly 12 percent in the last decade, even as the overall economy kept growing. Under Mr. Obama\u2019s supposedly job-killing regulations, more than 11.3 million jobs were created, compared with two million-plus under Mr. Bush\u2019s antiregulatory regime.It\u2019s true that the coal industry is losing jobs, largely a result of competition from cheaper natural gas, but the renewable fuels industry is going gangbusters: Employment in the solar industry, for instance, is more than 10 times what it was a decade ago, 260,000 jobs as opposed to 24,000.Therein lies one ray of hope that the United States, whatever Mr. Trump does, will continue to do its part in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Market forces all seem to be headed in the right direction. Technologies are improving. The business community is angry. A Gallup poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans are worried about climate change, and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that almost 70 percent of Americans wanted to stay in the agreement, including half of Trump voters.And some states are moving aggressively, including New York. On Wednesday, the State Senate in California, always a leader in environmental matters, passed a bill that seeks to put California on a path to 100 percent renewable energy by midcentury. On the same day, Exxon Mobil stockholders won a crucial vote requiring the company to start accounting for the impact of climate change policies on its business.These messages might be lost on Mr. Trump. Hopefully, not on the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Guide to the (Now Even More) Inscrutable \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Conservative Party\u2019s loss of its parliamentary majority in the recent elections has shuffled the deck of possibilities once again and left Prime Minister Theresa May scrambling to hold on to her position. Not only did the prime minister lose a lot of her authority, but she also failed to win popular endorsement for her planned clean break with the European Union. On Thursday, she won Parliament\u2019s approval for her legislative program, with the support of 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland.Both Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party remain committed to last year\u2019s referendum decision to leave the European Union. But they disagree on what sort of deal to negotiate. Tensions over Europe are resurfacing among Mrs. May\u2019s senior colleagues, and she will face grueling battles in the British Parliament (and possibly in the Scottish one, too) to get withdrawal legislation passed.Just as tough is the task facing Mrs. May\u2019s government in the negotiations with Brussels, in which the remaining 27 European Union nations have \u2014 so far \u2014 kept a unified front.How might it all end? No one knows for sure, but here are four possibilities. No DealMrs. May has long insisted that no deal is better than a bad deal, though she has been saying that less emphatically since her election debacle. Business leaders say that a bad deal would have to be very punitive indeed to be worse than a breakdown of talks. That would lead to a \u201ccliff edge\u201d for British companies, which would lose their current arrangements for access to European markets in 2019. A Clean BreakMrs. May says she wants Britain to leave the bloc\u2019s Customs Union, which eliminates tariffs, so that Britain can make global trade deals independently. She also wants to quit the European single market, which smooths trade in services, because leaving would end the free movement of European workers, in that way restoring national control of immigration. According to her plan, those arrangements would be replaced by a comprehensive trade agreement with the European Union.Even barring a seismic event like that, there is widespread and growing acceptance that negotiating a new trade deal with the European Union cannot be done before March 2019, when Britain is scheduled to leave. That might lead to a \u201cclean break plus,\u201d a transition period of several years to give the British economy breathing space, a strategy being championed by the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.Such an approach would most likely involve accepting, during the transition, current rules on the freedom of movement of European workers (and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice). It would probably also mean that Britain would have to agree to a divorce payment, effectively buying its economy time to adjust to new circumstances. All in all, that could prove expensive and would involve compromises. But when staring over a cliff edge, an economic parachute starts to look attractive, even if it comes with a big price tag.\u2018Soft Brexit\u2019For now, Mrs. May rejects the softer withdrawal. However, some analysts say they suspect that the government\u2019s position will shift later in the negotiations and that London may seek a type of membership of the Customs Union. If not, the government might struggle to get withdrawal legislation through Parliament.Resistance might come from the House of Lords, the unelected, upper chamber of Parliament that revises legislation. But the House of Lords will probably \u2014 eventually \u2014 take its lead from the elected House of Commons.That makes the position of the Labour Party crucial. By opposing the Conservative Party\u2019s detailed plan for withdrawal (rather than the principle of withdrawal), and pressing for some sort of membership of the Customs Union, Labour might force ministers to change course \u2014 and, if it\u2019s lucky, bring down the government in the process. Never Mind\u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamer, but I\u2019m not the only one,\u201d the European Council\u2019s president, Donald Tusk, quoting John Lennon, said when asked about the prospect of Britain\u2019s remaining inside the European Union. With both the Conservative and Labour parties committed to leaving, that remains unlikely. It would require a significant further shift in public opinion in favor of remaining, more so even than in the recent election, before lawmakers would start to feel the heat. Even then, it would tear apart the Conservative Party and invite a white-heat campaign against the government by Britain\u2019s tabloid newspapers.Nevertheless, there are signs of a slowdown in the British economy, and if conditions were to worsen during the negotiations, the withdrawal from the European Union could become increasingly unpopular. As the trade-offs become clearer, voters might conclude that the gains promised by the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign during the referendum were either bogus (like the 350 million pounds, or about $446 million, a week to be made available for the National Health Service) or likely to be outweighed by the losses.Reversing the withdrawal would probably involve a change of government and another referendum, and all that is hard to envisage. But if the recent volatility of British politics proves anything, it is that the unlikely is possible.Advertisement"}

As the Conservatives try to hang on to control of the government, a weakening economy is likely to intensify the sense of grievance among ordinary Britons who have not gained the spoils from recent years of growth.Consumer spending makes up nearly two-thirds of British economic activity, meaning the troubles of ordinary people can have decisive influence over the economy \u2014 and politics, for that matter. For the average worker, rising prices for everyday consumer goods are landing atop a decade of stagnating wages.Few economists expect that Britain will fall into a recession, but the consensus envisions disappointing economic growth ranging between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent annually over this year and next.In the dozen years since Vaidas Zelskis entered Britain from his native Lithuania to pursue work as a carpenter, his wages have grown from about 120 pounds a day (about $224 dollars at the exchange rates of the time) to about \u00a3180 now, or $233. But over the same time, his usual assortment of groceries have soared from some \u00a350 per week to more like \u00a3120.\u201cThe rich people can always afford what they want,\u201d Mr. Zelskis said as he took a cigarette break on a recent morning outside his current job at the Shard, an iconic skyscraper south of the River Thames. \u201cBut the middle class really feels it.\u201dMuch as in the United States, most working people in Britain have yet to fully recover from the traumatic financial crisis that began in 2008.Britain\u2019s average weekly wages are lower today than they were a decade ago after accounting for inflation, noted Martin Beck, lead British economist at Oxford Economics in London. This, despite the fact that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate dropped to 4.6 percent in April, a level last seen in 1975.\u201cFor most people, there hasn\u2019t been a real recovery for years,\u201d Mr. Beck said.In years past, low unemployment has tended to push up wages, as employers found themselves forced to pay more to compete for a smaller pool of workers. Why this typically enriching dynamic has failed to emerge now is the subject of considerable debate among economists.Unions are far weaker than years ago. The gig economy has replaced full-time jobs with part-time and temporary stints, diluting the power of workers to demand higher pay.A surfeit of global uncertainties \u2014 Brexit, President Trump\u2019s threats to dismantle institutions at the heart of the global order \u2014 have perhaps made companies reluctant to add costs.The weaker pound has given a boost to British exports, making them lower priced than European and American competitors. British whiskey, salmon and chocolate have been selling in increasing volumes.But Britain imports more food than it exports. Many of the country\u2019s key export industries \u2014 automotive, aerospace and medical devices \u2014 draw on suppliers in Europe for components. Even as the weak pound makes the prices of their finished wares more competitive, it also raises their costs.The economy also faces the loss of top-dollar banking jobs as London\u2019s status as a leading international financial center confronts the challenges posed by Brexit. Roughly one-third of the industry\u2019s business involves handling transactions for clients in Europe. Once Britain is out of the European Union, much of that business may be effectively illegal, requiring that banks satisfy the proclivities of regulators in the 27 remaining members of the bloc.The financial industry has been lobbying the government to forge a deal with Europe that would maintain the status quo, enabling the money to keep flowing unimpeded. In weakening Mrs. May\u2019s stature, the election may have increased the chances she will soften her line and assent to compromises that would preserve Britain\u2019s inclusion in the European market.Even so, global banks cannot afford to wait in the hopes that a useful deal will be struck. They are already drawing up plans to move jobs to cities elsewhere in the European Union as they seek to ensure that \u2014 whatever comes \u2014 they will be able to execute all trades. Britain could suffer losses of 15,000 to 80,000 jobs over the next two years, according to studies.Investment continues to grow modestly, because major projects take years to plan and execute. But most economists assume it will slow as Brexit separates the Britain from the rest of the European marketplace, undermining the incentive for multinational companies to use Britain as a regional hub.\u201cAs the outlines of Brexit negotiations begin to take shape, companies are going to be a lot more concerned,\u201d said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. \u201cEven if companies don\u2019t slash investment, they are likely to postpone expansions.\u201dFor now, scrutiny focuses on the increasingly beleaguered British consumer.Outstanding credit card balances across Britain were nearly 10 percent higher in April compared with a year earlier, the fastest pace of growth in more than a decade, the Bank of England disclosed. That stoked worries that consumers could soon exhaust their sources of cash as their paychecks are effectively diminished by inflation.\u201cPeople have been able to borrow to keep consumer spending growing faster than real incomes,\u201d said John Hawksworth, chief economist for PwC UK in London. \u201cThere\u2019s a question mark as to how much the consumer can keep the economy going on its own.\u201dJennifer Corbin, a 48-year-old mother of five who lives in Wembley, northwest London, already has an answer to that question: Her family is economizing, forgoing their annual summer trip to the Canary Islands, where sunshine is abundant.\u201cFood, housing, travel. Everything is more expensive now,\u201d she said at the beginning of a recent three-day weekend, as she and her family awaited a train to a coastal destination that was closer at hand \u2014 Brighton Beach, at the southern reaches of England.There, the forecast was for chilly rain, followed by chillier rain.Advertisement"}

World War I had caused a decline in European sugar production, creating a demand that Cuba rushed to fill, with the building of plantations and factories to satisfy the American market.

{"Headline": "Rangers Are Buying Out Dan Girardi\u2019s Contract", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Rangers said goodbye to a key member of their veteran core on Wednesday, buying out the remaining three years of defenseman Dan Girardi\u2019s contract.Girardi, 33, a career Ranger since his debut in the 2006-7 season, has played more playoff games \u2014 122 \u2014 than any other skater in franchise history. Only goaltender Henrik Lundqvist has more postseason appearances. Girardi also registered 46 goals and 184 assists in 788 regular-season games.The last three years of Girardi\u2019s six-year, $33 million contract had an annual salary cap charge of $5.5 million. The buyout means the Rangers will pay Girardi $1.11 million in each of the next six years while having cap space assigned to his contract at rates of $2.61 million next season, followed by two years of $3.61 million and three seasons of $1.11 million.\u201cI poured my heart and soul into this team for the past 11 seasons and I enjoyed every minute of it,\u201d Girardi said in a statement released by the Rangers.Slowed by injuries in recent seasons, Girardi played all 12 playoff games against Montreal and Ottawa, turning back the clock at times with his longtime partner Ryan McDonagh.But Girardi struggled against the speedy Canadiens and Senators, as did his veteran teammate Marc Staal. Both defensemen had been potential buyout options after the emergence of the rookie Brady Skjei and the newcomer Nick Holden.Staal, 30, has four years remaining on his contract with an annual cap charge of $5.7 million.The Rangers acquired defenseman Brendan Smith at the trade deadline. Smith, an unrestricted free agent, was a key playoff contributor and has expressed interest in re-signing with the Rangers.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely looking at bringing in another young defenseman next year,\u201d Vigneault said last month.Girardi is fifth among Rangers defensemen in career games, behind Harry Howell, Brian Leetch, Ron Greschner and Jim Neilson. Signed by the Rangers as an undrafted free agent in July 2006, Girardi played more games than any other undrafted player in franchise history.\u201cDan Girardi is a clear example of why it is important to believe in yourself and your ability,\u201d said Tom Renney, Girardi\u2019s coach during his first three seasons with the Rangers. \u201cHe is also an example of the need to remain true to what works for you, what makes you an authentic contributor.\u201dThe Rangers have the 21st pick in next week\u2019s N.H.L. draft, in Chicago. It will be the first time they draft in the first round since 2012, when they picked Skjei. The Rangers, who also re-signed forward Matt Puempel on Wednesday, will lose a player to the Vegas Golden Knights in the expansion draft next week in Las Vegas.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Talking to Boys the Way We Talk to Girls", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a Father\u2019s Day breakfast, my 5-year-old son and his classmates sang a song about fathers, crooning about \u201cmy dad who\u2019s big and strong\u201d and \u201cfixes things with his hammer\u201d and, above all else, \u201cis really cool.\u201dNow, there\u2019s nothing wrong with most of these qualities in and of themselves. But when these lyrics are passed down as the defining soundtrack to masculine identity, we limit children\u2019s understanding not just of what it means to be a father but of what it means to be a man \u2014 and a boy, as well.Even boys\u2019 literacy skills seem to be impacted by the taciturn way we expect them to speak. In his book \u201cManhood in America,\u201d Michael Kimmel, the masculine studies researcher and author, maintains that \u201cthe traditional liberal arts curriculum is seen as feminizing by boys.\u201d Nowhere is this truer than in English classes where, as I\u2019ve witnessed after more than 20 years of teaching, boys and young men police each other when other guys display overt interest in literature or creative writing assignments. Typically, nonfiction reading and writing passes muster because it poses little threat for boys. But literary fiction, and especially poetry, are mediums to fear. Why? They\u2019re the language of emotional exposure, purported feminine \u201cweakness\u201d \u2014 the very thing our scripting has taught them to avoid at best, suppress, at worst.Women often say they want men to be emotionally transparent with them. But as the vulnerability and shame expert Bren\u00e9 Brown reveals in her book, \u201cDaring Greatly,\u201d many grow uneasy or even recoil if men take them up on their offer.For three decades the research of Edward Tronick explored the interplay between infants and their mothers. He and his colleagues in the department of newborn medicine at Harvard Medical School discovered that mothers unconsciously interacted with their infant sons more attentively and vigilantly than they did with their infant daughters because the sons needed more support for controlling their emotions. Some of their research found that boys\u2019 emotional reactivity was eventually \u201crestricted or perhaps more change-worthy than the reactivity of girls,\u201d Dr. Tronick noted in an email. Mothers initiated this \u2014 through physical withdrawal.\u201cSo the \u2018manning up\u2019 of infant boys begins early on in their typical interactions,\u201d Dr. Tronick said, \u201cand long before language plays its role.\u201dJudy Chu, a human biologist, conducted a two-year study of 4- and 5-year-old boys and found that they were as astute as girls at reading other people\u2019s emotions and at cultivating close, meaningful friendships. In her book \u201cWhen Boys Become Boys\u201d she maintains that by the time the boys reached first grade, sometimes earlier, they traded their innate empathy for a learned stoicism and greater emotional distance from friends. Interestingly, they adopted this new behavior in public, exclusively, but not at home or when their parents were around.Why do we limit the emotional vocabulary of boys?We tell ourselves we are preparing our sons to fight (literally and figuratively), to compete in a world and economy that\u2019s brutish and callous. The sooner we can groom them for this dystopian future, the better off they\u2019ll be. But the Harvard psychologist Susan David insists the opposite is true: \u201cResearch shows that people who suppress emotions have lower-level resilience and emotional health.\u201dHow can we change this? We can start, says Dr. David, by letting boys experience their emotions, all of them, without judgment \u2014 or by offering them solutions. This means helping them learn the crucial lessons that \u201cEmotions aren\u2019t good or bad\u201d and that \u201ctheir emotions aren\u2019t bigger than they are. They aren\u2019t something to fear.\u201dSay to boys: \u201cI can see that you\u2019re upset,\u201d or ask them, \u201cWhat are you feeling?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s going on for you right now?\u201d There doesn\u2019t have to be any grand plan beyond this, she says. \u201cJust show up for them. Get them talking. Show that you want to hear what they\u2019re saying.\u201dAndrew Reiner teaches at Towson University and is working on a book about masculinity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Michel Temer of Brazil Is Charged With Corruption", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 President Michel Temer was charged with corruption by Brazil\u2019s prosecutor general late Monday. He was accused of taking a $152,000 bribe via an intermediary, an act that, according to the prosecutor general, Rodrigo Janot, \u201chelped to compromise the image of the Federal Republic of Brazil.\u201dMr. Janot said Mr. Temer had agreed to the $152,000 payment from Mr. Batista in exchange for helping to resolve a problem that a Batista company was having with a power plant it owned. He also said Mr. Temer should pay $3 million in moral damages.According to the charges, a further $11 million in bribes was promised, according to the charges, to Mr. Temer and Rodrigo Rocha Loures, a close aide to the president who was filmed taking delivery of a suitcase that the authorities say contained the payment. He was then arrested.Mr. Temer\u2019s fate is now in the hands of Brazil\u2019s Congress. If two-thirds of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, votes to accept the corruption charges or any others that may be coming, and the Supreme Court agrees, he will be suspended for up to 180 days and put on trial.Analysts said he should have enough support in Congress to survive the vote \u2014 for now.Elections are looming next year, and many lawmakers are facing their own corruption investigations. They may well feel safer siding with the government, even one as shaky as Mr. Temer\u2019s, said Marcus Melo, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Pernambuco.\u201cHe is a lame duck, but incredible as it sounds, he can count on this base because they, too, are implicated in many things,\u201d Mr. Melo said.But if the prosecutor general does bring separate charges against Mr. Temer, each one will have to be voted on separately, said Roberto Dias, a professor of constitutional law at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cThe tendency is that each time there is an indictment offered, that the political support that Temer has will be reduced,\u201d he said.None of this bodes well for Mr. Temer\u2019s legislative agenda, an ambitious package of austerity measures that he says is needed to revive Brazil\u2019s economy.Financial markets regard the measures, which include an unpopular overhaul of Brazil\u2019s generous pension system, as crucial to restoring the country\u2019s battered fiscal credibility.So does Mr. Temer, as he made clear on Monday, before the widely anticipated charges were revealed. \u201cThere is no Plan B. We have to keep going,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing will destroy us. Not me nor our ministers.\u201d He has vehemently denied all of the accusations against him, and has often pointed out that Mr. Batista received a generous plea bargain in exchange for cooperating with prosecutors.Mr. Temer did not immediately comment on the charges. Yet the constant flow of allegations has made it difficult for the government to operate, let alone carry out far-reaching plans.Executives at JBS, a Batista company, testified that Mr. Temer had negotiated millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations for his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. In still another case, he faces scrutiny over claims that he negotiated a $40 million bribe for the party in 2010.But so far, Mr. Temer has been able to escape those and other allegations.Mr. Temer will need 172 federal deputies to either abstain from voting or vote against accepting the charge brought by Mr. Janot.Sylvio Costa, the founder of Congress in Focus, an independent monitoring site, said the president\u2019s support was weakening. He said it could be further compromised if there were more revelations, or any sign that Brazil\u2019s economy, which has been showing some faint signs of recovery, is stumbling again.Mr. Temer can count on around 200 to 250 of the 512 deputies in the lower house, compared with about 400 a year ago, Mr. Costa said.A poll released last weekend found that 7 percent of Brazilians approved of Mr. Temer\u2019s administration, 76 percent thought he should resign, and 47 percent felt ashamed to be Brazilian.Datafolha, the polling company, interviewed 2,771 people in 194 cities from June 21 to 23. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.A visit by Mr. Temer to Russia and Norway last week, intended to distract from his problems at home, seemed to highlight them instead.First, his itinerary announced that he would be visiting the Soviet Union. Then the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, told him that Brazil must address its corruption problem, and Norway halved its contribution to an Amazon rain forest fund because deforestation was increasing.Some lawmakers from the center-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a key partner in Mr. Temer\u2019s coalition, have already argued that they should leave the government. On Monday, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former president and elder statesman of the party, said in a newspaper column that Mr. Temer should make a \u201cgrand gesture\u201d and cut short his mandate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nordstrom to Explore Deal to Go Private as Retail Sector Reels", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an industry reeling from bankruptcies, vacant storefronts and plummeting sales, Nordstrom is one of the few department store chains to show promise.The higher-end clothing retailer invested in its e-commerce business early on and was judicious about not opening too many new stores, avoiding many of the pitfalls that are driving other retailers to ruin.But even from a position of relative strength, Nordstrom is struggling to navigate a broad upending of the retail industry, as shopping malls lose their appeal and more customers choose to buy goods online.On Thursday, members of the family that founded Nordstrom in Seattle a century ago \u2014 and who still own a substantial portion of its shares \u2014 said they were exploring ways to shift the company into private ownership.The decision signals the Nordstrom family\u2019s commitment to its core retail business at a time when investors and lenders are deserting the industry in droves.It also reflects optimism that a private equity firm or a sovereign wealth fund would be willing to invest in a large retailer, after many major investors got burned in debt-fueled buyouts that went bust.\u201cNordstrom is the best of the breed,\u201d said David Shiffman, a managing director and a head of the retail group at Peter J. Solomon Company, an investment banking advisory firm. \u201cThis is not a laggard throwing in the towel.\u201dStill, considering going private is an acknowledgment that the public stock market is not a friendly place for companies needing to make costly changes as they compete with online giants like Amazon.By making such a move, Nordstrom would duck the glare of public shareholders and the pressure to constantly produce short-term profits.\u201cThis is a clear signal that the changes that retailers need to make are much more extensive and expensive than public shareholders have the appetite for,\u201d said Joel Bines, a managing director focused on retail at AlixPartners, an advisory firm.Traditional retailers are in a free fall, as physical stores fade as enjoyable, dynamic places to spend an afternoon. On Thursday, the Canadian company that owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor said it would cut 2,000 jobs.Department stores have tried to increase their focus on e-commerce, but many are still weighed down by costly real estate holdings they took on by moving into suburban malls across the United States during better times.How the retail industry evolves has big implications for the economy. The sector employs one in 10 Americans and occupies millions of square feet of commercial real estate.Nordstrom invested in online sales and marketing earlier than many of its peers, while proceeding carefully in opening new stores. The brand is also known for investing in customer service, as other retailers look to cut costs in unprofitable stores, said Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse.\u201cThey are a big exception,\u201d Mr. Buss said.Shares in Nordstrom were up 10 percent on Thursday on the news that a move to private ownership was being considered, giving the company a market value of $7.5 billion.Nordstrom shares had fallen 2.8 percent in the 12 months before that announcement \u2014 far less than other department stores\u2019 shares. But analysts complain that investors have lumped the company in with significantly troubled retailers, leaving its stock undervalued.That could be another motivation for finding a private partner.\u201cThe family is saying they have conviction in the business and see value far beyond where the street is willing to own the stock,\u201d Mr. Shiffman said.Nordstrom was co-founded by the Swedish immigrant John W. Nordstrom, who had moved out West and, eventually, to Alaska in search of gold. He settled in Seattle, where he teamed up with a shoemaker, Carl F. Wallin. They opened their first store in 1901.Members of the Nordstrom family have had the retail business in their blood from the start, and their name has left an indelible mark on Seattle. A medical office tower in the city bears the Nordstrom name, as do lecture and recital halls at Seattle\u2019s downtown art museum and symphony hall.In a city where fleece and T-shirts are more common among workers, employees at Nordstrom\u2019s downtown headquarters stand out for their chic attire, which they are encouraged to buy using employee discounts from the company\u2019s stores.Yet the Nordstroms\u2019 civic profile has been overshadowed to some degree by the area\u2019s newer business icons, including Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, whose company is expected to become the largest apparel retailer in the country this year.It seems unlikely that members of the Nordstrom family, who collectively own about 31 percent of the company\u2019s shares, could buy out the other shareholders without an investment partner like a private equity firm or a large pension fund.The company carries just $2.7 billion in long-term debt, far less proportionally than rivals like Neiman Marcus. That leaves plenty of room for the Nordstroms and any backers they line up to add more debt as part of a going-private deal. The company could also borrow against its real estate to help finance a transaction.The family members exploring the buyout are actively involved in managing the company. They include the co-presidents, Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom, and Erik B. Nordstrom; the president of stores, James F. Nordstrom Jr.; the chairman emeritus, Bruce A. Nordstrom; and Anne E. Gittinger.A Nordstrom spokeswoman declined to comment.Others have had a rougher time. TPG and Leonard Green teamed up with Millard S. Drexler, J. Crew\u2019s chief executive, to take the onetime fashion darling private again for about $3 billion.Other high-end department stores have not fared much better.Neiman Marcus, which has had two sets of private-equity owners in the past decade, planned to return to the public markets. But earlier this year, amid declining sales, it withdrew its plans to go public.Additional reporting by Nick Wingfield.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Fake Democracy", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe tell ourselves stories in order to live, as Joan Didion said. We do this as a nation, as individuals, as families \u2014 even when that construct is demonstrably false. For the United States, the biggest institutional lie of the moment is that we have a government of the people, responding to majority will.On almost every single concern, Congress \u2014 whether it\u2019s the misnamed People\u2019s House, or the Senate, laughably mischaracterized as the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body \u2014 is going against what most of the country wants. And Congress is doing this because there will be no consequences.We have a fake democracy, growing less responsive and less representative by the day.The biggest example of this is the monstrosity of a health care bill, which a cartel of Republicans finally allowed us to peek at on Thursday. The lobbyists have seen it; of course. But for the rest us, our first look at a radical overhaul of one-sixth of the economy, something that touches every American, comes too late to make our voices heard.Crafted in total darkness, the bill may pass by a slim majority of people who have not read it. Inevitably, with something that deprives upward of 23 million Americans of health care, people will die because of this bill. States will be making life and death decisions as they drop the mandated benefits of Obamacare and cut vital care for the poor, the elderly, the sick and the drug-addicted through Medicaid. The sunset of Obamacare is the dawn of death panels.It would be understandable if Republicans were doing this because it\u2019s what most Americans want them to do. But it\u2019s not. Only about 25 percent of Americans approved of a similar version of this bill, the one passed by the House. By a nearly 2 to 1 margin, people would prefer that the Affordable Care Act be kept in place and fixed, rather than junked for this cruel alternative.The Senate bill is \u201cby far, the most harmful piece of legislation I have seen in my lifetime,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders. At age 75, he\u2019s seen a lot.Remember when Republicans used to pretend to care about crafting the people\u2019s business in sunlight? \u201cIt\u2019s simply wrong for legislation that will affect 100 percent of the American people to be negotiated behind closed doors.\u201d That was Mike Pence in 2010.Why are they doing it? Why would the people\u2019s representatives choose to hurt their own people? The answer is further evidence of our failed democracy. About 75 million Americans depend on Medicaid. This bill will make their lives more miserable and perilous in order to give the top 2 percent of wealthiest Americans a tax cut.And where are the 75 million now? They are nowhere. The sad fact is, the poor don\u2019t vote. Up to 80 percent of low earners do not show up at the polls, and it\u2019s even worse in midterm congressional elections. The Republicans can screw the poor, whose population is disproportionately large in red states, because those citizens will not fight back.So, little surprise that Republicans are also working to make it even harder for the poor to vote. They can seek to disenfranchise one class of Americans, and get away with it from the safety of gerrymandered seats.The symptoms of democratic collapse \u2014 from the opioid crises of people who long ago checked out of active citizenship to the stagnation of class mobility \u2014 cry for immediate action.It takes the median worker twice as many hours a month to pay rent in a big city today than it did in the early years of the baby boomer era, as Edward Luce notes in his new book, \u201cThe Retreat of Western Liberalism.\u201d Add towering increases in health care and college costs to that and you\u2019ve got an unclimbable wall between low-income limbo and a chance at the middle class. The United States, once known for our American Dream, now has the lowest class mobility of any Western democracy, according to Luce.What is Congress doing? Nothing on wages. Nothing on college tuition. And the health care bill will most surely force many people to choose between buying groceries and being able to visit a doctor.Our fake democracy reveals itself daily. Less than a third of Americans support President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. In a truly representative government, you would see the other two-thirds, the common-sense majority, howling from the halls of Congress.Most Americans are also against building a wall along the Mexican border. They would prefer putting taxpayers\u2019 billions into roads, bridges, schools and airports. But the wall remains a key part of President Trump\u2019s agenda.Trump is president, of course, despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million people.

{"Headline": "U.N. to Reduce Peacekeepers in Darfur Region of Sudan", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The United Nations Security Council on Thursday approved a major reduction of peacekeepers in Darfur, the vast region of Sudan where violence continues against civilians, according to human rights groups, and millions remain displaced after years of fighting.More than a third of the nearly 19,000 troops and police officers deployed in Darfur will start to be withdrawn, according to a resolution unanimously adopted by the Security Council. The resolution is part of a larger effort, led by the Trump administration, to reduce the United Nations peacekeeping budget.The General Assembly is expected to vote on the new peacekeeping budget on Friday.\u201cWhile it\u2019s hard to predict the immediate effect these cuts would have on civilian protection,\u201d Omer Ismail of the Enough Project, a Washington-based advocacy group, said in an email, \u201cwe know the risk of conflict is high in many of the areas where bases are to be closed and military contingents are to be withdrawn.\u201dMr. Omer added that the withdrawal of peacekeepers \u201cwill make several key areas unsafe for humanitarian operations, likely leading to closures of programs upon which tens of thousands of conflict-affected people rely.\u201dPeter Wilson, Britain\u2019s deputy ambassador, told the Council that the situation remained \u201cfragile\u201d in Darfur, but had \u201cevolved\u201d sufficiently to justify the reduction of peacekeepers. Mr. Wilson said the Security Council would receive more frequent assessments of the situation in Darfur and would re-evaluate the conditions there in six months.The government of Sudan thanked the Security Council, asserting that Darfur was now secure and stable. The country\u2019s president, Omar al-Bashir, has been indicted by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity in connection with his government\u2019s role in the conflict with Darfur rebels since 2003.But Mr. Bashir has refused to cooperate with the court and continues to travel widely. The United States has said it is considering lifting sanctions against Sudan, as Washington has come to increasingly rely on the government\u2019s participation in counterterrorism operations.The United Nations mission in Darfur has come under criticism in the past for not doing enough to protect civilians from being raped or killed. The mission has routinely complained of a lack of cooperation from the government in Khartoum.\u201cThere is no reason to believe that government attacks on civilians and other abuses have ended since the same security forces remain in place,\u201d Daniel Bekele of Human Rights Watch said recently when the peacekeeping reductions were proposed. \u201cThey have never been prosecuted for their crimes and can\u2019t be relied on to protect civilians.\u201dThe cuts that were finally hammered out this week, after intense negotiations with other big funders of the organization, were modest. Diplomats settled on a $7.3 billion budget, equal to what the European Union had proposed and slightly less than what African countries had sought. The United States pays for 28 percent of the peacekeeping budget, the largest share of any country, owing to the size of its economy and its permanent seat on the Security Council. China is the second-largest funder.The United States contributes only a small number of troops and police officers to United Nations missions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did the Jack Welch Model Sow Seeds of G.E.\u2019s Decline?", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor Fortune magazine in 1999, Jack Welch, then General Electric\u2019s chief executive, wasn\u2019t just the country\u2019s best executive, or the manager of the year, but nothing less than the best manager of the 20th century, \u201cfar and away the most influential manager of his generation.\u201dMr. Welch himself was more circumspect. \u201cMy success will be determined by how well my successor grows it in the next 20 years,\u201d he said at a management conference that year.Eighteen years later, with this week\u2019s announcement that Mr. Welch\u2019s handpicked successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, would step down as G.E.\u2019s chief executive, the verdict would appear to be in.\u201cGiven how horrendous the stock performance has been for so many years, the most amazing thing is why the board didn\u2019t act sooner\u201d to replace Mr. Immelt, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Mr. Welch brought much needed energy and charisma to the chief executive\u2019s job and streamlined G.E.\u2019s bloated bureaucracy. Had he stayed on through the financial crisis, perhaps he would have recaptured the growth that eluded Mr. Immelt.But hardly anyone considers Mr. Welch, now 81, a management role model anymore, and the conglomerate model he championed at G.E. \u2014 that with strict discipline, you could successfully manage any business as long as your market share was first or second \u2014 has been thoroughly discredited, at least in the United States.No wonder, given the performance of the company\u2019s stock over the past 10 years. G.E. shares dropped 25 percent during that period, in contrast with a 59 percent rise for the S.&P. 500. The rival industrial conglomerate Honeywell\u2019s stock has more than doubled, and Danaher\u2019s has tripled. United Technologies gained 67 percent.Nonetheless, Mr. Immelt remained one of the country\u2019s highest-paid executives: $21.3 million in 2016, $33 million in 2015, and $37 million in 2014. Even without a formal severance package, Mr. Immelt, 61, will get an additional $211 million when he retires, Fortune estimates.\u201cI\u2019m a long-term G.E. shareholder,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cThe bottom line is, I did poorly and he did very well.\u201dSpeaking of his tenure as G.E.\u2019s leader, Mr. Immelt pointed to the increased strength of the company\u2019s industrial businesses, their competitiveness and large market shares.\u201cI\u2019ll say that will stand the test of time,\u201d he said in an interview on Monday with my colleague Steve Lohr. \u201cLet other people make their own judgments.\u201dMr. Immelt\u2019s defenders have pointed out that he had to contend with the collapse of the tech bubble, the Sept. 11 attacks and the financial crisis, all circumstances beyond his control. But so did the chief executives of every other major company.\u201cAbout the best that can be said is that he enabled G.E. to survive through a difficult time,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, professor of finance and asset management at Columbia. \u201cBut he never really understood how to create value through growth.\u201dAnd he inherited \u201ca highly inflated stock price,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said, thanks to Mr. Welch\u2019s aura and lofty expectations that probably no one could have met.As Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, put it, \u201cIt\u2019s always tough to follow a legend.\u201d\u201cJeff Immelt brought his best every day for 16 years,\u201d Mr. Welch said in a statement. His office said he was not available to comment about his own legacy.Mr. Immelt tacitly repudiated the Welch model himself, moving to dismantle parts of the sprawling G.E. empire by getting rid of NBCUniversal and the once-too-big-to-fail GE Capital. The problem, many critics said, is that he didn\u2019t do so nearly fast enough.\u201cI don\u2019t think Jack Welch was ever as good as he was made out to be,\u201d said Mr. Damodaran, who has spent years trying to value G.E. During Mr. Welch\u2019s tenure, \u201che benefited from the growth of financial services in the American economy and the growth of GE Capital,\u201d Mr. Damodaran added. \u201cThat\u2019s what made it untouchable for so long.\u201dMr. Damodaran said he warned G.E. executives in 2005 that complexity could become a problem. \u201cIf you wanted to create a valuation hell, it would be G.E.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was too complex by design, growing through numerous acquisitions. I told them back then, \u2018You\u2019re getting away with this now, but if there\u2019s ever a crisis, it will come back to haunt you.\u2019\u201dMr. Greenwald, the Columbia professor, agreed that much of G.E.\u2019s success, and then its problems, stemmed from an overreliance on its huge financial services business. \u201cIt was contributing 60 percent of profits, and Jack Welch could always tweak the earnings by turning to GE Capital,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it had no stable source of deposits\u201d to fall back on in the financial crisis.That is the main reason G.E.\u2019s rivals have fared so much better, Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cThey were never the broad conglomerate G.E. was, with huge financing businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re much more focused on industrial production.\u201dBoth Mr. Greenwald and Mr. Damodaran said the Welch conglomerate model had been thoroughly repudiated, so much so that there is a widely recognized \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d applied by investors to the stock prices of companies consisting of businesses with no obvious synergies. Activist investors have pounced on this to urge the breakup of disparate operations, and G.E. itself has been the target of the activist investor Nelson Peltz.\u201cSpecialization is something that provides real value,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a conglomerate, by definition you\u2019re not specialized.\u201dEven companies like Honeywell and United Technologies \u201caren\u2019t trying to do everything,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have areas of specialization.\u201dMr. Damodaran said few of the world\u2019s conglomerates, if any, are superstars.\u201cThey may be doing better than G.E., but they all suffer from similar problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not nimble and adaptable. It\u2019s much harder to be a conglomerate today than it was 20 or 30 years ago. The Welch model is certainly dated. Maybe it\u2019s still used in a few old-line manufacturing businesses, but not in the rest of the economy, where a start-up can destroy your business.\u201dEven though Mr. Immelt deserves praise for abandoning the Welch model, Mr. Damodaran said, he did it much too late. \u201cThey\u2019d be much better off if they\u2019d started sooner,\u201d he said.In a statement, a General Electric spokeswoman said, \u201cToday, G.E. is a more focused industrial company with strong growth opportunities in the long term.\u201dThat left investors salivating for more divestitures or spinoffs. \u201cDoes anyone really think there are any synergies between medical equipment and jet engines?\u201d Mr. Greenwald asked. \u201cA complicated, specialized business like medical equipment would be much better on its own.\u201dMore divestitures may well result in pretty much the same G.E. that Mr. Welch inherited, which is \u201ca boring, mature company,\u201d Mr. Damodaran said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a company that\u2019s going to work miracles. Even if well run, about the best G.E. can hope for is to grow at the rate of the economy. But that may be the best-case scenario. If it tries to rediscover its youth, that would make me nervous.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Easy Money Is Drying Up, and Markets Tremble", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byIt could be time for markets to come down from their sugar highs.After years of injecting trillions of dollars into their economies in an effort to encourage growth, central bankers have become more forthright in signaling an end to easy-money policies.What started as tremors in European government bonds after a speech on Tuesday by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, had spread to global stocks by Thursday.Mr. Draghi called for prudence in policy, and investors seemed to interpret that as a step back from the bank\u2019s commitment to buying European government bonds. Central bank officials were quick to point out that Mr. Draghi did not say that he would tighten policy immediately. But investors apparently ignored that.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, also indicated on Tuesday that an increase in rates might be in order.Those signals have prompted speculation that central bankers may be coordinating efforts to warn investors who benefited from the liquidity boom.Indeed, officials from the Federal Reserve have been saying for several weeks that financial markets were overheated.Investors are also keeping a close eye on the \u201cFaang\u201d stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which dropped briefly in early June. Those stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of market gains, and they are getting more expensive. A sustained fall could also lead to a bear market.Those jumps promised some notable benefits:\u2022 Investors get a bump in their dividends;\u2022 Executives could see their pay packages swell;\u2022 The big institutions might have more flexibility to lend, which could promote more long-term growth.Critics worry, however, that less regulatory pressure could set the stage for a return to the bad old days of enormous leverage and freewheeling.Instead, Rite Aid will sell 2,186 of its 4,600 stores to Walgreens, along with three distribution centers, for $5.18 billion. The announcement sent Rite Aid shares tumbling.The resistance was not unexpected \u2014 the companies\u2019 original $9.3 billion deal would have created a group with more outlets than CVS Health, the biggest drugstore chain by market capitalization in the United States.In spite of hopes that antitrust regulation would ease under President Trump, several deals, including in the health care sector, have been derailed this year.The British authorities have asked regulators to further examine a $15 billion bid by 21st Century Fox to take over the 61 percent of Sky, the European satellite giant, that it does not already own.Rupert Murdoch and his family will now face a review by Britain\u2019s competition authority, but they have dodged a regulatory bullet. The authorities ruled that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, even as they concluded that the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had pointed to \u201csignificant corporate failures.\u201dThe British Office of Communications, or Ofcom, did not hold back in its criticism of the scandal at Fox News, noting that 21st Century Fox was aware of multiple cases against Bill O\u2019Reilly that had led to settlements when it renewed its contract with the former host.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Francis Spufford\u2019s First Novel Is a Swashbuckling Tale", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesThe English writer Francis Spufford has long been a bit of a cult figure. It\u2019s an ardent cult. Once you\u2019ve read his intelligent and ingenious books, many other nonfiction writers seem merely to be issuing, to steal a phrase from a Charles Portis novel, \u201cfoul grunting.\u201dSpufford refuses to occupy a fixed position. His first book was \u201cI May Be Some Time: Ice and the English Imagination,\u201d which appeared in the United States in 1998 after winning several major awards in England.Intellectually he resembles a many-armed Hindu deity, able to pluck fruit and butterflies from anywhere on earth\u2019s most robust tall trees.His new book is another pivot. \u201cGolden Hill\u201d is his first novel, and not a typical first novel (mumbled quasi-memoir) but an ebullient, freewheeling historical fiction set in 18th-century New York City three decades before the Revolutionary War.I am not a terrific fan of historical novels. The weight of the bolts involved in set construction sinks nearly all of them to the lake bottom. \u201cGolden Hill\u201d did not make me rethink that position.But I read it in what felt like 10 minutes, and it left my mind feeling like it had been kissed by some sunburn. Its action is so vivid that you seem to be consuming (imagine Wolf Blitzer\u2019s voice here) breaking news. Delirious storytelling backfilled with this much intelligence is a rare and happy sight.The plot of \u201cGolden Hill,\u201d its fulcrum, at any rate, is as follows: A handsome young stranger named Richard Smith arrives in New York City from London with a promissory note for 1,000 pounds (a fortune, at that time) that he hopes to cash.Local gossip goes into overdrive. Is he an agitator? A spy? A thief on the lam? He refuses to say what he plans to do with his money, should he get it, or whether he intends to remain in the New World. He maintains a pleasant if sphinxlike mien.\u201cWhen a man creeps into a city in time of danger with a bag of gold,\u201d Richard is warned, misadventure may follow. Misadventure occurs. Richard does not escape entirely unharmed.Richard is clearly something of a gentleman. He\u2019s well read, speaks many languages and is up-to-date on British theater. He is slowly drawn into New York society. The depiction of this society is where Spufford especially shines.Everyone knows dinner parties are a form of warfare. Spufford makes this explicit in a scene in which Richard attends a meal put on by a prominent New York family.He is seated at the table so that \u201cCaptain Prettyman and Van Loon senior could rake him from opposite, and Mr. Lovell could contribute enfilading fire from his left, while Hendrick remained just in range should reinforcements be required.\u201dNearby is a complicated young woman named Tabitha, \u201can armament in herself,\u201d whose role in this story keeps unfolding. A thorny love story proposes to take wing.About her, Richard says at a crucial moment, as if he were Hugh Grant finally confronting Andie MacDowell in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d: \u201cI like all of you. I like the bird and I like the cage. I like the polished mind and the rough tongue. I like the tearing claws and the warm hands. I like the monster and I like the girl.\u201dBuried beneath all this are plot facets about which I am loath to do more than hint. Suffice it to say that Richard observes, upon his arrival in New York, how that city has vastly more slaves than London. In the practice of slavery he has taken a special interest.It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to remark, about a book like this one, that the city itself becomes a character. But Spufford conveys a teeming sense of Manhattan, \u201cwhere every alley may yet contain an adventure, every door be back\u2019d by danger, or by pleasure, or by bliss.\u201dAs such, he\u2019s written a high-level entertainment, filled with so much brio that it\u2019s as if each sentence had been dusted with Bolivian marching powder and cornstarch and gently fried. Some of this swashbuckling action goes over the top, but you will probably be turning the pages too quickly to register a complaint.I grew up reading (why? I often ask myself) John Jakes\u2019s leaden historical novels about the American Revolution. What kept me going, I suspect, were the sex scenes \u2014 all those heaving bosoms \u2014 that appeared every 25 pages or so, as reliable as mail delivery.The sex scenes in \u201cGolden Hill\u201d exist solely to advance this novel\u2019s sophisticated meanings. One involves gay men, caught in flagrante, who fear for their lives if exposed.Another involves Richard and a much-older actress, and is related by this novel\u2019s charming narrator, whose identity comes as a fundamental surprise.That moment is a commentary on the very difficulty of writing sex scenes without reaching for the standard metaphoric language: \u201cHow hard it is to describe a desirable woman without running into geography! Or the barnyard. Or the resources of the fruit-bowl.\u201dSpufford\u2019s resources are implausibly deep. As Samuel Taylor Coleridge said of Shakespeare, the fellow is myriad-minded.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zombies, Vampires and Republicans", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZombies have long ruled the Republican Party. The good news is that they may finally be losing their grip \u2014 although they may still return and resume eating conservative brains. The bad news is that even if zombies are in retreat, vampires are taking their place.What are these zombies of which I speak? Among wonks, the term refers to policy ideas that should have been abandoned long ago in the face of evidence and experience, but just keep shambling along.The right\u2019s zombie-in-chief is the insistence that low taxes on the rich are the key to prosperity. This doctrine should have died when Bill Clinton\u2019s tax hike failed to cause the predicted recession and was followed instead by an economic boom. It should have died again when George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts were followed by lackluster growth, then a crash. And it should have died yet again in the aftermath of the 2013 Obama tax hike \u2014 partly expiration of some Bush tax cuts, partly new taxes to pay for Obamacare \u2014 when the economy continued jogging along, adding 200,000 jobs a month.Will this banish the tax-cut zombie? Maybe \u2014 although the economists behind the Kansas debacle, who have of course learned nothing, appear to be the principal movers behind the Trump tax plan, such as it is.Consider what\u2019s happening right now on health care.Clearly, the goal is to pass legislation that will have devastating effects on tens of millions of Americans without giving those expected to pass it, let alone the general public, any real chance to understand what they\u2019re voting for. There are even suggestions that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, might exploit loopholes in the rules to prevent any discussion on the Senate floor.Why this combination of secrecy and speed? Obviously, this legislation can\u2019t survive sunlight \u2014 and I\u2019m by no means the first to make the analogy with vampires.This is unprecedented. Ignore Republican lies about how Obamacare was passed: the Affordable Care Act went through extensive discussion, and Democrats were always very clear about what they were trying to do and how they were trying to do it.So this isn\u2019t a Trump story; it\u2019s about the cynicism and corruption of the whole congressional G.O.P. Remember, it would take just a few conservatives with conscience \u2014 specifically, three Republican senators \u2014 to stop this outrage in its tracks. But right now, it looks as if those principled Republicans don\u2019t exist.Advertisement"}

And there is angry suspicion that lives could have been saved had relatively small sums of additional money been spent on Grenfell for nonflammable material.Britons were already on edge after two fatal terrorist attacks in London and one in Manchester in less than three months, but the London fire disaster, along with the sense that such a horrific accident might have been avoided, has deepened the mood of gloom and soul-searching.Britain\u2019s deadliest fire in more than a century raced from floor to floor, forcing residents to decide: Wait for rescuers or try to escape?Britain faces what the leader of the Birmingham City Council, John Clancy, told the BBC on Saturday was a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d\u201cThe dreadful events in London have understandably triggered an outburst of public anger and demands that councils need to do far more to protect tenants living in high-rise blocks,\u201d Mr. Clancy said.So far, samples from 34 tower blocks in 15 areas in England have shown that the cladding, or aluminum facade, wrapped around the buildings is unsafe, the government said. Other buildings, including privately owned blocks, hospitals, schools and hotels, may also be affected. One hotel chain, Premier Inn, told the BBC that it was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about cladding at buildings in Maidenhead, Brentford and Tottenham.Councils are scrambling to address the problem. Mr. Clancy\u2019s city, for example, plans to equip its 213 high-rise residential buildings with sprinklers. Several others have begun removing the type of cladding that is thought to have helped turn Grenfell into a fireball.The Camden Council, determined that there should be no repeat of the Grenfell catastrophe, insisted on Saturday that it had acted swiftly once it became clear that the homes were fire risks.Residents of one of the five evacuated towers were allowed to return early Saturday morning after the building was judged safe.\u201cGrenfell changes everything, and I just don\u2019t believe we can take any risk with our residents\u2019 safety,\u201d said Georgia Gould, the council leader. She added that the fire service had \u201ctold us they could not guarantee our residents\u2019 safety in those blocks.\u201dSo late Friday night, waking some residents, the council ordered families to leave their homes. They were encouraged to stay with friends and family or were offered hotel rooms, and some slept in emergency reception centers.Despite the warnings, more than 80 people have refused to move. Among some residents here, the sudden evacuation suggested blind panic on the part of city officials.\u201cI am very, very uncomfortable and worried,\u201d Aida Asik Austin said outside the Burnham block, where she, her husband and her son, 11, had spent the night, despite being urged to leave by the police, who had banged on her door at midnight.Ms. Austin now says she has no option but to vacate the apartment, since the gas supply will be disconnected. But she worries that she may be sheltered miles away from her son\u2019s school.Mary Kelly, a resident of the Bray block, told of how she had been watching television when her son called to tell her that her building was being evacuated. \u201cThey are not telling me anything,\u201d said Ms. Kelly, who spent the night at the relief center.Such scenes of displacement and discomfort pose a growing political risk for Mrs. May, who was already weakened after losing her parliamentary majority in an election this month.The prime minister was widely accused of fumbling the original response to the Grenfell Tower disaster, initially failing to meet with survivors. Despite subsequently devoting much time and attention to dealing with the aftermath, her government has rarely seemed in control of events.On Thursday, there was confusion about the number of tower blocks thought to have hazardous cladding similar to Grenfell Tower\u2019s. Downing Street at first suggested that 600 tower blocks, and thousands of families, were at risk \u2014 though that proved to be the total number of high-rise homes with any form of cladding.The government is still unable to say whether the cladding at Grenfell had complied with British building regulations. To add to the worries, landlords of privately owned homes have been only encouraged, not compelled, to send in samples of cladding for testing.Downing Street has said it is investigating whether defective cladding has been used on schools and hospitals, while adding that these tend to be shorter buildings and so less dangerous.On Saturday, Sajid Javid, the secretary of state for communities and local government, told Sky News that the evacuation in Camden had been prompted by concerns beyond cladding, including problems with insulation, fire doors and gas piping.Outside the Burnham block in Camden on Saturday, Claire-Louise Leyland, a Conservative Party councilor, echoed that message, and defended the council\u2019s emergency action. Ms. Leyland had spent much of Friday night trying to persuade residents to evacuate their homes.\u201cIf you are woken up, you are shocked, and people struggle to come to terms with what has happened,\u201d she said of the residents\u2019 reaction.Grenfell Tower, she said, had been such a traumatic event because it undermined some basic assumptions about how to keep people safe. \u201cThe fire was so unprecedented,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have had to question all our procedures.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In French Labor Overhaul, Union Leader Offers a Way to a Compromise", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 As thousands of workers last summer protested changes to France\u2019s labor laws, Laurent Berger, the head of one of the country\u2019s most influential unions, got an unsettling call.\u201cWe\u2019ve just had a profound political shift, so we\u2019re at a turning point where things can really change,\u201d Mr. Berger said in an interview.Much is at stake. Unemployment has been stuck around 10 percent for four years, and the economy has failed to recover from the financial crisis as fast as Germany\u2019s.The idea is to no longer protect jobs for life, while giving people skills to transition to different careers.\u201cWorkers still need protection, but in a globalized world, the economy must be able to adjust, too,\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cIf unions just oppose everything, we\u2019ll never move forward.\u201dAmid Mr. Macron\u2019s rise, Mr. Berger has sometimes painted his union as a moderating influence in France\u2019s labor movement at a crucial moment for the economy. Mr. Berger has pushed for a more flexible approach in France as the forces of globalization change the competitive landscape.Yet he is not immune to protesting when the stakes are high. On Sunday, he urged Mr. Macron to maintain discussions with unions and employer groups \u2014 or risk new demonstrations.Mr. Macron\u2019s plans contain several elements that unions, including the C.F.D.T., see as red lines. Foremost is a proposal to allow employers to negotiate directly with employees on a range of workplace issues, overriding sector-wide accords struck by unions. Labor organizations also oppose a measure to cap compensation awards in unfair dismissal cases.Mr. Berger insists his union is not the government\u2019s foe. An imposing, energetic man from a working-class family in northern France, he became a labor activist after an early career helping disadvantaged and poor people.He is willing to give employers more flexibility to downsize when the economy sours, provided that they hire when conditions improve and that those who lost jobs are protected and retrained.In France, \u201cthere\u2019s a natural conflict between employers and employees,\u201d he said at the C.F.D.T. headquarters, where sun streamed through gleaming windows replacing the ones that had been smashed. \u201cBut does it take a battle or dialogue to build compromise? I choose dialogue.\u201dHis position has engendered detractors, who see the C.F.D.T. as selling out to business interests. The protesters who vandalized his offices denounced him as a traitor. Others wielded signs proclaiming, \u201cWhen slavery is re-established, the C.F.D.T. will negotiate the length of the chains!\u201dYet it would seem to be a strategic move in the era of Mr. Macron, a centrist whose swift rise has upended France\u2019s traditional power balance. His R\u00e9publique en Marche party\u2019s majority in the National Assembly will give him momentum to push a strongly pro-business agenda.Divisions within France\u2019s labor movement may play to Mr. Macron\u2019s advantage. The C.G.T., which traces its roots to the French Communist party, has never been overtaken by another union. It may face challenges if Mr. Berger\u2019s union sets a more moderate tone for trade-offs.Philippe Martinez, the C.G.T.\u2019s leader, has said his organization does not necessarily oppose changes to the labor code. But last week, he maintained threats of mass protests if employee protections are cut too much.Just weeks into his presidency, Mr. Macron has already summoned labor leaders \u2014 starting with Mr. Berger \u2014 for marathon sessions to discuss overhaul plans, which will be fast-tracked through executive orders in summer. Mr. Macron has scheduled 50 more meetings with the unions through July, and more rounds in August and September.\u201cMacron is good at talking to the unions, at giving them something,\u201d said Philippe Aghion, an economics professor at Harvard and at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France who mentored Mr. Macron as a student, and who advises him on labor policy. \u201cHe\u2019ll take what they say into account.\u201dStill, Mr. Macron\u2019s political wins mask weaknesses that are not lost on union leaders. His parliamentary victory was overshadowed by record-low voter turnout. And many who backed Mr. Macron for president did so to keep his rival, the far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen, from winning \u2014 not to see him weaken labor protections.\u201cRight now, people are saying, \u2018He\u2019s just been elected president, let\u2019s give him a chance,\u2019\u201d Jean-Claude Mailly, the leader of Force Ouvri\u00e8re, the third-largest union, said at a recent news briefing. \u201cBut there\u2019s real anger in France.\u201dIn the current discontent, Mr. Berger is similarly walking a fine line between playing a leadership role during the president\u2019s overhaul drive, and placating members of his own union wary of radical change. Still, Mr. Berger insists he is not aiming to incite mass protests just yet.\u201cThere\u2019s a mentality in France that says we should cut off the heads of those at the top,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also a French tendency to focus on things that could go wrong.\u201dHe paused, then continued in a firm voice. \u201cWe can change that,\u201d he said.\u201cI have no desire to be among those who keep saying, \u2018None of this will work.\u2019 It has to work,\u201d Mr. Berger added. \u201cBecause if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll wind up with Le Pen in another five years. And things will be much, much worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Does Donald Trump Still Think Climate Change Is a Hoax? No One Can Say", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI have not had an opportunity to have that discussion,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.In announcing his decision to exit the Paris accord, President Trump scorned the Green Climate Fund. Does the United States contribute an outsize share?Mr. Trump offered no opportunity for anyone to ask him that on Friday. But his current views, whatever they may be, presumably shaped his thinking as he evaluated whether to remain in the Paris accord. Given that he promised on Thursday to seek to re-enter the pact on better terms or negotiate an entirely new deal that he said would be fairer to the United States, his acceptance or denial of climate science seems likely to determine his approach.But administration officials clearly saw no benefit in clarifying. If they affirmed that he still believed climate change to be fake, they would expose him to even more criticism at home and abroad and complicate the lives of those advisers who accept the broad scientific consensus. If they asserted that he had changed his mind and now agreed that climate change is real, then they would have to explain a flip-flop while risking criticism from his own base.Climate science deniers, cheered by his decision to pull out of the Paris agreement, seemed willing to live without a clearer statement taking on what they call the bogus claims of environmental advocates.\u201cI think his withdrawing us from Paris was the greatest action by a president in my lifetime,\u201d said Steve Milloy, who runs a website, JunkScience.com, which aims to debunk climate change and who served on Mr. Trump\u2019s environmental transition team. \u201cAnd he explained his action brilliantly. Most substantive explanation I\u2019ve ever heard from a president \u2014 including Reagan.\u201d\u201cWhat he believes,\u201d Mr. Milloy added, \u201cyou need to get from him.\u201dSupporters of the Paris accord said the White House refusal to outline Mr. Trump\u2019s beliefs on climate change indicated that he had not bothered to inform himself on the issue before making a decision with enormous consequences. \u201cBy not admitting what his views on this, the White House is just hiding the fact that Trump is too incurious to actually look seriously at the issue,\u201d said Andrew Light, a former Obama State Department official who helped negotiate the Paris pact.Carol Browner, a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator under Bill Clinton and adviser to Mr. Obama, said Mr. Trump\u2019s action seemed founded on misinformation. \u201cSeems he accepts junk science in his decision making which makes you wonder if next he will repeal bans on indoor smoking and put lead back in paint,\u201d she said.Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the E.P.A. and a longtime critic of what he calls \u201cclimate exaggerators,\u201d said the question of what Mr. Trump believed about the science never came up during the administration\u2019s deliberations over the Paris agreement.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about all the discussions that we had through the last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue: Is Paris good or not for this country?\u201d he told reporters at the White House. \u201cThat\u2019s the discussions I\u2019ve had with the president.\u201dMr. Pruitt and other administration officials defended Mr. Trump\u2019s decision as a courageous action to protect the United States. \u201cWe have nothing to be apologetic about as a country,\u201d he said, noting that the country has reduced its carbon emissions in recent years, attributing that to innovation and technology rather than government regulation.\u201cSo, when we look at issues like this, we are leading with action and not words,\u201d he said. \u201cI also want to say that exiting Paris does not mean disengagement.\u201dDescribing his own views, Mr. Pruitt derided those \u201cclimate exaggerators,\u201d who he said make assertions with great certainty. Mr. Pruitt said he has concluded that \u201cglobal warming is occurring, that human activity contributes to it in some manner\u201d but \u201cmeasuring with precision, from my perspective, the degree of human contribution is very challenging.\u201dMr. Trump has not been so shy in the past about his opinions on the subject. At one point in 2009, he signed an open letter to Mr. Obama published as an ad in newspapers supporting \u201cmeaningful and effective measures to control climate change,\u201d although that may have just reflected the influence of the three adult children who also signed.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.As he opened his presidential campaign, he told Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio host, that the weather changed naturally over time and that there was not a major problem. \u201cI\u2019m not a believer in global warming,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a believer in man-made global warming.\u201d\u201cI have a very open mind,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we\u2019re going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind.\u201dBy this week, however, Mr. Trump was no longer speaking his mind on the question of the science, and neither were his aides.Mr. Spicer said twice this week that he had not had the chance to ask the president. Asked if he would find time to take the question to Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cIf I can, I will.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Higher Education Seeks Answers to Leaner Years", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn uncertain futureWith an important source of revenue down and the flow of customers flattening out, one of the biggest businesses in Georgia \u2014 its public university system \u2014 is turning to a strategy of consolidations and mergers to improve efficiency and cut costs.The universities are putting some of the resulting $24 million in savings into efforts to reduce the number of dropouts. That beefs up the bottom line, too: It\u2019s cheaper to help a student stay in school than to recruit a new one.Dramatic changes like these are essential, Chancellor Steve Wrigley told his Board of Regents in April. \u201cWe inherited a system largely conceived in the 1960s,\u201d Mr. Wrigley said. \u201cBut times, society and students have all changed dramatically.\u201dThat is not only true in Georgia. Other colleges and universities across the country are also responding (albeit sometimes slowly) to challenges threatening their traditional role in society if not their survival.Because of a dip in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds, among other reasons, for example, enrollment has been dropping for five years, meaning that there are about 300,000 fewer undergraduates to divvy up among America\u2019s campuses than there used to be.To fill seats, colleges are engaged in an arms race of discounts that they increasingly cannot afford \u2014 discounts so deep that, while their sticker prices appear to be rising ahead of the inflation rate, the schools are actually seeing their net tuition revenue decline. Many small, private nonprofit colleges are giving away a record 51 percent of their tuition income in the form of discounts, according to new figures from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.All of these pressures mean something has to give, and that includes upkeep. Colleges and universities face a combined shortfall of $30 billion for needed repairs and renovations, according to the APPA, formerly the Association of Physical Plant Administrators.But in another bid to attract students, they keep building more, spending $11.6 billion last year on new construction, the private firm Dodge Data and Analytics says. That is adding not only more space the universities will have to maintain, but billions of dollars in debt on which someone will have to pay the interest.\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental lack of understanding about the strains that higher education is under,\u201d said Susan Fitzgerald, who tracks them as a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s.James Soto Antony, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who focuses on education leadership, said that people imagine that all universities look like the one where he works. \u201cThey see this $36 billion endowment and the manicured lawns and they impute that onto all colleges and universities,\u201d Mr. Antony said. \u201cAnd most of them are not like that. They are dramatically struggling for enrollment.\u201dHere\u2019s how thin: Thanks to rising discounts, small colleges reported an average revenue increase per freshman of just two-tenths of a percent last year, which means they lost ground when inflation is accounted for.Ken Redd, director of research and policy analysis at the business officers association, said: \u201cAre there enough students out there? Is there enough money out there in a time of declining enrollment to support all of those schools. Based on what we see now, you\u2019d have to say the answer is no.\u201dChief business officers on campuses agree with him. More than four in 10 don\u2019t think their current financing models are sustainable. \u201cHearing that from the chief business officers is very telling,\u201d Mr. Redd said.So universities and colleges are getting serious about other kinds of reforms. Some, as in Georgia, are dramatic \u2014 and controversial. Several campus mergers there were announced only days before they were voted on by the Board of Regents, without enough notice for the public to sign up to comment. A similar proposal was put on the table in April by the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (which does not include the University of Connecticut) in the wake of an enrollment drop and state budget cuts, only to be protested by faculty and students.\u201cChange is not easy, particularly when you\u2019ve got institutions that have been around for 100 years\u201d said Charlie Sutlive, vice chancellor for communications and governmental affairs at the University System of Georgia.That \u201cis tied as directly as possible to institutional financial health,\u201d said George L. Mehaffy, vice president for academic leadership and change at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, which is involved in the project. \u201cIf you increase the number of students you retain and graduate, it dramatically affects your bottom line.\u201d\u201cWe know what works,\u201d said Travis Reindl, senior communications officer at the Gates Foundation, \u201cand we know there is a core set of diverse institutions with pockets of solutions and innovations going on, but they\u2019ve never been brought together like this.\u201dRichard D. Legon, president of the association, said that fixing higher education \u201crequires a collaborative partnership that benefits from some of the creativity and ingenuity board members bring to the table, working with institutional leadership to ensure that students, who are really in a customer mode, want to shop at your place.\u201dNot everyone is doing this work. \u201cThere are some colleges that are very realistic about the challenges they\u2019re facing,\u201d said Ms. Fitzgerald of Moody\u2019s. \u201cThere are others that still have their heads in the sand and think that things are going to get better.\u201dBut the activity that is underway represents \u201ca sea change,\u201d Mr. Mehaffy said. \u201cThere was an era when institutions sort of just moved on. The funds were relatively good, the students were standing in line. And today\u2019s environment is dramatically different. It is a time of enormous strains, but the good news is that it\u2019s a moment of growing action.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of a college at the University of Georgia.

They had become resigned to the notion that the European Union\u2019s moment in history was over. Six months later, nothing is different, yet everything has changed.Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decisive victories in France \u2014 first in the presidential election in May and then again in parliamentary elections last week \u2014 on a proudly pro-European platform have led many Europeans to believe that rather than disintegration, further integration may now be possible. The hope among the ever-closer-unionists is that Mr. Macron\u2019s labor reforms in France will persuade Germany to invest more in eurozone economies. Meanwhile, plans for further investment in European defense are afoot.The answer is quite straightforward. The governments in Poland and Hungary fear that further political integration will endanger the illiberal regimes they have put in place, while many Eastern Europeans fear that any Macron-Merkel initiative could result in a two-tiered Europe where they are second-class citizens.But while a majority of the Eastern European elite is suspicious of Mr. Macron\u2019s policies, some argue that the politics of low wages is the major reason for the huge outflow of people from their region. In some countries, more than 10 percent of the population has left to work abroad. The International Monetary Fund calculates that if the outflow continues at current rates, Central, Eastern and southeastern Europe will lose around 9 percent of their expected gross domestic product from 2015 to 2030.But while the Merkel-Macron strategy presents a challenge to Central Europe\u2019s economy, the reality of a two-class Europe presents a strategic risk.Central European resistance to the new Berlin-Paris axis may usher in a different taste of Europe altogether. These countries now face a choice between deeper integration on terms set by Germany and France or political marginalization \u2014 and the fears of a two-tiered European Union could become self-fulfilling prophecies.Unfortunately, the illiberal turn in Hungary and Poland \u2014 marked by attempts to control the courts, tame independent news media, and interfere in civil society (not to mention politicians\u2019 base nationalistic rhetoric) \u2014 has forced many Western Europeans to close their ears to what may be in some instances legitimate Central European grievances.The refugee crisis is a case in point. For Western Europeans, the Polish, Czech and Hungarian refusal to accept resettlement quotas adopted by Brussels in 2015 demonstrates that the Eastern European countries lack the solidarity necessary for the European Union. Eastern Europeans, on the other hand, rightly insist that the solidarity imperative must not trump a democratic mandate, and who belongs to a community is an existential question to be decided solely by democratically elected governments. The problem is that Hungary\u2019s hysterical anti-refugee language has made it easy for other Europeans to dismiss Central Europe\u2019s legitimate fears as objectionable nationalism.The governments in the region faced with Merkel-Macron initiative to reorder the union will soon be forced to choose between a future of deeper integration with Western Europe, or a future where Central Europe is increasingly marginalized. It\u2019s a choice between Emmanuel Macron and Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s hard-line nationalist prime minister. The jury is out on which choice governments will make. But Central Europe\u2019s 20th-century experience may be summarized by the adage, \u201cIf you are not at the table, you are on the menu.\u201dIvan Krastev, the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies, a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna and a contributing opinion writer, is the author, most recently, of \u201cAfter Europe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Is one type of oppressive regime better than the other? For President Trump, the answer is obviously \u201cyes.\u201d Mr. Trump seems to hate oppressive regimes that convert private property into public goods for the benefit of the people, but he loves oppressive regimes that convert public goods into private property for the benefit of a few rich friends.To the Editor:Kudos to President Trump for demanding that Cuba finally turn over a parade of criminals who have sought sanctuary on the Communist island for decades. Finally we have a titanium-spined president who isn\u2019t afraid to use America\u2019s military and economic might as leverage over these tin-pot dictators who under previous administrations made us the laughingstock of the world.Like him or not, Mr. Trump\u2019s election was a seismic game-changer for America\u2019s foreign and domestic policy, and I believe that it would be catastrophic if we were to go back to the way it was pre-Trump.EUGENE R. DUNN, MEDFORD, N.Y.To the Editor:As one of the 600,000 American tourists who visited Cuba in 2016, I can attest to the positive changes that President Barack Obama\u2019s lifting of travel and diplomatic restrictions has had for countless ordinary Cubans. The contrast between what I observed in a previous trip to Cuba in 1978 and last year was dramatic.The difference could be seen in the satisfaction of the elderly woman who has transformed her humble home into a B&B, the entrepreneurial energy of the 30-somethings who are building their tour guide business, and the joy in the eyes of a young gay couple now free to pursue their dreams openly. Fidel Castro has died, his brother Ra\u00fal is to retire in 2018, and a more pragmatic successor is in the wings.Problems remain, including a state-dominated mass media environment, a largely noncompetitive political system, inadequate internet access, and growing inequality between Cubans who are involved in the tourist economy and those outside that booming sector. But none of these problems will be lessened by reimposing pre-Obama restrictions \u2014 quite the contrary.The writer is a past president of the Latin American Studies Association.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frank Lloyd Wright House, a Demolition Target, Is Now an Architecture School\u2019s Lifeline", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStill, Mr. Rawling, 35, had to figure out what to do with the house \u2014 2,500 square feet of coiled concrete built in 1952 in an exclusive neighborhood called Arcadia and now in need of some care. He knew he wanted to open its doors so that others could experience its unique design, just as he had as a child when he toured the house with his mother, a second-grade teacher.\u201cI wanted people to be inspired and hopefully bring some of Wright\u2019s creativity into their lives,\u201d Mr. Rawling said.On Thursday, the 150th anniversary of Wright\u2019s birth, Mr. Rawling officially donated the house to the architecture school, expanding its footprint into the heart of one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States.At a time when so many historic properties have been \u201cbladed and graded over, ignored and pushed aside,\u201d he said, \u201cour students will have the opportunity to study the house, learn from the house, understand it and work on reconstructing it.\u201dThe school\u2019s problems were structural, much like the problems with the Wright house, whose cantilever needs to be jacked up so that one of its corners does not continue to sag.Starting in 2010, the school and its nonprofit sponsoring organization, the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, had to separate so that the school could continue to operate as an accredited institution of higher education. Without the separation, students could have lost access to government-backed loans and the school would have had to close, Mr. Betsky said.It has since reinvented itself, changing its name \u2014 it used to be known as the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture \u2014 and appointing a new dean, Mr. Betsky, the former director of the Cincinnati Art Museum. It continues to operate from its two original campuses, Taliesin, Wright\u2019s home in Spring Green, Wis., and Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Ariz., a national historic landmark.This fall, a rotating cast of professors and students will move in and design while there, Mr. Betsky said. Through partnerships, the school hopes to bring in small groups of public-school students who are interested in an architecture career.The house stands as an ode to bygone times.Its spiral design is meant to capture the wind that blows from any direction and to invite the desert in. Victor Sidy, an architect in charge of preservation and planning at the house, said Wright\u2019s idea was to \u201cmake a new model of community for America,\u201d gathering people and landscape together in one place.It is also an intimate space, which David Wright and his wife, Gladys, called home until their deaths \u2014 he in 1997, at the age of 102, and she in 2008, at 104. Their children sold the house in 2009 to people they thought would restore it as their residence.

{"Headline": "U.S. Unemployment at 16-Year Low, but Economy\u2019s Weak Spots Remain", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe milestone on the jobless rate came with a middling increase of 138,000 in payrolls and revisions that reduced the gains in the previous two months. It mainly reflected a decline in the share of working-age adults who have a job or are in the market for one.The judgment of what constitutes strong or tepid job growth has shifted as the expansion ages. With more baby boomers retiring each year, economists estimate that the monthly addition of roughly 100,000 jobs should be enough to absorb those entering the work force, including newly minted graduates.Only twice in the last eight months has that 200,000 figure been reached; the average over the last three months has been 121,000. Analysts are split on whether the slower pace is a sign of the labor market\u2019s tightness or its slack. Those who believe the economy is reaching full capacity, or is already there, argue that there are just not that many available workers left.\u201cSince 2012, this has been a tremendous period of steady, solid job growth \u2014 historic in many ways \u2014 that has slowly absorbed most if not all of the underemployed and unemployed people last year,\u201d said Alan MacEachin, chief corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\u201cWe\u2019ve really had to change our tactics of how we source associates,\u201d Mr. Traylor said. His company has begun working with high schools and community colleges to interest students in entry-level manufacturing and distribution jobs \u2014 paying about $15 an hour \u2014 which have been particularly hard to fill.Skeptics argue that if the labor market were truly stretched, wages would be rising faster. Instead, year-over-year wage growth has declined since the end of last year to 2.5 percent, just a nose in front of inflation.The skeptics included bond traders who drove yields down on Friday, betting that even if the Fed goes ahead with a rate increase this month, it will think twice about further moves in the second half of the year.\u201cThat\u2019s always ugly,\u201d said Mr. North, the Euler Hermes economist.Among political leaders, responses predictably split along partisan lines.\u201cWe\u2019re not worried about slowing job growth,\u201d Gary D.

{"Headline": "Deposed Saudi Prince Is Said to Be Confined to Palace", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The recently deposed crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Nayef, has been barred from leaving the kingdom and confined to his palace in the coastal city of Jidda, according to four current and former American officials and Saudis close to the royal family.The new restrictions on the man who until last week was next in line to the throne and ran the kingdom\u2019s powerful internal security services sought to limit any potential opposition for the new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, 31, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize relationships with Saudi royals.It was unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place. An adviser to the Saudi royal court referred queries to the Information Ministry, whose officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. A senior official in the Saudi Foreign Ministry reached by telephone on Wednesday night described the account as \u201cbaseless and false.\u201dThe elder prince was also replaced as interior minister by a 33-year-old nephew, marking the end of a career that had won him deep respect in Washington and other foreign capitals for his work dismantling Al Qaeda\u2019s networks inside the kingdom after a string of deadly bombings a decade ago.Supporters of Mohammed bin Salman, often referred to as M.B.S., have lauded his promotion, saying it empowered a young, ambitious prince who has laid out a positive vision for the kingdom\u2019s future.But his elevation effectively ended the political prospects of many older princes, some of whom consider him rash, power hungry and inexperienced. Prince Mohammed also serves as the kingdom\u2019s defense minister, putting him in charge of Saudi Arabia\u2019s costly military intervention against the Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen.Saudi state news media has gone out of its way to portray a smooth transition, repeatedly broadcasting a video showing Mohammed bin Salman deferentially kissing the hand of Mohammed bin Nayef, often referred to as M.B.N., who wishes him well.But the restrictions placed on the elder prince suggest fear that some members of the sprawling royal family are upset with the change, and that public appearances by him could exacerbate such sentiments.\u201cIt\u2019s an indication that M.B.S. does not want any opposition,\u201d a senior United States official said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want any rear-guard action within the family. He wants a straight elevation without any dissent \u2014 not that M.B.N. was plotting anything anyway.\u201dThe official said the United States government was in contact with the Saudi Interior Ministry, but that American officials had not had any formal contact with Mohammed bin Nayef and were monitoring the situation closely.\u201cM.B.N. has been such a great friend and partner of the U.S., we would not want to see him treated inelegantly or indecorously,\u201d the senior American official said.Since Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s removal from the line of succession, several veteran American counterterrorism and intelligence officials who had strong relationships with him have privately expressed outrage at his treatment. But they were wary of speaking publicly given the strong support for King Salman and his son from President Trump and other top aides, including Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law.The restrictions have also been imposed on Mohammed bin Nayef\u2019s daughters, according to a former American official who maintains ties to Saudi royals. A married daughter was told that her husband and their child could leave their home while she had to stay, the former official said.One Saudi close to the royal family said the new restrictions had been imposed almost immediately after Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s promotion.After the announcement, Mohammed bin Nayef returned to his palace in Jidda to find that his trusted guards had been replaced by guards loyal to Mohammed bin Salman, according to the Saudi and a former American official. Since then, he has been prevented from leaving the palace.Another former American official with close contacts with the royal family confirmed that Mohammed bin Nayef had been barred from leaving the kingdom, but said he had not heard that he had been restricted to his palace.His rise came at the expense of Mohammed bin Nayef, who has maintained a low profile while developing strong relationships with successive American administrations and intelligence officials.During Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s rise, American officials had struggled to build relationships with both princes while trying not to be used as leverage in any rivalry between them.Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s elevation has been accompanied by that of a number of other young princes. One of his brothers, Khalid bin Salman, was recently named the ambassador to Washington. He is believed to be in his late 20s.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and Eric Schmitt and Mark Mazzetti from Washington. Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corruption Crackdown Intensifies in Tunisia, and the People Cheer", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTUNIS \u2014 The Tunisian prime minister has embarked on a sweeping crackdown against organized crime, arresting nearly a dozen mafia bosses and smuggling barons in recent weeks in an effort to stamp out what has become a nearly existential threat to the young democracy.The drive has surprised nearly everyone for its vigor, but it is not without risks, as the mafia bosses have become so powerful that financial and political analysts say they present a threat as dangerous as terrorism.\u201cIt is a war, not a one-off battle,\u201d Mr. Chahed, 41, a soft-spoken agricultural engineer, who worked for several years on development programs at the United States Embassy in Tunis, said in an interview this month. \u201cWe are going to continue to the end. It is very important for the Tunisian economy, for the security of the territory.\u201dThe popular uprising in 2010 that overthrew the 23-year dictatorship of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was fueled by the venality of his family and the relatives of his wife, Leila Trabelsi.Yet since then the problem of corruption has only worsened. Whereas it used to benefit just a tight circle around the president, it now encompasses a wider circle of thousands.Over the last several years it has infected large portions of the public sector in what has become known as the \u201cdemocratization of corruption,\u201d as crime bosses have paid for influence in the media, political parties and the police and judiciary.Mr. Chahed declared a war on corruption when he took over the government in August, with little evident progress. But now he is casting the problem as a security issue.\u201cWe are persuaded there is a link between smuggling, terrorism financing, cross-border activities and also capital flight,\u201d Mr. Chahed said, promising more arrests ahead.Already they are piling up. This month, Moncef el Materi, a close associate linked by marriage to the former president and his wife, was arrested in France, apparently at the request of the Tunisian authorities. He had been wanted since 2011.One of the biggest smuggling barons, Chafik Jarraya, was arrested May 23 and charged with treason and intelligence links to a neighboring country \u2014 widely understood to be Libya. He is in military custody and will appear before a military tribunal.At least nine others have been detained under the country\u2019s state of emergency law. Preliminary charges include smuggling, the illegal registration of real estate and failure to report income, according to news agency reports.Human Rights Watch, among others, has criticized the government\u2019s use of a military tribunal and state of emergency laws to try civilians, but the prime minister insisted that everything was within the law.\u201cWe are not targeting people but the whole system,\u201d he added. \u201cOur aim is to dissect the systems of trafficking, to break the smuggling networks and to reveal the financing and sites of this phenomenon.\u201dCorruption has been suffocating Tunisia\u2019s economy, which was already battered by a wave of bloody terrorism attacks in 2015 and 2016. Corruption in public contracting alone is costing the country nearly $1 billion a year, according to Chawki Tabib, the head of the anticorruption agency.The most serious abuse is within public institutions, and involves hundreds of civil servants and members of the administration, as well as officials in Tunisia\u2019s maritime ports and customs areas. Already, 21 customs officials have been removed from their posts, and 35 others have been referred to a disciplinary tribunal.Mr. Chahed, who will visit the United States next month to push for more security assistance and investment in Tunisia, has been under growing pressure from international financial institutions to take on the problem. Yet it may have been startling revelations from one of the biggest criminal bosses that left him with little choice but to act.Mr. Trabelsi, 42, is already behind bars, sentenced to 108 years for various charges of embezzlement and fraud for his business activities during the dictatorship, but his videotaped testimony from prison shocked the country.For the first time, a member of Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s family circle openly described how he had built his business empire by bribing customs officials and using his presidential connections to monopolize import concessions and flout legal and financial regulations.\u201cIf you have someone at the customs, you have no problem,\u201d Mr. Trabelsi said. \u201cI was generous with the customs officials. They knew that I paid four or five times more than the others.\u201dHe fingered some of his partners in crime, and said even high-level bureaucrats had been quick to help, adding that corruption was still going on.\u201cThere has been a revolution, but nothing has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to what I hear, the same system is still operational.\u201dThree days later, the prime minister acted, arresting, among others, several former business associates of Mr. Trabelsi.\u201cI think they seized this opportunity to do what they had not dared,\u201d said Sihem Bensedrine, the president of the Truth and Dignity Commission, which has a mandate to uncover human rights and financial abuses during nearly 60 years of authoritarian rule. \u201cMaybe this is a first step, it is good that they started.\u201dImmediately after the revolution, the government confiscated property and businesses owned by Mr. Ben Ali and his family. A commission to investigate corruption in and embezzlement by the former government, led by an eminent law professor, Abdelfattah Amar, produced a 300-page report, with documents found in the presidential palace, and referred 459 cases to the courts.Yet according to Mr. Tabib, the head of the anticorruption agency, only 40 of those cases have been brought to a successful conclusion. Successive governments failed to provide a budget for the commission, bringing work to a standstill. The judiciary, nominally independent, has been accused of delays and corruption.Mr. Chahed\u2019s government has been promising more action, yet it has been sending mixed signals. It passed a law for access to information, and another to protect whistle-blowers, but also supports a reconciliation law for businessmen under investigation that opponents say would whitewash their crimes.Mr. Chahed insists that steady work is going on, of which the arrests are just part. Mr. Tabib now has 30 investigators in his anticorruption commission, and money is being put into training 500 more magistrates.The prime minister is discovering that there is popular support for his drive. In a recent survey by the International Republican Institute, 89 percent of Tunisians described the economy as being in a bad way and 85 percent said they felt that action against corruption was the solution.\u201cPeople are telling him if you do it you\u2019ll become a national hero,\u201d said Achraf Aouadi, president of I-Watch, an anticorruption advocacy movement in Tunis. \u201cIt\u2019s the jackpot.\u201dLilia Blaise contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Restructuring Deal That Helps Investors, Not Puerto Rico", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneWhile it\u2019s not clear if there are sharks in the waters surrounding Puerto Rico, the island does have sharks of a different kind \u2014 ones that hail from mainland hedge funds, municipal bond funds and insurance companies that insure against bond defaults.The human sharks have been circling Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds, given that the island has more than $70 billion of debt that has defaulted or is in danger of doing so.Some investors have been holding the island\u2019s debt for years, but others have more recently snatched up Puerto Rico-related bonds for significantly less than 100 cents on the dollar. They want a debt restructuring that gives them a big fat profit.The fighting is particularly fierce at the moment over what will happen to $9 billion worth of bonds that were issued by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.After several years of difficult negotiations, the authority, known as Prepa, reached an agreement in April with its creditors, which include the hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital, bond funds managed by Oppenheimer and Franklin Templeton and insurance companies like MBIA and Assured Guaranty, which are obligated to make up the difference between the negotiated recovery of the bonds and 100 cents on the dollar.Like everything having to do with Puerto Rico and its finances, the deal cut between the power authority, which is owned by the municipal government, and its creditors is complex.But the gist of it is that the creditors are hoping to get a present value recovery of around 75 cents on the dollar: new bonds with a face amount of 85 cents on the dollar, issued at a below market interest rate.It\u2019s great deal for the creditors, given what rough shape Prepa is in operationally. Puerto Ricans pay some of the highest electricity rates around \u2014 in the vicinity of 21 cents per kilowatt-hour. (New Yorkers pay nearly 25 cents per kilowatt-hour, one of the highest rates in the United States.) And Prepa has projected the rate to rise to as much as 30 cents per kilowatt-hour.There are also problems with patronage and the high costs of labor, pensions and the fuel that powers the electricity generators. The deal with creditors does defer principal and interest payments that free up $2.2 billion to be used on capital improvements. But with a physical plant woefully in need of repairs and an upgrade, that will not be enough.And there will also be a monthly surcharge on the bills of consumers and businesses in Puerto Rico that will be dedicated to pay the interest and principal payments on the newly issued debt.In other words, if the restructuring deal as proposed is approved, Prepa\u2019s customers \u2014 both consumers and businesses \u2014 effectively will be taxed in order for the hedge funds and other creditors that bought the bonds at a discount to make a profit. That\u2019s a profit that cannot be renegotiated if Prepa again finds itself in financial distress down the road because the new revenue generated from the surcharge will be placed in a new, bankruptcy-remote entity for the creditors\u2019 benefit.Worse, as electricity use falls with the continuing exodus of the island\u2019s residents and businesses, those that remain will pay higher and higher surcharges to meet the Prepa debt payments.It is unfair to tax the people and businesses of Puerto Rico so that investors can make hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. It makes no sense to restructure the debt of the company without fixing its operational problems, or at least to have a restructuring that addresses both operational and financial problems.Puerto Ricans deserve a restructuring plan that provides them with affordable electricity on a realistic future timetable. What is being proposed virtually guarantees that they will still pay unusually high rates for electricity so that a few hedge funds and bond funds can make a profit and so that the insurance companies can avoid paying up for their poor underwriting decisions.The restructuring with the bondholders started before the June 2016 passage of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, known as Promesa. That law allowed Puerto Rico\u2019s other debts to be restructured in a way similar to how bankruptcy works in the United States, with a judge approving a deal that issues new debt based upon what a debtor can reasonably be expected to pay while also making necessary operational fixes, too.The power authority\u2019s creditors claim the company received a waiver exempting it from Promesa. That\u2019s not fair, since the new act gives debtors like Prepa far more leverage to negotiate \u2014 leverage the power authority didn\u2019t have years ago when it started the negotiation with its creditors.The deal the authority cut with its creditors before Promesa should be junked. It\u2019s a windfall for hedge funds and the insurance companies and it brutalizes the people and businesses of Puerto Rico. Prepa should restart the negotiation with creditors, under the auspices of the Promesa law, and make sure that any debt restructuring is paired with the operational fixes that the power authority desperately needs.The creditors know they have a great deal for themselves. That explains why they are lobbying Republicans in Congress and are working overtime to persuade the independent Prepa board to approve the restructuring as is.The creditors\u2019 lobbying is having an effect. On June 15, Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, wrote a letter to Jos\u00e9 B. Carri\u00f3n III, the chairman of the financial oversight and management board of Puerto Rico, urging the board to approve the Prepa restructuring as is.A day later, two other members of Congress, Representatives Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, Democrat of New York, and Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, urged Mr. Carri\u00f3n to reject the restructuring. \u201cHigher electricity costs are detrimental to the local economy, causing businesses both large and small to operate with reduced margins, leaving them less able to expand and hire new employees,\u201d they wrote. The restructuring \u201cwill only accelerate the out-migration of residents and businesses. This downward spiral will deplete what is left of the island\u2019s economic foundation,\u201d they said.It\u2019s hand-to-hand combat. And the latest deadline to decide what to do is Friday. It could still be pushed back again.Regardless, it\u2019s clear that the deal as currently drafted is not fair to the people and businesses of Puerto Rico. It will keep electricity rates on the island at absurdly high levels and negatively affect the island\u2019s ability to recover economically. It\u2019s a recipe for future disaster, and all so that a few rich people can get even richer.An earlier version of this column misstated the electricity rates for Puerto Rico and New York City. They are 21 cents and nearly 25 cents, respectively, not 27 cents and 13 cents. The column also omitted a relevant provision in the restructuring deal. The proposed deal with creditors does defer principal and interest payments that free up $2.2 billion to be used on capital improvements.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shares Plunge as China Voices Concern Over \u2018Systemic Risks\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Some of China\u2019s largest companies may pose a systemic risk to the country\u2019s banks, a senior banking official said on Thursday, in the latest signal that Beijing is ratcheting up scrutiny of a financial system plagued with hidden debt that poses a hazard to the health of the economy.At a briefing on Thursday in Beijing, Mr. Liu, deputy head of the commission\u2019s prudential regulation bureau, said that his agency was looking into \u201csystemic risk of some large enterprises,\u201d according to numerous media accounts, and that the risk could spread to other institutions.Later on Thursday, Li Xinghao, a spokesman for the banking commission, said Mr. Liu had been \u201cmisquoted\u201d as saying that the commission was worried about the risk posed by those companies.Still, his comments come as China clamps down on some of its most ambitious and acquisitive companies.China has been trying to get its unruly financial sector under control, worried that asset bubbles and its enormous unofficial \u2014 or \u201cshadow\u201d \u2014 banking system could threaten its economy, the world\u2019s second largest after the United States\u2019. In April, President Xi Jinping urged the country to ward off systemic risks to maintain financial security during a group study session for members of the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party.A surge in acquisitions by large Chinese companies in recent years has increased worries that several of them, which rely on borrowed money for their large purchases, could pose a risk to the banks that lend to them. A crucial cause for concern is that many of these companies overpaid for some of these purchases.Analysts have expressed concern about the rapid expansion of China\u2019s credit, warning that the country could face serious risk if it does not toughen measures to control its debt-fueled binge. The authorities have also been increasingly nervous about the flow of money out of the country, which contributed to a sharp fall in the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves in recent years, before steadying in recent months.The increased scrutiny comes at a time of emphasis on political and economic stability ahead of the Communist Party\u2019s 19th Party Congress this autumn, when leadership decisions are likely to be made.In Hong Kong, shares in Fosun fell 5.8 percent and those in its health care unit 5.9 percent, while shares in the HNA Holding Group Company closed 6.1 percent lower. In the Chinese city of Shenzhen, Dalian Wanda\u2019s listed unit, Wanda Film Holdings, had to suspend trading after its stock fell 10 percent.In statements, both Dalian and Fosun said the companies were operating normally. Wanda said that rumors that some Chinese banks had ordered the sale of its bonds were \u201cmalicious speculation.\u201d The HNA Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Ailin Tang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}

You peruse a small area \u2014 no chance of getting lost or wasting time searching for things \u2014 because the store stocks only sample items. You wave your phone in front of anything you want to buy, then walk out. In the back, robots retrieve your items from a warehouse and deliver them to your home via driverless car or drone.Our mental image of job-killing automation is robots in factories or warehouses. But the next jobs to disappear are probably ones that are a much bigger part of most people\u2019s daily lives: retail workers and cashiers in stores and restaurants.For a long time, economists argued that routine jobs like factory and clerical work were vulnerable to automation but that jobs in both the service and knowledge sectors were safer. They require human skills that are hard for machines to imitate, like judgment and adaptability. These skills are useful when an executive makes strategic business decisions or when a chef fries one customer\u2019s egg and scrambles another\u2019s.But it has become increasingly clear that parts of every job will be automated \u2014 and that the service sector is next. Although certain service jobs like health aide or preschool teacher still seem safe, others, like those in retail and food service, are already being displaced. It\u2019s not hard to teach a machine to do routine tasks like scanning bar codes, stocking shelves or dunking fries in oil.Estimates like these are guesses at best, because imagining the future is an act of science fiction. And even when technologies exist, companies adopt them slowly. That\u2019s one reason productivity isn\u2019t increasing at the rate economists might expect, even though more work is able to be automated. But there is evidence that retail jobs are transforming rapidly.Companies won\u2019t invest in technology unless it\u2019s less expensive than employing people, and most retail workers make near minimum wage. But in a case study of grocery stores, McKinsey found that the savings from automation were three times the cost, and 68 percent of the savings were from reduced labor costs.Retailers say automating certain tasks doesn\u2019t necessarily displace employees, but frees them to do other things that are more valuable to customers. Lowe\u2019s, for instance, said its customer service robot answered simple questions so employees could provide more personalized expertise, like home project planning.Whole Foods, before the Amazon acquisition, made a similar argument to Forrester. \u201cWe intentionally don\u2019t over-automate our stores, at least not on the front end,\u201d an executive told Forrester, which didn\u2019t name the person in its report. \u201cWe want to have the personal touch of real people.\u201dBut shoppers often prefer to save time by interacting with fewer people, especially when they just need coffee or paper towels \u2014 thus the convenience of online ordering for in-store pickup at places like Walmart and Starbucks.On the other hand, said David Autor, an M.I.T. economist, it would make the job market even more challenging for a group of workers who already struggle to find stable, well-paid employment and are unlikely to have the education to move into better jobs.Amazon said it had no plans to lay off Whole Foods workers or use Amazon Go technology to automate cashiers\u2019 jobs.Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy, said Amazon\u2019s plans could be much bigger than simply automating stores.\u201cThe bigger and more profound way that technology affects jobs is by completely reinventing the business model,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon didn\u2019t go put a robot into the bookstores and help you check out books faster. It completely reinvented bookstores. The idea of a cashier won\u2019t be so much automated as just made irrelevant \u2014 you\u2019ll just tell your Echo what you need, or perhaps it will anticipate what you need, and stuff will get delivered to you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Conservative-leaning governments in Britain, France, Germany and Japan all signed on to successive climate change agreements.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.Yet when Mr. Trump pulled the United States from the Paris accord, the Senate majority leader, the speaker of the House and every member of the elected Republican leadership were united in their praise.But in Republican political circles, speaking out on the issue, let alone pushing climate policy, is politically dangerous. So for the most part, these moderate Republicans are biding their time, until it once again becomes safe for Republicans to talk more forcefully about climate change. The question is how long that will take.\u201cWith 40 percent of Florida\u2019s population at risk from sea-level rise, my state is on the front lines of climate change,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida. \u201cSouth Florida residents are already beginning to feel the effects of climate change in their daily lives.\u201dThe effort picked up steam the next year after the House of Representatives passed what is known as cap-and-trade legislation, a concept invented by conservative Reagan-era economists.The idea was to create a statutory limit, or cap, on the overall amount of a certain type of pollution that could be emitted. Businesses could then buy and sell permits to pollute, choosing whether to invest more in pollution permits, or in cleaner technology that would then save them money and allow them to sell their allotted permits. The administration of the first President George Bush successfully deployed the first national cap-and-trade system in 1990 to lower emissions of the pollutants that cause acid rain. Mr. McCain pushed a cap-and-trade proposal to fight climate change.\u201cI thought we could get it done,\u201d recalled Henry A. Waxman, a retired House Democrat who led the cap-and-trade push in 2009. \u201cWe just had two candidates from the Republican and Democratic parties who had run for president and agreed that climate change was a real threat.\u201dConservative activists saw the legislative effort as an opportunity to transform the climate debate.Myron Ebell, a senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, worked behind the scenes to make sure Republican offices in Congress knew about Mr. Horner\u2019s work \u2014 although at the time, many viewed Mr. Ebell skeptically, as an extremist pushing out-of-touch views.As Congress moved toward actually passing climate change legislation, a fringe issue had become a part of the political mainstream.\u201cThat was the turning point,\u201d Mr. Horner said.Unshackled by the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision and other related rulings, which ended corporate campaign finance restrictions, Koch Industries and Americans for Prosperity started an all-fronts campaign with television advertising, social media and cross-country events aimed at electing lawmakers who would ensure that the fossil fuel industry would not have to worry about new pollution regulations.Their first target: unseating Democratic lawmakers such as Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Perriello of Virginia, who had voted for the House cap-and-trade bill, and replacing them with Republicans who were seen as more in step with struggling Appalachia, and who pledged never to push climate change measures.But Americans for Prosperity also wanted to send a message to Republicans.Until 2010, some Republicans ran ads in House and Senate races showing their support for green energy.\u201cAfter that, it disappeared from Republican ads,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cPart of that was the polling, and part of it was the visceral example of what happened to their colleagues who had done that.\u201dWhat happened was clear. Republicans who asserted support for climate change legislation or the seriousness of the climate threat saw their money dry up or, worse, a primary challenger arise.\u201cIt told Republicans that we were serious,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, \u201cthat we would spend some serious money against them.\u201dEven for congressional veterans, that message was not missed. Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who once called climate change \u201ca serious problem\u201d and co-sponsored a bill to promote energy-efficient light bulbs, tacked right after the 2010 elections as he battled to be chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee against Joe Barton, a Texan who mocked human-caused climate change.Mr. Upton deleted references to climate change from his website. \u201cIf you look, the last year was the warmest year on record, the warmest decade on record. I accept that,\u201d he offered that fall. \u201cI do not say that it\u2019s man-made.\u201d\u201cIn my own campaign, there were people who felt strongly enough about my views on climate change to use it to help defeat me, and other Republicans are very sensitive to that possibility,\u201d Mr. Lugar said in an interview. \u201cSo even if they privately believe we ought to do something about it, they\u2019re reticent, especially with the Republican president taking the views he is now taking.\u201dAfter winning re-election in 2012, Mr. Obama understood his second-term agenda would have to rely on executive authority, not legislation that would go nowhere in the Republican-majority Congress. And climate change was the great unfinished business of his first term.To finish it, he would deploy a rarely used provision in the Clean Air Act of 1970, which gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to issue regulations on carbon dioxide.The result was the Clean Power Plan, which would significantly cut planet-warming emissions by forcing the closing of hundreds of heavy-polluting coal-fired power plants.The end run around Congress had consequences of its own. To Republican (and some Democratic) critics, the Clean Power Plan exemplified everything they opposed about Mr. Obama: He seemed to them imperious, heavy-handed, pleasing to the elites on the East and West Coasts and in the capitals of Europe, but callous to the blue-collar workers of coal and oil country.\u201cIt fed into this notion of executive overreach,\u201d said Heather Zichal, who advised Mr. Obama on climate policy. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a good enough job on managing the narrative.\u201dRepublicans who had supported the climate change agenda began to defect and have since stayed away.\u201cOn the issue of climate change, I think it\u2019s happening,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a CNN podcast interview last April. But, he said, \u201cThe president decided, at least in the last couple years if not more, to rule by edict.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s political opponents saw the climate rules as a ripe opportunity. \u201cWhen the president went the regulatory route, it gave our side more confidence,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cIt hardened and broadened Republican opposition to this agenda.\u201dStarting in early 2014, the opponents of the rule \u2014 including powerful lawyers and lobbyists representing many of America\u2019s largest manufacturing and industrial interests \u2014 regularly gathered in a large conference room at the national headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, overlooking the White House. They drafted a long-game legal strategy to undermine Mr. Obama\u2019s climate regulations in a coordinated campaign that brought together 28 state attorneys general and major corporations to form an argument that they expected to eventually take to the Supreme Court.They presented it not as an environmental fight but an economic one, against a government that was trying to vastly and illegally expand its authority.West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, led the session, \u201cThe Dangerous Consequences of the Clean Power Plan & Other E.P.A. Rules,\u201d which included, according to the agenda, Scott Pruitt, then the attorney general of Oklahoma; Ken Paxton, Texas\u2019 attorney general; and Geoffrey Barnes, a corporate lawyer for Murray, which had donated $250,000 to the Republican attorneys general political group.When Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, he did not appear to have a clear understanding of the nation\u2019s climate change policies. Nor, at the start of his campaign, did he appear to have any specific plan to prioritize a huge legal push to roll those policies back.This ad appeared in The New York Times in December 2009, urging President Barack Obama to push a global climate change pact being negotiated in Copenhagen. Donald J. Trump and members of his family supported the ad, along with other business leaders.However, it did not go unnoticed that coal country was giving his presidential campaign a wildly enthusiastic embrace, as miners came out in full force for Mr. Trump, stoking his populist message.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about miners all over the country,\u201d he said, eliciting cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put miners back to work.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t used to have all these rules and regulations that make it impossible to compete,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it all off the table.\u201dThen an official from the West Virginia Coal Association handed the candidate a miner\u2019s hat.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers embraced the miners as emblematic of the candidate\u2019s broader populist appeal.\u201cThe coal miners were the perfect case for what he was talking about,\u201d Mr. Bennett said, \u201cthe idea that for the government in Washington, it\u2019s all right for these people to suffer for the greater good \u2014 that federal power is more important than your little lives.\u201dMr. Trump took on as an informal campaign adviser Robert E. Murray \u2014 chief executive of the same coal company that had been working closely for years with the Republican attorneys general to unwind the Obama environmental legacy.Mr. Murray, a brash and folksy populist who started working in coal mines as a teenager, is an unabashed skeptic of climate science. The coal magnate and Mr. Trump had a natural chemistry, and where Mr. Trump lacked the legal and policy background to unwind climate policy, Mr. Murray was happy to step in.\u201cI thank my lord, Jesus Christ, for the election of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Murray said soon after his new friend won the White House.Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Ebell, the Competitive Enterprise Institute fellow who had worked for years to undermine the legitimacy of established climate science, to head the transition team at E.P.A. Mr. Ebell immediately began pushing for an agenda of gutting the Obama climate regulations and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.When it came time to translate Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to coal country into policy, Mr. Murray and others helped choose the perfect candidate: Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump wanted to be seen delivering on the promises he had made to the miners. As controversies piled up in his young administration, he sought comfort in the approval of his base.Meanwhile, a battle raged at the White House over whether to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, urged him to remain in, cautioning that withdrawing could be devastating to the United States\u2019 foreign policy credentials.But these voices did not have clout in Washington, either in Congress or at the White House, when it comes to energy policy.Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, backed by Mr. Pruitt, told the president that pulling out of the deal would mean a promise kept to his base.Dr. Bolin helped steer the conference to its conclusion: \u201cIt is now believed that in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man\u2019s history,\u201d he wrote in the conference\u2019s 500-page report.While the politics of climate change in the United States has grown more divided since then, the scientific community has united: Global warming is having an impact, scientists say, with sea levels rising along with the extremity of weather events. Most of the debate is about the extent of those impacts \u2014 how high the seas may rise, or how intense and frequent heavy storms or heat waves may be.But in Congress, reluctance to embrace that science has had no political downsides, at least among Republicans.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have an example of where someone has paid a political price being on that side of it,\u201d said Michael Steel, who served as press secretary for the former House speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and the current House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, during his 2012 run as Mitt Romney\u2019s vice-presidential choice.Instead, the messages of Mr. Pruitt still dominate.\u201cThis is an historic restoration of American economic independence \u2014 one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said on Thursday, stepping to the Rose Garden lectern after Mr. Trump. \u201cWe owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.\u201dBut most public opinion polls find that voters rank the environment last or nearly last among the issues that they vote on. And views are divided based on party affiliation. In 2001, 46 percent of Democrats said they worried \u201ca great deal\u201d about climate change, compared with 29 percent of Republicans, according to a Gallup tracking poll on the issue. This year, concern among Democrats has reached 66 percent. Among Republicans, it has fallen, to 18 percent.Until people vote on the issue, Republicans will find it politically safer to question climate science and policy than to alienate moneyed groups like Americans for Prosperity.\u201cThis is a local issue for me,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cEven conservatives in my district see the impact. It\u2019s flooding, and it\u2019s happening now.\u201dMr. Curbelo is confident that as the impact of climate change spreads, so will the willingness of his Republican colleagues to join him.Outside of Congress, a small number of establishment conservatives, including a handful of leaders from the Reagan administration, have begun pushing Washington to act on climate change. Earlier this year, James A. Baker III, one of the Republican Party\u2019s more eminent senior figures, met with senior White House officials to urge them to consider incorporating a carbon tax as part of a broader tax overhaul package \u2014 a way to both pay for proposed cuts to corporate tax rates and help save the planet. A Reagan White House senior economist, Art Laffer; a former secretary of state, George P. Shultz; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., George W. Bush\u2019s final Treasury secretary, have also pushed the idea.\u201cThere are members from deep-red districts who have approached me about figuring out how to become part of this effort,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cI know we have the truth on our side. So I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll win \u2014 eventually.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when the Supreme Court stayed the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which regulated emissions from coal-fired power plants.

{"Headline": "C.B.O. Head, Who Prizes Nonpartisanship, Finds Work Under G.O.P. Attack", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When much of Washington was glued to the testimony of former F.B.I. director James B. Comey this month, Keith Hall, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, was one of the few who averted their eyes from televisions.For Mr. Hall, avoiding political spectacles \u2014 anything politically partisan, really \u2014 has become second nature. On his commute to Capitol Hill, he tunes out the buzz of partisan chatter on talk radio. At home, cable news is a no-no. And because friends sometimes try to talk to him about politics, he has become a master in the art of the dodge.But the noise may soon be impossible to ignore. Senate Republicans are racing to finish health care legislation this week so that the C.B.O. can offer its assessment ahead of a vote that they would like to happen before the July Fourth recess.Such is life for the bookish economist who leads the most powerful government office that most Americans have never heard of. Congress intended the C.B.O. to serve as a nonpartisan provider of cost estimates and economic forecasts for nearly every piece of legislation that Congress considers. That makes the agency a lightning rod of criticism for both Republicans and Democrats when it says bills are going to be more costly to taxpayers than politicians had indicated. These days Mr. Hall and the credibility of his office have been under especially intense scrutiny because of the C.B.O.\u2019s damning assessments of the health care bill that Republicans have been struggling to pass this summer.Staying out of the political fray while working in its epicenter can be daunting, and Mr. Hall inevitably gets thrust into a spotlight that he does not crave.\u201cWe\u2019re a nonpartisan place and we\u2019re working in a partisan world and we get treated as if we\u2019re partisan,\u201d Mr. Hall, 60, said in an interview at his fourth-floor office, which sits in the shadow of the Capitol. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201dMost recently, the partisan pressure has been coming directly from top Trump administration officials.Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said last month that the C.B.O.\u2019s time had \u201ccome and gone\u201d and accused its employees of holding a liberal political bias. He even suggested making changes to the Congressional Budget Act, which created the office, to make the C.B.O. less influential in the legislative process.\u201cYou can have a government without a Congressional Budget Office,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney told The Washington Examiner in May.The C.B.O. is often a target of criticism, but the fury of the attacks on Mr. Hall and his staff has struck veterans of the agency as a consequence of the toxic tone that has become pervasive in Washington in recent months.\u201cThe directness of the attack by Mick Mulvaney is highly unusual,\u201d said Doug Elmendorf, who was Mr. Hall\u2019s predecessor as the director of the C.B.O. \u201cThe attack was unusual in not being just a disagreement with a particular estimate, which is totally legitimate, but an attack on the role of the organization.\u201dThe agency was born out of a clash between Congress and President Richard M. Nixon, who was refusing to disburse appropriated funds that went against his preferred policies. In 1974, lawmakers passed the Congressional Budget Act, which strengthened the budget authority of Congress and established the Congressional Budget Office as an agency to provide impartial economic estimates of legislation.But the Trump administration thinks that the C.B.O. has amassed too much power, and Mr. Mulvaney is not the only one to target the office. Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, has also laced into its work recently, pointing to its off-target estimates of the Affordable Care Act as evidence that it is ill equipped to pass judgment over the new Republican health plan.The barrage of criticism is not without irony. It was Mr. Price, then a Republican congressman from Georgia, who called Mr. Hall in 2015 to inquire about his interest in the job. Mr. Hall was enjoying a comfortable post as chief economist at the International Trade Commission, where he enjoyed a low profile and an exotic travel itinerary while keeping an eye on retirement and the Washington Nationals.As the party in control of Congress, Republicans were the ones to pick Mr. Hall for the job, and Mr. Price himself hailed the selection as a wise choice.Friends and former colleagues of Mr. Hall describe him as \u201clow key\u201d: someone who is more an erudite academic than a political punching bag.\u201cHe is a no-drama kind of person,\u201d said Erica Groshen, who succeeded Mr. Hall as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cHe is not the kind of guy who is going to try to circumvent the professional work of the agency or to try to skew it in one way or another.\u201dAlthough its critics often question its statistical models or economic assumptions, to those who have worked at the C.B.O. the notion that it could cook its books is hard to fathom. The office is closely advised by expert advisory panels, and it frequently seeks comment from policy specialists from all political persuasions.Mr. Hall said that the most surprising thing to him about the coarse reactions to the C.B.O.\u2019s reports is that lawmakers on congressional committees and their staff members work closely with the office while writing their legislation. Rather than Congress submitting a finished bill to the C.B.O. in a black box, there is a regular exchange of feedback throughout the process.The C.B.O. will face another round of attacks when it produces an analysis of the health plan being written by Senate Republicans under a shroud of secrecy.On Wednesday, Mr. Hall will also have to answer for the office\u2019s work when he testifies before Congress on his own office\u2019s budget.Mr. Hall will undoubtedly get questions about the C.B.O.\u2019s objectivity and calls for its role to be diminished. He finds himself focusing more on protecting his staff of economists and statisticians who work late into the night and over weekends crunching numbers for Congress.\u201cPart of my job is somewhat to shield them,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cYou can see the criticism, you can hear about it, and one of the things that\u2019s been important I think is to tell them that people can have their opinion on things, but it doesn\u2019t change what we do and how we do it.\u201dHe rarely pushes back against his critics in public. Like referees or umpires, he said, there is nothing to be gained from becoming part of the debate.But Mr. Hall does believe strongly that the C.B.O. should not be weakened or phased out. The work, he said, is especially important at a time when facts and data have increasingly come under assault by politics.\u201cIt\u2019s this idea of where the truth is,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cI hate the term speaking truth to power, but it\u2019s sort of why we\u2019re here.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Keith Hall, who is under fire from Republicans, misstated the action that President Richard M. Nixon took on the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which created the C.B.O. Nixon signed it on July 12 of that year; he did not veto it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain in Disarray", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn an era of election surprises, Britain\u2019s didn\u2019t disappoint. Two months ago, when Mrs. May made her call for a snap election, Conservatives held a huge lead over Labour, which was perceived as dead in the water under the old-school hard-leftist Jeremy Corbyn. Mrs. May was expected to get five years of unchallenged authority. Instead, Labour gained a whopping 29 seats in Parliament, helped by the biggest turnout in two decades, and a triumphant Mr. Corbyn called on Mrs. May to resign. In a parallel surprise, the Scottish National Party suffered a drubbing, effectively ending talk of another referendum on Scottish independence.Mrs. May lost for many reasons, chief among them a campaign that undermined her reputation as a resolute and tough leader. She rarely ventured outside scripted Conservative settings, and when she did she was ill at ease and tone-deaf. Her plan to charge the elderly more for long-term care was especially damaging. The proposal was promptly labeled the \u201cdementia tax,\u201d and she was compelled to withdraw it. Mr. Corbyn, by contrast, confounded all expectations with an aggressive campaign that featured enthusiastic crowds at packed open-air rallies.Surprisingly, Brexit \u2014 the reason Mrs. May called the election and arguably the most important matter confronting Britain, with potentially dire consequences for the economy and for Britain\u2019s place in the world \u2014 played only a marginal role in either the Conservative or Labour campaign. Neither Mrs. May nor Mr. Corbyn presented a coherent strategy for leaving the European Union. Voters were left with the vague notion that Mrs. May favored a hard exit, with a full withdrawal from the common market and an end to the free movement of people, and that Mr. Corbyn favored a softer exit. Only the Liberal Democrats focused on Brexit, calling for a new referendum, but they emerged with a mere 12 seats.By contrast, the European Union side has been invigorated by the election of a strongly pro-European president in France, Emmanuel Macron, and the likelihood that his new party will win big in the impending parliamentary elections. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany also looks solid in her bid for a fourth election victory in September. European Union officials in Brussels insisted that dealing with a weakened Britain was not in their interest, but there was no disguising a dollop of schadenfreude.A weakened Britain is in nobody\u2019s interest. While the election did not give Mrs. May the strong hand she wanted, it could still benefit Britain if it forces the country\u2019s newly reshuffled political leadership to confront not only the domestic issues that played a role in the campaign, but also the elephant in the room that went all but unnoticed. June 23 will mark one year since the Brexit referendum; it is time for the government to come clean with the public about what it can realistically expect from the divorce with Europe, and what its strategy will be for the negotiations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gay Lawmaker, Leo Varadkar, Is in Line to Be Ireland\u2019s Prime Minister", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBLIN \u2014 A gay son of an Indian immigrant is now all but certain to become the next prime minister of Ireland, a country that has rapidly been leaving its conservative Roman Catholic social traditions behind.Leo Varadkar, who was chosen on Friday by the Fine Gael party to be its leader, and therefore the head of the center-right governing coalition, will be the first openly gay taoiseach (as Ireland\u2019s prime minister is called), and, at 38, the youngest. He succeeds Enda Kenny, who is stepping down.Mr. Varadkar\u2019s rapid rise to the country\u2019s highest political office, only 10 years after he entered Parliament, owes much to a willingness to speak his mind, a novelty in the normally cautious world of Irish politics.Though in some ways he is emblematic of Ireland\u2019s transition to a more liberal society, Mr. Varadkar presents himself as conservative on issues like the economy and law and order. As he was campaigning for the party leadership, he used his cabinet position as minister for social protection to start a high-profile campaign against welfare fraud, which was seen as a gesture to appeal to Fine Gael\u2019s right-wing supporters.He also surprised his liberal admirers by reaching out to the party\u2019s anti-abortion faction, saying that Fine Gael \u201cshould be a warm house for those who have socially conservative views.\u201dIn 2015, Mr. Varadkar was widely praised for bravery and honesty when he said publicly that he was gay, the first Irish government minister to do so. At the time, Irish voters were debating a proposed constitutional amendment to permit same-sex marriage, and his stand is credited with bolstering the successful \u201cyes\u201d campaign, making Ireland the first country to legalize gay marriage by popular vote.Mr. Varadkar was born in Dublin in 1979, the son of an Irish Catholic nurse from County Waterford and a Hindu doctor from Mumbai, India. His parents met in England in the 1960s and lived in India for a time before moving to Ireland.Mr. Varadkar trained as a doctor \u2014 a general practitioner \u2014 and became involved in politics while still in medical school. He developed a reputation as an intelligent, hard-working and articulate city councilor in Dublin, won a parliamentary seat in the Dublin West constituency at the age of 28, and rose swiftly in party circles.Though the Fine Gael party and its allies have the largest bloc of seats in Parliament, they do not command a majority. Even so, opposition parties are not expected to block Mr. Varadkar\u2019s formal election as prime minister by the Dail. To do so would prompt a general election, which none of the major parties want right now.Mr. Varadkar clinched the Fine Gael leadership on Friday by defeating his only rival, Simon Coveney, a fellow cabinet minister, in an internal party election. Though Mr. Coveney received more votes from rank-and-file members, Mr. Varadkar had greater support among Fine Gael\u2019s members of Parliament. Under the party\u2019s weighted voting rules, that made Mr. Varadkar the winner.A habit of speaking out on issues outside his ministerial responsibilities has sometimes embroiled Mr. Varadkar in controversy. In 2011, six months after Ireland was pressured into accepting a bailout of 85 billion euros by the European Union (about $122 billion), he claimed (incorrectly, as it turned out) that a second bailout might soon be necessary. His comment caused consternation among colleagues in the government who were trying to persuade the world that Ireland had finally stabilized itself after the banking and housing crash of 2008.Mr. Varadkar was accused of racism in 2008 after he suggested in the Dail that unemployed immigrants should be paid to leave the country.

His party\u2019s chief rival, Fianna Fail \u2014 also center-right \u2014 can bring down the government and force a general election whenever it feels the moment is advantageous. It does not seem advantageous now: The two parties are running close in most opinion polls, with, if anything, a narrow lead for Fine Gael.Meanwhile, the government faces a number of serious domestic issues that could blow up into crises, including the troubled public health service; soaring rents and housing prices; anger at rising economic inequality; an interlocking nest of church-and-state questions; and slumping police morale and discipline.Threats by the Trump administration to crack down on American multinational companies that base themselves overseas for tax reasons are also a grave concern for Ireland, which uses low corporate tax rates to entice companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Twitter to process their cash flows through Dublin.By far the biggest menace on the Irish horizon, however, is Britain\u2019s looming withdrawal from the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d which threatens to stir divisions within and between the Republic of Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland, where decades of sectarian struggle largely subsided after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.Brexit will also severely disrupt Ireland\u2019s close business links with Britain, its largest trading partner, by removing Britain from the European single market and customs union while Ireland remains.During the leadership campaign.

{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Party and Allies Win Big in France", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the votes were counted, Mr. Macron\u2019s party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche (the Republic on the Move) and its allies had won 350 seats in the 577-member National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament.For the two mainstream parties, the outcome was a bleak repudiation: The center-right Republicans and their allies were relegated to a distant second place, with an estimated 135 members for its bloc in Parliament, while the Socialists and their allies, who had a majority in the last election, saw their bloc reduced to an estimated 45 seats.The former Socialist prime minister Manuel Valls appeared to have barely won re-election in his district, by a margin of just 139 votes. His opponent made accusations of improprieties and asked for a recount. Several prominent Socialist representatives, including four who served as ministers in the previous government, lost their seats.Parties on both the far left and the far right won more seats \u2014 and Mr. Macron\u2019s bloc won fewer \u2014 than analysts had projected in the past week. Still, Mr. Macron \u201chas all the powers,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis, who resigned on Sunday as head of the Socialist Party, which with its allies won both the presidential and the parliamentary elections of 2012, only to see their popularity erode under the leadership of Mr. Macron\u2019s predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.A top Republican official, Fran\u00e7ois Baroin, wished Mr. Macron \u201cgood luck\u201d but said his party would continue to be heard, as the largest opposition party. Most of the better-known Republicans were re-elected, but Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, a moderate and one the party\u2019s top officials, lost to a Macron-backed candidate in her Paris district.\u201cThe level of abstention in the second round is a sign that a large part of the working-class electorate are not going to vote anymore,\u201d Mr. Rouban said, describing the sense of alienation evident in the abstention as \u201can invisible fracture\u201d separating the poorest and more modestly off members of French society from the rest.Mr. Macron\u2019s opponents seized on the abstention rate to try to discredit his victory. The leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, said the abstention level was \u201ccrushing,\u201d adding, \u201cOur people have entered into a form of civic general strike.\u201d He suggested that with such a high number of people declining to vote, the government was robbed of its legitimacy.A majority of eligible voters did not show up, perhaps because they thought Mr. Macron\u2019s candidates did not need their support or, more worryingly for Mr. Macron, because they were unwilling to give him their endorsement. Many might have been tired of voting, having been called to the polls not only for the two rounds of the presidential election and then two rounds of voting for Parliament, but also for primary elections on the left and the right ahead of the presidential election.Nonetheless, the overall picture for Mr. Macron was a positive one.Mr. Macron, 39, has seemed like a golden child of Western liberal democracy of late, with his stunning rise to power in little more than a year and his seemingly unerring sense of how to exercise it in his first weeks in office.But Sunday\u2019s abstention rate suggests that he has yet to convince many French voters that his ideas and legislative program will make their lives better. The high rate could spur union-led street protests, a longtime staple of French politics, especially if Mr. Macron tries, as he has promised, to fast-track part of his legislative program.Still, with 350 representatives elected on the ballot of La R\u00e9publique en Marche or its close ally, the Democratic Movement, Mr. Macron could justifiably say that a majority of those who voted chose his program of loosening France\u2019s restrictive labor laws, making it easier for businesses to hire and fire employees, and reducing worker protections with the goal of creating more jobs.The National Assembly, France\u2019s lower and more powerful house of Parliament, will lose little time getting to work and \u2014 if all unfolds as Mr. Macron hopes \u2014 the steps will begin to change France. Although Parliament will not vote on key measures in its first few weeks in office, it will start discussing the measures later this summer, setting the stage for rapid passage in the early fall, including the contentious overhaul of France\u2019s labor laws.Also on tap for completion in the next four months is a potentially controversial codification in common law of some measures in the current state of emergency, such as the ability to conduct house raids or place people under house arrest without the prior authorization of a judge. An ethics law for politicians is also expected.Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, the far-left leader, won his seat in a district in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille. His party and its Communist allies won 27 seats, fewer than might have been expected after Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s strong showing in the presidential election, but enough to challenge the Socialists for the status as the main left-wing opposition party.Only the mainstream right party, the Republicans, and its allies managed to maintain a significant presence in Parliament.Advertisement"}

May Avoid Trial and a Spanish Banking Takeover", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019re following major market developments throughout the day.The Royal Bank of Scotland moved closer on Wednesday to avoiding a trial in long-running shareholder litigation over a rights issue by the lender before its near-collapse in 2008.As the financial crisis loomed almost a decade ago, the lender raised 12 billion pounds, or about $15 billion at current exchange rates, weeks before it ultimately had to be rescued by the British government. R.B.S., which remains 72 percent owned by the government, received a \u00a345 billion bailout that year.Investors in the shareholder litigation have claimed that they were misled about the bank\u2019s financial health ahead of the share offering.The bank, based in Edinburgh, has agreed to settle about 87 percent of the remaining claims based on value against it after reaching an agreement with the RBoS Shareholders Action Group, which represents about 9,000 individual investors, according to Jonathan Nash, a lawyer for the shareholders.Shareholders representing the remaining claims are undecided and need more time to determine whether they want to proceed, Mr. Nash said on Wednesday.Mr. Nash said the bank and the shareholder group were confident the majority of those remaining claim holders would agreed to settle.The trial was supposed to begin last month, but has been delayed several times after R.B.S. increased the size of its settlement offer and the parties asked for more time to try to resolve the case. The revised settlement offer is worth about \u00a3200 million.Under an agreement between the parties on Wednesday, the trial will be put on hold and the undecided shareholders will have to decide if they want to settle by June 20.At the moment, there is no funding available for the case to continue, so any shareholders who want to go to trial would need to secure funding and notify the court by July 28. That is not expected to happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Obama Officials Find There\u2019s No Place Like Their Old Law Firms", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a new administration comes to Washington, top government regulators flock to the exits to find new jobs, but they seldom have to look very far.A few parlay their experience into corporate counsel jobs or trade up to a more rarefied law firm than the one they had left earlier.But most of them, like Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, or Mary Jo White, former chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, simply return to their previous law firms.In the latest high-profile transition, the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder has welcomed back Aitan D. Goelman, who was enforcement director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission until February. In his regulatory role, Mr. Goelman oversaw cases using new enforcement powers authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation that grew out of the 2008 economic crisis.\u201cI was interested in hands-on law practice,\u201d Mr. Goelman said in explaining why he returned to his firm. But like most other top federal lawyers, he first looked around to see what was on offer elsewhere in the legal industry. \u201cI spent four months talking with many firms,\u201d he said, \u201cand a lot of them were interested because I had experience with big institutional clients who were caught up in government regulations or prosecutions.\u201dMr. Goelman will be a firm partner in Washington focusing on the securities, commodities and derivatives industries, internal investigations and defense of cross-jurisdictional regulatory and criminal matters.The revolving door between government and law firms is decades old, as the newest political overseers arriving in Washington recruit their own legal hands for savvy counsel to prevent \u2014 or rescue them from \u2014 misdeeds or mistakes. And, as white-collar practices at major law firms have been booming in the wake of the regulatory overhauls that followed the economy\u2019s 2008 crisis, that swinging door typically means a big payday for most lawyers.\u201cLawyers need to look at the field,\u201d said Jack Zaremski, president of Hanover Legal Personnel Services, a New York legal recruiter. \u201cThose going into the private sector are able to leverage government experience for compensation which oftentimes amounts to multiples of what they were earning before they went to the private sector.\u201dGovernment prosecutors, who earn around $150,000 annually, can gain coveted experience as a high-level government enforcer or regulator and later be rewarded with a Big Law partnership easily worth $1 million or more.And many do. Robert S. Khuzami, formerly a terrorism prosecutor and general counsel of Deutsche Bank and \u2014 most important of all for law firms \u2014 once the top enforcement official at the Securities and Exchange Commission, was avidly courted by a raft of big firms when he left his post in 2013.As the Obama administration wound down, major firms stepped up their efforts to grab other star lawyers \u2014 the kind who have gone toe-to-toe with corporate attorneys and won.Some corporations reach into government ranks and hire directly. PepsiCo hired Tony West, who was the associate attorney general in the Justice Department, as its general counsel in November 2014.More routinely, top-tier firms embrace departing regulators, especially those with experience in securities and foreign corrupt practices law.Cybersecurity is the latest hot commodity, said Jeffrey A. Lowe, the partner practice group leader at the legal search firm Major, Lindsey & Africa.A recent hire in that field was John P. Carlin, the Justice Department\u2019s top national security lawyer, who in January joined law firm Morrison & Foerster to lead its global risk and crisis management practice. Unlike most lawyers leaving high-ranking federal jobs, he had no law firm to return to because he had spent nearly his entire career in government service.But many lawyers return to their \u201chome\u201d firms, and get a promotion. After she departed in February, Ms. White returned to the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, where she had led the litigation department before her S.E.C. appointment. Ms. White is now senior chairwoman of the elite firm, counseling corporate boards and advising clients on government investigations and similar matters.In 2015, Mr. Holder ended his six years as the nation\u2019s highest law enforcement official with a return to his former law firm, Covington & Burling, as a partner focusing on investigations and complex lawsuits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Reaches Debt Deal for Greece Worth 8.5 Billion Euros", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUXEMBOURG \u2014 European Union officials agreed on Thursday to unlock loans of 8.5 billion euros for Greece, to ensure it meets huge payments on its debt next month.The agreement included formal participation by the International Monetary Fund, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance minsters.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said she was prepared to recommend joining the bailout even though work remained on how to ease Greece\u2019s debt burden. \u201cI hope that the discussion over specific debt relief measures can soon be brought to conclusion,\u201d she said.Ms. Lagarde said she would formally recommend participation in the bailout of as much as $2 billion on what she described as a standby basis.The difficulty in completing a deal has centered on a long-running showdown among creditors. On one side, several eurozone countries led by Germany want Athens to carry out what they view as reforms before specifying debt concessions that could take effect next year at the earliest. On the other, the I.M.F., with policy makers in Brussels and the Greek government, has been pushing for immediate commitments on the details of eventual debt relief.The standoff has highlighted the problems of managing the sprawling 19-nation area that uses the euro, and is occurring despite recent signs that regional leaders had tamed crises that have plagued the monetary union for much of the last decade.On Thursday, Greece was offered bailout money above its immediate needs to service its debt. It also received some clarity about eventual measures to ease its debt burden in the medium term.Those measures included extending the final due dates on some Greek debt for as long as 15 years, to around midcentury, to make it easier to pay.In another concession, the Eurogroup formally agreed to a longer-term French plan to link the scale of Greek bond repayments to the country\u2019s economic growth, though it said details still needed to be fleshed out.While eurozone leaders appear to have avoided the short-term threat of a Greek default, much remains at stake politically for the Greek and German governments.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy and its de facto leader, will hold national elections in September, and its leaders, including the hard-line finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, have shown little desire to be specific about what concessions Greece was promised. Along with their counterparts in the Netherlands, German politicians are wary of the domestic consequences of appearing to ask German taxpayers to foot the bill for largess to Greece.As a result, forgiving even part of Greece\u2019s debt is off the table. Further adjustments to repayments, such as extending the deadline, remain extremely unlikely this year.Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, told a news conference on Thursday that he had agreed to the deal because it offered a degree of guidance on how Greece would bring its debt under control.\u201cIs it as much clarity as the Greek people deserve after all the reforms that have been carried out, and all the sacrifices that have been made?\u201d Mr. Tsakalotos said. \u201cPerhaps not. But we recognize that we do not want the perfect to be the enemy of the good.\u201dCrucially, Greek leaders now want their country\u2019s debt to be eligible for the European Central Bank\u2019s huge bond-buying program. That effort, known as quantitative easing, has sought to inject cash into the eurozone economy and bolster growth. Including Greece\u2019s bonds in the list of loans eligible to be purchased would help restore investor confidence in those bonds.The European Central Bank has said it will consider buying Greek bonds only if it concludes that Greece\u2019s debt load is sustainable.The central bank has not said how it defines sustainable, but a stamp of approval from the I.M.F. is probably a prerequisite.The agreement on Thursday \u201cis a first step toward securing debt sustainability,\u201d said Peter Ehrlich, a spokesman for the European Central Bank. Mr. Ehrlich declined to say when the bank might decide about including Greece in the asset-buying program.Over time, I.M.F. involvement has become a crucial issue, and the fund remains concerned that Greece may never be able to repay its enormous loans, which are equivalent to about 180 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. The fund had been withholding its participation in the latest bailout until European countries offer concrete promises of debt relief.Berlin has dug in its heels against such a promise. It is wary that offering concessions could slow the pace of economic reform in Greece, and fears that such moves could have political consequences in Germany.The debate has increased tensions between Greece and Germany.Ms. Lagarde, the I.M.F. managing director, said her decision on Thursday to approve the money in principle \u201callows for more time for negotiations to be concluded on the required debt relief.\u201dDisbursement of the money would follow only with final agreement on the manageability of Greece\u2019s debt, she said. The pledge by the I.M.F. was important in avoiding \u201cthe crisis that we would have otherwise had mid-July, had this not happened today,\u201d she said.Ms. Lagarde said Greece still had a \u201ccontinued promise of debt relief.\u201d The standby arrangement was \u201ca second-best solution \u2014 and it\u2019s not a bad solution,\u201d she said.James Kanter reported from Luxembourg, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.

{"Headline": "Bucking Trump, These Cities, States and Companies Commit to Paris Accord", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepresentatives of American cities, states and companies are preparing to submit a plan to the United Nations pledging to meet the United States\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions targets under the Paris climate accord, despite President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the agreement.The unnamed group \u2014 which, so far, includes 30 mayors, three governors, more than 80 university presidents and more than 100 businesses \u2014 is negotiating with the United Nations to have its submission accepted alongside contributions to the Paris climate deal by other nations.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.By redoubling their climate efforts, he said, cities, states and corporations could achieve, or even surpass, the pledge of the administration of former President Barack Obama to reduce America\u2019s planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025, from their levels in 2005.It was unclear how, exactly, that submission to the United Nations would take place. Christiana Figueres, a former top United Nations climate official, said there was currently no formal mechanism for entities that were not countries to be full parties to the Paris accord.Ms. Figueres, who described the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw as a \u201cvacuous political melodrama,\u201d said the American government was required to continue reporting its emissions to the United Nations because a formal withdrawal would not take place for several years.There are 195 countries committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions as part of the 2015 agreement.Mr. Bloomberg, a United Nations envoy on climate, is a political independent who has been among the critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s climate and energy policies.Eighty-two presidents and chancellors of universities including Emory & Henry College, Brandeis and Wesleyan are also participating, the organizers said.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to pull out of the Paris agreement was motivating more local and state governments, as well as businesses, to commit to the climate change fight, said Robert C. Orr, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris agreement as the United Nations secretary-general\u2019s lead climate adviser.On Thursday, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Jerry Brown of California, all Democrats, said they were beginning a separate alliance of states committed to upholding the Paris accord.\u201cThe electric jolt of the last 48 hours is accelerating this process that was already underway,\u201d said Mr. Orr, who is now dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the volume of actors that is increasing, it\u2019s that they are starting to coordinate in a much more integral way.\u201dAmericans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.The United States is about halfway to its 2025 emissions reduction target, Mr. Orr said. Of the remaining reductions, the federal government \u2014 through regulations like gas mileage standards for vehicles \u2014 could affect about half.But in a draft letter to Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, Mr. Bloomberg expressed confidence that \u201cnon-national actors\u201d could achieve the 2025 goal alone.\u201cWhile the executive branch of the U.S. government speaks on behalf of our nation in matters of foreign affairs, it does not determine many aspects of whether and how the United States takes action on climate change,\u201d he wrote.\u201cThe bulk of the decisions which drive U.S. climate action in the aggregate are made by cities, states, businesses, and civil society,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCollectively, these actors remain committed to the Paris accord.\u201dCities and states can reduce emissions in many ways, including negotiating contracts with local utilities to supply greater amounts of renewable energy, building rapid transit programs and other infrastructure projects like improved wastewater treatment. Similarly, corporations can take measures like buying renewable energy for their offices and factories, or making sure their supply chains are climate-friendly.\u201cOur states will move forward, even if the president wants to go backward,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.America\u2019s biggest corporations have been bracing for the United States to exit from the Paris climate accord, a move executives and analysts say would bring few tangible benefits to businesses \u2014 but plenty of backlash.American companies also face the wrath of overseas consumers for abandoning what has been a popular global agreement \u2014 customers who could buy more Renaults instead of Chevrolets or Reeboks instead of Nikes.\u201cPulling out of Paris would be the worst thing for brand America since Abu Ghraib,\u201d said Nigel Purvis, a top environmental negotiator in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and the chief executive of Climate Advisers, a consulting firm.\u201cMars stands by the Paris Climate Agreement,\u201d said Grant Reid, the chief executive of Mars. The company, best known for its candies, remained committed, he said, to achieving \u201cthe carbon reduction targets the planet needs.\u201d2016 is the hottest year on the historical record and the third consecutive record-breaking year, scientists say.It was unclear from Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement what commitments the United States would honor in the Paris accord, which include contributions to the operating budget of the accord\u2019s coordinating agency, the framework convention.Jackie Biskupski, the mayor of Salt Lake City and a Democrat, said her administration had recently brokered an agreement with the local utility to power the city with 100 percent renewable energy by 2032.Global warming is having a significant impact in Utah, she said, especially on water availability and quality. \u201cWe feel very strongly that we have an obligation to make sure we keep moving in the right direction on this issue,\u201d she said.\u201cWe really have to make choices that reflect our long-term goals, that really address long-term issues of today,\u201d she added.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Big Tech Stocks Build Market Euphoria, and Jitters", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google.In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes \u2014 Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain \u2014 as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies.But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded.\u201cThere is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. \u201cNo one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.\u201dDespite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks.Other markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election.The stock market, however, remains the main attraction.Late in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end.According to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion \u2014 a consequence of investors\u2019 buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value.As is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment.The push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership.Through these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks \u2014 an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented.It is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market.\u201cIn terms of magnitude, we have not seen this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist.In Mr. Paulsen\u2019s view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period.So when Facebook\u2019s net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon\u2019s sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice.\u201cYou have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cSo yes, you can see how valuations would get extended.\u201dStock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today\u2019s technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era.Still, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce?For example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year \u2014 with more than half that amount from Apple, the world\u2019s richest company.Of course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business.Amazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard.Still, it is not today\u2019s earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow\u2019s, the argument goes.Surprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it.Bill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Mr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google\u2019s cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered.\u201cI have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cYet that is how the market is pricing it.\u201dAnother well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position.While skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division.\u201cAmazon is more fully valued than when we bought it,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages.\u201dAs these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns.That is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures.

{"Headline": "With Trump Set to Meet Narendra Modi, Many U.S. Indians Are Hopeful", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERSEY CITY \u2014 With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India set to meet President Trump on Monday for the first time, many Indians in communities like this one have had high hopes for the relationship between the two leaders \u2014 both of whom swept to power as media-savvy political outsiders pledging to revive their national economies.In a string of storefronts here in \u201cLittle India\u201d that pay tribute to Hindu deities, Yogi Patel, 52, runs the Laxmi Pan Center, which is named after the goddess of wealth and sells a betel nut breath freshener. He has lived in the United States for 32 years and is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump.\u201cTrump is doing the right thing. He\u2019s doing good for U.S. citizens and America,\u201d he said, switching between English and Hindi to explain that he grew up in Gujarat, the state that Mr. Modi led as chief minister before the 2014 election. \u201cAnd I am from both countries.\u201dBut as Mr. Trump has tried to crack down on immigration and withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, singling India out as a country that has gained unfairly from the accord, the meeting of the two leaders with nationalist leanings and sizable social media followings has taken on a more complicated tone for others in the Indian diaspora.Mr. Trump is \u201ca little bit unpredictable,\u201d said Vasudev Patel, who voted for Mr. Trump and is the secretary of the Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party, USA, Mr. Modi\u2019s party. \u201cNobody knows when he will make what comment. And the next day he will say he didn\u2019t say that. He\u2019s like an Indian politician.\u201d\u201cMost immigrants who come are really trying to make a life for themselves and their families. They\u2019re really concerned about the mortgage on the house, the papers to get their green card, family back at home,\u201d said Devesh Kapur, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an author of \u201cThe Other One Percent: Indians in America.\u201d\u201cThis has now become a wake-up call that they cannot stand as aloof,\u201d he added.The diaspora in the United States sees itself as a wealthy and powerful segment of the population, with Indian-born business leaders, including Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, rising to prominence in recent years.The median income of an Indian-American household is $88,000, well above the $49,800 average for the United States as a whole, according to the Pew survey. And 38 percent of Indian-Americans have advanced degrees, compared with just 10 percent of the rest of the United States population.\u201cIndian-Americans or Indians here are politically active,\u201d said Tanvi Madan, the head of the India Project at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey are in the policy space. They have integrated in a substantial way. You see them on prime-time television show and in sports.\u201dBoth Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump have made efforts to woo the migrant community.Weeks before the election last year, Mr. Trump visited another Indian community in New Jersey, where he proclaimed that the two countries would be \u201cbest friends.\u201d Mr. Modi, once barred from the United States on allegations surrounding the deaths of hundreds of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002, held a rally for 19,000 people at Madison Square Garden on his first trip to the United States shortly after taking office.The Indian prime minister\u2019s meeting with the diaspora on Sunday in Washington was relatively low-key.Those in the crowd, like Srujal Parikh, the executive vice president at the Federation of Indian Associations, were eager to voice specific concerns before Mr. Modi\u2019s visit to the White House.Some are concerned about the relationship between the two countries after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Others want the prime minister to address the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s anti-immigrant comments and its tough stance on visas for skilled workers.\u201cI myself am an immigrant, so I always think this country is built on immigration,\u201d said Mr. Parikh, a Democrat. \u201cThese are the people that bring the country up or down.\u201d\u201cWe must be talking about the immigration issue. We must be talking about how they can make a bridge between the two countries.\u201dRai Das, 24, who works at a small Indian restaurant in Little India, talks of feeling scared lately while walking the streets of New York.\u201cThere is some sort of wave going on,\u201d said Ms. Das, who moved to the United States two years ago to study data analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but people are discriminating.\u201dYet Kiran Sethi, 52, the owner of Reema Jewelers across the street from the restaurant, was so torn by last year\u2019s vote that she did not cast a ballot, despite being a Democratic supporter in the past. She believes the new administration will do more to create jobs for her two daughters, who earned college degrees in the United States and are looking for work.\u201cWhen I see them sitting at home for six months, I feel their pain,\u201d said Ms. Sethi, adding that Indian Americans are a \u201cwell respected\u201d part of American society. \u201cDo you know how hard we work? We try our best that our kids go to school and get a good education.\u201dThis week\u2019s meeting could rest mostly on personal rapport. The two men may seem to have a lot in common, but Mr. Modi\u2019s asceticism stands in stark contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s flamboyant style.From his pan shop in Little India, Mr. Patel remained optimistic.\u201cTheir mind-set is the same,\u201d he said, batting away concerns as he took an oversize stick of sugar cane to the juicer. \u201cModi does good for India, and he\u2019s thinking of the public there. And Trump is the same here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of a member of the Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party, USA. Vasudev Patel is the secretary, not the president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Past 50 Years of Israeli Occupation. And the Next.", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Six-Day War at 50JERUSALEM \u2014 Three months after the 1967 war, Israel\u2019s ruling Mapai Party held a discussion on the future of the newly conquered territories. Golda Meir, who would become Israel\u2019s leader a year and a half later, asked Prime Minister Levi Eshkol what he planned to do with the more than one million Arabs now living under Israeli rule.\u201cI get it,\u201d Mr. Eshkol jokingly replied. \u201cYou want the dowry, but you don\u2019t like the bride!\u201d Mrs. Meir responded, \u201cMy soul yearns for the dowry, and to let someone else take the bride.\u201dOn this 50th anniversary of the war, it is clear that over the half-century that followed, Israel managed to fulfill Mrs. Meir\u2019s wish, keeping control of the land indefinitely without wedding itself to the inhabitants. This resilient and eminently sustainable arrangement, so often mischaracterized as a state of limbo assumed to be temporary, has stood on three main pillars: American backing, Palestinian weakness and Israeli indifference. Together, the three ensure that for the Israeli government, continuing its occupation is far less costly than the concessions required to end it.Each pillar, in turn, draws support from a core myth promoted by leaders in American, Palestinian or Israeli society. For Americans, the myth that the occupation is unsustainable is a crucial element in maintaining and excusing the United States\u2019 financial and diplomatic abetting of it. From the halls of the State Department to editorials in major newspapers and the pronouncements of pro-peace organizations like J Street, Americans are told that Israel will have to choose, and very soon, to give Palestinians either citizenship or independence, and choose to either remain a democracy or become an apartheid state.Yet none of these groups calls on the United States to force this supposedly imminent choice, no matter how many times Israel demonstrates that it prefers a different, far easier option \u2014 continued occupation \u2014 with no real consequences. The only real fallout from continued occupation are major increases in American financing of it, with Israel now receiving more military assistance from the United States than the rest of the world does combined. Mistaking finger-wagging for pressure, these groups spend far too much time on phrasing their criticism of settlements and occupation, and far too little asking what can be done about it.What supports the fiction that Israel cannot continue subjugating the Palestinians \u2014 and therefore that the United States will not be complicit in several more decades of subjugation \u2014 is a seemingly endless parade of coming perils, each of which, it is claimed or hoped, will cause Israel to end its occupation in the near future.Initially, the threat was of an attack by the Arab states. But that soon crumbled: Israel made a separate peace with the strongest one, Egypt; the Arabs proved incapable of defending even sovereign Lebanon from Israeli invasion; and in recent years, many Arab states have failed to uphold even their longstanding boycott of Israel.Then there was the demographic threat of a Palestinian majority arising between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. But official Israeli and Palestinian population statistics indicate that Jews have been a minority in the territory Israel controls for several years now, and with no repercussions: A majority of the world\u2019s nations still speak of undemocratic rule by a Jewish minority as a hypothetical future, not an unacceptable present.A standoff as Palestinians and Israeli soldiers await the arrival of Palestinian police officers in Gaza in 1994.Later came the threat of renewed Palestinian violence. But Israel, with the strongest army in the region, has repeatedly demonstrated that it can endure and outlast whatever bursts of resistance the divided and exhausted Palestinians can muster.The next threats, too, came up empty. The rise of nominally pro-Palestinian powers like India and China has, to date, had no negative effect on Israel, which has strengthened ties with both countries. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, though noisy on some American campuses, has yet to make a dent in Israel\u2019s economy or its citizens\u2019 self-reported level of life satisfaction, among the highest in the world.Advocacy among some Palestinian intellectuals and their allies for enfranchisement in a single state, the so-called one-state solution, has not been endorsed by a single Palestinian faction and is a long way from drawing majority support in the West Bank and Gaza. If the proposal ever gathered momentum, Israel could easily counter it by withdrawing from the West Bank, as it did from Gaza in 2005.The latest, though surely not the last, in this list of threats is the prospect of political changes within America and its Jewish community. Israel has become a more partisan issue, and polls show a majority of Democrats in favor of some economic sanctions or other action against Israeli settlements. Among American Jews, a growing rate of intermarriage with gentiles is lessening attachment to Israel, and Jewish organizations are increasingly divided over support for the country. Despite such vexation, mainly among liberal Jews, surveys over nearly four decades have shown overall American backing for Israel over the Palestinians only increasing, and none of the hand-wringing has translated into changes in American policy.For American politicians, electoral and campaign finance incentives still dictate a baseline of unconditional support for Israel. The United States has given more than $120 billion to the country since the occupation began, spent tens of billions of dollars backing pro-Israel regimes ruling over anti-Israel populations in Egypt and Jordan, and provided billions more to the Palestinian Authority on condition that it continue preventing attacks and protests against Israeli settlements. And those expenditures do not reckon the cost to American security interests of Arab and Muslim resentment toward the United States for enabling and bankrolling the oppression of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.For the most part, the Palestinians themselves have done much to support the status quo. The myth upheld by leaders of the Palestinian government is that cooperating with Israel\u2019s occupation \u2014 which, in fact, makes the occupation less costly, more invisible to Israelis and easier to sustain \u2014 will somehow bring it to an end. This will happen, the theory goes, either because Palestinian good behavior will generate pressure from the contented Israeli public or because Israel, once deprived of excuses, will be forced by the United States and the international community to grant Palestinians their independence.This is the myth underlying the continued support of the Oslo arrangements long after they were set to expire in 1999. It was also the basis for the two-year plan of former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to build the institutions of a Palestinian state, and for the 12 years of quiescence and close security cooperation with Israel under President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank.A counterpart to this myth, propounded by Israeli officials and regurgitated by American policy makers, is that Israel will not make concessions if pressured but will do so if it is warmly embraced. The historical record demonstrates the opposite.Severe pressure from the United States, including the threat of economic sanctions, forced Israel to evacuate Sinai and Gaza after the 1956 Suez crisis. It also compelled Israel to commit to a partial Sinai pullout in 1975. It made Israel acquiesce to the principle of its withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war, including the West Bank, in the 1978 Camp David accords. And it obliged Israel to reverse its incursions into southern Lebanon in 1977 and 1978.By the same token, it was Palestinian pressure, including mass demonstrations and violence, that precipitated every Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territory. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who agreed to the first Israeli pullouts from parts of the West Bank and Gaza, made his initial proposals for Palestinian self-government in 1989, when he was the defense minister attempting to quash the first intifada. Even Yitzhak Shamir, then the prime minister and a vehement opponent of ceding territory to the Arabs, put forward an autonomy plan for Palestinians later that year.As the intifada developed into an increasingly militarized conflict in 1993, and Israel sealed off the occupied territories in March that year, Israeli negotiators held secret meetings with Palestinians near Oslo. There, they asked for an end to the intifada and soon agreed to evacuate the military government and establish Palestinian self-rule. In 1996, the clashes and riots known as the tunnel uprising led directly to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s promise to negotiate a withdrawal from most of Hebron, which Israel formally committed to do several months later.As bloodshed diminished, though, Israel\u2019s sense of urgency about the Palestinian problem dissipated. No serious proposals for unilateral withdrawal were made again until the level of violence in the West Bank and Jerusalem escalated in late 2015.Finally, for Israel, the most pervasive myth is that there is no Palestinian partner for peace. Palestinians are irredeemably rejectionist, runs this argument; they will not give up on their impossible goals and have never made real compromises, in spite of every generous Israeli proposal. The truth is that the history of the Palestinian national movement is one long series of military defeats and ideological concessions. Each of those slowly moved the Palestine Liberation Organization from rejection of any Israeli presence to acceptance and recognition of Israel on the pre-1967 lines, compromising 78 percent of historic Palestine. For years, the international community bullied and cajoled the P.L.O. to accept a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, the remaining 22 percent.When the P.L.O. finally did so, in 1988, the rug was pulled out from under it. Palestinians woke up to find that 22 percent of the homeland had been redefined as their new maximalist demand. Shimon Peres was among the few Israeli leaders to recognize the magnitude of the Palestinians\u2019 concession. He called it Israel\u2019s \u201cgreatest achievement.\u201dIn the last quarter-century of intermittent American-led negotiations, the powerlessness of the Palestinians has led to still further concessions. The P.L.O. has accepted that Israel would annex settlement blocs, consented to give up large parts of East Jerusalem, acknowledged that any agreement on the return of Palestinian refugees will satisfy Israel\u2019s demographic concerns and agreed to various limitations on the military capabilities and sovereignty of a future state of Palestine.During that time, Palestinians were never presented with what Israel offered every neighboring country: full withdrawal from occupied territory. Egypt obtained sovereignty over the last inch of sand in Sinai. Jordan established peace based on the former international boundary, recovering 147 square miles. Syria received a 1998 proposal from Prime Minister Netanyahu (on which he subsequently backtracked) for a total evacuation from the Golan Heights. And Lebanon achieved a withdrawal to the United Nations-defined border without granting Israel recognition, peace or even a cease-fire agreement.The Palestinians, though, remain too weak, politically and militarily, to secure such an offer, and the United States and the international community won\u2019t apply the pressure necessary to force Israel to make one. Instead, the United States and its allies pay lip service to the need to end the occupation, but do nothing to steer Israel from its preferred option of perpetuating it: enjoying the dowry, denying the bride.This is the first in a series of articles that will examine the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, a half-century on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest-Selling Artist at Auction Is a Name You May Not Know", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf asked, \u201cWho is the biggest-selling artist at auction?\u201d few people in the art world would answer \u201cZhang Daqian.\u201dThe scale of these prices reflects how the balance of financial power has shifted to Chinese auctions. Artprice calculated that in 2016 \u2014 a year marked by nervousness and contraction in the art market \u2014 China captured 38 percent of the $12.45 billion in public fine art sales worldwide, eclipsing the 28 percent achieved in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable when you think that in 1985 it was illegal to sell art in mainland China, and now there are 400 auction houses,\u201d said James Lally, a New York dealer in historic Chinese works of art. \u201cThe rules are being set by Chinese buyers.\u201dBoth Zao and Zhang lived most of their lives abroad. \u201cThe interest in both of their oeuvres shows that Chinese in China are getting more and more interested in other Chinese stories of modernity \u2014 That is, stories other than the ones that happened in the P.R.C.,\u201d said Shane McCausland, a professor of art history at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, referring to the People\u2019s Republic of China.But modernism is not the only best-selling Chinese story. In Hong Kong, historic art continues to generate big auction prices. Mr. Lally attended Christie\u2019s auction on Wednesday of a large celadon-glazed \u201cDouble Dragon\u201d amphora in the Tang style from the reign of Emperor Yongzheng, who ruled from 1722 to 1735. This finely preserved item of porcelain was pushed by two telephone bidders to 140.5 million dollars, toward the upper range of Christie\u2019s estimate. \u201cIt\u2019s a very impressive piece,\u201d Mr. Lally said, \u201cbut that\u2019s plenty of money for a piece of porcelain from the 18th century.\u201dOn May 28, Phillips held its second Hong Kong evening sale of 20th century and contemporary art and design. This raised 129.8 million dollars, or $16.6 million, from 57 lots, five of which failed to sell. The Sean Scully abstract \u201cWall of Light Green,\u201d from 2013, sold for $1.4 million, almost doubling a high estimate that reflected current gallery prices.\u201cThe waiting list for the artist is in the hundreds,\u201d said Jonathan Crockett, Phillips\u2019s head of 20th century and contemporary art in Asia, who has been following Ms. Ay Tjoe\u2019s career. \u201cThree or four years ago, if you were lucky enough to be able to buy one of her paintings, it would have cost between $50,000 and $100,000.\u201dAs Professor McCausland notes, the state-run China Artists Association now officially promotes a \u201cconservative nativist\u201d art that reframes \u2014 some might say regurgitates \u2014 the traditions of ink painting. This aesthetic was on show in the derivative, decorative works on offer at Christie\u2019s \u201cChinese Contemporary Ink\u201d auction on May 29, which raised 17.7 million dollars. \u201cIf people want to curry favor with the government, or the Party, they\u2019ll collect it,\u201d said Professor McCausland.Meanwhile, the market for what the West would recognize as \u201ccutting edge\u201d contemporary art remains disproportionately small in China, considering the country\u2019s economic and cultural might.Mr. Taylor\u2019s London gallery is exhibiting seven large-scale works by the Shanghai abstract painter Ding Yi. Little-known in the West, Ding uses a visual language of grids and crosses to obliquely evoke the seismic psychological and physical changes that China has undergone in recent years. The paintings, from 2016, are priced at 350,000 pounds, or about $450,000. Two have sold; one buyer was from Europe, the other from the United States.Mr. Taylor said he had found it encouraging to see a far larger attendance of mainland Chinese visitors at this year\u2019s Art Basel Hong Kong, but he remained skeptical that contemporary pieces would come to dominate China\u2019s visual culture and art market as they have in the United States and Britain \u2014 at least any time soon.\u201cThere just aren\u2019t that many people\u201d in China who are interested in buying international contemporary art, Mr. Taylor said. \u201cEvery museum has a historical collection at its core,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re all rooted in tradition.\u201dTastes change, of course, and electronic devices are revolutionizing notions of culture all over the world. But the millennia-old artistic traditions exemplified by Zhang Daqian suggest that China\u2019s cultural tastes might well last longer than ours.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Democrats Can Find New Voters", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe relentless focus on the white working class in the aftermath of the election of President Trump has overshadowed a much larger bloc of voters, the roughly 65 million service sector workers whose partisan loyalty is up for grabs.This immense and diverse employment sector is set to become a battleground in the struggle between Democrats and Republicans.Mark Muro, a Brookings senior fellow, noted in an email:While the term \"service sector\" has become somewhat pejorative, with its ambience of lousy locally-traded food-service and maintenance jobsit also includesresearch services, education services, and professional services like consulting.Muro sees potential for Democratic Party growth in the service sector, arguing thatthe ongoing \"servitization\u201d of the economy is a big trend and it likely will benefit the Democratic Party for years to come.Manufacturing jobs moved in the opposite direction, falling from 18.2 million in 1974 to 12.4 million.Richard Florida, the director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, has conducted some of the most detailed analyses of employment sectors.\u201cRepublicans dominate working class metros,\u201d Florida noted in an email. \u201cDemocrats dominate knowledge-professional-creative class metros.\u201dStanding between the working and creative classes are low-paid service workers. Florida places better paid service workers who are technically in the service class \u2014 lawyers, teachers, social workers, many high tech digital employees \u2014 into the creative class.With this more restrictive definition, Florida notes, service workers are stillthe largest class with 65 million workers, about 45 percent of the work force. Low wage routine jobs in food prep retail, office work, personal and health services. Majority women, multiracial, multiethnic.How do they vote? Florida finds that this population currently splits its vote evenly between the two parties \u2014 \u201cno statistical significance for either Trump or Clinton.\u201d According to Florida, for Democrats, to keep \u201cbemoaning the loss of the white working class may be a big mistake.\u201dFlorida argues that low-paid service workers are the population that Democrats need to mobilize. He suggests a far more targeted approach:Not working class places. The way to do this is with an aggressive inclusive growth agenda: upgrade service jobs, higher geographically-indexed minimum wage, better labor laws to protect service and caring work and jobs, universal basic income, affordable housing. I could go on. This is the new winning cross-class, geographic coalition.Patrick Adler, a doctoral candidate in urban planning at U.C.L.A. who collaborated with Florida on this research, does not disagree, but has some caveats. He sent me data he compiled that suggests that low-paid service workers are by no means guaranteed to become loyal Democrats. Much depends on ethnic and other demographic characteristics.Adler analyzed 2016 voter information from 75 metropolitan areas with absolute majorities (at least 50 percent) of low-wage service workers \u2014 cities like Ocean City, N.J., Hot Springs, Ark. and Las Vegas.Adler\u2019s data shows that the strongest Clinton metro areas were 49.8 percent Latino, while Trump\u2019s best metros were 8.7 percent Latino. Clinton metros had four times the percentage of foreign-born voters (at 20 percent) as Trump\u2019s (at 5 percent).\u201cWhat stands out to me,\u201d Adler wrote,is that solidly Clinton service metros tend to be immigrant gateways like Miami, McAllen and Orlando, while solidly Trump service metros tend to be highly segregated (i.e., black/white segregated) Southern places.The demographics of the pro-Clinton metros point to additional problems facing Democrats who seek to build support among service workers. The high levels of immigrant, Latino and foreign-born voters in these communities means that it is more challenging to register and turn them out.Democrats, however, know that they need to get more votes from workers without college degrees, and that their best opportunity to do so is among service workers.For example, 77 percent of the 5.8 million employed in personal care and service occupations are women; 72 percent of the 17.7 million people working in office and administrative support occupations are women; and 75.6 percent of the 8.9 million in health care occupations.Democratic operatives and union organizers are starting to mobilize lower-paid service workers in preparation for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential elections. The Service Workers International Union is gearing up for a major political and union organizing campaign in the Midwest.Union officials estimate that there are 64 million workers across the country who make less than $15 an hour.\u201cOnly half are registered, and only half of them voted. 48 million of them did not vote in 2016,\u201d one union leader, who asked not to be identified so that he could be forthright, told me. A big problem last year, he said, was thatHillary Clinton didn\u2019t inspire anyone. Why the hell stand in line if it\u2019s just to vote for more of the same?Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and strategist, wrote me by email to say that he thinks Florida\u2019s analysis \u201cis very smart.\u201d Greenberg, like many pollsters, had been broadly categorizing voters without college degrees as working class, but recently he has begun to change the practice:For the first time, we are asking occupation to try to get at this \u2014 and so, I think there really is potential for Democrats to gain here. This is a real insight into what is possible.Service industries are where the growth strategies of organized labor have been mostly focused for 40 years, and where most of the growth has occurred. While union membership has stagnated on the bottom line at around 16 million over that span, the composition of the 16 million changed dramatically, millions of health care, personal service, education and government workers (and some retail) joining, while roughly the same number in other sectors \u201cleaving.\u201dRepublican leaders, Booth argues, are fully aware of the dangers of an organized and politically mobilized service sector. \u201cThe effort to strangle this opportunity has been the top strategic priority of the GOP\u201d since it gained power in the 2010 midterm elections, he contended. These efforts include state right-to-work legislation, ending automatic deduction of union dues, severe restrictions on the issues permitted at the bargaining table, and other restraints on organized labor.Booth notes that in 2014, Democrats and unions successfully backed ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage in three red states, Alaska, Arkansas and South Dakota, \u201cbut little or none of the support spilled over to help Mark Pryor, Mark Begich and Rick Weiland,\u201d the losing Democratic Senate candidates in those states.One key obstacle for Democrats seeking to recruit service workers is that such a mobilization would require stronger class appeals and less emphasis on identity politics than party leaders have been prepared to make.If, as my SEIU source says, \u201cpolitics doesn\u2019t answer people\u2019s problems,\u201d then you are \u201cnot going to get majorities willing to get into the fight.\u201dSimilar tension has been a constant source of intraparty conflict dating back nearly 50 years to the 1968 presidential primary battle between Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy.The conflict will not be resolved by November 2018. But the ideas suggested by Richard Florida are a start. Nothing instills the drive to adopt successful strategies like the anguish of defeat and the relegation to minority status.An earlier version of this column misstated the name of the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees when Paul Booth, an executive assistant for the organization, retired; it was Lee Saunders, the current president, not Gerald McEntee, a former one, for whom Mr. Booth also worked earlier in his career.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "OPEC Took Aim at U.S. Oil Producers, but Hurt Itself, Too", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Picture a three-year-old tug of war waged across the globe that leaves both sides wobbly and scarred but unmoved. That\u2019s one way of looking at the high-stakes competition between the world\u2019s big oil exporters and the companies drilling in American shale fields.On one side of the rope is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the Saudi-led group whose strategy for retaining market dominance has twirled from one failed tactic to another as it struggles to conquer a glut that will almost surely suppress prices for at least another year.At least 123 of the companies operating in North America have filed for bankruptcy since early 2015, and the survivors, like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have watched their share prices slump well below bull market averages as they borrow to keep up their dividends. More than 150,000 oil workers lost their jobs in the United States alone, although the job market is beginning to recover.\u201cFor both sides, there has been one twist in the road after another,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit, an energy research consultancy. For prices to rise again, \u201cinventories have to be seen as coming down, and there needs to be a tempering in the growth of U.S. shale production,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the two things that are defining the market right now.\u201dBut neither is happening.United States oil production, which averaged 8.9 million barrels a day in 2016, will rise to 9.3 million barrels a day this year, according to the Energy Department. The department is projecting production of 10 million barrels a day in 2018, exceeding the record set in 1970. Last week domestic crude inventories eased a bit, but gasoline stockpiles rose by 2.1 million barrels.OPEC set the latest market cycle in motion in late 2014, when the Saudis and their allies decided to swing cartel policy in an unexpected direction. Instead of cutting production to support prices, as it had done so often in the past, OPEC decided to let market forces loose and then even raised production.The goal was a sharp but brief price slump that would drive independent American producers out of business to guarantee continued OPEC dominance of international markets.American drilling did drop precipitously, as companies decommissioned more than half their rigs and neglected to complete wells already drilled through 2015 and part of last year.But the American producers proved durable. They pushed innovation to produce more oil at lower costs by drilling longer lateral wells through shale fields. Their effort was helped along by cost reductions for drilling and production made possible in part by new technologies, including robotics and sensors to improve efficiencies.Companies generally lost money through much of 2015 and 2016, and while some are beginning to earn a profit again, others risk being taken over or going out of business altogether.\u201cNobody wants to come to grips with the fact the days of $70 and $80 oil are over,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \u201cThe shale producers continue to cut costs, and that gives them the hope to survive. But if oil prices don\u2019t rise significantly from the current level, 50 percent of the shale producers will go out of business.\u201d\u201cThe unexpected resilience and revival of U.S. shale production is already frustrating OPEC\u2019s efforts to draw down global stocks,\u201d said Badr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, based in the United Arab Emirates, \u201cand threatening its market share at the same time.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.But OPEC\u2019s cuts were partly a mirage. Its production actually rose by 290,000 barrels a day in May, to the highest level of the year, because Libya and Nigeria were exempted from the cuts and were gushing crude onto world markets.Political instability could throttle production from either country at any moment, but both continue to surprise the markets with their robust exports.But another twist may lie ahead in the battle for markets. Lower prices could force companies to slash production again. Already, some are cutting back on exploration and new projects in fields where it is expensive to operate, like the Canadian oil sands.\u201cIt remains to be seen if drilling can continue at the same pace in a sub-$50 environment once price hedges expire,\u201d Mr. Jafar said, referring to the American shale producers. \u201cBut if it does, I believe OPEC producers will have no choice but to revert to preservation of market share once again, which could see prices nose-dive. And the cycle will continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Election Delivers New Variable for Uncertain Global Economy", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In a global economy amply stocked with anxiety-provoking variables, Britain just added another.An election designed to bolster the government\u2019s mandate instead yielded fundamental confusion over who is in charge as the nation prepares for fraught negotiations in its pending divorce from the European Union.Investors took the latest turmoil in Britain as a prompt to unload the British pound. As European markets began trading on Friday, the currency slipped as much as 2 percent against the dollar. The country\u2019s benchmark stock index, however, gained around 1 percent. Analysts said that rise occurred because many of the companies that make up the index do a majority of their business overseas and therefore benefit from a cheaper pound.And yet the shocking electoral outcome also has the potential to diminish the looming economic costs of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, commonly known as Brexit.It enhanced the possibility that a chastened government led by Mrs. May would now strike a less confrontational approach with Europe while seeking a way to keep Britain within the bloc\u2019s large single marketplace.The European authorities have consistently emphasized that Britain\u2019s continued inclusion in the single market requires that it abide by the bloc\u2019s rules \u2014 not least, a provision that people be allowed to move freely within its confines.In the parlance of the moment, Britain appeared destined for a so-called hard Brexit, in which it would sever itself from the single marketplace, raising the prospect that tariffs could ultimately constrain trade across the English Channel.This redrawing of the basic geography of European commerce was playing out just as President Trump was disavowing regional trade deals across the Atlantic and Pacific, while variously threatening trade hostilities with Canada, China, Germany and Mexico.This election could change that trajectory.It is unclear how long Mrs. May\u2019s government will hold together \u2014 even with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland, it retains a narrow majority in parliament. But the unexpected new political configuration might compel Britain to relinquish its pursuit of immigration limits in an effort to keep itself within the single market.In short, the election has complicated the assumption that Britain is headed irretrievably toward the exits, producing a moment in which seemingly everything may be up for reconsideration.Those who have favored Britain remaining within Europe, or at least softening the terms of its exit, now have \u201can expectation, or at least a hope, that cooler heads will prevail,\u201d said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, a company based in London that manages foreign exchange transactions. \u201cIt may be that hard Brexit has been rejected by the electorate.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.And yet, perhaps counterintuitively, the election also appeared to increase the possibility of an unruly Brexit in which Britain crashes out of the European Union absent a deal governing future interaction.Mrs. May formally initiated the proceedings in March, setting the clock ticking on a two-year negotiating window in which Britain and Europe must settle financial terms and strike an agreement on trade. That was always going to be complicated, subject to the influence of domestic politics in the other 27 members of the European Union.Now, such talks are to unfold in an atmosphere in which she must tame an unruly party whose fiercest advocates for Brexit may be emboldened by her narrow majority, with the prospect of still another election later this year. All of which heightens the possibility that the two-year clock may expire without a deal, a scenario known in Brexit vernacular as going over the cliff edge. As the metaphor implies, it could get ugly.Britain now sends nearly half its exports to the European Union, a flow of goods that would be impeded by its departure from the single market.Worries about the economic impact of Brexit have been weighing heavily on the pound, which plunged after the referendum last June that unleashed Brexit. With Britain at risk of suffering barriers to trade, it has lost some of its considerable luster as a place for companies to invest, making its money a less desirable currency to hold.A weakened pound has, in turn, translated into rising prices in Britain \u2014 on food, gasoline and imported components used by domestic factories. All of this has reinforced concerns about the fate of the economy.The scene in Britain has played out just as other sources of uncertainty have been gnawing at the global economy.Add to the list of variables the fact that Britain \u2014 with the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy \u2014 is scheduled to sit down with European leaders to haggle over Brexit just days after its leadership suffered a major setback at the polls.The decisive question is whether this latest wave of uncertainty marks a step back from Brexit, one that could restore a sense of calm, or whether it means more chaos at a time when the world craves capable leadership.\u201cThe outlook for Brexit is now very unclear,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy, said as the sun rose over London. \u201cThe odds of a softer Brexit have increased as a result of the outcome last night. At the same time, it also does increase the odds of a cliff-edge Brexit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese City With a Russian Past Struggles to Preserve Its Legacy", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHarbin JournalFor Gao Hong, a local businesswoman, such structures are not at all surprising. They were standard features of the Harbin she knew as a child, a city constructed in the late 19th century as a Far Eastern outpost of imperial Russia, a base for the Chinese Eastern Railway in what was once known as Manchuria.But the two have witnessed something in common: the old architecture being demolished to make room for expanding roads and cookie-cutter high-rise blocks.\u201cAt least a third of these old buildings have disappeared,\u201d Ms. Gao lamented. \u201cThe city has changed beyond recognition.\u201dDistressed by the destruction and empowered by social media, Mr. Bu, Ms. Gao and other residents have banded together to preserve what remains of Harbin\u2019s Russian architecture, battered as it has been by waves of war, revolution and, now, urban redevelopment.Last year, when the Harbin city government decided that the bridge would have to be removed to make room for a high-speed rail line, it met with strong resistance from residents. Hundreds signed petitions and thousands wrote comments online calling on the government to abandon the plan. Some hung protest banners on the bridge.\u201cThere\u2019s hardly anyone here in Harbin who doesn\u2019t know the Jihong Bridge,\u201d Ms. Gao said over lunch at Lucia, a Russian restaurant. \u201cSo there was a huge backlash because people have incredibly deep feelings about it.\u201dThe State Administration of Cultural Heritage weighed in, too, rejecting the Harbin government\u2019s initial plan to dismantle the bridge and move it to a new location.Under the plan that was finally approved, the bridge will be kept at its original site but on a longer and higher span to accommodate the new rail line.This was not the first time Ms. Gao faced the possible destruction of a city landmark. In 2014, she started researching and writing about the remaining older structures on WeChat, the social messaging platform. One three-story building, now a jewelry store, used to house the United States Consulate. Another, home to a Russian businessman, was seized by Japanese soldiers in the 1930s who turned its basement into a prison.The street where Mr. Hu grew up was once lined with villas. But starting in the 1980s, with the introduction of a market-based economy and real estate speculation, he said, \u201cthe demolition began.\u201d\u201cIt was economic reform and opening up, and construction began on a massive scale,\u201d Mr. Hu said at his restaurant, whose wooden ceiling and wall panels he carved himself, a skill he mastered when he was sent to the countryside to work as a teenager in the 1970s. \u201cThey said we needed to build more apartments, because we didn\u2019t have enough housing, but the quality of those new apartments is so shoddy.\u201dThe making of Harbin is like no other Chinese city. In 1898, Russian engineers and workers from both Russia and China came to build the Chinese Eastern Railway. They were soon followed by Russian Jews fleeing pogroms, and then aristocrats driven out by the Bolshevik Revolution and White Russian troops seeking refuge after defeat in civil war.Chinese were also drawn to Harbin, first to help build the railway and later for business. Some set up shops and factories and became successful entrepreneurs. Borrowing designs from their foreign neighbors, many built stone houses with European exteriors and Chinese-style interior courtyards \u2014 a style local residents commonly call \u201cChinese baroque.\u201dIt was only in recent years that the local government, finally realizing that the city\u2019s unique architecture could attract tourists, began renovating some of the surviving older buildings. Now, the city takes pride in St. Sophia Cathedral, which has been preserved as a museum, and the Russian buildings along the Central Boulevard. One synagogue has been turned into a concert hall, and another into a Jewish museum.But to local preservationists, those efforts have come too late, and in some cases are ill conceived.The project, which has counterparts in many other Chinese cities that have constructed new \u201cold cities,\u201d has been met with scorn from local preservationists who say it is absurd that the government is tearing down authentic older architecture and building imitations.\u201cIt\u2019s a failure, because it\u2019s fake,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Evicting the old residents, and with them the popular restaurants and shops they ran, has destroyed the character of the district, they say.\u201cPeople have left, and shops are gone,\u201d said Yin Haijie, a sociology professor at the Harbin Institute of Technology. \u201cCultural preservation means nothing to real estate developers and the government. Nothing is being considered but economic interests.\u201dMs. Yin said the city lacked good channels for local scholars and preservationists to communicate with the government. \u201cWe are really disadvantaged,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government is strong and society is weak.\u201dOn a recent afternoon, workers were drilling into Jihong Bridge\u2019s concrete walkways. The bridge\u2019s four obelisks and the carved lion heads that have stood sentinel for nearly a century glistened in the sun.\u201cWe have tried,\u201d Ms. Gao said. \u201cIn the end we might be powerless, but we are still trying our best.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Buy a Home? Beware: It\u2019s a Seller\u2019s Market", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserA tight supply of houses for sale, along with rising prices and worries about higher mortgage rates, is making buying a home a challenge in some areas this season.Because of a lack of inventory of homes in some markets, there is often a rush of offers when properties do become available, said Javier Vivas, manager of economic research at Realtor.com, a listing website. \u201cBuyers,\u201d he said, \u201cshould expect heavy competition.\u201d\u201cDemand is easily outstripping supply in most of the country, and it\u2019s stymieing many prospective buyers from finding a home to purchase,\u201d Lawrence Yun, an economist for the Realtors association, said in a statement about the housing market.An improved economy has stimulated demand for housing, but the supply of homes for sale has lagged, making it harder for shoppers to find affordable properties, said Daren Blomquist, a senior vice president with Attom Data Solutions, which tracks property trends.One factor in the tight supply, Mr. Blomquist said, is that people are holding onto their homes longer than they once did. Investors who bought homes during the recession are earning rental income and are not in a rush to sell, while some owners still cannot sell because they remain underwater on their mortgages \u2014 meaning they owe more than the homes are worth. The average home seller these days has owned the house for about eight years, he said, compared with about four years before the recession.Another factor, according to Attom\u2019s data: fewer foreclosures. Nearly 10 years after the financial crisis, foreclosures are at prerecession levels in many areas, reducing another source of homes for sale.All that means that competition is fierce in some markets, especially for lower- and midpriced homes, and home shoppers must be nimble. Lynn Johnson, a broker with Bamboo Realty in bustling Raleigh, N.C., said buyers must understand that they do not have days to mull an offer. \u201cThey have to be ready to pull the trigger if they find the right house,\u201d she said.The choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest financial decisions that many adults make.Buyers must also be prepared to put more cash down when they place a property under contract, she said. In the past, Ms. Johnson said, shoppers could expect to put down $500 as a \u201cdue diligence\u201d deposit to the seller, which they would expect to lose if they found a house they liked better and walked away from a purchase contract. But now, sellers may demand deposits of $1,000, and sometimes as much as $2,500.In Denver, where the inventory of homes has been low for the past couple of years, \u201cThere is no such thing as lowballing,\u201d said Stacie Staub, founder of West and Main Homes in Lakewood, Colo., near Denver. Often, she said, homes go on the market on a Friday and are under contract by Sunday.The market is so tight that Ms. Staub often recommends that people looking to trade up to a new home should first sell their own house, and then go shopping with cash. Sellers generally frown on \u201ccontingency\u201d offers, which are subject to the sale of an existing home. When sellers are receiving multiple offers, they\u2019ll choose all-cash bids over contingency offers, she said: \u201cIf you can\u2019t pay cash, it\u2019s harder to get your offer accepted.\u201dBuyers are often so eager that sellers can negotiate a two-month \u201crent back,\u201d she said, so they can live in their home \u2014 often rent-free \u2014 while shopping for a new one, Ms. Staub said.Even markets that had not been so cutthroat are starting to shift. The area in and around Fayetteville, N.C., had been \u201cmedium warm\u201d earlier in the spring, but activity has heated up, said Rosemary Buerger, an agent with Coldwell Banker Advantage in Cameron, north of Fort Bragg. A lack of new construction has helped to tighten inventories, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in more of a seller\u2019s market now,\u201d she said.Here are some questions and answers about the current home-buying market:How should I approach house shopping in a tight market?Ms. Johnson advises clients to write out a list of \u201cneeds,\u201d or must-haves, and wants, to streamline their house-hunting efforts. \u201cDo you have to have four bedrooms?\u201d she said. \u201cThen why look at a three-bedroom? You cannot waste time.\u201dBrokers say shoppers should expect that sellers will receive multiple offers. This means that if you find a house you like, you should make your best offer right away. Many shoppers want to offer the list price or below, but in a seller\u2019s market that may put you at a disadvantage, Ms. Johnson said; in Raleigh, homes often sell for more than the list price.What should I expect will come with the house?In calmer markets, buyers typically expected to get major appliances like refrigerators, washers and dryers \u2014 perhaps even that riding lawn mower sitting in the garage \u2014 with the purchase of the home. Not so in a seller\u2019s market, Ms. Johnson warned. \u201cYou are getting the house,\u201d she said. Appliances, and usually closing costs, are most likely on you, she said.What are mortgage rates doing?Rates are still low by historical standards, reducing some of the pressure from rising home prices. They\u2019re up compared with a year ago, but they dipped a bit on Thursday, according to the weekly report from Freddie Mac. Rates on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.89 percent, down from 3.94 percent last week. (A year ago, the average was 3.6 percent.)Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.E.C. Lets All Firms Keep Parts of I.P.O. Filings Secret", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byIn an attempt to revitalize the public capital markets, the nation\u2019s top regulator of stocks is turning to stealth mode.The Securities and Exchange Commission, in Walter J. Clayton\u2019s first major policy move as chairman, is expanding a program that will allow all private companies to keep some details of their finances and business strategies under wraps early in the process of an initial public offering.Currently, only smaller companies are allowed to confidentially file draft registration statements for review by the agency before offerings. Some well-known companies, like Snap, Twitter and the burger chain Shake Shack have been able to do so, but the threshold of annual gross revenue of $1 billion has barred others.Filing confidentiality is intended to make it easier for companies that want to go public. It allows companies to iron out any wrinkles in their financial reporting with the regulator privately. And they do not have to worry about competitors getting an early peek at their figures.Yet some market specialists say confidential filing has had little impact and question why markets regulators are emphasizing secrecy over openness.Since the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Start-Ups) Act was enacted, some 1,350 confidential filings have been submitted, as of March 31, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.The Nasdaq stock market, which competes with the New York Stock Exchange for the listings of new companies, cheered the S.E.C.\u2019s decision.\u201cWe have long supported such an action and believe it is one step forward in making the public markets more attractive, which will foster economic growth,\u201d Adena Friedman, the chief executive of Nasdaq, said in a statement.Jay R. Ritter, a professor at the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida, who studies initial public offerings, was more skeptical about its effects, although he generally supported the idea.\u201cThis is not necessarily going to encourage more companies to go public,\u201d Professor Ritter said. \u201cThe whole JOBS Act has had very marginal impact.\u201dOne criticism of the confidentiality provision has been that it shortens the time between when a prospectus becomes public and the road show for investors before the trading debut of a stock. But that should not be a major obstacle for big investors who can spend time poring over the filing, Professor Ritter said.At his confirmation hearing in March, Mr. Clayton \u2014 who as a longtime lawyer at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell worked on a number of initial public offerings, including Alibaba\u2019s and Och-Ziff Capital Management\u2019s \u2014 emphasized that he would \u201clike to see more companies going public here.\u201dHe and Republican lawmakers have pointed to regulation as a prime culprit for the shrunken universe in American stocks.\u201cWe are striving for efficiency in our processes to encourage more companies to consider going public, which can result in more choices for investors, job creation and a stronger U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Clayton said on Thursday.Yet other forces have clearly been at work over the last two decades. Wave after wave of mergers and acquisitions have caused many stocks to be delisted. Mutual funds and other big investors tend to prefer bigger investments to many small investments in new company offerings and the like.Perhaps more important, younger companies, particularly in technology, are now able to raise huge sums of capital privately and have no need of public markets. Take Uber, which has raised more than $14 billion from venture capitalists and other investors, giving the private company a valuation of $70 billion.Mr. Clayton cited Uber during his confirmation hearing as an example of a company that 20 years ago probably would have gone public at this point.This year, however, there have been signs of improvement in the market for new stocks. Renaissance Capital noted on Thursday that 54 initial offerings raised $11 billion in the second quarter \u2014 the most in number and proceeds in two years. Already, the market for new stocks, led by companies like Altice USA and Blue Apron, has raised more capital this year than in all of 2016.The commission said on Thursday that permitting all companies to file secretly would give them more flexibility to plan their offerings and reduce \u201cthe potential for lengthy exposure to market fluctuations that can adversely affect the offering process and harm existing public shareholders.\u201dAnna Pinedo, a partner at Morrison & Foerster who specializes in securities law, said the expansion on confidential filing would also apply to companies considering a direct listing on a stock exchange without seeking to raise capital through a public offering.But until now, a company considering a direct listing had to make its filing public when it applied. Ms. Pinedo said the commission\u2019s action would permit any company to keep its financial statements confidential until 15 days before its shares are set to begin trading.\u201cIf you look at how much money unicorns have raised, perhaps they don\u2019t need to do a conventional I.P.O.,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the burger chain that recently made its initial public offering. It is Shake Shack, not Snack Shack.Jeffrey Cane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

My friend is almost invariably calm and good-humored, but when he called his voice was filled with anxiety. \u201cI got this letter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d The letter was nothing less than a deportation decree. German authorities had decided to send Peer back to Afghanistan, our war-torn home country.For the past six years, Peer has lived here in Stuttgart. In 2011, he fled his home in Paktia Province, in eastern Afghanistan, because of worsening violence. He reached Germany after traveling, often by foot, through Iran, Turkey, Greece and the Balkans. After a year in Stuttgart, he found a job as a cleaner, which he has held ever since. Today, he is integrated into society, has learned better-than-passable German and pays his fair share of taxes. He has made friends from around the world and has begun to plan a future here.But all of a sudden, he was forced to book a plane to Kabul. The authorities had told him to \u201cleave voluntarily,\u201d a veiled threat that contained the specter of state agents appearing at his door if he failed to self-deport. To incentivize his allegedly voluntary return, Peer will receive a few hundred euros.Targeting Afghan asylum seekers for deportation has become a trend in the European Union, where governments are seeking to decrease and discourage migration. While refugees from Iraq or Syria are regularly granted asylum, more and more Afghans face deportation. Even though Afghanistan has been plagued by war for nearly 40 years, countries like Sweden, Austria and Germany argue that many Afghans are \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d and that their country has \u201csafe areas\u201d to which they can return.Since then, Afghan refugees all over Europe have been thrust into a state of dread. Meanwhile, the Afghan government pretends to be in control of the country\u2019s security. According to President Ashraf Ghani, the European Union\u2019s money is needed to boost the country\u2019s economy. However, most of it might vanish in Afghanistan\u2019s corrupt political system, as has happened in the past with international aid.\u201cHow do these people dare to decide about our lives and destinies?,\u201d Peer said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a charade.

{"Headline": "The Car Was Repossessed, but the Debt Remains", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than a decade after Yvette Harris\u2019s 1997 Mitsubishi was repossessed, she is still paying off her car loan.She has no choice. Her auto lender took her to court and won the right to seize a portion of her income to cover her debt. The lender has so far been able to garnish $4,133 from her paychecks \u2014 a drain that at one point forced Ms. Harris, a single mother who lives in the Bronx, to go on public assistance to support her two sons.\u201cHow am I still paying for a car I don\u2019t have?\u201d she asked.For millions of Americans like Ms. Harris who have shaky credit and had to turn to subprime auto loans with high interest rates and hefty fees to buy a car, there is no getting out.Many of these auto loans, it turns out, have a habit of haunting people long after their cars have been repossessed.The reason: Unable to recover the balance of the loans by repossessing and reselling the cars, some subprime lenders are aggressively suing borrowers to collect what remains \u2014 even 13 years later.Ms. Harris\u2019s predicament goes a long way toward explaining how lenders, working hand in hand with auto dealers, have made billions of dollars extending high-interest loans to Americans on the financial margins.These are people desperate enough to take on thousands of dollars of debt at interest rates as high as 24 percent for one simple reason: Without a car, they have no way to get to work or to doctors.With their low credit scores, buying or leasing a new car is not an option. And when all the interest and fees of a subprime loan are added up, even a used car with mechanical defects and many miles on the odometer can end up costing more than a new car.Subprime lenders are willing to take a chance on these risky borrowers because when they default, the lenders can repossess their cars and persuade judges in 46 states to give them the power to seize borrowers\u2019 paychecks to cover the balance of the car loan.Now, with defaults rising, federal banking regulators and economists are worried how the strain of these loans will spill over into the broader economy.For low-income Americans, the fallout could, in some ways, be worse than the mortgage crisis.With mortgages, people could turn in the keys to their house and walk away. But with auto debt, there is increasingly no exit. Repossession, rather than being the end, is just the beginning.\u201cLow-income earners are shackled to this debt,\u201d said Shanna Tallarico, a consumer lawyer with the New York Legal Assistance Group.There are no national tallies of how many borrowers face the collection lawsuits, known within the industry as deficiency cases. But state records show that the courts are becoming flooded with such lawsuits.For example, the large subprime lender Credit Acceptance has filed more than 17,000 lawsuits against borrowers in New York alone since 2010, court records show. And debt buyers \u2014 companies that scoop up huge numbers of soured loans for pennies on the dollar \u2014 bring their own cases, breathing new life into old bills.Portfolio Recovery Associates, one of the nation\u2019s largest debt buyers, purchased about $30.2 million of auto deficiencies in the first quarter of this year, up from $411,000 just a year earlier.One of the people Credit Acceptance sued is Nagham Jawad, a refugee from Iraq, who moved to Syracuse after her father was killed. Soon after settling into her new home in 2009, Ms. Jawad took out a loan for $5,900 and bought a used car.After only a few months on the road, the transmission on the 10-year-old Chevy Tahoe gave out. The vehicle was in such bad shape that her lender didn\u2019t bother to repossess it when Ms. Jawad, 39, fell behind on payments.\u201cThese are garbage cars sold at outrageous interest rates,\u201d said her lawyer, Gary J. Pieples, director of the consumer law clinic at the Syracuse University College of Law.The value of any car typically starts to decline the moment it leaves the dealer\u2019s lot. In the subprime market, however, the value of the cars is often beside the point.A dealership in Queens refused to cancel Theresa Robinson\u2019s loan of nearly $8,000 and give her a refund for a car that broke down days after she drove it off the lot.Instead, Ms. Robinson, a Staten Island resident who is physically disabled and was desperate for a car to get to her doctors\u2019 appointments, was told to pick a different car from the lot.The second car she selected \u2014 a 2005 Chrysler Pacifica \u2014 eventually broke down as well. Unable to afford the loan payments after sinking thousands of dollars into repairs, Ms. Robinson defaulted.Her subprime lender took her to court and won the right to garnish her income from babysitting her grandson to cover her loan payments.Ms. Robinson and her lawyer, Ms. Tallarico, are now fighting to get the judgment overturned.\u201cEssentially, the dealers are not selling cars. They are selling bad loans,\u201d said Adam Taub, a lawyer in Detroit who has defended consumers in hundreds of these cases.Many lawyers assisting poor borrowers like Ms. Robinson say they learn about the lawsuits only after a judge has issued a decision in favor of the lender.Most borrowers can\u2019t afford lawyers and don\u2019t show up to court to challenge the lawsuits. That means the collectors win many cases, transforming the debts into judgments they can use to garnish wages.The lenders argue that they are just recouping through the courts what they are legally owed. They also argue that subprime auto lending meets an important need.And collecting on the debt is a critical part of the business. The first item on the quarterly earnings of Credit Acceptance, the large subprime auto lender, is not the amount of loans it makes, but what it expects to collect on the debt.The company, for example, expects a 72 percent collection rate on loans made in 2014 \u2014 the year that a used 2009 Volkswagen Tiguan was repossessed from Nina Lysloff of Ypsilanti, Mich.With all the interest and fees on her Credit Acceptance loan factored in, the car ended up costing her $28,383. Ms. Lysloff could have bought a brand-new Volkswagen Tiguan for $22,149, according to Kelley Blue Book.When Ms. Lysloff fell behind, the trade-in value on the car was a fraction of what she still owed. Last year, Credit Acceptance sued her for $15,755.The strategy at Credit Acceptance, which has a market value of $4.4 billion, is yielding big profits. The Michigan company said its return on equity, a measure of profitability, was 31 percent last year \u2014 more than four times Bank of America\u2019s return.Credit Acceptance did not respond to requests for comment.Some of the people who got subprime loans lacked enough income to qualify for any loan.U.S. Bank is pursuing Tara Pearson for the $9,339 left after her 2011 Hyundai Accent was stolen and she could not pay the fee to get it from the impound lot. When she purchased the car in 2015 at a dealership in Winchester, Ky., Ms. Pearson said, she explained that her only income was about $722 from Social Security.Her loan application listed things differently. Her employer was identified as \u201cS.S.I.,\u201d and her income was put at $2,750, court records show.Citing continuing litigation, U.S. Bank declined to comment about Ms. Pearson.Auto lending was one of the few types of credit that did not dry up during the financial crisis. It now stands at more than $1.1 trillion.Despite many signs that the market is overheating, securities tied to the loans are so profitable \u2014 yielding twice as much as certain Treasury securities \u2014 that they remain a sought-after investment on Wall Street.\u201cThe dog keeps eating until its stomach explodes,\u201d said Daniel Zwirn, who runs Arena, a hedge fund that has avoided subprime auto investments.Some lenders are pulling back from making new loans. Subprime auto lending reached a 10-year low in the first quarter. But for those borrowers already stuck with debt, there is no end in sight.Ms. Harris, the single mother from the Bronx, said that even after her wages had been garnished and she paid an additional $2,743 on her own, her lender was still seeking to collect about $6,500.\u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Said to Pick Nominees for 2 Positions on Fed Board", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has selected candidates for at least two of the three open positions on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors, according to people with direct knowledge of the decision.The expected nominees include Randal K. Quarles, a Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration, and Marvin Goodfriend, a former Fed official who is now a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University.In picking Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend, President Trump is seeking to install conservative counterweights to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. Both men have expressed reservations about the Fed\u2019s aggressive efforts to revive economic growth since the 2008 crisis.Mr. Quarles would also become a leading figure in the administration\u2019s efforts to roll back financial regulation. He would be nominated to serve as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, with responsibility for overseeing the Fed\u2019s regulatory responsibilities.It is not clear when the administration intends to announce the nominations, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential conversations. Until that happens, it remains possible that Mr. Trump could decide to reopen the search process.Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend did not return calls requesting comment. \u201cWe have no announcement at this time,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman.Mr. Quarles was a lawyer for the financial industry before joining the Bush administration in 2002, first as assistant secretary for international affairs and then as under secretary for domestic finance. After leaving the administration in 2006, he became a partner at the Carlyle Group before helping to found Cynosure in 2014.At the Fed, Mr. Quarles would take the place of Daniel Tarullo, who led the Fed\u2019s push to tighten financial regulation after the 2008 crisis, though he was never formally nominated to serve as the vice chairman for supervision.Mr. Quarles is regarded as significantly more sympathetic than Mr. Tarullo to the industry\u2019s concerns that regulation is overly restrictive, limiting economic growth.One of Mr. Quarles\u2019s major tasks at the Fed would be overseeing the annual \u201cstress test\" of large banks, intended to make sure that they can weather a crisis.But his influence would be constrained, at least in the short term, because Ms. Yellen played a key role in developing those regulations. Ms. Yellen\u2019s term ends in February 2018, creating the next Fed personnel decision confronting Mr. Trump.He left the bank in 2005 to join the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University.Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend have expressed support for the idea that the Federal Reserve should adopt a more formulaic approach to policy-making. House Republicans have proposed legislation that would require the Fed to articulate a policy rule \u2014 a mathematical approach to determining the level of interest rates \u2014 that would limit the role of human judgment in monetary policy.Mr. Goodfriend is also a critic of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases in the wake of the financial crisis. The Fed amassed more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Goodfriend has said that the Fed should not purchase mortgage bonds, because doing so promotes economic growth in a particular sector \u2014 the kind of judgment that should be left to those who determine fiscal policy.The Fed has operated in recent years without a full complement of seven governors. The board oversees regulatory policy, and the governors also hold permanent votes on the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.By law, the Fed\u2019s board must include at least one person with community banking experience, and two of the people with direct knowledge of the process said that a number of candidates with that background have been interviewed in recent weeks. It is not clear, however, where a decision on filling the community-banking governor opening now stands.Binyamin Appelbaum reported from Washington, and Kate Kelly from New York.Advertisement"}

That is good for the economy and good for society.\u201dA core principle of consumer lending, she said, is making sure you lend to someone capable of repayment.In a national income-sharing program, the government would provide a specific amount of financial assistance, and in return, the student would agree to pay a small percentage of earned income to the government over a certain number of years. There would also be a cap on the total amount that could be paid back.At Washington College, Ms. Bair has proposed something slightly different: a donor-funded income-sharing program.

But analysts have raised concerns that the rally could soon lose steam, arguing that company earnings have been bolstered by tax cuts rather than improved bottom lines.The benchmark Nikkei average gained 1.6 percent on Friday to close at 20,177, the first time it topped the symbolic 20,000 mark since December 2015. Markets in Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia and India also rose.A modest decline in the value of the yen has helped. A weaker currency makes Japanese multinationals like Toyota and Hitachi more profitable, by increasing the value of the revenue they earn outside Japan.Buoyed by robust global demand, earnings at publicly traded Japanese companies during the most recent fiscal year, which ended in March, rose to their highest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis. The gains in the Japanese stock market on Friday were widely shared, with businesses as diverse as steel makers, insurance companies and department stores attracting investors.A strong American economy has also pushed global markets higher, and any sign that the pace of growth in the United States was slowing could undercut those advances.Japanese stocks have in effect been playing catch-up, as well. In spite of the recent surge in share prices, Japan has still underperformed other big markets this year.Some analysts expect the rally to lose steam.One reason is taxes. Profits at Japanese companies have been strengthened in part by falling corporate income tax rates. The government has cut taxes three times since 2013, a change that has been the largest contributor to earnings gains over the past five years, analysts at UBS said in a note to clients this week.Another small tax cut is planned for next year, but the overall momentum for cuts is slowing, UBS noted. That would mean companies will have to find ways to improve their bottom lines on their own, or see the earnings growth that has drawn investors to the Nikkei fade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brownback Tax Cuts Set Off a Revolt by Kansas Republicans", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Sam Brownback\u2019s leadership of Kansas came to be synonymous with a single, unyielding philosophy: Cut taxes, cut the size of government, and the state will thrive.But this week, Mr. Brownback\u2019s deeply conservative state turned on him and his austere approach. Fed up with gaping budget shortfalls, inadequate education funding and insufficient revenue, the Republican-controlled Legislature capped months of turmoil by overriding the governor\u2019s veto of a bill that would undo some of his tax cuts and raise $1.2 billion over two years.The move amounted to a shocking rejection of the tax-cutting experiment Mr. Brownback had held up as the centerpiece of his conservative governing. But economic growth and revenues lagged, and even his allies began to publicly criticize the tax cuts.The results were a warning of the risks for other Republican-controlled states that have tested similar approaches, and a dizzying descent for Mr. Brownback\u2019s legacy and any future political aspirations.\u201cBeing governor was all about his tax plan,\u201d Dinah Sykes, a state senator and fellow Republican, said of Mr. Brownback. \u201cAnd he really believed it was the right step. But as many of us have seen, it was not. We had to take a vote to say no and say, \u2018This is not the right direction.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how the governor doesn\u2019t see that.\u201dMs. Sykes, who was among the moderate Republican lawmakers to vote to override Mr. Brownback\u2019s veto, said she thought she had no choice but to push for a change. Her suburban Kansas City district had grown weary of the governor\u2019s uncompromising fiscal approach over the last six years, she said, as had many other Kansans.\u201cEmail after email after email I get from constituents, say, \u2018Please, let\u2019s stop this experiment,\u2019\u201d she said.On Tuesday night, the State Senate and House, both held by Republicans, moved swiftly, narrowly voting hours apart to turn back the governor\u2019s veto of the tax increase. For Mr. Brownback, a onetime presidential candidate who has grown increasingly isolated, it was a devastating blow \u2014 a final rejection by some of his allies for his centerpiece doctrine.\u201cWe\u2019ve made a big step backwards,\u201d Mr. Brownback said on Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s the wrong philosophy to implement.\u201d He portrayed the choices as deciding to be either a low-tax state that encouraged business growth or a high-tax state that killed it.\u201cA lot of people made it about me,\u201d said Mr. Brownback, a farm boy turned successful lawyer, state secretary of agriculture, member of Congress and the 46th governor of Kansas. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Kansas. It\u2019s about the future of this state.\u201dThe outcome in Kansas was likely to send a signal to other red states pursuing similar tax philosophies about the risks and limits of the approach. Republicans control 24 other state capitals, and some have likewise pressed for tax reductions and limits on spending, though few have taken steps as bold or sustained as in Kansas.Even before this week, Democrats in states like Nebraska and Iowa have held out the Kansas model as a cautionary tale for their own Republican-run states. \u201cIt is something that Iowans talk about, that they don\u2019t want to find themselves in a situation like Kansas,\u201d said State Senator Janet Petersen, a Democrat in Iowa, where business property taxes were reduced in 2013 and where Republicans took control of state government this year.First elected governor of Kansas seven years ago by a wide margin, Mr. Brownback wasted no time steering the Republican Party on a hard-right turn. In his first term, he helped push out moderate Republicans from the Legislature. Under his leadership, Kansas loosened restrictions on guns, made it harder for women to get abortions and passed some of the strictest voting laws in the country.Most famously, he instituted the largest income tax cuts in Kansas history, a move that he promised would act \u201clike a shot of adrenaline in the heart of the Kansas economy.\u201dLast fall, as the policy faltered, the moderate wing of the party roared back, ousting legislators from the far right.Then came the threats of override from a once-loyal State Legislature. Mr. Brownback narrowly escaped an override of his veto of a tax increase in February. In that confrontation, the Senate balked at supporting an override after the House agreed by a single vote to defy Mr. Brownback\u2019s veto of a plan to raise more than $1 billion over two years.And in March, the Kansas Supreme Court found that the state\u2019s spending on public education was unconstitutionally low, dealing the governor another blow and putting added pressure on Republican lawmakers to at least loosen his tax-cutting policy.By Tuesday night, Mr. Brownback\u2019s latest veto on a tax increase was doomed: The State House had four extra votes beyond the two-thirds needed to override; the Senate had exactly the two-thirds needed. The tax increase affects income tax rates and exemptions for some farmers and business owners.As news of the developments filtered out on Wednesday morning, starkly split reactions began pouring in around the state. Kris Kobach, the secretary of state and a firm conservative, defended Mr. Brownback\u2019s approach, while some Democrats, like Senator Tom Holland, of Baldwin City, cheered the end of \u201cSam\u2019s march to zero.\u201dJim Ward, the Democratic leader in the Kansas House of Representatives, said there was \u201cgreat relief and excitement\u201d among lawmakers of all partisan loyalties who came to believe that \u201cenough is enough\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ve had your turn.\u201dMr. Ward said the willingness of so many Republicans to vote against the governor showed his waning influence.\u201cHe has spent all of his political capital,\u201d Mr. Ward said. \u201cWhen you see the speaker of the House, who is aligned with him ideologically, vote to override him on a tax bill, which is like the holy grail of Republican politics, or the fourth rail, don\u2019t touch it, that just shows the governor\u2019s ability to persuade is gone.\u201dIn Topeka, even before the Legislature opened in January, rumors were swirling around the state capital that Mr. Brownback was on his way out, headed to a job in the Trump administration before the end of his term, two years from now. So far, no job outside Kansas has materialized, but talk of his shrinking popularity and precarious political future have persisted.Mr. Kobach, best known for his controversial stances on immigration and voter fraud, is widely expected to run for the Republican nomination. He denounced the Legislature\u2019s override vote.\u201cKansas does not have a taxation problem; it has a spending problem,\u201d he said, suggesting that the state could have balanced its budget by cutting spending across state agencies and reducing the number of government employees. He added that Mr. Brownback could hold up other accomplishments as governor \u2014 his toughening of laws on abortion and guns \u2014 that go beyond fiscal matters.\u201cCertainly the tax cuts were a central part of his agenda for the last six and a half years,\u201d Mr. Kobach said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that that part is damaged.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Doctor Is In. Co-Pay? $40,000.", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Velvet Rope EconomySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When John Battelle\u2019s teenage son broke his leg at a suburban soccer game, naturally the first call his parents made was to 911. The second was to Dr. Jordan Shlain, the concierge doctor here who treats Mr. Battelle and his family.\u201cThey\u2019re taking him to a local hospital,\u201d Mr. Battelle\u2019s wife, Michelle, told Dr. Shlain as the boy rode in an ambulance to a nearby emergency room in Marin County. \u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d Dr. Shlain instructed them. \u201cYou don\u2019t want that leg set by an E.R. doc at a local medical center. You want it set by the head of orthopedics at a hospital in the city.\u201dWithin minutes, the ambulance was on the Golden Gate Bridge, bound for California Pacific Medical Center, one of San Francisco\u2019s top hospitals. Dr. Shlain was there to meet them when they arrived, and the boy was seen almost immediately by an orthopedist with decades of experience.For Mr. Battelle, a veteran media entrepreneur, the experience convinced him that the annual fee he pays to have Dr. Shlain on call is worth it, despite his guilt over what he admits is very special treatment.\u201cI feel badly that I have the means to jump the line,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you have kids, you jump the line. You just do. If you have the money, would you not spend it for that?\u201dIncreasingly, it is a question being asked in hospitals and doctor\u2019s offices, especially in wealthier enclaves in places like Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco and New York. And just as a virtual velvet rope has risen between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else on airplanes, cruise ships and amusement parks, widening inequality is also transforming how health care is delivered.Money has always made a big difference in the medical world: fancier rooms at hospitals, better food and access to the latest treatments and technology. Concierge practices, where patients pay several thousand dollars a year so they can quickly reach their primary care doctor, with guaranteed same-day appointments, have been around for decades.But these aren\u2019t the concierge doctors you\u2019ve heard about \u2014 and that\u2019s intentional.Dr. Shlain\u2019s Private Medical group does not advertise and has virtually no presence on the web, and new patients come strictly by word of mouth. But with annual fees that range from $40,000 to $80,000 per family (more than 10 times what conventional concierge practices charge), the suite of services goes far beyond 24-hour access or a Nespresso machine in the waiting room.\u201cIt\u2019s more like a family office for medicine,\u201d Dr. Shlain said, referring to how very wealthy families can hire a team of financial professionals to manage their fortunes and assure the transmission of wealth from generation to generation.Only in this case, they are managing health, on behalf of clients more than equipped to pay out of pocket \u2014 those for whom, as Dr. Shlain put it, \u201cthis is cheaper than the annual gardener\u2019s bill at your mansion.\u201dThere are rewards for the physicians themselves, of course. A successful internist in New York or San Francisco might earn $200,000 to $300,000 per year, according to Dr. Shlain, but Private Medical pays $500,000 to $700,000 annually for the right practitioner.For patients, a limit of no more than 50 families per doctor eliminates the rushed questions and assembly-line pace of even the best primary care practices. House calls are an option for busy patients, and doctors will meet clients at their workplace or the airport if they are pressed for time.In the event of an uncommon diagnosis, Private Medical will locate the top specialists nationally, secure appointments with them immediately and accompany the patient on the visit, even if it is on the opposite coast.Meanwhile, for virtually everyone else, the typical wait to see a doctor is getting longer.\u201cYou have no idea how much money there is here,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Matles, who specializes in internal medicine and joined MD Squared after working at Stanford, where he treated 20 to 25 patients a day and barely had time to talk to them. \u201cDoctors are poor here by comparison.\u201dNowhere is the velvet rope in health care rising faster than here in Northern California, where newfound tech wealth, abundant medical talent and a plethora of health-conscious patients have created a medical system that has more in common with a luxury hotel than with the local clinic.In fact, before founding Private Medical, Dr. Shlain, 50, worked as the on-call doctor at the Mandarin Oriental hotel here, an experience he said taught him about how to provide five-star service as well as good medical care.Private Medical started 15 years ago with a single location in San Francisco, and has since opened practices in nearby Menlo Park, in 2011, and Los Angeles, in 2015. Dr. Shlain is now eyeing an expansion into New York, Seattle and Santa Monica, Calif.The annual fee covers the cost of visits, all tests and procedures in the office, house calls and just about anything else other than hospitalization, as well as personalized annual health plans and detailed quarterly goals for each patient.Although Private Medical provides its patients with doctors\u2019 cellphone numbers and same-day appointments, like more conventional concierge practices do, Dr. Shlain does not like the term \u201cconcierge care.\u201d\u201cWhen I\u2019m at a country club or a party and people ask me what I do, I say I\u2019m an asset manager,\u201d Dr. Shlain explained. \u201cWhen they ask what asset, I point to their body.\u201d\u201cWe organize health care for the entire family,\u201d he said, sitting in his hip-but-not-too-fancy office in a nondescript building in upscale Presidio Heights. Dr. Shlain and his team will coordinate treatment for grandparents in a nursing home and care for their middle-aged children, as well as provide adolescent or pediatric medicine for the grandchildren.For example, when a teenage patient with a history of depression or anxiety moves across the country to Boston for college, Private Medical will line up a top psychiatrist near the school beforehand so a local professional is on call in case there is a recurrence. Or if a middle-aged patient is found to have cancer, Dr. Shlain can secure an appointment in days, not weeks or months, with a specialist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston or Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\u201cIt\u2019s not because we pay them,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s because we have relationships with doctors all over the country.\u201dAs with the ever more rarefied tiers of frequent-flier programs or V.I.P. floors at hotels, the appeal of MD Squared and Private Medical is about intangibles like time, access and personal attention.\u201cI am able to give the time and energy each patient deserves,\u201d said Dr. Matles, the MD Squared physician in Menlo Park. \u201cI wish I could have offered this to everyone in my old practice, but it just wasn\u2019t feasible.\u201dSo in addition to providing immediate access to specialists, concierge doctors also come in handy when otherwise wealthy, powerful people find themselves flummoxed by a health care system that is opaque to outsiders.\u201cIf you need to go to Mass General, we can get you in,\u201d Dr. Matles said. \u201cWe are connected. I don\u2019t know if I can get you to the front of the line, but I can make it smoother. Doctors like to help other doctors.\u201dBut for all their confidence about the advantages of their particular brand of concierge medicine, these physicians are quick to admit they struggle with the ethical issues of providing elite treatment for a wealthy few, even as tens of millions of American struggle to afford basic care.He sees no reason that the medical world should not respond to consumer demand like any other player in the service economy. \u201cWhenever I bump into a bleeding-heart liberal, which I am, I mention that schools, housing and food are all tiered systems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut health care is an island of socialism in a system of tiered capitalism? Tell me how that works.\u201dDr. Howard Maron, who founded MD Squared, is similarly candid about the new reality of ultra-elite medical care.\u201cIn my old waiting room in Seattle, the C.E.O. of a company might be sitting next to a custodian from that company,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhile I admired that egalitarian aspect of medicine, it started to appear somewhat odd. Why would people who have all their other affairs in order \u2014 legal, financial, even groundskeepers \u2014 settle for a 15-minute slot?\u201dA third-generation doctor from Boston, Dr. Jones offers a version of concierge medicine that is a way of providing more personalized service \u2014 the way doctors did when he graduated from medical school more than four decades ago \u2014 rather than delivering a different standard of care.\u201cEncina is like a Unesco World Heritage site \u2014 we practice medicine the way it has been traditionally practiced,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because you\u2019re an Encina patient doesn\u2019t mean you can go to the front of the line, unless you need to because of your case.\u201dNot far from Dr. Jones\u2019s office in Palo Alto, the new wing of Stanford\u2019s hospital is taking shape. Designed by the star architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, it will feature a rooftop garden and a glass-paneled atrium topped with a 65-foot dome. And unlike the old wing, all of the new building\u2019s 368 rooms will be single occupancy, a crucial amenity for hospitals competing to attract elite patients from across the United States and overseas.Stanford raised a significant portion of the project\u2019s $2 billion cost by cultivating wealthy patients \u2014 a funding model used by university hospitals around the country, which is especially effective among the millionaires and billionaires of Silicon Valley.Not to be outdone, Lenox Hill Hospital in New York recently hired a veteran of Louis Vuitton and Nordstrom, Joe Leggio, to create an atmosphere that would remind V.I.P. patients of visiting a luxury boutique or hotel, not a hospital. \u201cThis is something that patients asked for, and we want to go from three-star service to five-star service,\u201d said Mr. Leggio, the hospital\u2019s director of patient and customer experience.In its maternity ward, the Park Avenue Suite costs $2,400 per night, twice what a deluxe suite at the Carlyle Hotel down the street commands, but that\u2019s not a problem for well-heeled new parents. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z welcomed their baby, Blue Ivy, into the world at Lenox Hill, as did Chelsea Clinton and her husband, and Simon Cowell and his girlfriend.With a separate sitting room for family members, a kitchenette and a full wardrobe closet, the suite overlooking Park Avenue is a world away from the semiprivate experience upstairs at the hospital, where families share an old-fashioned room divided by a curtain. Slightly less exalted but still private rooms in Lenox Hill\u2019s maternity ward range from $630 to $1,700 per night.As the stream of celebrity couples suggests, there is plenty of demand for these upscale options, crowding out traditional maternity wards. Lenox Hill is replacing some of its shared maternity rooms with private rooms, a far more profitable offering for hospitals since patients pay for them out of pocket, not through insurance plans that can bargain down rates.Hospital executives argue that giving the well heeled extra attention is a way of keeping the lights on and providing care for ordinary middle- and even upper-middle-class patients, as reimbursements from private insurers and the federal government shrink. \u201cI need to succeed to pay for the children we are bringing in from all over the world and treat for free,\u201d said Dr. Angelo Acquista, a veteran pulmonologist who leads Lenox Hill\u2019s executive health and international outreach programs.Then there are the red blankets that some big Stanford benefactors receive when they check in as patients. For doctors and nurses, it is a quiet sign of these donors\u2019 special status, which is also noted in their medical records.\u201cYou don\u2019t get better care,\u201d Dr. Jones said. \u201cBut maybe the dean comes by, and if it\u2019s done well, it\u2019s done invisibly. It\u2019s an acknowledgment of a contribution to the organization.\u201dRex Chiu, an internist with Private Medical in Menlo Park, spent more than a decade as a doctor on Stanford\u2019s faculty. \u201cI loved my time at Stanford, but I was spending less and less time with patients,\u201d he said. \u201cFifteen or 20 minutes a year with each patient isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\u201cWe all say we should get the same care, but I got sick and tired of waiting for that to happen,\u201d he added. \u201cI decided to go for quality, not quantity.\u201dBesides more money, the calmer pace of high-end concierge medicine is also a major selling point for physicians \u2014 Dr. Matles said he never made it to an event at his children\u2019s school until he joined MD Squared. But for Dr. Sarah Greene, it wasn\u2019t really the money or the lifestyle that led her to Private Medical.\u201cI really have time to think about my patients when they\u2019re not in front of me,\u201d said Dr. Greene, a pediatrician who joined the company\u2019s Los Angeles practice in October. \u201cI may spend a morning researching and emailing specialists for one patient. Before, I had to see 10 patients in a morning, and could never spend that kind of time on one case.\u201dGetting in the door as a new hire isn\u2019t easy. When it comes to credentials like college, medical school and residency, Dr. Shlain said, \u201cat least two out of the three need to be Ivy League, or Ivy League-esque.\u201dIn many ways, today\u2019s elite concierge physician provides the same service as the family doctor did a half-century ago for millions of Americans, except that it is reserved for the tiny sliver of the population who can pay tens of thousands of dollars annually for it.\u201cI didn\u2019t know this level of care was possible,\u201d said Trevor Traina, a serial entrepreneur here who is a patient of Dr. Shlain\u2019s. \u201cI have a better relationship with my veterinarian than the doctors I went to in the past.\u201dWhat about everyone else? Mr. Traina doesn\u2019t see much future for the conventional family doctor, except for patients who go the concierge route.\u201cThe traditional model of having a good internist is dying,\u201d said Mr. Traina, a scion of a prominent family here that arrived with the California Gold Rush. \u201cEven the 25-year-olds at my company either have some form of concierge doc, or they\u2019ll just go to an H.M.O. or a walk-in clinic. No one here has a regular doctor anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From City to Jungle, a New Novel Summons the Politics and History of Two Islands", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Nick Laird\u2019s third novel, \u201cModern Gods,\u201d assumes the guise at various points of novels we\u2019ve all read before: A man discovers he can\u2019t escape the violent deeds of his past; a woman fed up with her life is spiritually revived by a visit to a third-world guru; a family reunion catalyzes the sharing of secrets and sorting out of misunderstandings. But this deeply ambitious book is none of those things, exactly \u2014 or rather, it is all of them and a great deal more. The characters in \u201cModern Gods\u201d traverse oceans, time zones and political situations as part of Laird\u2019s project to pry apart the very structures of worship and locate the systems they have in common, among them storytelling and ritual cruelty.The plot of \u201cModern Gods\u201d pivots around several disparate journeys: Liz Donnelly, whose anthropology Ph.D. led to early success with a self-help book and TV series in which she applied the teachings of L\u00e9vi-Strauss to the project of personal happiness, returns to her hometown in Northern Ireland for her younger sister\u2019s wedding. Liz\u2019s life in New York has run aground; she can\u2019t finish a second book and has just discovered her boyfriend dallying with another man. Her anthropologist\u2019s sensibility, applied to small-town Protestant Northern Ireland, is archly revealing; standing among her sister\u2019s wedding presents, \u201cshe surveyed the landscape of wrapped shapes. Ulster \u2014 a gift-based culture. You received, you returned, you passed it on. The statelet ran on quid pro quo, on tit for tat \u2014 and the rules applied as much as to toasters given at weddings as sectarian slaughter.\u201dSectarian slaughter crosshatches the early sections of the novel in the form of descriptions of a massacre that took place 20 years earlier in a pub. Assailants in Halloween masks shot five people during a live music set, and in brief interludes the carnage is described from the perspective of the victims, whose last impressions the reader painfully shares. Sectarian violence has also traumatized Stephen McLean, the soon-to-be second husband of Liz\u2019s sister, Alison. His father, a Protestant policeman, was shot 26 times by the I.R.A. when Stephen was a child. Stephen has acknowledged to Alison a prior involvement in the Troubles, but she has chosen not to know the details.Laird, the author of two previous novels and several acclaimed collections of poetry, dazzles ear and eye with his kinetic prose, animating city, countryside and, later, tropical jungle. Describing New York, he writes: \u201cThe sun had sunk out of sight, but the glass sides of the skyscrapers downtown gave back its old lion face.\u201d Of Liz\u2019s arrival in Northern Ireland: \u201cThe light of Ulster traveled not by particle or wave but by indirection, hint and rumor. A kind of light of no-light, emanating from a sun so swathed in clouds it was impossible to tell where it lurked in the sky.\u201dWith a mere flick of description, Laird summons vast stretches of politics and history. Here is his brief summation of the economic bubble as experienced in Ballyglass, the town Liz hails from: \u201cA shop selling only mobile phone cases opened. A shop selling designer children\u2019s clothes opened. There was an ice cream \u2018shoppe.\u2019 There was a deli selling \u2018organic produce.\u2019 The citizens of Ballyglass watched these developments with disbelief, amusement, anger and finally despair. When the economy collapsed, the main feeling was one of vindication; it had always seemed ridiculous, fantastical, and so it had been proved. The town had been poor for all of its 500 years, and by God it would be poor again.\u201dAfter Alison\u2019s wedding to Stephen, the novel splits into two new directions: Alison and Stephen begin a vexed honeymoon on Rhodes, and Liz travels to New Ulster, off the coast of Papua New Guinea, where she has agreed to fill in as a last-minute presenter for an episode in a BBC series on religion. The subject is a charismatic female leader called Belef, who has rejected the evangelical teachings of the missionaries who dominate the region in favor of a new religion she has invented, known as the Story. The juxtaposition of Ulster with New Ulster, not to mention a cult leader whose name sounds a lot like \u201cBelief,\u201d raises the specter of a schema, but events in New Ulster are lively enough to distract the reader from these suggestive symmetries. Watching Margo, a neurotic BBC producer, try to package the unpredictable and possibly psychotic Belef, who talks to dead people through the trunks of trees, is highly amusing. Equally so is Belef\u2019s immediate and inexplicable fixation upon Liz. \u201cBelef whispered urgently, \u2018Elisabet, I know you are in grief but you are here for purposes.\u2019 It seemed to Liz like the rock beneath her shifted. How could she know? What did she mean?\u201dStill, the dynamism Laird has conjured in New Ulster \u2014 a trill of incipient violence; a mass imbibing of a hallucinogen that leaves the BBC producer prone and vomiting \u2014 keeps us reading, and the tragic climax resonates powerfully with the Northern Ireland sections of the novel. Apart from any theory, the events of the story leave a vivid impression of the opportunistic mythmaking, sectarian conflict and pragmatic greed at the heart of these religious systems. As Liz observes while in church during Alison\u2019s wedding: \u201cEverywhere imagery of sacrifice and offering, memorials and altars \u2014 but even while disguised as just the opposite, a sanctuary from materialism, the church functioned as a marketplace of cold transactions. For it was here that all the contracts were proposed, signed, enacted. \u2026 Portrait of the Christian as a stakeholder, as a shrewd and patient small investor.\u201dIn the end, the Donnelly family members reunite in Ballyglass for a coda that perhaps is destined not to satisfy after the sweep of all that precedes it. Secrets are revealed and misunderstandings clarified with the too-neat rush of a last scene in a Shakespearean comedy. But it is a problem comedy, to be sure, for no amount of family catharsis can subdue the dark roil of violence and trauma that Laird\u2019s tale has summoned, and that still flickers just behind it.Jennifer Egan\u2019s new novel, \u201cManhattan Beach,\u201d will be published in October.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Anti-Nafta Stance Is on a Collision Course with Natural Gas", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Of all the industries thrown into question by President Trump\u2019s promise to upend free trade with Mexico, natural gas is easily one of the most important.More than a quarter of Mexico\u2019s electricity is powered by American natural gas, leaving it especially vulnerable to any upheavals from a trade battle with the United States.But selling natural gas to Mexico is also a godsend for the American energy industry, which is lobbying the White House to emphasize just how crucial the relationship with Mexico is.With billions of dollars at stake and zigzagging administration stances on trade, American energy companies are taking no chances. They are also setting their sights on an old friend in a unique position to help: Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, who recently served on the board of a pipeline company that ships natural gas to Mexico and who is now Mr. Trump\u2019s energy secretary.But if the United States pulls out of the agreement, it will be up to the Energy Department to approve future gas exports considered to be in the national interest.That places Mr. Perry in a pivotal role at a tense time, and there is good reason to consider him a friend of the industry. As governor of Texas, he defended contentious practices like fracking to promote his state\u2019s oil production and natural gas exports. Under his watch, production of natural gas in the state soared 50 percent.After he left office, Mr. Perry joined the board of Energy Transfer Partners, a company that has completed four gas pipelines to Mexico in the last two years.And when he ran for president in 2016, the company\u2019s chief executive became the single biggest contributor to Mr. Perry\u2019s ill-fated campaign.\u201cRick Perry is a really good friend of mine and he is a bright guy,\u201d Mr. Warren said. \u201cHe understands the energy business quite well, and it gives me great comfort that he is in that position.\u201dThen this month, the American Petroleum Institute, one of the strongest lobbies in Washington, made its position unmistakably clear in an open letter to the administration stating that \u201cthe current Nafta agreement works for the oil and gas industry.\u201dMr. Perry says he understands the symbiotic nature of the relationship between Mexico and American energy companies, and he has promised to do what he can to maintain it. Even in the unlikely event that Nafta could not be renegotiated, he said, he would fully support continuing the energy trade.\u201cI see this as an opportunity to allow an American natural resource to help bolster both countries\u2019 economies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall goal of the Trump administration is to sell what Americans make to bolster this economy. If you are selling it to a partner, a neighbor, even better.\u201dMr. Perry said his stance was not clouded by his former job on the board of Energy Transfer. Having already passed through the revolving door between government and the energy industry, Mr. Perry said, he was in no way conflicted about his new role.\u201cI work for Donald Trump and I work for the American people,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s threats against Mexico and shifting statements about withdrawing from Nafta have prompted some worry, however, persuading Mexican officials to begin exploring options in the event of a cutoff.\u201cIn the context of an escalating trade war, a cutoff of gas by one side or the other is possible,\u201d said Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, an energy research firm.Such a move, according to Mr. Book, would summon what he calls a \u201cmutually assured destruction scenario,\u201d in which American companies suffer a serious loss of income and Mexico faces an energy shortage that could devastate the most basic functions of its capital, Mexico City.The impact on the United States could also hit home for some of the most important members of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet and support base. With American gas exports to Mexico expected to double by 2019, most gas will come from Texas, a vital Republican stronghold that is the home state of both Mr. Perry and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.Mr. Trump\u2019s threats have \u201ccreated some worry on Mexico\u2019s part, and as a result Mexico has looked at its backups and alternatives,\u201d said Carlos Pascual, the former American ambassador to Mexico and a senior vice president for IHS Global Energy. \u201cBut the first screams that would go up if the U.S. were to cut off natural gas shipments to Mexico would come from the oil and gas producers in Texas.\u201dAt least 17 pipelines currently carry more than four billion cubic feet of natural gas a day to Mexico, with four additional cross-border pipelines to be completed over the next two years and many more in the planning phase.For Mexico, natural gas is a linchpin of its future. It will become the major source of the nation\u2019s power in the next decade, a crucial resource to generate electricity for citizens and industries. Mexico\u2019s Energy Ministry announced a five-year plan in 2015 to expand the country\u2019s pipeline network to accommodate increased imports of gas.With American natural gas both cheap and readily available, Mexican oil executives have set aside plans to produce their own gas from their country\u2019s shale fields. That has left some worried that if the trade relationship falters, Mexico could suddenly be on shaky ground. Mexican officials have begun to explore importing liquid natural gas from countries like Peru.Publicly, however, officials and executives in Mexico have been cautiously optimistic about the future of the energy trade. In an appearance at Rice University last month, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, chief executive of the national oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, said he felt confident that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies would not interrupt the flow of oil and gas between the nations.\u201cTrade is a win-win, especially in energy,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cIn the case of Mexico and United States it is clearly complementary.\u201dMr. Perry largely agreed, acknowledging the importance of the natural gas trade to American companies and their efforts to protect it.\u201cEverybody in the private sector is going to look after their interests and their stockholders\u2019 interests. I get that, and that\u2019s fine and good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Trump administration is going to make decisions on how to sell American products, create American jobs, and if that helps bolster the relationship with Mexico and Canada in a North America energy strategy, then there is a lot of reason to celebrate.\u201dA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the share of Mexico\u2019s electricity that is generated using American natural gas. As the article correctly stated, it is more than one-quarter, not one-half.Clifford Krauss reported from Houston, and Azam Ahmed from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

Simpson puts us in the audience of the \u201cRing\u201d cycle, notes and all. But any tension in these 60-plus pages lies in the question of whether this couple\u2019s marriage will survive betrayal. It is an operatic marathon that might test the patience of non-aficionados \u2014 in itself a good trick because the principals aren\u2019t enjoying much of anything about their holiday under duress.The winning entry in the dialogue brevity sweepstakes might be the one in \u201cCheapside,\u201d in an exchange between a schoolboy whose parents arrange for a career-counseling lunch with a lawyer friend. \u201c\u2018Your dad was telling me you\u2019re not sure yet what subject you want to take at university.\u2019\u201c\u2018S\u2019right.\u2019\u201c\u2018But you don\u2019t want to follow him into medicine.\u2019\u201c\u2018Blood,\u2019 he said, and shuddered.\u201dAcross the nine stories, in the leitmotif department, trepidations about turning 50 would get the nod. \u201cArizona\u201d takes place during one acupuncture session, where both the acupuncturist, Mae, and the patient, Liz, \u201cwere coalescing a step deeper into middle age.\u201d They discuss \u201cthe private life of the body,\u201d growing older, looking older.

{"Headline": "Nancy Pelosi Tells Democratic Critics, \u2018I Think I\u2019m Worth the Trouble\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, strolled before the cameras on Thursday with defeat at her back once more, projecting a well-worn swagger \u2014 brash, defiant, more than a little off key \u2014 as she insisted that her moment had not passed.With six words, Ms. Pelosi, 77, demonstrated the self-assurance that has powered her as one of the most successful congressional leaders in the modern era. Yet even as Democrats enjoy a surge of grass-roots energy that could resurrect their House majority, some members of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s own party are impatient for her to give up her 15-year grip on power.She is the Democrat most crucial to determining whether her party can take back the House and torpedo President Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 an avatar of the kind of coastal excess that Republicans abhor and that some progressives have come to view suspiciously in an age of ascendant populism.\u201cEverybody wants leaders,\u201d she said in an interview in her office at the Capitol, during which she was often as dismissive of critics in her own party as she was of the Republican opposition. \u201cNot a lot of people want to be led.\u201dTo many Democrats, Ms. Pelosi is their own indispensable woman, a legislative genius, tactical wizard and prolific fund-raiser whose ability to hold together a fractious caucus is written in her own success in passing many laws, and blocking even more.But some in her caucus have reached a different conclusion: She is not, well, worth it.Representative Kathleen Rice, Democrat of New York, said flatly that Democrats had lost their way and could not win the majority back with Ms. Pelosi leading the party. Ms. Rice hosted a Thursday afternoon meeting of just over a dozen anti-Pelosi House Democrats, according to Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who attended. The would-be coup plotters did not emerge with \u201cany action items,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.\u201cThe Republican playbook for the past four election cycles has been very focused, very clear: It\u2019s been an attack on our leader,\u201d Ms. Rice said. \u201cIs it fair? No. Are the attacks accurate? No. But guess what? They work. They\u2019re winning, and we\u2019re losing.\u201dEven allies of Ms. Pelosi say they would be uneasy about her coming to their districts for public events, a practice she has largely given up as she has become such a focal point for Republican attacks.Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky, heaped praise on Ms. Pelosi\u2019s leadership skills but demurred when asked if he would want her to go to Louisville.\u201cNot at a rally,\u201d he said.Ms. Pelosi, boasting that she was \u201cthe biggest fund-raiser in the country\u201d still in office, dismissed suggestions that her time had passed. And she could not help but note that her critics did not mind benefiting from her financial prowess.\u201cYou know what? I want them to win. I want them to win,\u201d she said of those who want her fund-raising help but would just as soon avoid being photographed with her. \u201cIf I were bothered by that, I wouldn\u2019t be raising the money. What is curious to me is people say, \u2018Raise us all the money and then step aside.\u2019 It\u2019s like, what?\u201dSince entering the House Democratic leadership in 2002, Ms. Pelosi has raised nearly $568 million for her party. Just in the 2016 election cycle, she raised over $141 million.Ask any Democrat why Ms. Pelosi is so valuable, and invariably, her ability to raise money will be cited.Yet her allies say she supplies much more than cash, praising her ability to impose member discipline and her skills as a \u201cback-room dealer,\u201d in the admiring words of Representative Dina Titus, Democrat of Nevada.Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, hailed her deftness at \u201cherding cats.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of work for her to kind of keep us away from impeachment and on health care and the economy,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. Of her fund-raising supremacy, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s good at the wealthier folk.\u201dBut after Mr. Ossoff, the Democratic nominee in the Georgia race, harnessed online liberal fervor to raise at least $25 million, largely from small contributions, and Senator Bernie Sanders did the same to bankroll his presidential bid, the value of high-dollar fund-raising is increasingly in question. Some on the left even argue that it is detrimental to the party\u2019s image.\u201cYou can\u2019t tell people you\u2019re against big money, that you\u2019re fighting for the average American, and then spend so much of your time with PACs and corporate interests and the very wealthy,\u201d said Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Texas Democrat who has been frustrated with Ms. Pelosi and is running for the Senate. In any case, Mr. O\u2019Rourke added, \u201cif money were the critical factor, we\u2019d be in the majority right now.\u201d\u201cI am a master legislator,\u201d she said.But when pressed, she talked at length and in bracingly frank terms about why she was under fire in her caucus \u2014 and why it would not impede her.\u201cI think there was a level of disappointment after the election for president, because I think a number of people here thought they were destined for the administration,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, diagnosing the renewed restlessness among some House Democrats.Others in the caucus, she suggested, were simply preening for future campaigns. \u201cIt may serve their purpose statewide to say, \u2018I fought the leadership,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I respect that.\u201dShe said that no Democratic lawmakers had approached her about stepping down since the Georgia contest. And, taking aim at the band of mostly young House Democrats agitating for her to go, she claimed that their criticism had drawn her allies closer: \u201cPeople just flock to support me,\u201d she said.As for why the right so delights in elevating her, Ms. Pelosi said it was because she had been so effective. But she also said that the Republicans targeting her believed her gender made her more polarizing than other political leaders, and that the right\u2019s fixation on her hometown grew out of San Francisco\u2019s identity as a haven of tolerance for gays and lesbians.Tying unpopular, and well-known, congressional figures to others in their party seeking election is hardly a novel strategy. Republicans used the same playbook when Tip O\u2019Neill, a Massachusetts Democrat, was House speaker, portraying him as the picture of liberal excess. And the right spent decades inserting Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s well-known face and Boston brogue into commercials against Democrats running on more conservative terrain.But the irony now is that, while Ms. Pelosi is a down-the-line progressive, she is hardly representative of the Sanders left on economic issues, or of the interest-group enforcers of cultural liberalism. She is resisting calls for House Democrats to run on single-payer health care coverage and is an unapologetic pragmatist when it comes to those in her ranks who deviate from orthodoxy.When a debate about abortion flared earlier this year, Ms. Pelosi made it plain that there was a home in the party for those who oppose abortion rights.The caricature of Ms. Pelosi as an elite California liberal is also faulty. She is more a product of the bare-knuckle Baltimore political clubhouse \u2014 where she learned politics at the knee of her father, the mayor \u2014 than the Pacific Heights chardonnay-and-canap\u00e9s circuit. \u201cHave your fun,\u201d she said at a news conference Thursday, all but taunting her intraparty detractors. \u201cI thrive on competition.\u201dA vast majority of House Democrats expect no such competition, at least not at the moment.\u201cNobody pushed Michael Jordan into retirement,\u201d said Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trauma, Taxes and Trump", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the middle of his speech trashing the climate accord, President Trump suddenly blurted out that his \u201ctax bill is moving along in Congress.\u201d This was something of a surprise since, A) there is no tax bill and, B) nothing is moving along in Congress.\u201cThe most diplomatic thing you could possibly say was, \u2018Wow, that was a real head-scratcher,\u201d said Ron Wyden of Oregon, the leading Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. Diplomatically.The House and Senate come back to Washington on Monday and it\u2019s time to be on guard. I know it\u2019s hard for you to focus on the nation\u2019s legislature when we have an administration that refuses to reveal whether the president believes the globe is warming. But attention must be paid.You\u2019d think the first priority would be passing Obamacare repeal and a new health insurance plan, but it looks like that puppy is never leaving the kennel. This is a wild guess, based mainly on the fact that there are 100 senators, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s been heard saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how we get to 50.\u201dAlso, everybody is going to be sort of distracted, what with the fired F.B.I. director testifying before Congress about whether the president asked him to go easy on the fired national security adviser.So productivity will be less than high. The one thing the Republicans really, really want to do is cut taxes. Well, that and raise the debt limit so the government doesn\u2019t plunge into a giant, calamitous, deadly financial whirlpool and ruin the economy.Of these two priorities, Congress prefers thinking about the tax one. There is bipartisan agreement in Washington that the current tax system, which Wyden likes to call \u201ca dysfunctional, rotting economic carcass,\u201d is \u2026 imperfect.In theory, everyone could get together and come up with a plan to lower corporate tax rates while eliminating special-interest loopholes, make the system simpler for the average citizen and raise the rates on those who have the most ability to pay.O.K., forget the last one.Also, the chances that there will be a big bipartisan deal are somewhat smaller than a premature baby gnat. The last time Congress actually managed that was in 1986. (Really, 1986. It was a great year. Lady Gaga was born. \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d debuted in London. The Dow was hovering around 4,000. Democrats and Republicans went out for drinks together after work.)The Trump administration, however, does have its own plan, which balances tax cuts with the closing of tax loopholes. We know this because Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin testified about it before the Senate Finance Committee last week. So far it\u2019s only one page long, and Mnuchin answered a great many questions by saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question.\u201dPerhaps Mnuchin would have had more detail if he had some help. He doesn\u2019t have a deputy \u2014 there still isn\u2019t a nominee. The last one, Goldman Sachs executive Jim Donovan, withdrew his name from consideration, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.Also, we have a president who refuses to release his tax returns. Totally unfair to keep carping on that now that the election\u2019s over. Except for the part about having a president who refuses to release his tax returns.That was the budget from last week! You remember, the one that counted the same $2 trillion twice? But it presumed the tax cuts wouldn\u2019t add to the deficit, and now that\u2019s apparently back on the table. (The table, Wyden said in a phone interview, \u201cis gonna collapse like some overloaded Thanksgiving banquet.\u201d)The officials who are working for this administration, when they\u2019re not contemplating the ruination of their careers, keep insisting that something great is coming. The tax plan will be \u201cvery detailed\u201d and actually drafted, as opposed to written on the back of a napkin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn told the Fox Business Network. And it will be ready \u2026 \u201cby the end of the summer.\u201dSo what about the thing that\u2019s supposed to be, um, \u201cmoving along\u201d? Could it be just a dumb tax cut for the wealthy? \u201cReform is still part of our agenda,\u201d Cohn insisted.Yeah, and tomorrow the president is going to release his tax returns, after a speech detailing the evolution of his thinking about climate change.Let\u2019s look at this in the brightest way possible. The bad news is that Trump, in a desperate lunge to accomplish something, will try to ram through a quick-and-dirty tax cut that will aid the rich and increase the deficit. Republican administrations that were much saner than this one did exactly that.The good news is that this crowd is so inept it might not work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Martin Schulz: A Partnership Worth Saving", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBERLIN \u2014 In the preamble to their constitution, the American people pledge to \u201cpromote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\u201d This compelling, powerful statement has made the United States a world champion of liberty and democracy \u2014 a commitment for which all who value and honor the common heritage of freedom are grateful.It is precisely these values on which the trans-Atlantic partnership was founded. It is not simply a community of interests, but a lasting friendship between democrats and democracies. Although not free of conflicts and by no means perfect, it is a friendship shaped and sustained by the principles of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and a belief in the market economy. We shall never forget that many Americans sacrificed their lives for democracy and freedom in Europe.However great that legacy may be, sadly, one cannot deny it is in danger of suffering serious damage. The world is undergoing seismic change with barely conceivable consequences. The rules-based international order largely established by the United States and Europe after World War II is no longer automatically accepted by all states. The international system of trade, which for decades has been characterized by the opening up and interaction of markets, is being challenged by a model of barriers and isolationism. A new type of nationalism and authoritarianism is questioning the achievements of freedom and democracy.This authoritarianism is an external challenge to the Western value-based alliance. Neither Russia nor China has an interest in the joint sustained strength and success of democracies in Europe and the United States. However, our values are also threatened from within. Right-wing and populist parties and movements have gained significant ground in some European countries. Their smear campaigns are poisoning democratic culture and cohesion in Europe.With Donald Trump, Americans have elected a president who hardly displays a deep respect for those values and traditions that made the United States and the trans-Atlantic partnership what they are. A president who wants to build walls around the nation of freedom, of immigrants, that the United States has always been. A president who wants to partition off the world\u2019s largest economy and enforce protectionism, who denies climate change and withdraws from the Paris climate agreement \u2014 probably the most significant agreement in the first years of the 21st century. A president who seemingly finds it more important to send a quick tweet than to rely on journalistic and scientific accuracy. A president who made his first official trip abroad to Saudi Arabia to secure a multi-billion-dollar arms deal rather than visit his closest allies in the struggle for peace and cooperation in the world.This president is putting the trans-Atlantic partnership to an unprecedented test. \u201cBusiness as usual\u201d is no adequate response to this challenge, to which Europe can give only one sensible answer: We must strive to achieve greater European cohesion and solidarity. In terms of German and European politics that means, in particular:First, we must do everything in our power to strengthen the partnership. The United States and Europe have a deep political, cultural, economic and personal alliance that is greater than any individual leader of a single country. In a world that has become more unsettled, it is increasingly important that the United States and Europe make efforts to solve problems together. However difficult cooperation may become, our partnership will continue to reach out to the president of the United States.Second, the fact is confrontations will mount. We should not shy away from them as long as they can be settled by argument and with mutual respect. If elected as German chancellor, I would, for example, oppose the American president\u2019s demands for enormous arms increases in Germany and Europe. If Germany actually did increase military spending to 2 percent of its economic output, by the mid-2020s it would have the largest army in Europe. Surely nobody wants this. All the same, we Europeans must face the critical question of whether we already bear enough international responsibility. Instead of engaging in unbridled rearmament we should combat the causes of conflicts, as well as invest in better equipment and strive for more efficiency in military cooperation within both Europe and NATO.Third, Europe overall must become more effective and independent in its policies. To achieve this, it needs to reform from within, invest more in growth and jobs, engage in an ambitious European climate policy and strengthen common foreign and trade policies geared toward transparent, open markets and progressive standards. Europe, thus strengthened, can and should be a self-confident partner of the United States.Finally, American society is much richer and more diverse than the politics of its current government. The mayors, governors, intellectuals and scientists, entrepreneurs, the active elements of civil society, artists and all who constitute progressive America must continue to be our partners, more than ever. We should initiate joint projects to support climate protection, diversity and tolerance, trade, political cooperation and social exchange.What we need now is an alliance of the progressive and benevolent sections of society to shoulder our responsibility for the great legacy of the trans-Atlantic partnership and our common interest in cooperation in a global world. It will not always be easy, but our friendship is worth the effort.Martin Schulz, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, is a candidate for chancellor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conglomerates Didn\u2019t Die. They Look Like Amazon.", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThe conglomerate was supposed to be dead, a relic of a bygone era of corporate America. Investors, we have been repeatedly told, want smaller, nimbler, more focused companies.And yet there is Amazon.Amazon is just one of these new-economy conglomerates. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is another. Facebook is quickly becoming a conglomerate, too.That is very likely true of today\u2019s tech-enabled conglomerates, too, which are spending, and often losing, tens of billions of dollars annually on all sorts of projects and acquisitions that may or may not turn out to be successful. But investors are seemingly willing to give these new behemoths a free pass in the name of growth and innovation \u2014 until they aren\u2019t.If there is any lesson from the last breed of industrial conglomerates, it is that there is a natural life cycle to most of them.The model begins like this: A company that is successful in one area turns itself into a conglomerate by using its free cash flow to finance the development or acquisition of businesses in other areas \u2014 at first, ones that are similar to their current business, and later often ones that are farther afield. And then the company does this again and again.When such an economic machine works, it works extraordinarily well. But when any one of the major levers in the machine breaks or even stalls, the entire enterprise comes under pressure. Shareholders start complaining that the sum of the parts would be worth more separately than together.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cYou look at companies that got really big in the world, the record is not very good,\u201d Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway \u2014 the world\u2019s largest conglomerate \u2014 told investors several years ago.His business partner, Warren Buffett, stunned shareholders this year when he suggested that he expected shares of Berkshire to rise immediately after his death because of speculation that the company would be broken up and thus would be worth more. (He and Mr. Munger both believe that Berkshire is better off intact, but Mr. Buffett thinks investors\u2019 knee-jerk reaction will be to believe the opposite.)When it comes to Amazon (or Alphabet, or any of the new conglomerates), the question is whether there is something fundamentally different about these businesses given their grounding in digital information \u2014 especially as they expand into complex brick-and-mortar operations like upscale supermarkets.In an age of big data and artificial intelligence, are businesses that look disparate really similar? And can one company\u2019s leadership really oversee so many different businesses? When does it become too big to manage?Google\u2019s own internal list of top-10 principles seems to include an anti-conglomerate provision: \u201cIt\u2019s best to do one thing really, really well.\u201dLeaving aside the question of whether that maxim may have been more suitable to the Google of a decade ago, it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped the company from jumping into all sorts of businesses outside its flagship search and advertising business. Some of these businesses \u2014 which include Android, YouTube, Waze, Nest Labs, self-driving cars and internet distribution \u2014 have been more successful than others. Most of these were brought under the Google umbrella through acquisition, evidence of how the company has used the enormous proceeds of its advertising business to subsidize its entrance into all sorts of other enterprises.Facebook, too, is expanding its offerings through acquisition, buying Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR. And for now, there are no obvious signs that looking after a wider array of businesses is weakening the management at Alphabet, Facebook or, for that matter, Amazon.\u201cThe economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote. \u201cUnder these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational \u2014 even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.\u201dEven more provocatively, she contends that Amazon\u2019s role as both a distributor and cloud provider for many of its competitors gives it an unfair advantage. \u201cThis dual role also enables a platform to exploit information collected on companies using its services to undermine them as competitors,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote.Amazon has thus far been left alone by regulators because it has helped reduce prices of most products. It is not a natural monopoly. \u201cCan prices ever be \u2018too low\u2019?\u201d the Federal Trade Commission asks on its website. \u201cThe short answer is yes, but not very often.\u201dThat may be true. But in Amazon\u2019s case, it has the potential to become so dominant in so many areas that its impact could be more than simply lowering prices for consumers; it could put large companies out of business.Were that to happen, this new breed of Silicon Valley conglomerates may become more powerful \u2014 and resilient \u2014 than the 20th-century conglomerates of yore.If Amazon were to use its acquisition of Whole Foods, along with the profits from its other businesses, to lower prices so much that it put out of business a company like Walmart, with its 1.5 million United States employees, would that be a good outcome? Or is that just a natural part of capitalism?The view of Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is clear. The man who is assembling the 21st century\u2019s most fearsome new conglomerate once explained his view of competition this way: \u201cYour margin is my opportunity.\u201dAn earlier version of this column incorrectly included a distinction awarded to Michael C. Jensen, a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School. He is not a Nobel laureate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Trump Honeymoon: Unexpected, and at Risk of Ending", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The short, unexpected honeymoon that China enjoyed with President Trump seems to be in trouble, dashing hopes in Beijing that the two countries had embarked on a new, businesslike relationship.Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that China had failed to pressure North Korea into curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile program means that Beijing must now confront the prospect of a stormier relationship ahead \u2014 not just over North Korea but also tougher stands on trade, currency and the South China Sea that Mr. Trump set aside as he sought President Xi Jinping\u2019s help with Pyongyang.Mr. Trump did not detail what might follow that conclusion, but the options on the table with North Korea \u2014 including more coercive sanctions that could target Chinese companies trading with the country, a military buildup and even the use of force \u2014 are all deeply objectionable to Beijing.At the same time, Mr. Trump had previously suggested he was holding off on getting tough on China\u2019s trade policies in return for Mr. Xi\u2019s help with reining in North Korea, often engaging in public flattery of the leader. Now, Mr. Xi and his colleagues in Beijing must ask \u2014 again \u2014 whether Mr. Trump is serious about the threats he made on the campaign trail.The prospect of a rockier relationship is particularly sensitive now as Mr. Xi prepares to preside over the Communist Party\u2019s 19th National Party Congress in the fall. While Mr. Xi\u2019s re-election to a second five-year term as president is not in doubt, he is said to want to use the gathering to consolidate his authority and reshuffle the leadership, and he does not want any foreign crises to be distractions.\u201cWhat Trump is saying is, I don\u2019t need you on North Korea now, and therefore maybe we should have it out on these other issues, like trade,\u201d said John Delury, an expert on China and the Koreas at Yonsei University in Seoul.The official response from China was fairly muted, though strained.\u201cI have to say that the crux of the Korean Peninsula problem and the focal point of the conflict is not China,\u201d a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, said at a briefing on Wednesday.He added: \u201cResolving the Korean Peninsula issue requires joint efforts, and it won\u2019t work if it depends on China alone.\u201d At the same time, he said that \u201cChina\u2019s role is indispensable.\u201dThe statement by Mr. Trump, although couched in appreciative words for Mr. Xi, surprised and annoyed analysts in Beijing. China had taken significant steps to tighten trade with the North, they said, and the United States had, as always, not given sanctions enough time to take effect.\u201cChina has done its best, and these sanctions are working,\u201d said Lu Chao, director of the Border Study Institute at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, a government research organization in Shenyang. \u201cGiven time, they will have a greater impact on the economy.\u201dCheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said that Mr. Xi\u2019s government had learned not to take Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter messages at face value.\u201cThe Chinese government assumes Trump\u2019s tweets do not necessarily represent the administration,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government cannot treat them very seriously. Trump changes all the time.\u201dHe added that the new round of meetings in Washington came at a \u201cvery critical period\u201d and that the government would try to sustain the positive momentum of the first few months of the Trump presidency.Mr. Xi\u2019s visit in April to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s club in Palm Beach, Fla., underlined the importance China places on relations with the United States, and officials hoped the initial cordiality between the two leaders would establish the sort of nonconfrontational partnership that Beijing prefers.\u201cWe understand the Americans are angry over the student\u2019s death,\u201d said Jin Qiangyi, director of the Center for North and South Korea Studies at Yanbian University in Yanbian, near China\u2019s border with North Korea. But imposing new sanctions targeting Chinese companies would only lead to more problems, he said.\u201cThe United States may want to smoke North Korea out with sanctions so it would drop its nuclear programs, but we doubt this will work,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a country that has managed to go through decades of sanctions.\u201dJane Perlez and Yufan Huang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fewer and Smaller: A New Normal for London\u2019s Summer Auctions", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Reflecting major shifts in the global economy, the art market is evolving at a rapid pace. Take Christie\u2019s: For the first time since 1998, the auction house will not hold summer sales of contemporary works in London.With that in mind, Christie\u2019s, a 250-year-old auction house that is owned by Artemis, a company controlled by the French luxury retail magnate and art collector Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, has reduced its London contemporary sales weeks to two from three, matching the frequency in New York. Christie\u2019s continues to hold summer offerings of Impressionist and modern art, but its main evening sale on Tuesday will be held the night before the contemporary auction of its rival Sotheby\u2019s. That rescheduling left Sotheby\u2019s selling \u201cImps and Mods\u201d on its own last week in London.\u201cThe digital space is the Christie\u2019s South Ken of the 21st century,\u201d said Mr. Cerutti, adding that he envisaged the auction house as a global operation with fewer auction rooms and more online sales. But with more than 75 percent of clients concentrating on 20th-century and contemporary artworks, he emphasized the growing importance of specially promoted, curated auctions in more traditional collecting fields, such as the decorative arts. \u201cWe need to reinvigorate these categories and find new collectors,\u201d he said.The Sotheby\u2019s evening sale on Wednesday did manage to attract some exceptional works, helped by eight-figure guarantees.A third party \u201cirrevocable bid\u201d ensured that Wassily Kandinsky\u2019s 1913 painting \u201cBild mit Weissen Linien\u201d (\u201cPainting With White Lines\u201d) would sell for at least 27 million pounds, or about $34 million. From a European collection and never before offered at auction, the work was one of a series of revolutionary Kandinsky paintings from 1913 that pushed Western art to the edge of pure abstraction. It inspired the most sustained bidding war of the evening, with two telephone bidders nudging a buyer in the room, represented by the London-based art adviser Hugo Nathan, to \u00a333 million with fees. The price was an auction high for the artist.\u201cFemme et Oiseaux,\u201d one of the 23 intricate \u201cConstellation\u201d paintings on paper that Joan Mir\u00f3 made from January 1940 to September 1941 in response to the horrors of World War II, had been guaranteed to sell for at least \u00a323 million.In 2001, a Sotheby\u2019s auction of the Stanley J. Seeger collection included \u201cNocturne\u201d from the series, which sold for $5.6 million.The Sotheby\u2019s leap in valuation to at least $30 million for \u201cFemme et Oiseaux\u201d was deemed too ambitious, and it sold unopposed to the guarantor for \u00a324.6 million with fees.\u201cThey\u2019re incredibly rare and desirable, the zenith of what he did,\u201d Stephane Cosman Connery, an art adviser based in New York, said of Mir\u00f3\u2019s Constellation paintings. \u201cBut Sotheby\u2019s was only able to get it with an insurance policy that was onerous to everyone else,\u201d Mr. Connery added, alluding to the intimidating scale of the guarantee.On the night, sellers with the nerve to offer high-value works \u201cnaked\u201d \u2014 without guarantees \u2014 were rewarded with competitive bidding.Kandinsky\u2019s sumptuously Expressionistic painting \u201cMurnau \u2014 Landschaft mit Gr\u00fcnen Haus\u201d (\u201cMurnau \u2014 Landscape With Green House\u201d), dating from 1909, was also new to the market. It attracted two determined telephone bidders who pushed the price to \u00a321 million against a low estimate of \u00a315 million.As Mr. Cerutti of Christie\u2019s intimated, the major auction houses are increasingly looking at alternative ways to bolster demand for works that are not obvious trophies.This time, the Sotheby\u2019s sale curators Allan Schwartzman and Thomas Bompard came up with the idea of Actual Size, a 35-lot auction devoted to smaller-scale works.But with a low estimate of \u00a34 million, the 8-inch-wide drawing did not attract any bids, prompting murmurs in the room.\u201cFive million dollars was too expensive,\u201d Hugh Gibson, a dealer based in London, said. \u201cYou can dress these sales up any way that you like, but the normal rules of the market still apply. The estimates were high for certain things.\u201dBut wider exposure can bolster the prices of old masters: A jewel-like flower still life on copper by the Flemish painter Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder (1573-1621) sold, for an upper estimate of \u00a33 million to a telephone bid taken by Patti Wong, chairwoman of Sotheby\u2019s Asia.And the 1970 Picasso pastel \u201cBuste de Femme Couch\u00e9e\u201d attracted at least four bidders before climbing to \u00a32.4 million, against a high estimate of \u00a3900,000.Over all, the Actual Size auction raised a low-estimate \u00a320.9 million from the 35 lots. Just over a third of the lots were unsuccessful \u2014 a relatively high failure rate for a heavily marketed, \u201ccurated\u201d sale.Bidding was also selective at the Sotheby\u2019s Imps and Mods sale. The auction raised \u00a3127.9 million, also toward the low end of the estimate, from 23 works, 26 percent of which were left unsold.\u201cThe sales are concentrated on a few blockbuster lots,\u201d said James Roundell, director of Impressionist and modern art at the London dealer Dickinson. \u201cIt\u2019s feast or famine these days,\u201d he added.Fewer live sales and newly devised \u201ccurated auctions\u201d \u2014 that succeed only if the estimates are not too high \u2014 supported by online sales to keep demand bubbling at a lower level seem to be the trend.These might feel like strange times for London\u2019s storied auction houses, but they could be the new normal for the city\u2019s summer sales.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charter School Founded by DeVos Family Reflects National Tensions", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. \u2014 Julia Stevenson scurried through the hallway as her school day came to a close, hoping to take advantage of as much daylight as possible to complete one of the last assignments of her high school career.\u201cI\u2019m flying home today,\u201d Ms. Stevenson, 18, said with a broad smile, explaining that she was hoping for clear skies and a beautiful view of Lake Michigan on the 300-mile round trip from Gerald R. Ford International Airport to her hometown, Traverse City, Mich.With her pilot\u2019s license in sight, Ms. Stevenson was about to graduate from the West Michigan Aviation Academy, a public charter school here founded by Dick DeVos, the billionaire husband of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.Ms. DeVos has called it an inspiration for her dogged support for school choice, a shining example of what is possible when schools are able to meet students\u2019 unique interests and needs. On Tuesday, she told thousands of charter school advocates that her husband\u2019s school prepared students \u201cto contribute in significant ways to our 21st-century economy.\u201dBut with its deep-pocketed founder, corporate sponsors and remarkable capacity to raise money, the Aviation Academy may be more an example of what education can achieve with seemingly limitless funds than a model for other schools.Like the neighborhood public schools of Grand Rapids, the academy, on the grounds of Gerald Ford Airport, receives $7,500 per student in state funding. This helps pay for its rigorous science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, curriculum and its faculty, including the four flight instructors on staff.But it does not pay for the school\u2019s two airplanes; many of its science, engineering and mathematics facilities; or its distinction as the only school in the country that offers flight instruction as part of the curriculum. Students can graduate and fly a plane before they can rent a car or legally have a beer.How? The DeVoses alone have given more than $4 million to the school. Mr. DeVos donated an airplane from his private collection. Delta Air Lines donated another.\u201cThe concept is good. I just wish a public school would\u2019ve thought of starting that rather than have it be a charter,\u201d said Mary Bouwense, president of the Grand Rapids teachers union. \u201cBut I guess we wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it. You have to have a boatload of money to start a school at the airport.\u201dThe school, publicly funded and privately operated, is representative of the tensions in the school choice movement that have grown under the Trump administration.Ms. DeVos and Mr. Trump are proposing to increase funding for public charters, which serve more than three million students nationwide, by $168 million, or 50 percent, while cutting total education funding by $9 billion, much of which would come from programs primarily for traditional public schools.While charter schools have long had bipartisan support \u2014 they have been championed by every president since Bill Clinton \u2014 the movement finds itself at a crossroads. Charter school advocates have long said they support traditional public education as well, but the Trump budget has presented them with something of a choice: us or them.\u201cThe president has given a big hug to charter schools at the same time he\u2019s slapped down other education priorities,\u201d Nina Rees, president and chief executive of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, told a gathering of more than 4,000 charter leaders and advocates this week. \u201cAll of us need to understand that accepting the president\u2019s support for charter schools doesn\u2019t tie us to his whole agenda.\u201dThe Aviation Academy has been at the center of similar debates in Michigan. The DeVoses backed the state\u2019s first charter legislation, passed in 1993, and their support for expanding charter schools has been seen as a direct threat to public schools, particularly vulnerable ones in cities like Detroit.On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos praised charter schools for proving that \u201cquality and choice can coexist,\u201d but said they \u201care not the one cure-all to the ills that beset education.\u201dMs. DeVos encouraged her husband to start the school after he lost a run for Michigan\u2019s governorship in 2006. It would combine two of his passions: education and flying.Since then, the academy has attracted a diverse pool of 600 students via lottery. One of the recipients of its C.E.O. award this year was a refugee who enrolled in ninth grade speaking only Swahili. It outperformed traditional schools on state tests this year and has a four-year graduation rate of 85 percent.Students shoulder some costs, like extra blue polo shirts for their uniforms, insurance for Chromebooks and a fee for flight instruction. But the school primarily supports its aviation program with fund-raisers, including an annual banquet, which have drawn guests of honor such as former President George W. Bush.The DeVos name \u201cdoesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d said the school\u2019s chief executive, Patrick J. Cwayna, a former Grand Rapids public school principal whom Mr. DeVos selected to run the academy.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we use their positive influence to bring advantages to our kids?\u201d Mr. Cwayna asked.Ms. Stevenson hopes that does not change. She has wanted to be a pilot since age 6 and never imagined that she would be able to take her family flying to celebrate her graduation. To attend the Aviation Academy, she has lived with family friends since she was a sophomore, one of a number of students who come from miles away.While Ms. DeVos has no direct role in running the school, Ms. Stevenson said it had become a target of critics since she became secretary of education.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of politics to it, but for me, personally, it\u2019s been an awesome opportunity that I\u2019ve been able to take advantage of,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said. \u201cI don\u2019t see why that\u2019s a negative thing. We\u2019re just a bunch of kids pursuing our dreams.\u201dThe school started with 80 students in a renovated conference room at the airport, and has since tripled its population and nearly doubled its size. Its student body is 34 percent non-Caucasian and 10 percent special education, and this year, it drew 282 applications for 155 spots, including two applicants in their 30s.Mr. Cwayna said Mr. DeVos did not push his political or policy views on the school\u2019s leadership. He has made only two requests based on personal preference: that it not call the parent group \u201cthe PTA\u201d and that the men wear gray pants, a light blue shirt, dark blue blazers and one of three ties.Mr. DeVos is currently guiding the school through another expansion. At a recent board meeting that he led, members mulled over plans to add new facilities, including an airplane hangar, commons and classrooms.Mr. DeVos smiled often but said little. Then he was presented with the growing number of students on the waiting list.\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cWaiting lists always bring mixed feelings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fisticuffs Over the Route to a Clean-Energy Future", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCould the entire American economy run on renewable energy alone?And yet the proposition is hardly as solid as Professor Jacobson asserts.\u201cI had largely ignored the papers arguing that doing all with renewables was possible at negative costs because they struck me as obviously incorrect,\u201d said David Victor of the University of California, San Diego, a co-author of the new critique of Professor Jacobson\u2019s work. \u201cBut when policy makers started using this paper for scientific support, I thought, \u2018this paper is dangerous.\u2019\u201dThe conclusion of the critique is damning: Professor Jacobson relied on \u201cinvalid modeling tools,\u201d committed \u201cmodeling errors\u201d and made \u201cimplausible and inadequately supported assumptions,\u201d the scholars wrote. \u201cOur paper is pretty devastating,\u201d said Varun Sivaram from the Council on Foreign Relations, a co-author of the new critique.But with the stakes so high, the gloves are clearly off.In a conversation over the weekend, he accused his critics of being shills for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries, without the standing to review his work. \u201cTheir paper is really a dangerous paper,\u201d he told me.But on close examination, Professor Jacobson\u2019s premise does seem a leap of faith.The weakness of energy systems powered by the sun and the wind is their intermittency. Where will the energy come from when the sun isn\u2019t shining and the wind isn\u2019t blowing? Professor Jacobson addresses this in two ways, vastly increasing the nation\u2019s peak hydroelectricity capacity and deploying energy storage at a vast scale.\u201cTo repower the world, we need to expand a lot of things to a large scale,\u201d Professor Jacobson told me. \u201cBut there is no reason we can\u2019t scale up.\u201dActually, there are reasons. The main energy storage technologies he proposes \u2014 hydrogen and heat stored in rocks buried underground \u2014 have never been put in place at anywhere near the scale required to power a nation, or even a large city.His system requires storing seven weeks\u2019 worth of energy consumption. Today, the 10 biggest storage systems in the United States combined store some 43 minutes. Hydrogen production would have to be scaled up by a factor of 100,000 or more to meet the requirements in Professor Jacobson\u2019s analysis, according to his critics.Professor Jacobson notes that Denmark has deployed a heating system similar to the one he proposes. But Denmark adapted an existing underground pipe infrastructure to transport the heat, whereas a system would have to be built from scratch in American cities.A common thread to the Jacobson approach is how little regard it shows for the political, social and technical plausibility of what would undoubtedly be wrenching transformations across the economy.He argues for the viability of hydrogen-fueled aviation by noting the existence of a hydrogen-powered four-seat jet. Jumping from that to assert that hydrogen can economically fuel the nation\u2019s fleet within a few decades seems akin to arguing that because the United States sent a few astronauts to the moon we will all be able to move there soon.He proposes building and deploying energy systems at a scale that has never been achieved and at a speed that nobody has ever tried. He assumes an implausibly low cost of capital. He asserts that most American industry will easily adjust its schedule to the availability of energy \u2014 unplugging when the wind and sun are down regardless of the needs of workers, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders.And even after all this, the system fails unless it can obtain vast amounts of additional power from hydroelectricity as a backup at moments when other sources are weak: no less than 1,300 gigawatts. That is about 25 percent more power than is produced by all sources combined in the United States today, the equivalent of 600 Hoover Dams.Building dams is hardly uncontroversial. So Professor Jacobson proposes adding this capacity with \u201czero increase in dam size, no annual increase in the use of water, no new land,\u201d simply by adding a lot more turbines to existing dams. It is not obvious that so many of them can be added, however, or at what cost. Especially considering they would be unproductive 90 percent of the time and for use only as a backstop. What\u2019s more, adding turbines does not increase the available energy at any given time unless there is more water pushing through them.Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science, one of the lead authors of the critique, put it this way: The discharge rate needed from the nation\u2019s dams to achieve the 1,300 gigawatts would be equivalent to about 100 times the flow of the Mississippi River. Even if this kind of push were available, it is not hard to imagine that people living downstream might object to the release of such vast amounts of water.\u201cThe whole system falls apart because this is the very last thing that is used,\u201d Professor Clack noted. \u201cIf you remove any of this, the model fails.\u201dIt is critically important to bring this debate into the open. For too long, climate advocacy and policy has been inflected by a hope that the energy transformation before us can be achieved cheaply and virtuously \u2014 in harmony with nature. But the transformation is likely to be costly. And though sun, wind and water are likely to account for a much larger share of the nation\u2019s energy supply, less palatable technologies are also likely to play a part.Policy makers rushing to unplug existing nuclear reactors and embrace renewables note: Shuttering viable technological paths could send us down a cul-de-sac. And we might not be possible to correct course fast enough.An earlier version of this column included an outdated affiliation for one scientist, Christopher Clack. He is now chief executive of the grid modeling firm Vibrant Clean Energy; he is no longer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Colorado, Boulder.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Arundhati Roy\u2019s Return to the Form That Made Her Famous", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionThis was the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh, writing in 1995, a decade after a government-sponsored massacre left 3,000 Sikhs dead in Delhi. The questions he asked have only grown in relevance. How to write about such an event without descending into despair? And how to give hope without being treacly?I thought of these questions while reading Arundhati Roy\u2019s \u201cThe Ministry of Utmost Happiness\u201d \u2014 her first novel in 20 years. Set in India in the present decade (with back stories extending into the 1950s), it is a novel about social and political outcasts who come together in response to state-sponsored violence.Roy\u2019s first and only other novel, \u201cThe God of Small Things,\u201d was a commercial and critical sensation. The gorgeous story of a doomed South Indian family, it sold six million copies and won the Booker Prize. It became a sort of legend \u2014 both for its quality and for its backwater publishing story: Roy, unlike so many other successful Indian writers in English, didn\u2019t live abroad or attend an elite college. She had trained as an architect and had an obscure career as an indie actress and screenwriter. Her success, which involved foreign agents and a startling advance, was linked to India\u2019s kick-starting, liberalizing economy as well. It seemed everything had come together for Roy\u2019s book.Roy reacted with instinctive defiance. She stopped writing fiction and began protesting against the Indian state, which, she felt, was steamrollering the rights of the poor and collaborating with capitalist overlords. Several books of essays followed. Their titles \u2014 \u201cThe Algebra of Infinite Justice,\u201d \u201cThe End of Imagination,\u201d \u201cCapitalism: A Ghost Story\u201d \u2014 convey the largeness of her concerns. She traveled with Maoist guerrillas in an Indian forest, marched with anti-big-dam protesters, met with Edward Snowden in a Moscow hotel room, and was threatened and even briefly imprisoned by the Indian government \u2014 and she continued to write. But the writing was not of the same standard as her fiction. Though occasionally witty in its put-downs, it was black-and-white and self-righteous \u2014 acceptable within the tradition of political writing, but not artful.So it is a relief to encounter the new book and find Roy the artist fully and brilliantly intact: prospering with stories and writing in gorgeous, supple prose. The organs of a slaughtered buffalo in one scene \u201cslip away like odd-shaped boats on a river of blood\u201d; the \u201coutrageous\u201d femininity of transgender women or hijras in a neighborhood make the \u201creal, biological women\u201d look \u201ccloudy and dispersed\u201d; a boat is seen \u201ccleaving through a dark, liquid lawn\u201d of a weed-choked lake. Again and again beautiful images refresh our sense of the world.The story concerns several people who converge over an abandoned baby at an anti-corruption protest in Delhi in 2011. There is a hijra named Anjum who has survived the anti-Muslim Gujarat riots of 2002. There is her sidekick, a former mortuary worker who calls himself Saddam Hussain because he is obsessed with the \u201ccourage and dignity\u201d of Saddam \u201cin the face of death.\u201d And there is an enigmatic middle-class woman called S. Tilottama who ferries the abandoned baby to her home.Tilottama, who shares biographical details with Roy, is perhaps the central node of the book; she connects everyone. In college for architecture in the 1980s she was close to three men \u2014 all of whom end up being involved with the Kashmir conflict in some way: one as an intelligence officer, the other as a journalist, and Musa, the Kashmiri of the group, as a freedom-fighter, or militant. The three men intersect again on an autumn night in Kashmir in the 1990s, when Tilottama, nicknamed Tilo, is arrested on a houseboat for apparently colluding with a militant. What follows is a saga that enfolds the whole conflict.These sections of the book filled me with awe \u2014 not just as a reader, but as a novelist \u2014 for the sheer fidelity and beauty of detail. A worried father watches his son save himself as he falls down the stairs in their house. \u201cHow did you learn to fall like that?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho taught you to fall like this?\u201d (He fears, like so many Kashmiri parents, that his son has joined a militant group.) A young militant describes buying ammunition from the army, because, in Kashmir, \u201ceverybody on all sides is making money on the bodies of young Kashmiris.\u201d A turncoat Kashmiri torturer who works for the Indian government unconsciously introduces a journalist as being \u201cfrom India.\u201d This is terrific novelistic noticing, and it has none of the programmatic feeling of Roy\u2019s nonfiction.The other part of the book, which concerns Anjum, gives Roy more trouble, but only in its political aspects. We see how Anjum, born intersex as Aftab in the conservative Muslim quarters of Old Delhi, wishes \u201cto put out a hand with painted nails and a wrist full of bangles and delicately lift the gill of a fish to see how fresh it was before bargaining down the price.\u201d She eventually joins a hijra home. Then, in 2002, on a visit to Gujarat, she is attacked by right-wing Hindu mobs. While swiftly narrated, this section is flatter in execution: We know where Roy stands, where her sympathies lie, and though she finely conjures the world of Old Delhi Muslims and hijras, what emerges is a sort of political fairy tale, with the good guys and bad guys clearly delineated. Even here Roy can\u2019t help writing with astonishing vividness, immersing us deep into a subculture. She has also crammed this section with superb mini-biographies, as if she\u2019s conducting a novelistic census of the entire neighborhood. Nevertheless this section seemed for me to belong to a different book.And here one comes to the problem with the form Roy has chosen. For the Kashmir stories, Roy relies on a looped, nesting structure familiar from \u201cSmall Things\u201d; though occasionally ponderous, it heightens our suspense. The Anjum sections are linear and propulsive and often playful. But Anjum and Tilo and the other outcasts are brought together not through intellectual affinity but the device of the abandoned baby at the protest.Roy, who has witnessed a great deal of turmoil, is uniquely placed to emphasize the solidarities between movements. She wants to show us a genuine counterculture of protest. Nevertheless, I longed for fewer connections, fewer babies and more in-depth depictions of the psychologies of the movements. I wanted Roy to focus not on the big symbols, but once again on the small things.Karan Mahajan\u2019s second novel, \u201cThe Association of Small Bombs,\u201d was a finalist for the 2016 National Book Award.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Amazon Be the Next Apple?", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBlood is running in the retail aisle. Sears, the most iconic name in American retailing, told its investors in March that \u201csubstantial doubt exists related to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d The appliance retailer HH Gregg went defunct at the end of May, and once-celebrated companies like Bebe and Limited are desperately trying to survive as online-only storefronts. The carnage has spread beyond empty shopping malls and big-box stores to the grocery trade. Last week, a poor earnings report cost Kroger, the nation\u2019s second-largest food retailer, 19 percent of its stock market value in a matter of hours \u2014 and that was before Amazon announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market.So why might Amazon, the giant of online shopping, want to spend $13.4 billion on 461 brick-and-mortar stores of the sort other retailers are shedding left and right, along with a coffee roaster, 11 food distribution centers and manufacturing plants that do things like bake bread and gut fish? One obvious possibility is that Amazon could try to cut delivery times and costs by letting shoppers order online and then pick up their goods at the nearest Whole Foods. Another is that Amazon, for some reason, wants to grab a share of the low-profit grocery business, where online sales have not taken off, and see whether its technological wizardry can revolutionize food shopping.But there may be a less obvious explanation of Amazon\u2019s interest in Whole Foods: Perhaps it wants to be a bit more like Apple.There\u2019s no question that Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has built a hugely successful business. But a large part that business comes from selling the products of others. Only a tiny fraction of its retail sales \u2014 its Kindle e-reader, its Echo home control center, the audio books published by its Audible subsidiary, its Amazon Original videos \u2014 are exclusive to Amazon. The company makes money on the rest only if the prices on its website, with delivery costs added in, are below those elsewhere.What that means is that Amazon\u2019s margins are skinny. Last year its business that provides cloud-based web services for businesses and governments, with $12 billion of revenue, brought in three times the pre-tax profit Amazon reaped from $125 billion in retail sales.How to solve this problem? An envious glance at one of their company\u2019s best-known competitors might offer Amazon executives an answer.Apple doesn\u2019t need flashy stores in expensive locations to distribute phones and computers; those can be ordered on the internet. The Apple Stores, meticulously planned from their online appointment books to the transaction processing system that emails a receipt before you\u2019ve walked out the door, sell an experience, not electronics. Their purpose is to persuade customers that Apple has extraordinarily exciting products for which premium prices are entirely justified.Whole Foods started out with a similar idea, but its approach hasn\u2019t been working well. Its customer count dropped 2.6 percent last year as shoppers rebelled against high prices for food that didn\u2019t seem worth the premium. In a phone call with investors on May 10, John Mackey, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Whole Foods was striving for \u201clower costs, lower prices and higher sales.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like the mantra of a high-end retailer.Aside from its troubled grocery business, though, Whole Foods brings Amazon two important assets: affluent customers and locations in high-income neighborhoods. Amazon might use these assets to broaden its business in a way it cannot do online.Online retailing allows retailers access to millions of customers, but that\u2019s not always a benefit. One of the challenges of e-commerce is that it\u2019s difficult to segment the market. Every customer has access to the same web pages. Online merchants may take advantage of information about individuals\u2019 browsing history and past purchases to offer different prices to some than to others, but there\u2019s no way to make online shopping a special experience with Apple-style margins. For that, it\u2019s still critical to bring customers in the door.That\u2019s where Whole Foods comes in. Whole Foods\u2019s stores are sizeable, averaging nearly 40,000 square feet. Imagine Amazon carving out a fifth of that space, with separate entrances, and creating boutiques with well-trained staff and dynamic merchandising. Under the Amazon name or some newly created brand, those boutiques could sell exclusive products and services to shoppers on their way to grab a kale-and-red-currant salad for lunch or a pound of locally raised grass-fed beef for dinner, without detracting from Amazon\u2019s online business.They could sell excitement at profit margins Amazon will never achieve from selling books and backpacks on the internet \u2014 profit margins that look a lot more like Apple\u2019s.Marc Levinson, a historian and economist, is author of \u201cThe Great A&P and the Struggle for Small Business in America\u201d and \u201cAn Extraordinary Time: The End of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the Ordinary Economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then she smiled broadly.\u201cIt feels so good,\u201d Ms. Jones, 73, said. \u201cMainly because I can say it out loud without being afraid.\u201dLike 150,000 indigenous children across Canada, Ms. Jones was sent far from home to a residential school to be forcibly assimilated into Western culture. There, any trappings of her native culture were strictly forbidden. When a teacher caught Ms. Jones learning another indigenous language from two schoolmates, Ms. Jones said, the teacher yanked out three fingernails.It worked: Ms. Jones spoke nothing but English, until recently, when she began learning her lines in the country\u2019s first Haida-language feature film, \u201cEdge of the Knife.\u201dWith an entirely Haida cast, and a script written in a largely forgotten language, the film reflects a resurgence of indigenous art and culture taking place across Canada. It is spurred in part by efforts at reconciliation for the horrors suffered at those government-funded residential schools, the last of which closed only in 1996.Restoring the country\u2019s 60 or so indigenous languages, many on the verge of extinction, is at the center of that reconciliation.The loss of one language, said Wade Davis, a University of British Columbia anthropology professor, is akin to clear-cutting an \u201cold-growth forest of the mind.\u201d The world\u2019s complex web of myths, beliefs and ideas \u2014 which Mr. Davis calls the \u201cethnosphere\u201d \u2014 is torn, just as the loss of a species weakens the biosphere, he said.A Haida glossary dedicates three pages to words and expressions for rain.\u201cEnglish cannot begin to describe the landscape of Haida Gwaii,\u201d the Haida homeland, Mr. Davis said. \u201cThere are 10,000 shades of nuance and interpretation. That really is what language is.\u201dFewer than 20 fluent speakers of Haida are left in the world, according to local counts. For the Haida themselves, the destruction of their language is profoundly tied to a loss of identity.\u201cThe secrets of who we are are wrapped up in our language,\u201d said Gwaai Edenshaw, a co-director of the film, who like most of the cast and crew grew up learning some Haida in school but spoke English at home.\u201cIt\u2019s how we think,\u201d he continued. \u201cHow we label our world around us. It\u2019s also a resistance to what was imposed on us.\u201dMr. Edenshaw was a co-writer of the script for the 1.8 million Canadian dollar ($1.3 million) film, which is set in Haida Gwaii \u2014 an archipelago of forested islands off the west coast of Canada \u2014 during the 1800s. It tells an iconic Haida story of the \u201cwildman,\u201d a man who is lost and becomes feral living in the forest. In this version, the wildman loses his mind after the death of a child, and is forcibly returned to the fold of his community in a healing ceremony.The script was translated into two remaining, distinct dialects of the language: Xaad Kil and Xaayda Kil. None of the stars are conversant in either dialect. The crew held a two-week language boot camp in April so cast members, who also have little or no acting experience, could learn to pronounce their lines before filming started in May.\u201cI\u2019m not used to using my mouth like that,\u201d said William Russ, 37, who sat on the floor of a long house.At his feet was a black speaker, which replayed the recording of a Haida elder saying a line that in English seemed to capture his predicament: \u201cYou are so careless, Aditsii. Everything is crumbling around you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like we learned from the ravens and birds \u2014 all those clicking sounds,\u201d Mr. Russ said.But that political and cultural resurgence has not spread to the Haida language, despite many grass-roots efforts.\u201cThe language was dying before me,\u201d said Diane Brown, 69, the archipelago\u2019s best-known language advocate, who started to teach Haida in schools in the 1970s. \u201c The elders would say: \u2018What will we call ourselves, if we don\u2019t speak Haida? Who is going to talk to the ancestors?\u2019\u201dIn 1998, Ms. Brown helped found the Skidegate Haida Immersion Program to teach the southern dialect, but the program\u2019s focus quickly shifted to preservation, drawing elderly speakers to record commonly used phrases and lessons onto thousands of audiotapes.Each death meant one fewer person to practice with. But tentative learners have also faced local resistance, said Jaskwaan Bedard, who has worked for 14 years to be \u201capproaching fluency.\u201d She is finishing her degree to teach Haida-as-a-second-language classes in local high schools.\u201cHow the language was lost was very traumatic,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the barriers \u2014 working through the trauma.\u201dUnrelated to any other language, its grammar is complex and its structure polysynthetic; a verb conveys not just action but a wealth of other information. Then there is basic pronunciation. Haida has some 35 consonants and two tones. There are 20 sounds that do not exist in English.\u201cIf you don\u2019t speak it, you lose the hollow in the side of your cheek,\u201d Ms. Jones said, inserting the lid of a pen into her mouth so she could produce the Haida \u201chl.\u201dBut the casts of \u201cAtanarjuat\u201d and of Mr. Kunuk\u2019s subsequent films were fluent in Inuktitut, one of three indigenous languages still widely spoken in Canada.\u201cWe financed enough to produce the film,\u201d said Jonathan Frantz, the producer and director of photography, who works for Mr. Kunuk\u2019s production company, Kingulliit Productions. \u201cThere\u2019s no extra money for language-learning. That is a $100,000 multiyear project on its own.\u201dIf delivering the lines proves too difficult for some cast members, he will resort to adding them in later, he said. But ultimately, the movie is \u201cabout sustaining the language and culture through authentic representation.\u201dIn Haida Gwaii, the film is a desperately needed boost to the economy on the reserves, where unemployment is estimated at 70 percent.Local builders constructed a long house on the site of an old traditional village where the film is being shot. Local weavers made the costumes. A Haida artist tattooed clan crests on the chests and arms of willing actors in the traditional stick-and-poke fashion.A local musician, Vern Williams, was hired to create songs for the film. During the evenings of the language camp, he pulled out his guujaaw \u2014 drum \u2014 and filled the long house with his low, mournful voice.Mr. Williams, 58, spent seven terrible years in a residential school.\u201cI don\u2019t call this reconciliation,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething was taken. We are taking it back.\u201dThe commission called on the government to invest heavily in the revitalization of indigenous languages, noting it spends just 9.1 million Canadian dollars on programs supporting dozens of them each year, compared with 348.2 million Canadian dollars on the country\u2019s two official languages, French and English.In December, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government increased annual funding for indigenous languages to 23 million Canadian dollars and promised to introduce an Indigenous Languages Act to protect them. To date, that has not happened.\u201cThis is fundamental to our survival as indigenous people,\u201d said Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, which represents 634 reserves in Canada. He was optimistic that the law would be introduced in summer next year, and come with \u201cas much resources to promote the languages as they did to kill them.\u201dAfter a long day of stumbling over pronunciation, Mr. Russ, one of the actors, sat by the wood stove with his script open on his lap, enjoying Mr. Williams\u2019s music for a moment. He had circled every line he found difficult, which were all 37.His relaxation did not last long. \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel overwhelmed,\u201d he said, heading outside to practice.Two weeks was not enough to learn pronunciation, let alone memorize his lines. Then, he had to learn how to act.Advertisement"}

Zakiyyah Alexander\u2019s piece \u2014 part of the final installment of Ensemble Studio Theater\u2019s annual one-act play series \u2014 also tackles assimilation, racism and sexism.This would be a lot even for two acts, and at just under 30 minutes the play feels like the pr\u00e9cis for a full-length work rather than a self-contained effort. Certainly it would be great to see more of the intriguing Aliah (Lily Balsen), whose evolution from the title character to \u2014 well, what, remains tantalizingly open \u2014 is rushed in this context.Then one day she has a terrifying encounter on the subway, a brief moment that evokes the racist harassment that\u2019s been flourishing during the past few months. Maybe one day Ms. Alexander will tell us what happened to Aliah.None of the four other plays in the series match \u201cThe Good Muslim\u201d in ambition, though Donald Marcus\u2019s compact two-hander \u201cIntensive Care\u201d succeeds by making the most out of economy.Edith Freni\u2019s \u201cFemale Beginner\u201d and Elyzabeth Gregory Wilder\u2019s \u201cSanta Doesn\u2019t Come to the Holiday Inn,\u201d on the other hand, plop hastily sketched characters in the middle of drama \u2014 contrived in the first case, wan in the second.

{"Headline": "Helmut Kohl, Chancellor Who Reunited Germany, Dies at 87", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHelmut Kohl, a towering postwar figure who reunified Germany after 45 years of Cold War antagonism, propelled a deeply held vision of Europe\u2019s integration and earned plaudits from Moscow and Washington for his deft handling of the fall of the Berlin Wall, died on Friday at his home in Ludwigshafen, Germany, the Rhine port city where he was born. He was 87.\u201cWe mourn,\u201d his party, the Christian Democratic Union, said on Twitter in announcing his death.With his diplomacy, resolve and readiness to commit huge sums to ending his country\u2019s division, Mr. Kohl was remembered by many as a giant of epochal times that remade Europe\u2019s political architecture, dismantled the minefields and watchtowers of the Iron Curtain and replaced the eyeball-to-eyeball armed confrontation between East and West with an enduring, if often challenged, coexistence between former sworn foes.A physically imposing man \u2014 he stood 6 feet 4 inches and weighed well over 300 pounds in his leadership years \u2014 Mr. Kohl pursued his and his country\u2019s political interests as Germany\u2019s chancellor with persistent, even stubborn, determination. He could be \u201can elephant in a china shop,\u201d as he described himself, and he overcame European opposition to unification the same way he handled political opposition at home: by the force of a jovial yet dominating personality.Germany in particular faced the challenge of engaging with a formerly dictatorial, Soviet-backed East and welding it to a prosperous West that drew its support from Western allies. Between the two lay a gulf of mistrust.Unlike many Germans, Mr. Kohl never shied from expressing pride in what he often called \u201cthis, our Fatherland,\u201d even when the phrase unsettled many who had suffered at his country\u2019s hands in World War II. In dealing with the legacy of Germany\u2019s Nazi past, Mr. Kohl, who was a 15-year-old member of the Hitler Youth when the war ended, invoked what he called \u201cthe absolution of late birth\u201d so often as to offend some listeners.A politician most of his adult life, Mr. Kohl was chancellor for 16 years starting in 1982, longer than any German leader since Bismarck. He ruled the Christian Democratic Union as if it were his fief.His political career ended with defeat, however, in elections in 1998, and his legacy was later clouded by disgrace over a party fund-raising scandal.Even so, that was not the image that emerged in the many tributes offered on Friday.\u201cWe feel that a life has ended and he who lived it will go down in history,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel said, her voice shaking. \u201cIn this moment, I am thinking with great respect and great gratitude on that life and work.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt will take some time before we realize what we have truly lost.\u201dIn his later years Mr. Kohl was seen as a diminished figure, infirm and in a wheelchair after a fall resulted in a head injury in 2008 that made speech difficult for him. Far from focusing on his achievements as one of Europe\u2019s dominant statesmen, critics raked over his private life. His first wife, Hannelore Kohl, committed suicide in 2001, ostensibly because of a rare allergy to light, which had forced her into a nocturnal existence.In 2008, shortly after his fall, Mr. Kohl announced his intention to marry a companion, Maike Richter, 35 years his junior and a former economic adviser in the chancellery. She was later accused of limiting access to him and his archives.After the war, he spent his entire political life in the new Christian Democratic Union of Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhard. Like them, he made his overriding goal the rebuilding of Germany within a united Europe.Aware that Germany could be reunified only with the support of both the United States and the Soviet Union, Mr. Kohl formed close ties with the elder President George Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He also befriended President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of France, who helped him overcome the apprehensions of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain.In a memoir, Mr. Kohl quoted Mrs. Thatcher as saying just after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: \u201cTwice we defeated the Germans! Now they\u2019re back again.\u201dIn 1985, to mark the 40th anniversary of the Nazis\u2019 defeat, Mr. Kohl insisted that President Ronald Reagan visit a German military cemetery in Bitburg, even after it was discovered that members of the Waffen-SS, the Nazi paramilitary force that carried out the Holocaust, had been buried there alongside ordinary German soldiers.American officials sounded out Mr. Kohl about letting the president off the hook, to no avail, according to former Secretary of State George P. Shultz.\u201cPresident Reagan was deeply affected by the strength and vehemence of Kohl\u2019s views,\u201d Mr. Shultz wrote in his memoirs. \u201cKohl was adamant. He had a choice, Kohl said: President Reagan could go to Bitburg, or he could cancel and see the Kohl government fall.\u201dThe president went to the former Nazi concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen and then, without regrets, to Bitburg. But Mr. Shultz observed, \u201cKohl\u2019s unbending iron will did seem to demonstrate a massive insensitivity, on the one hand, to the troubles he was causing Ronald Reagan and, on the other, to the trauma this episode caused in the Jewish community around the world and, beyond the Jewish community, to all who remembered the Holocaust and its horrors.\u201dMr. Kohl was a German leader who could identify with the young men, some buried at Bitburg, who had been swept up by the Nazi war machine, and he was proud of his provincial roots in the nearby Palatinate region, close to the French border. After rising to the chancellor\u2019s office in 1982, he won four elections in a row \u2014 two as chancellor of West Germany and two after it absorbed the Communist German Democratic Republic. But he lost the fifth, in 1998, when the Social Democrats returned to power under Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.A year later, German prosecutors discovered a network of secret bank accounts and charged Mr. Kohl with using them to hide illegal contributions to his party. Expressing regret for \u201cmistakes,\u201d Mr. Kohl refused to disclose the names of any donors, even after a parliamentary inquiry was begun. In early 2001, Mr. Kohl paid a fine of more than $100,000 to end a criminal case against him and left Parliament the next year.Months earlier, though, potential successors had begun to circle, sensing that the scandal had stripped away Mr. Kohl\u2019s hallmark mantle of political invulnerability. In December 1999, Ms. Merkel, one of his Christian Democratic Union prot\u00e9g\u00e9s from the formerly Communist part of Germany, wrote in the daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that it was time for Mr. Kohl to withdraw from politics and \u201cmake way for the successors, the younger generation.\u201dMs. Merkel took over the Christian Democrats in 2000 and became chancellor in 2005, the first woman to hold the office.Well into his retirement, Mr. Kohl, who had once referred to Ms. Merkel as \u201cdas m\u00e4dchen\u201d \u2014 the girl \u2014 continued to snipe at her from the wings, questioning her handling of European politics. In 2016, he urged her to show restraint after Britain voted to leave the European Union. But by then, Ms. Merkel was eyeing a fourth run at the chancellery in 2017 \u2014 potentially equaling or even surpassing her one-time mentor\u2019s record in Germany\u2019s highest office.Helmut Joseph Michael Kohl was born in Ludwigshafen on April 3, 1930, the third and last child of C\u00e4cilie E. and Hans Kohl, a civil servant and tax expert who had been a soldier in World War I.When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Mr. Kohl\u2019s father answered the call to arms and did not return home until 1945. His elder brother, Walter, also volunteered and was killed in action in 1944. By then, Ludwigshafen was under almost daily attack from Allied bombers, and young Helmut, who, like most boys his age, had become a member of the Hitler Youth, was pressed into service to dig charred corpses from the ashes. Later, he fed ammunition to antiaircraft guns in the Bavarian Alps.In the spring of 1945, after surviving a heavy Allied bombing of Berchtesgaden and its environs in the Bavarian Alps, where Hitler had a retreat, Mr. Kohl decided the war was over for him. With a few friends, he set off on foot for his hometown, 250 miles away.\u201cStill in our Hitler Youth uniforms and without papers of any kind, we avoided the roads, on which truck after truck of American troops were rolling, and ran along the rail lines or over the crossties,\u201d Mr. Kohl wrote years later.After the Nazis capitulated in May, the group fell into the hands of Polish laborers, who gave them a beating. When he finally got home, in early June, he found Ludwigshafen three-quarters destroyed but the Kohl family home still standing.There, as a student preparing for university studies, he met a refugee from East Germany, Hannelore Renner, whom he married in 1960.Ms. Kohl projected a public image of traditional middle-class respectability, but after her suicide in 2001, Heribert Schwan, a journalist who had ghostwritten three volumes of Mr. Kohl\u2019s autobiography and claimed to have had close access to his wife, depicted her as a tragic figure who had worn the trappings of a political spouse \u201clike armor\u201d to shield her unhappiness in the role. She had been profoundly disturbed by his refusal to identify anonymous donors in the party financing scandal that ended his political career, Mr. Schwan said.With his second marriage, critics said Mr. Kohl appeared to be in thrall to his wife, Maike. She was credited both with tending to him assiduously in his infirmity and limiting access to him by his former associates, including Juliane Weber, his onetime office manager and confidante for three decades.Der Spiegel, an influential newsmagazine that acknowledged a troubled relationship with Mr. Kohl, said in 2012 that the \u201clink between political history and the physical frailty of this once-powerful man\u201d had \u201cturned his twilight years into a tragedy that is being closely watched in Germany.\u201dBesides his second wife, Mr. Kohl\u2019s survivors include his sons, Walter and Peter. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.Mr. Kohl went to college in Frankfurt and later in Heidelberg. He joined the Christian Democratic Union when he was only 17. His doctoral thesis in history, submitted a decade later, was on the rebirth of political parties in his home region after the war. The next year he was elected to the legislature of the postwar federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and in 1967 he became the state premier.But his ambition was to be his party\u2019s national leader. He realized that goal in 1973, a year before Willy Brandt, the Social Democratic chancellor who had begun a hotly contested policy of gradual reconciliation with Communist East Germany and the Soviet Union, resigned after it was discovered that a Communist spy had infiltrated his office. Mr. Kohl ran against Brandt\u2019s successor, Helmut Schmidt, in 1976, came surprisingly close to victory, and moved to Bonn to lead the opposition in the national Parliament.He became chancellor in 1982 when Mr. Schmidt\u2019s coalition partners, the Free Democrats, switched their support to Mr. Kohl\u2019s party. But despite having run campaigns with the slogan \u201cFreedom or Socialism,\u201d he left mostly unchanged the Brandt-Schmidt policy of gradual opening to the Communist East.In office, he occupied a villa behind his Bonn office on the Rhine during the week and liked to dine at unprepossessing Italian restaurants. He commuted home to Ludwigshafen by helicopter on weekends, when he could indulge in his favorite German dish, stuffed sow\u2019s belly, often inflicted on foreign visitors invited down for an evening at his home.After he won the 1987 elections, Mr. Kohl was host of the first visit to Bonn by an East German Communist leader, Erich Honecker, who was seeking billions of West German marks to prop up his ailing economy. His cordiality puzzled those who had long thought of Mr. Kohl as staunchly anti-Communist, and long after East Germany disappeared, he successfully resisted attempts to open secret files that Communist intelligence had maintained on his activities.Mr. Kohl and Mr. Gorbachev had their first meeting in Moscow in October 1988. But by then communism had begun to unravel all over Eastern Europe, and it became clear that Mr. Gorbachev was not ready to use Soviet military might to keep that from happening.By the summer of 1989, tens of thousands of people were fleeing East Germany through Hungary and Czechoslovakia to West Germany, and Mr. Kohl saw that reunification might be within reach.After Mr. Honecker was deposed and his successors opened the Berlin Wall on the night of Nov. 9, 1989, Mr. Kohl surprised his allies with a prompt 10-point plan for a German confederation.But the enthusiastic crowds he encountered in subsequent visits to East Germany convinced him that confederation was not enough. Confident of support in Washington, he made a 52-hour visit to Moscow and a retreat in the Caucasus Mountains in July 1990 and secured Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s acquiescence in the unification of the two German states in the Federal Republic, within NATO.\u201cWe did not take part in the war directly, we do not have it on our conscience,\u201d Mr. Kohl wrote of Mr. Gorbachev, \u201cbut we still remember the war in our mind\u2019s eye, we have seen its horrors, we have experience that others do not have. And we must bring all of it to bear to advance civilization.\u201dThat Oct. 3, Mr. Kohl celebrated reunification with a fireworks demonstration in Berlin. It was the apogee of his career.East Germany, thought to have had the strongest economy of any European Communist country, turned out to be bankrupt. Mr. Kohl gave eastern Germans the deutsche marks they had long craved, though at a 1:1 exchange rate, which left their inefficient state-run industries unable to compete on Western economic terms. Many collapsed.But in the first postwar all-German elections, in December 1990, he campaigned on the promise that unity would bring a flowering in the East, and won with 43.8 percent of the vote for his party.Within a year, though, more than a million people in the East were out of work. Leftist demonstrators in Halle, in the East, spattered Mr. Kohl with eggs, calling him a \u201cliar.\u201d Mr. Kohl went after them with clenched fists before being restrained. In the West, taxpayers felt taken advantage of when government spending to rebuild eastern Germany\u2019s shattered infrastructure sunk the deficit toward $400 billion. Inflation accelerated, and when the central bank pushed up interest rates, it was blamed for causing recession in much of Western Europe.The prospects for European unity also suffered. At the end of 1991, Mr. Kohl and his fellow leaders, meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, had agreed to an ambitious plan for European economic, monetary and political union. But almost immediately the project became bogged down in the economic difficulties and squabbling over Europe\u2019s failure to end the war in the Balkans. Some blamed the Kohl government for the start of the war, saying it had been hasty in recognizing Croatia, a German ally during World War II, when it broke away from Yugoslavia.\u201cI\u2019ve been wrong about some things since 1990, but who hasn\u2019t been?\u201d Mr. Kohl said in 1994, when polls were predicting yet again that his era was ending. He won elections that year, too, but the government\u2019s majority was razor-thin.Mr. Kohl began warning that the German welfare state, with its robust mark, 35-hour workweek and five-week vacations, was becoming uncompetitive in the global economy. Unemployment soared to nearly 4.7 million \u2014 12.2 percent of the work force \u2014 within two years.Unemployment like this had been unknown in Germany since the 1930s, when it contributed to the rise of the Nazis. Mr. Kohl\u2019s party had created the welfare state in part to prevent such horrors from ever happening again. But now, he told his compatriots, belt-tightening and budget-cutting would be the order of the day, with the hope that a united Europe with a common currency would eventually bring renewed prosperity.Long an advocate of a single European currency, Mr. Kohl was accused of ignoring what turned out to be one of its most stubborn challenges after it came into circulation: Without a political and fiscal union to buttress it, the currency, the euro, remained prey to crises, like the turmoil that drove Greece to the brink of economic collapse in the mid-2010s.At the close of the 20th century, Mr. Kohl had resisted pressures to turn over the party leadership to somebody younger. Instead, he decided to prove his critics wrong and run for chancellor again in 1998 against Mr. Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Social Democrats, who argued that after 16 years it was time for a change. Mr. Kohl\u2019s party went down to defeat.Mr. Schr\u00f6der was no more successful in solving the unemployment problem than his predecessor, but Ms. Merkel eventually reaped the benefits of an overhaul introduced under Mr. Schr\u00f6der.In recent years, with European unity shaken by recession, Mr. Kohl was outspokenly critical of his successors for, as he put it, \u201cruining my Europe.\u201d Among other things, he faulted them for insisting on financial austerity in response to the global recession that began in 2007.But he denied dismissing them as imbeciles, as he was quoted as doing in \u201cLegacy: The Kohl Transcripts\u201d (2014), a book by Mr. Schwan and Tilman Jens that drew on hundreds of hours of confidential interviews that Mr. Schwan said he had done in ghostwriting Mr. Kohl\u2019s memoirs. One quotation had him saying that Ms. Merkel \u201cdidn\u2019t even know how to properly use a knife and fork.\u201dMr. Kohl disputed the accuracy of that and 115 other quotations and sued the authors and their publisher, a subsidiary of Random House, for violation of privacy. In April 2017, a court in Cologne awarded him damages of a million euros ($1.1 million), a record. The defendants appealed.Later in 2014 he published \u201cWith Concern for Europe,\u201d a book written with his wife. \u201cHave we lost our minds \u2014 and our sense of responsibility, too?\u201d he wrote.For all the rancor surrounding Mr. Kohl at home, however, his standing among former allies on the world stage remained largely intact.\u201cIn more than size, he was the largest figure on the European continent in decades,\u201d former President Bill Clinton wrote in his memoir, \u201cMy Life,\u201d in 2004. And in a statement on Friday, the elder former President Bush called Mr. Kohl \u201ca true friend of freedom, and the man I consider one of the greatest leaders in postwar Europe.\u201dAn obituary on Saturday about Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor of Germany, omitted credit for two reporters. The obituary was written by Craig R. Whitney and Alan Cowell, not just by Mr. Whitney; and Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

The order would create a category of programs that industry groups and other third parties could develop and then submit for Labor Department approval, rather than working within existing department guidelines.\u201cApprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cInstead apprentices earn while they learn.\u201dMr. Trump would redirect over $100 million of federal job training money to pay for the new apprenticeships, supplementing $90 million in funding for the existing program.Corporate groups hailed the idea of expanding apprenticeship programs and making them more flexible, arguing that apprenticeships are a reliable path to good-paying jobs in sectors like retail and hospitality for those who could no longer support themselves in production sectors like manufacturing.\u201cWe applaud the Department of Labor and the administration for being willing to look at how to craft this in a way that brings apprenticeships to a new range of audiences,\u201d said Rob Gifford, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, which oversees the industry group\u2019s apprenticeship programs.But Mr. Gifford said that streamlining regulations could make apprenticeship programs even more effective.The administration\u2019s interest in apprenticeships stands in contrast to the cutbacks for other forms of job training in its budget proposal, involving far larger sums. The Association of Community College Trustees said that while it welcomed Thursday\u2019s move, it remained worried about \u201cthe severe cuts proposed to federal work force and education programs.\u201dUnderlying the relatively modest size and scope of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal is a much bigger idea about why workers who have lost good-paying jobs that do not require a college degree are struggling to find work at comparable wages.In the eyes of the president and many corporate leaders, the crux of the problem is skills \u2014 the proposition that employers are eager to fill millions of good-paying jobs that workers lack the skills to perform.\u201cThe U.S. faces a serious skills gap,\u201d Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta said during a call with reporters last week, pointing to six million vacant jobs \u2014 the most since the department starting keeping track in the early 2000s. The vacancies were especially abundant in manufacturing, information technology and health care, he said.If the unemployed could acquire the necessary skills through apprenticeships or course work, the thinking goes, companies could quickly fill these jobs, providing workers with economic security and stimulating the economy.Despite the belief of some, however, there is little evidence that the economy is suffering from an unusually large skills gap.While economic indicators do show a historically high number of job vacancies, as Mr. Acosta pointed out, research economists tend to believe that the skills gap accounts for, at most, a limited portion of this development. Many experts believe it plays almost no role at all.One way to see this is to hypothetically assign unemployed workers to jobs or industries regardless of their qualifications, essentially assuming away the skills gap. The difference between the hypothetical unemployment rate that results from this exercise and the actual unemployment rate would show the extent to which the skills gap is driving unemployment.But when you do this, according to Aysegul Sahin, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the size of the skills gap today is unremarkable. \u201cThe level of mismatch at the occupation level is pretty much where it was before the Great Recession,\u201d she said.Ms. Sahin points to two other factors causing employers to take longer to fill jobs: the aging of the work force and a long-term decline in the proportion of start-ups in the economy. Older businesses tend to grow more slowly and typically take longer to fill vacancies as a result. They often devote more resources to the process and have more bureaucracy overseeing it, such as a human resources department.Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago, helped create an index showing that the average time it takes to fill a job is the longest since January 2001. He believes that a skills gap could be part of the explanation, but he also sees several other factors. For example, he said, employers have better technology and data to screen candidates for drug problems, criminal records or credit problems, prolonging the hiring process.Proponents of the skills gap hypothesis typically contend that the loss of many jobs in manufacturing, for example, is offset by the creation of jobs at comparable pay that the same workers could perform with somewhat more training.\u201cWhen the jobs these guys filled go away, it\u2019s not clear there is something new and substitutable any time soon,\u201d said Jason Faberman, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago who has studied the skills gap issue.So the potential for skills-building to fill many of the economy\u2019s job vacancies is limited.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say the skill-mismatch problem is irrelevant \u2014 it certainly isn\u2019t if you think about a 45-year-old who loses a job in a traditional industry and needs to find a new job,\u201d said Gordon Hanson, an economist at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied job-market polarization. \u201cBut we do have abundant evidence that there are just fewer of those middle-skilled jobs available.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech, Fed, Trump: So Many Reasons to Worry About the Market", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseInvestors have seemingly been oblivious to claims of Russian interference in the election, the firing of a director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the appointment of a special prosecutor. As the second quarter ends this week, 2017 has so far been a banner year, with major indexes hitting records.But as the bull market rolls on, some see storm clouds on the horizon. \u201cValuations are high and it\u2019s one of the longest and largest bull markets in history,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cBull markets don\u2019t last forever. So the question is, when will the music stop?\u201dInvestors \u201care on a knife\u2019s edge,\u201d said Michael J. Kelly, global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments. With many still scarred by the financial crisis, \u201cthey see a potential disaster around every corner.\u201dThis month the so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which have led the market\u2019s rally \u2014 faced a sudden downdraft, which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times to come. Those jitters were on display Thursday, as tech shares led a sell-off that put a dent in the major indexes.And then there\u2019s Mr. Trump himself, whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential to rattle markets.So I asked some prominent investors and market analysts whether they were pulling back from stocks, and how they viewed these latest developments.There\u2019s no question that these market darlings, which together have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the market\u2019s gains, are expensive, and getting more so. Price-to-earnings ratios range from 38 (Facebook) to 184 (Amazon). Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes. They show up not only in so-called growth funds, but also in value and low-volatility funds. Should they embark on a sustained plunge, a bear market could quickly follow.The tremor in June was \u201ca warning shot across the bow,\u201d said Bill Smead, the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. The Faang stocks \u201care showing all the classic signs of being overcooked,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat magazine hasn\u2019t had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover? There\u2019s no question this can end very badly. But the market can stay irrational for a very long time. My sense is that there\u2019s one big blowout rally left in these stocks.\u201dMr. Stack noted that the Faang stocks had brief sell-offs last June and October, only to rebound. Still, he said, \u201cthe Faang stocks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due to the amount of money that flowed into them and the high expectations that have driven them higher.\u201dBut like Mr. Smead, he doesn\u2019t expect that to be imminent. \u201cWe\u2019re not buying them, but we\u2019re not necessarily saying sell,\u201d Mr. Stack said. He urged investors to rebalance portfolios that have become too heavily weighted in these stocks.Everyone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market, but that may still be years away.\u201cHistorically it\u2019s difficult to find a bear market that wasn\u2019t triggered to some extent by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as they\u2019re going to will have a significant impact. What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced to raise rates faster than everyone anticipates. The Fed has prepared investors for one more rate hike this year. That\u2019s where the potential surprise could come. If we see two or three by year\u2019s end, we\u2019re going to see definite headwinds and maybe a market top of some significance.\u201dMr. Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room to maneuver before stocks start to be affected. \u201cWe just had a once-in-70-year crisis that left very long scars. Businesses basically didn\u2019t invest for eight years. In tightening, the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate. But we\u2019re just getting to the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and we\u2019re seeing more normal economic activity.\u201dMr. Kelly said bull markets typically last another three to four years after such a point in the economic cycle, and can even go another eight or nine. \u201cBull markets die from excess, not old age,\u201d he said.Mr. Smead agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re getting closer to normal rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be difficult for the stock market when it happens. People will be less willing to be adventurous. But that\u2019s still years away.\u201dOver at InvesTech Research, \u201cwe\u2019re still quite bullish,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe\u2019re not increasing cash reserves. We are rebalancing towards more defensive and out-of-favor sectors, like consumer staples and health care.\u201d\u201cThe risks don\u2019t lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cFor political mayhem to upset the economic apple cart, it has to irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level. So far we don\u2019t see that happening. Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16-year highs, and C.E.O. confidence in April was the highest since 2004.\u201dNor have investors given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver business-friendly corporate tax reform and a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code, despite the president\u2019s troubles.At the same time, \u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t be looking to the market for vindication,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a Trump rally. He\u2019s basically riding on the Obama years. \u201cHis bottom line: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to politics, and that\u2019s been a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

President Barack Obama observed that in today\u2019s economy, all people need higher education, either a community college certificate program or a university degree. For speaking the truth, Republicans labeled him an elitist.The true elitists are the 1 percenters who use their money to elect corrupt politicians and stir up class warfare to divide and conquer.To the Editor:I readily accept that the pain of the underprivileged is real and that elites can be condescending. That said, the essay falls short of addressing the entire problem. It assumes that the condescension is one-sided (it is not) and that it exists in a vacuum (it does not).What else can one call it when the heartland refers to itself as the \u201creal\u201d America while the diverse middle-class California neighborhood I live in is seen as a threatening abnormality?Being more open to other points of view is almost always a good idea. But asking progressives to be more open to and gentle with the Trump base without asking anything in return won\u2019t fix anything.ALLAN HALCROW, ANAHEIM, CALIF.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Monkeys Can Teach Us About Fairness", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonkeys were taught in an experiment to hand over pebbles in exchange for cucumber slices. They were happy with this deal.Then the researcher randomly offered one monkey \u2014 in sight of a second \u2014 an even better deal: a grape for a pebble. Monkeys love grapes, so this fellow was thrilled.The researcher then returned to the second monkey, but presented just a cucumber for the pebble. Now, this offer was insulting. In some cases the monkey would throw the cucumber back at the primatologist in disgust.In other words, the monkeys cared deeply about fairness. What mattered to them was not just what they received but also what others got.Monkeys aren\u2019t the only primates instinctively offended by inequality. For example, two scholars examined data from millions of flights to identify what factors resulted in \u201cair rage\u201d incidents. One huge factor: a first-class cabin.An incident in a coach section was four times as likely if the plane also had a first-class cabin; a first-class section increased the risk of a disturbance as much as a nine-hour delay did.When there is a first-class section, it is at the front of the plane and economy passengers typically walk through it to reach their seats, but in some flights the boarding is in the middle of the plane. The researchers found that an air-rage incident in coach was three times as likely when economy passengers had to walk through first class compared with when they bypassed it.Payne challenges a common perception that the real problem isn\u2019t inequality but poverty, and he\u2019s persuasive that societies are shaped not just by disadvantage at the bottom but also by inequality across the spectrum. Addressing inequality must be a priority, for we humans are social creatures, so that society becomes dysfunctional when we see some receiving grapes and others cucumbers.The dysfunction affects not only those at the bottom, but also the lucky ones at the top. Consider baseball: Some teams pay players much more disparately than others do, and one might think that pay inequality creates incentives for better performance and more wins.In fact, economists have crunched the data and found the opposite is true. Teams with greater equality did much better, perhaps because they were more cohesive.What\u2019s more, it turned out that even the stars did better when they were on teams with flatter pay. \u201cHigher inequality seemed to undercut the superstar players it was meant to incentivize, which is what you would expect if you believed that the chief effect of pay inequality was to reduce cooperation and team cohesion,\u201d Payne notes.Something similar emerges in national statistics. Countries with the widest gaps in income, including the United States, generally have worse health, more homicides and a greater array of social problems.People seem to understand this truth intuitively, for they want much less inequality than we have. In a study of people in 40 countries, liberals said C.E.O.s should be paid four times as much as the average worker, while conservatives said five times. In fact, the average C.E.O. at the largest American public companies earns about 350 times as much as the average worker.Presented with unlabeled pie charts depicting income distributions of two countries, 92 percent of Americans said they would prefer to live with the modest inequality that exists in Sweden. Republicans and Democrats, rich and poor alike \u2014 all chose Sweden by similar margins.\u201cWhen the level of inequality becomes too large to ignore, everyone starts acting strange,\u201d Payne notes. \u201cInequality affects our actions and our feelings in the same systematic, predictable fashion again and again.\u201d\u201cIt makes us believe weird things, superstitiously clinging to the world as we want it to be rather than as it is,\u201d he says. \u201cInequality divides us, cleaving us into camps not only of income but also of ideology and race, eroding our trust in one another. It generates stress and makes us all less healthy and less happy.\u201dThink of those words in the context of politics today: Doesn\u2019t that diagnosis of stress, division and unhappiness strike a familiar chord?So much of the national conversation now is focused on President Trump, for understandable reasons. But I suspect that he is a symptom as well as a cause, and that to uncover the root of our national dysfunctions we must go deeper than politics, deeper than poverty, deeper than demagoguery, and confront the inequality that is America today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chandraswamy, Who Fell From Favor as a Guru to Celebrities, Dies at 66", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA spokesman for Apollo Hospital said Chandraswamy had a stroke recently and died there.Born Nemi Chand Jain, the son of a Rajasthani moneylender, Chandraswamy left home to study astrology and meditation, only to emerge a few years later as a \u201cguru on the make,\u201d said Vinay Sitapati, a political scientist who interviewed him for a book. How Chandraswamy spent the intervening time was never clear.In the decades that followed, he built a vast network of political connections, most of them in the governing Indian National Congress, Mr. Sitapati said. In doing so he became an influential purveyor of information about India\u2019s power centers and of that coveted good: access.Rustic in appearance, with his wood staff and flowing beard, Chandraswamy proved skillful at winning the trust of international leaders, securing their confidence by rattling off the names of his influential confidants and performing such seemingly supernatural feats as mind reading.Often he would ask a new acquaintance to write questions on scraps of paper, crumple the scraps into balls, and then repeat each question as they unfolded the paper.\u201cHe closed his eyes and went into a trance,\u201d K. Natwar Singh, a senior diplomat, wrote. \u201cSuddenly he asked my wife to pick up any of the paper balls. She did so. Opened it. Chandraswamy then told her what the question was. He was spot on.\u201d\u201cBy the fourth question, the future iron lady\u2019s demeanor changed,\u201d Mr. Singh wrote. Mrs. Thatcher was so impressed, he said, that she asked for a second appointment, and even agreed to his request that she wear a red dress.This talent, \u201cfor entering the heads of others,\u201d as one journalist put it, gave Chandraswamy access to all manner of regents and superstars in a period when India\u2019s economy was beginning to tap into international networks.In her book \u201cGurus: Stories of India\u2019s Leading Babas,\u201d the journalist Bhavdeep Kang wrote that Mobutu Sese Seko, the military dictator of Zaire, would invite Chandraswamy to Kinshasa, the capital, and ask him to hide behind a curtain during an important meeting, then ask his advice on whether the visitor could be trusted.Mr. Singh, the diplomat, recalled landing in the Bahamas and struggling fruitlessly to get an appointment with the prime minister there, only to get an unexpected call from a chuckling Chandraswamy \u2014 who, Mr. Singh said, had not been told of his travel plans \u2014 informing him that he had arranged a meeting between the men for the next day.The two had met in 1971 at the Hindu temple Tirupati Balaji and entered into a kind of symbiosis. Mr. Rao was \u201ca bit of a provincial country bumpkin\u201d eager for the contacts and intelligence the guru could provide. Chandraswamy won him over by passing on what other party members were saying about him, said Mr. Sitapati, author of the biography \u201cHalf-Lion: How P. V. Narasimha Rao Transformed India.\u201d\u201cHe needed someone like Chandraswamy who could use the back channels,\u201d Mr. Sitapati said.Subramanian Swamy, a member of Parliament and a longtime friend of the guru\u2019s, said Chandraswamy\u2019s prominence began to attract ill will.\u201cHe was jetting around the world, living in great comfort,\u201d Mr. Swamy said. \u201cA guru is supposed to sit in a hut.\u201dHis time in the limelight ended with breathtaking swiftness.An income-tax raid on the guru\u2019s ashram reportedly turned up records of $11 million in payments to Mr. Khashoggi, who was later implicated as a middleman in the Iran-contra scandal, the clandestine effort in which the Reagan administration sold arms to Iran and channeled the proceeds illegally to right-wing counterrevolutionaries in Nicaragua.\u201cMany of these people, who looked upon him as a spiritual person, seeing that he was not able to protect himself \u2014 naturally, there was a devaluation,\u201d Mr. Swamy said. \u201cThey suddenly felt, if this is what the state is doing to him, you better avoid him.\u201dMr. Sitapati, who interviewed the guru repeatedly in 2015 and 2016, said Chandraswamy\u2019s only visitors were low-level officials.\u201cHe had a very lonely life,\u201d he said. \u201cHis face would totally light up when he started talking about the 1970s and 1980s. It was really like the autumn of the patriarch.\u201dThere was no immediate word on whether he left survivors.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Single-Payer Party? Democrats Shift Left on Health Care", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Republicans savaged Democrats for supporting the Affordable Care Act, branding the law \u2014 with some rhetorical license \u2014 as a government takeover of health care.Now, cast out of power in Washington and most state capitals, Democrats and activist leaders seeking political redemption have embraced an unlikely-seeming cause: an actual government takeover of health care.In a sign of shifting sympathies, most House Democrats have now endorsed a single-payer proposal. Party strategists say they expect that the 2020 presidential nominee will embrace a broader version of public health coverage than any Democratic standard-bearer has in decades.RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United and the California Nurses Association, powerful labor groups that back single-payer care, said the issue had reached a \u201cboiling point\u201d on the left.Supporters of universal health care, including activists with Ms. DeMoro\u2019s union, repeatedly interrupted speakers at the California Democratic Party\u2019s convention in May, challenging party leaders to embrace socialized medicine. Demonstrators waving signs with single-payer slogans have become a regular feature at town hall meetings hosted by members of Congress.\u201cThere is a cultural shift,\u201d said Ms. DeMoro, who was a prominent backer of Mr. Sanders. \u201cHealth care is now seen as something everyone deserves. It\u2019s like a national light went off.\u201dRepresentative Rick Nolan of Minnesota, a populist Democrat whose district voted for President Trump by a wide margin, said he had rarely seen core Democratic voters as enthusiastic about an issue as they were about single-payer health care. Mr. Nolan said he would support creating a state-level system in Minnesota, but believed the party\u2019s goal should be a national law.He warned Democrats against being too cautious on health care or trusting that they could passively reap the benefits of Republican missteps, saying that his party needed a more boldly \u201caspirational\u201d health care platform.Rank-and-file Democrats, Mr. Nolan said, \u201care energized in a way I have not witnessed in a long, long time.\u201dAt this point, state and federal single-payer proposals appear mainly to embody the sweeping ambitions of a frustrated party, rather than to map a clear way forward on policy. A handful of legislators in Democratic states \u2014 some positioning themselves to run for higher office \u2014 have proposed single-payer bills, including in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Only in California does the legislation appear to have at least a modest chance of being approved this year.Even there, State Senator Ricardo Lara, an author of the bill, said his legislation would not clear the State Assembly without detailing how expanded coverage would be financed. The proposal currently lacks a complete funding plan.Should California enact a single-payer law, it would still require a waiver from Washington to redirect federal funding to the state program \u2014 which might be difficult with Trump appointees running the Department of Health and Human Services.But Mr. Lara said that Mr. Trump\u2019s election, and subsequent Republican efforts to unwind the Affordable Care Act, had upended the conversation about health care among Democrats. He said he would have been unlikely to press for single-payer under a Democratic president.\u201cI no longer have the luxury of going step by step,\u201d Mr. Lara said. \u201cWe need to do a single-payer or we\u2019re going to be in a position where millions of people are going to lose coverage.\u201dThere remains considerable skepticism among senior Democrats about a single-payer plan, and party strategists fear that proposing a potentially divisive health care agenda would offer Republicans a welcome diversion from their own tortured wrangling over the Affordable Care Act.At a briefing with reporters last month, the House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, replied with a flat \u201cno\u201d when asked if Democrats should make single-payer a central theme in 2018. She said state-level action was more appropriate, though she said she supported the idea in concept.\u201cThe comfort level with the broader base of the American people is not there yet,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.Democrats were unable to pass either of those measures into law the last time they controlled Congress and the White House, in 2010, because they failed to draw unanimous support from both liberal and centrist Democrats. Mr. Obama never tried to create a full single-payer system, and Mrs. Clinton described the idea as unachievable during the 2016 campaign.Karen Politz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation who has tracked the single-payer debate for years, said it would be difficult to persuade the country to move to an all-government health care system \u2014 a disruptive process that would likely lead to higher taxes in place of the premiums people now pay to insurance companies.Even if most consumers paid less over all, as single-payer proponents claim, Ms. Politz said, morphing premiums into taxes would be culturally and politically challenging. \u201cIt does involve big government, and it\u2019s kind of baked into the American psyche that we resist that,\u201d she said.Still, Democrats acknowledge that there is a palpable appetite on the left for comprehensive government health care. A number of the party\u2019s potential 2020 presidential contenders, including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, have signaled support for some version of universal government care, though neither Mr. Booker nor Ms. Harris has endorsed the single-payer proposal in his or her home state.The Conyers proposal would effectively void the current private health insurance system and impose new taxes on wealthy people and on certain kinds of income to pay for benefits. In May, the bill won a symbolically telling endorsement from Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the Democratic caucus and a leading possible successor for Ms. Pelosi.Mr. Crowley said his support for the bill was \u201cpart practical, part aspirational,\u201d conceding that there was no immediate path to making it law.\u201cYou can\u2019t do this with 110 votes,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Talks Open in Brussels, With a Mountain to Climb", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe negotiations, which could last nearly two years, did not produce anything revelatory on the first day. But they are crucial to the future of Britain and to the cohesion of the other 27 member states of the bloc.And they come at a time when the government of Prime Minister Theresa May is hanging by a thread, and when a new debate is in progress over what Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe ought to be.The meeting, held around a large oval table, will be the first of many as the clock ticks toward March 29, 2019, the day when Britain will be out of the European Union, with or without a deal.Entering the talks, David Davis, Britain\u2019s secretary of state for exiting the European Union, known as Brexit, said that he aimed for \u201ca positive and constructive tone, determined to build a strong and special partnership\u201d with \u201cour European allies and friends.\u201dMichel Barnier, Europe\u2019s chief negotiator, also called for constructive talks, but he focused on the need to agree on an agenda, citing the bloc\u2019s preferred priorities. \u201cWe must first tackle the uncertainties caused by Brexit \u2014 first, for citizens, but also for the beneficiaries of E.U. policies and for the impact on borders, in particular Ireland,\u201d he said.Mr. Barnier, who comes from France\u2019s mountainous Savoie region, presented Mr. Davis with a hiking stick, presumably implying a long, steep route ahead.In a news conference on Monday evening after the talks, both men said that the atmosphere had been good.The European Union wants to settle the rights of its citizens now living in Britain and to agree on a form of arbitration in disputes. It also wants Britain to pay the union a large but negotiable sum, possibly 40 billion to 60 billion euros ($45 billion to $67 billion) or more, probably spread out over five years. Both sides want to preserve an open border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, which will stay in the bloc, while figuring out how to handle customs issues there.Only after European officials in Brussels deem that \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made, does the union want to begin discussing a future relationship with a post-Brexit Britain.Mrs. May announced a \u201chard Brexit,\u201d with Britain outside both the European single market and its customs union. But she did not get a clear mandate for that at the polls, with Britons favoring closer continuing ties to the bloc becoming more vocal. But there is considerable confusion in Britain about how the European Union works.And as long as controlling migration remains at the core of Britain\u2019s position, backed by both Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party, continuing access to the single market would seem to be impossible.Staying in the customs union would ease the Irish border problem, but would cover only about 20 percent of the British economy, which is mostly built on services, not goods. It would also prevent Britain from making its own trade deals.So there seems to be growing pressure on Mrs. May to choose a longer transition, lasting well past the 2019 date, that would keep Britain adhering to the single market and paying money to Brussels, as Norway does, while it negotiates a comprehensive free-trade deal. That process could take five years or more.\u201cThe Europeans are very clear about their position on the Brexit talks, but it\u2019s very difficult to see any such clarity on the British side, since there might not even be the same government there in a few months\u2019 time,\u201d said Fabian Zuleeg, director of the European Policy Center, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cAny deal reached in Brussels might not even politically pass the British Parliament, and then we end up with a chaotic exit.\u201dFor the Europeans, Brexit is a distraction. Britain\u2019s departure will be a considerable blow, but the union has other problems, including an aggressive Russia, a migrant crisis, porous borders and, importantly, an ambivalent if not hostile President Trump.It is also clear that Europe\u2019s big decisions on Brexit will be made by member governments and will probably come only after the German elections. So there is time for Britain to get its act together and for the Europeans to see whether Mrs. May will survive in office.Britain\u2019s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, a proponent of Brexit, told reporters in Luxembourg on Monday that there would be arguments with Brussels over money and much else. \u201cBut I think the most important thing about us now is for us to look to the horizon,\u201d he said cheerily, adding, \u201cI think, in the long run, this will be good for the U.K. and good for the rest of Europe.\u201dStill, Britain\u2019s negotiating position is weaker now. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u2019s coordinator for Brexit, said time was running out.\u201cI am glad that we are sticking to the negotiating timetable, which is already quite tight,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s now, first of all, make progress in the field of citizens\u2019 rights and create legal certainty for both our people and our companies.\u201dMr. Zuleeg of the European Policy Center noted that Britain had already lost influence over policy issues in the union. \u201cIn many ways, Brussels has already moved on,\u201d he said.Mrs. May plans to attend a European Council summit meeting in Brussels on Thursday, where she is bound to encounter a degree of annoyance with her new political vulnerability, mixed with some sympathy. The German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, noted in a newspaper interview published on Sunday that by calling and then losing a snap election, Mrs. May had created a \u201cdifficult, even impossible situation, without clear majorities and clear negotiation strategy.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe will negotiate fairly, and fair means that we want to keep the British as close as possible to the E.U. \u2014 but never at the price that we divide the remaining 27 E.U. states.\u201dMr. Gabriel is an important member of Germany\u2019s Social Democratic Party, a junior member of the current governing coalition, and his party his is trying to unseat Mrs. Merkel in September. So, like Mr. Johnson and Mrs. May, he speaks these days as much for his party as for his government.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are the English Fit to Govern Themselves?", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn the long and tangled history of relations between Britain and Ireland, it has generally been the Irish who seemed troubled. British identity was fixed, solid and self-confident. Britain had, after all, imposed itself on much of the world. Ireland, on the other hand, was anguished, uncertain and divided. Brits could look across the Irish Sea with a mixture of perplexity and patronizing disdain: Why can\u2019t the Irish settle down and stop being so obsessed with those maddening questions of nationality and identity?So perhaps some of us in Ireland can be allowed a moment of schadenfreude as we look across the same sea and ask a similar question. Or even if we turn around the question the English so often asked about us: Are the English fit for self-government?The big deal about Mr. Varadkar\u2019s election as \u201ctaoiseach,\u201d the Irish name for the position of prime minister, is that it\u2019s no big deal. He is the new leader of what is traditionally the most conservative of the Irish political parties, Fine Gael, long a bastion of Catholic moral values. But neither his sexuality nor his ethnicity is an issue for most people. People like him or dislike him to the extent that they like or dislike his party and the minority government it leads. The rest is just personal detail, interesting but of minor significance.This is as it should be \u2014 though it has taken Irish society a long time and much suffering to get to this point. It learned the hard way, by making all the mistakes. When it was founded in 1922, the Irish state adopted a monolithic notion of identity, built on the twin pillars of nationalism and Catholicism. Irish society locked itself into a theocratic state, in which the Catholic Church had far too much power. The country struggled to find a place in the global economy. And it had to deal with the sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland and all its deadly consequences of unresolved anxieties about history and identity.Ireland took a long time to come to terms with these problems, but they have been more or less settled through an open economy, membership in the European Union and the Belfast Agreement of 1998 that ended the Troubles and, in the process, redefined Irish identity as flexible and plural. As a consequence, Ireland\u2019s relationship with Britain has been more amicable and apparently serene than at any time in modern history.Then along came Brexit, an upheaval powered above all by English nationalism. The problem with English nationalism is not that it exists but that it is incoherent, inarticulate and immature. This underground torrent has always been there, but it was buried for centuries beneath two powerful constructs: the British Empire and the United Kingdom. With the empire gone and the union under strain from rival nationalist movements in Scotland and Northern Ireland, English nationalism has flooded to the surface with great destructive force.Raw nationalism has a characteristic turn of mind: It defines itself by what it is not. The Irish nationalism of my youth did this by defining Ireland as the anti-England. Likewise, the English nationalism that emerged with the demand for Brexit defines Englishness by what it is against: immigrants and the European Union. We Irish had to learn by our mistakes that this way of thinking is worse than useless. But English nationalism is hardly inclined to heed the Irish experience. It wants to make all the old mistakes before learning anything.This is why Mrs. May\u2019s election campaign was so disastrous. The only story it had to tell was negative: She would protect the borders from immigrants and take Britain out of the European Union. Within these big nullities, she offered no concrete detail and no credible sense of what a post-Brexit Britain would actually look like. What Mrs. May found out is that if you put a big \u201cno\u201d at the heart of your politics, you end up with a big nothing, a vacuum of authority.Britain is discovering what Ireland had to face up to a long time ago: You can\u2019t govern a modern democracy by defining only what it isn\u2019t.It seems oddly fitting therefore that Brexit, which was supposed to be about \u201ctaking back control\u201d from Brussels, has actually given a great deal of control to a Northern Irish party that no one in Britain votes for. Fitting because the Democratic Unionist Party on which Mrs. May now depends for her slim majority is like a ghost from Britain\u2019s own past: tribally sectarian, animated by flag-waving chauvinism and militantly Protestant (which, according to its theology, means opposing same-sex marriage and abortion and favoring the teaching of creationism in schools).Most British voters look at this party and recoil in horror at the thought that it now has power over them. But when you unleash the forces of nationalism, you should not be too surprised to find yourself at the mercy of expressions of identity you thought were safely confined to the history books.Mr. Varadkar, a prime minister who embodies the very different sense of identity that has evolved in Ireland, might like to savor the ironies, but he can\u2019t. Before he rose to be leader of the only country that has a land border with Britain, Mr. Varadkar was a doctor. Faced with a neighbor going through a nervous breakdown, he will need his best bedside manner.An earlier version of the illustration associated with this article showed a four-leaf clover to symbolize Ireland, but the Irish shamrock is conventionally depicted as a trefoil. The image has been amended accordingly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Is Growing, but So Are Its Losses", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs streaming music a good business?Streaming has taken over as the dominant music format and is attributed with revitalizing the moribund business of record labels big and small. But for streaming companies, the answer is not as clear-cut.And on Thursday, Spotify released its annual report, which may be the last piece of financial data available to investors before the company formally moves to go public, expected this year or next.Since the company began, the costs of paying record labels and others for licensing rights has been by far its biggest expense, and the more its users click, the more Spotify must pay. According to a company statement, royalty and distribution costs equaled nearly 85 percent of its revenue. Add in nearly $900 million in salaries, marketing, product development and other costs, and, once again, expenses far exceeded revenues.When will it be profitable? In its report, filed with European regulators, Spotify repeated a statement it has made numerous times over the years: \u201cWe believe our model supports profitability at scale.\u201dAs Spotify grows, economies of scale will help in areas like product development, said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research, and with more financial clout, particularly after going public, it could pursue more disruptive goals like signing artists directly. It is also pushing to improve margins, by renegotiating licensing deals with record labels.Still, he added, streaming itself has not proved profitable for Spotify or any other service like it.\u201cStreaming is the content industry\u2019s response to Napster,\u201d Mr. Mulligan said. \u201cWe have not got highly viable user propositions, but have yet to develop commercial models.\u201d\u201cWe believe we will generate substantial revenues as our reach expands and that, at scale, our margins will improve,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe will therefore continue to invest relentlessly in our product and marketing initiatives to accelerate reach.\u201dAn article on June 16 about Spotify\u2019s annual report on its financial data misstated its revenue in euros in 2016.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Goes All In on Drama", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the outset of the prison hostage situation that occupies Season 5 of Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d Gloria Mendoza (Selenis Leyva) implores her fellow inmates to stand down. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody\u2019s dead. We can still pull back.\u201dThis feels, in a way, like the series talking to itself. If you commit to this story, it\u2019s saying, if you see this situation through to its logical conclusion, things will be done that can\u2019t be undone, and this will be a different show than it began as. Do you really want to do this?Yes, this audacious if sometimes out-of-control season answers. \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d really wants to do this.The uprising was set in motion at the end of Season 4, when a guard killed Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) during a riot at Litchfield, a women\u2019s prison in upstate New York. In the chaos afterward, Thomas Humphrey (Michael Torpey), a sadistic prison guard, loses control of a gun that he sneaked into the prison. Dayanara Diaz (Dascha Polanco) finds herself pointing it at him.Season 5, which arrives on Friday, picks up there. The situation becomes a hostage siege in the way that many crimes happen: an opportunity, a heated decision in the moment. Just as Dayanara, a soft-spoken amateur cartoonist, has suddenly become an armed rebel, \u201cOrange,\u201d an acerbic comedy-drama, is instantly pushed hard to the drama end of the spectrum.The siege at Litchfield takes up the whole season, spanning only a few days, and it has a concentrating effect on the show, for good and bad. It immediately focuses the plot of this sprawling series, which often needs half a season to build momentum.But the brutality this time makes the tonal issues more pronounced. \u201cOrange\u201d has always juxtaposed comedy and darkness, but the moral lines \u2014 what you expect to be horrified by or to laugh at \u2014 are tougher to read now. There\u2019s abuse of captive guards and other inmates, even mutilation. One prisoner is bought and sold as a slave; in one late stretch, the series essentially becomes a horror movie. The mash-up of tones \u2014 satire, heartbreak, terror, whimsy \u2014 is daring, but it doesn\u2019t always work.The premise is bracing, though: What would these characters do with freedom, however brief? Some turn vicious; others build a peaceful barter economy based on Snickers and Cheetos. As Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like a party, except terrifying!\u201dThe biggest change comes to Poussey\u2019s best friend, Taystee Jefferson (Danielle Brooks), who becomes the inmates\u2019 negotiator. It\u2019s a standout turn for Ms. Brooks, as her character wills herself to rise to the job.\u201cOrange\u201d has always been a show about society building in a confined space. It\u2019s a Russian novel of a story, with dozens of characters \u2014 I suggest watching with IMDB.com open. Players come and go; formerly major figures, like Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), recede. With its fiefs and racial and ethnic subcultures, Litchfield has an expansive geography as much as Westeros in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dThis season, to extend that analogy, finds those kingdoms uniting \u2014 sort of, not entirely \u2014 against their own White Walkers, the perpetrators of the dysfunctional Litchfield system. There\u2019s no magic here, though; whether they say so or not, everyone seems aware that prison sieges don\u2019t end well.That knowledge invests the season with purpose. More than ever, \u201cOrange\u201d is like a speeding vehicle with a wheel missing: It doesn\u2019t always steer steadily, you can feel the chassis shimmying and straining, but the velocity is urgent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Uber and Airbnb Became Poster Children for the Disruption Economy", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionDuring the week of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in January 2009, three young would-be entrepreneurs \u2014 Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk \u2014 crashed on air mattresses in unfurnished rooms they had rented in a rundown house in Washington. They spent some of their days at a Metro station handing out fliers that urged strangers to offer rooms for rent, and in the evenings they fielded angry email complaints from a woman who had rented space in the basement. Despite the difficulties they faced that week, the huge demand for accommodations from people who had flocked to the inauguration convinced the group that the business they were hoping to create, which they called AirBed & Breakfast, would succeed if they persisted.Also in town for the festivities were two other hustling San Francisco startup jockeys, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp. They had used a website to find more comfortable accommodations, but on Inauguration Day they couldn\u2019t get a cab and had to sprint miles in the wicked cold to get to the mall on time. Camp had been trying to convince Kalanick to join him in a startup that would allow people to summon a car with the push of a button on an iPhone. The cab problems they had in Washington, which were similar to what they experienced in Paris a few months earlier, helped persuade him that the company, then called UberCab, had potential.At certain moments in history, a confluence of technological and social advances creates the opportunity for a new field of innovation. That was happening at the beginning of 2009. A few months earlier, a reluctant Steve Jobs had been persuaded by his colleagues to allow other companies to develop apps for the iPhone. That happened just as Google Maps and GPS and other tools were enabling more wondrous mobile-based services. In addition, cloud services such as Amazon\u2019s allowed startups to store and process large amounts of data without building their own infrastructure. The explosive growth of Facebook had encouraged people to create trusted identities and share things online. And as the 2008 financial crisis receded, the overcaffeinated venture capitalists of Silicon Valley became frenzied in the pursuit of new potential unicorns.The result was the blossoming of a type of economic activity with many kludgy labels \u2014 the \u201csharing\u201d or \u201cgig\u201d or \u201con-demand\u201d economy \u2014 that do not quite capture its disruptive and transformative nature. What companies such as Airbnb and Uber have done in the past decade is take the peer-to-peer sharing of digital content that flourished online, through sites like Napster and YouTube and Facebook, and apply it to our physical world, including cars and rooms and scores of other goods, tasks and services.Three new fast-paced narrative books written by seasoned business journalists (all of whom I have known since my days in the magazine world) detail the personal, financial and social aspects of the rise of these companies. \u201cWild Ride,\u201d by Adam Lashinsky, executive editor of Fortune, is a crisp and lively look at both the good and bad aspects of the rise of Uber and its C.E.O., Kalanick. His Fortune colleague Leigh Gallagher has similarly produced a colorful account of Airbnb and its C.E.O., Brian Chesky, \u201cThe Airbnb Story.\u201d And Brad Stone of Bloomberg News has intertwined the two tales in \u201cThe Upstarts,\u201d a richly researched and highly readable narrative that provides additional layers of insight by weaving in contrasting stories of competing companies that failed.As happens on all of history\u2019s uncharted frontiers, the pioneers of the sharing economy have displayed an energizing mix of idealism and recklessness. Airbnb\u2019s founders came from a background of arts and design, rather than coding and engineering, which offered, contrary to the preaching of STEM education apostles, an advantage in a new economy built on connecting humans to other humans. As a child, Chesky used to visit the Norman Rockwell Museum near his home and spent hours sketching . \u201cOn a family trip to Florence one year,\u201d Gallagher reports, \u201che stood in front of the statue of David for eight hours, meticulously drawing it.\u201d Gebbia studied the violin, played jazz piano and originally planned to be a painter. They met at the Rhode Island School of Design, and they started their company when a big design conference came to San Francisco and there was a shortage of hotel rooms.Both managed sports teams while at R.I.S.D., and their tale illustrates the importance of team formation in innovation. Each brought different skills to their collaboration: Chesky evolved into a manager and chief executive, and Gebbia focused on product design. To complete the team, they brought in Gebbia\u2019s friend Blecharczyk, a computer science geek from Harvard who had started a software company when he was an undergraduate. \u201cNo one of us alone could have done this,\u201d Gebbia said. \u201cTwo of us alone couldn\u2019t have done this. But the combination of what Nate brings, what Brian brings, what I bring, put that together, and I think that\u2019s how we\u2019ve persevered through all the challenges.\u201dThat perseverance \u2014 indeed an insane persistence \u2014 was another component of their success. Having come up with a wacky marketing idea of repackaging breakfast cereal during the 2008 conventions in boxes featuring Obama or John McCain, they lived on the leftover cereal during the subsequent lean year of struggling to keep the company going. They used their scarce resources to fly to New York on weekends to watch how the early adopters were using Airbnb and offering to photograph for free the apartments that were listed on their site.In the case of Uber, both co-founders were already somewhat successful serial entrepreneurs. The idea for an on-demand car service originated with Camp, but Kalanick shaped it. He was a maestro of collaborative brainstorming. Like Steve Jobs, he firmly believed that collaboration happened best when people got together in the flesh, and he turned his San Francisco apartment into a gathering place he called the Jam Pad. \u201cIt was a kind of entrepreneurial safe house, a place where like-minded obsessives could gather in front of a whiteboard and debate the intricacies of building internet companies,\u201d Stone writes.At first neither he nor Camp wanted to run Uber, so they set out to add a manager to their team. Kalanick sent out a tweet, \u201clooking 4 entrepreneurial product mgr.\u201d A 27-year-old midlevel product manager for General Electric in Chicago sent back the most lucrative Twitter reply in history: \u201cemail me :) graves.ryan@gmail.com.\u201d Graves was hired, and the stock he got is now worth more than $1.5 billion.Collaboration, however, can only go so far. It is also necessary to have an intense, driven leader with the visionary brilliance and obstinacy of a Steve Jobs. After finally signing up full-time as C.E.O. in 2010 and edging Ryan Graves down a notch, Kalanick became that.Kalanick focused on beating back regulators, from San Francisco to Paris, who insisted that if Uber cars were going to function like taxis they had to adhere to the rules and licensing requirements that cabbies faced. He fought with a righteousness mixed with self-interest that caused most city officials to think of him as arrogant (or another word that begins with \u201ca\u201d). It was a classic case of technological disruption where there is merit to both sides: It was unfair to medallion taxi owners to allow a competitor that did not have to play by the same rules, and yet for years city officials had become so beholden to and intimidated by the taxi industry that the medallion and licensing system had become a way to protect the interests of the owners rather than of passengers.With his scorched-earth approach to rules, Kalanick not only won battles for Uber but also for a techno-libertarianism that was contemptuous of most government attempts to regulate disruptive innovation. \u201cUber\u2019s lawyers and lobbyists, who had begged him, unsuccessfully, to seek compromise and testify with humility, began to whisper in reverent tones about a new political dictate that contravened all their old assumptions. Travis\u2019s Law,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cIt went something like this: Our product is so superior to the status quo that if we give people the opportunity to see it or try it, in any place in the world where government has to be at least somewhat responsive to the people, they will demand it and defend its right to exist.\u201d He was right.Only once did Kalanick show caution. In 2012, Uber was still using only professional drivers, mainly in town cars. A competitor started a service named Lyft that allowed drivers to use their personal cars, sometimes festooned with a playful pink mustache. Kalanick, uncharacteristically, argued to regulators that this should be illegal. But when he saw Lyft gaining traction, he reversed himself and responded with a ride-sharing service called UberX that quickly became dominant.A good litmus test to determine a person\u2019s basic ideological outlook is to ask about Uber\u2019s use of surge pricing. To some, it is a sensible way to match supply and demand by encouraging more drivers to come out and some consumers to find other transportation during periods of peak demand. Hotels and airlines use variable pricing all the time. To others it smacked of gouging, especially when there were huge spikes in prices during Superstorm Sandy and a hostage crisis in Sydney. Some of the problems could have been avoided with a bit more sensitivity \u2014 Uber would have been wise to kick in its own financial incentives for drivers during a major crisis \u2014 but that was not an instinct that came naturally to Kalanick. \u201cAnyone who whined about surge pricing, in his eyes, was too thick to understand the laws of supply and demand,\u201d Lashinsky writes. The hard-driving testosterone-fueled culture of Uber eventually caused problems. Earlier this month, the board approved top management changes, which included having Kalanick take an indefinite leave of absence, after an independent investigation found a culture of sexism and disrespect pervaded the company.Chesky has been more sensitive to public concerns, but the complex issues raised by Airbnb are as challenging, especially in places where the service is dominated not by easygoing millennials renting out a spare bedroom but instead by developers who buy up multiple houses and apartments to convert into short-term rentals. That can destroy residential neighborhoods and decimate the supply of affordable housing. To his credit, Chesky has tried to deal with these issues as well as the problem of racial discrimination that had infected the service. I watched in admiration earlier this year as Airbnb and my hometown, New Orleans, painstakingly negotiated a complex agreement, with enforcement and taxing mechanisms, specifying the number of days per year each type of place could be rented on Airbnb, with distinctions made by neighborhood and by whether a place was owner-occupied.The benefits that Airbnb and Uber pioneered go beyond convenience. They allow people to make human connections in an era that has become much more institutionalized in the decades since family-run bed-and-breakfasts began being replaced by standardized hotel chains. Stepping into someone\u2019s personal car or apartment forges a bond of trust and, in Gallagher\u2019s words, \u201cyields a little vote of confidence in our fellow humanity.\u201d A disconnected society becomes slightly more connected, not just digitally but also physically.Stone saw this firsthand while covering Chesky on a visit to Paris in November 2015 when the terrorist attack that killed 130 people occurred. \u201cI Ubered home that night to my Airbnb, near the Cath\u00e9drale Notre Dame de Paris,\u201d he writes. \u201cOnce back, I received a frantic phone call from my worried host, Ivan, whom I had never met in person (he was out of town and had left me the keys) but who wanted to make sure I was O.K. The next morning, he emailed: \u2018I was relieved to hear you yesterday on the phone. I hope you are well today despite the critical times in Paris.\u2019 He invited me to stay for as long as necessary until the travel situation in the city returned to normal.\u201dUber and Airbnb, as embodied by their young billionaire leaders, represent, to their supporters, a radical expansion of freedom and a liberating empowerment of individuals to supply services as they please, without government interference. They have provided workers with added flexibility and sources of income, and they have created a new economy based on trust and earned reputations. Consumers rate their drivers and hosts, and they in turn rate us. When it works well it encourages all involved to be a bit nicer and restores the bonds of trust that have been fraying in our society.But as Stone points out, \u201cUber and Airbnb have also come to represent, at least to some, the overweening hubris of the techno-elite. Critics blame them for everything from destroying the basic rules of employment, exacerbating traffic and ruining peaceful neighborhoods to bringing unrestrained capitalism into liberal cities.\u201d On a deeper level, this new economy is disrupting not only old industries but also the entire concept of work. Instead of having \u201ca job,\u201d a growing number of people will, by desire or necessity, support themselves by juggling on-demand gigs. That presents an issue that goes well beyond the need for new regulations; it will require whole new ways to think about pensions, health care, benefits, sick leave, disability and retirement savings.A review on the cover this weekend about four books on the rise of Uber and other transformative start-ups includes outdated information about Travis Kalanick, one of Uber\u2019s founders. After the section had gone to press, Mr. Kalanick resigned as the company\u2019s chief executive; he is no longer merely on an indefinite leave of absence from that position. In addition, an accompanying picture caption also includes the outdated reference.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s Bad News.", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsAt first glance, the new numbers seem like a bit of a mystery. The unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low, yet job creation slowed and the number of people who are neither working nor looking for work rose. But the data aren\u2019t really inconsistent. Rather, they point to a job market that is pretty close to full employment \u2014 where workers who want a job can find one fairly easily, but low unemployment isn\u2019t pulling workers into the labor force en masse.The big headline is a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent. That\u2019s lower than it ever fell during the mid-2000s expansion, and you now have to go back to 2001 to find a moment as good. But the details of why the rate fell in May are terrible; the unemployment rate dropped for all the wrong reasons.Instead of a decrease because more people are employed, the number of people who reported themselves as having a job actually dropped by 233,000. Meanwhile, the number of people not in the labor force at all \u2014 neither working nor actively looking for work \u2014 soared by 608,000.Those are volatile numbers, and any one month probably doesn\u2019t mean much. But over a longer horizon, the trend is still looking pretty soft. The great weak spot in the labor market in the last few years has been labor market participation \u2014 fewer adults have sought work at all, so they are not working but do not count as unemployed.And while there had seemed to be some progress earlier in the year, the labor force participation rate is now only a tick above where it was a year ago. A rate rise from 62.6 percent to 62.7 percent over the course of an entire year is not much of an improvement.Meanwhile, employers reported adding 138,000 jobs in May, fewer than analysts had expected. Over the last three months, the United States added an average of only 121,000 jobs \u2014 the lowest three-month average since 2012. That\u2019s higher than the level of job creation that would be expected based on growth in the population, but not by much, and that figure was above 200,000 as recently as February.These trends \u2014 labor force participation that is barely rising, fewer jobs being added, and a quite low unemployment rate \u2014 are all in line with one another. They\u2019re what you would expect to see if the job market were close to full employment, a state where nearly everyone who wants a job can get one, and the great constraint on growth is the number of workers.On one hand, that\u2019s the goal. If the Federal Reserve judges that\u2019s where the economy stands, for example, it will view its task of healing the job market as having been accomplished.But one of the great hopes for the United States economy over the last few years has been that an improving labor market would pull back in many of the millions of people who left the labor force in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. At a micro level, that would mean more people earning a living; at the macro level, it would increase the economic potential of the nation.And to be clear, there is still room for that to happen. The ratio of 25-to-54-year-olds who are employed fell in May, to 78.4 percent from 78.6 percent, but it is still plausible that it could rise back to its levels above 80 percent before the 2008 recession, or even to its record highs near 82 percent back in 2000.You can imagine plenty of things that might cause that shift, including wage growth (working is more appealing if the paycheck is higher) and training programs to try to help people enter the work force. But the reality over the last year is that there isn\u2019t much evidence that this is happening.So there is still hope for America\u2019s armies of nonemployed. But if we keep getting monthly reports like the one for May, we will have to grapple with the possibility that a low unemployment rate and plentiful jobs aren\u2019t going to be enough to pull them into the labor market.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Soft Brexit\u2019 Supporters Rise in Britain on the Eve of Talks", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Ridiculed by the right-wing tabloid media and ignored by Prime Minister Theresa May as she pursued plans for a clean break with the European Union, Britain\u2019s pro-Europeans suddenly have something they have long wanted: leverage.The pro-Europe Britons\u2019 demands that Mrs. May maintain closer ties to the European Union have grown louder and more assertive \u2014 in particular the calls to keep Britain in Europe\u2019s customs union, which provides tariff-free access to Continental markets and helps integrate the British and European economies.For the first time since the referendum on Britain\u2019s exit, there is \u201can opportunity to have a much better relationship with the European Union,\u201d said Roland Rudd, a senior figure in the defeated \u201cremain\u201d campaign and founder of Finsbury, a communications company.Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London, said, \u201cI think on balance in the House of Commons there is a majority for something softer than Theresa May\u2019s idea of Brexit.\u201dThis, Professor Menon said, creates a difficult and dangerous dynamic for Mrs. May. She emerged from the snap election she called with a far weaker hand for Brexit negotiations, and must also avert a return to feuding over Europe in her Conservative Party, where there is still strong support for a tough stance.The new and changed political landscape makes the prospect of two diametrically opposed outcomes more likely, he said: \u201ca softer Brexit\u201d or \u201ca chaotic Brexit.\u201dFor now, no one is talking about revisiting the principle of British withdrawal, a plan accepted by the Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party after Britons voted in a referendum last year to quit. But the timing could hardly be more problematic for a change in Mrs. May\u2019s original plan, only days before talks are to begin with the European Union and amid signs of frustration in Brussels at the political turmoil in London.Yet, if she does not move away from their agenda, which prioritizes control over immigration and lawmaking above the country\u2019s economic interests, Mrs. May risks legislative gridlock in Parliament, where she has no clear majority and must rely on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party.Central to her attempts to govern effectively will be the more pro-European politicians in Mrs. May\u2019s government. She promoted one of them, Damian Green, a longtime ally, to first secretary of state and kept in place Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, whom she had intended to fire, according to news reports.Speaking in Luxembourg on Friday ahead of a meeting of European Union finance ministers, Mr. Hammond said, according to Reuters, \u201cMy clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritize protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations and take them forward.\u201dEven the Democratic Unionist Party lawmakers, who support Britain\u2019s withdrawal and will want to keep Mrs. May in power, hope to keep open their border with Ireland for free trade, which is vital to the Northern Irish economy. While they may agree to leave the customs union, they back a policy of \u201ccomprehensive free trade and customs agreement\u201d with the European Union.Pro-Europe Britons have floated other ideas, such as accepting a long transition period before Britain departs from the bloc, and accepting rulings from the European Court of Justice.The prospect of Britain\u2019s continuing indefinitely in Europe\u2019s single market, which removes non-tariff barriers and helps trade in services, is less likely. That would almost certainly involve accepting free movement, something that both Mrs. May and Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, have ruled out.Other Labour figures, however, have talked of remaining in a \u201creformed\u201d version of it and have criticized Mrs. May\u2019s stance. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve criticized the government for is simply sweeping options off the table before they even started the negotiations,\u201d Keir Starmer, a Labour lawmaker and spokesman on the British exit, told the BBC.Mrs. May could stall the negotiations for a time, because the immediate focus of the talks will be on other issues, including the rights of European Union citizens living in Britain.But the Labour Party knows that in her weakened position in Parliament, the prime minister could eventually be defeated over a range of issues, including Brexit-related bills. Even if she gets such legislation through the House of Commons, she will have to worry about the unelected House of Lords, where she has no majority, either.\u201cIt was very, very difficult for Theresa May before the election,\u201d Professor Menon said, \u201cand it has now become significantly more difficult still.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Health Debate Shows What Both Parties Care About Most", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byValues RevealedEconomists believe what people do more than what they say. It\u2019s called revealed preference: People\u2019s actions are the best indication of what they actually want, not their words.The same applies to political parties. This is plain to see in the Senate health care bill, which would eliminate large parts of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.More so than speeches and slogans ever could, the content of the Affordable Care Act and the Better Care Reconciliation Act, or Obamacare and Trumpcare, reveal the different values of the two parties. It\u2019s hard to imagine a clearer statement of priorities than the competing approaches to health care in the United States.In short, Democrats are focused on trying to maximize the number of people who have decent health insurance, and are willing to accept whatever tax increases and arrangements with health insurers and other private interests are needed to make that happen. They seek the broadest possible availability of health care, whatever the cost and political trade-offs it takes to achieve it.Republicans are focused on trying to minimize taxes, especially on investment income, and keeping federal subsidies for health care to a minimum. They are willing to accept the wrenching consequences that attaining those goals might have for Americans\u2019 insurance coverage, betting that lower taxes and smaller government will fuel a more vibrant economy.This contrast is evident in both the content of the two bills and some of the choices the parties\u2019 leaders have taken in pursuing them.The Republican bill, which the Senate intends to vote on next week, has been cast as the Obamacare repeal bill. But it leaves some significant parts of the Affordable Care Act intact and has some provisions that change health policy that aren\u2019t really about the 2010 law. Those details shed light on the underlying goals of Republican leaders apart from simply being able to tell their supporters that they repealed Obamacare.In other words, it\u2019s as much about changing the very nature of the Medicaid program \u2014 away from an open-ended promise from the federal government and toward a narrowly constrained program \u2014 as it is about undoing provisions of the Affordable Care Act.It\u2019s also telling which parts of Obamacare are being tweaked, and which are being fully repealed. Tax subsidies to help the middle class pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are being reduced, not eliminated. But the tax increases for high-income Americans that Democrats used to help pay for the Affordable Care Act are being scrapped entirely.A 3.8 percent tax on investment income over $250,000 for a couple would be history, as would an 0.9 percent surcharge on payroll tax above that same level. The Tax Policy Center estimates that would amount to an average tax cut of $54,000 for households making over $1 million.Finally, in parsing what Republicans really value most in health policy, there is what they didn\u2019t do. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House\u2019s version of this legislation would reduce the number of people with health insurance by 23 million; similar estimates of the Senate legislation are expected next week.But there\u2019s not much evidence that congressional Republicans see those estimates as a reason to devise a new plan that would keep more people insured. Rather, they are barreling ahead \u2014 the House voted on its version of the plan before the C.B.O. numbers on the latest version had even been finished.Then there are the Democrats.Republicans have shown willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve goals of less federal spending on health care and lower taxes; Democrats have, conversely, displayed a similar approach to get to the goal of more widely available insurance.A real-time count of every senator\u2019s position.In 2009, the Obama administration was focused on cobbling together the votes for a program to expand the availability of insurance, through any path it could find.That meant negotiating with the health insurance industry to keep its central role in the United States health care system, even as some on the left wing of the Democratic Party would have preferred shifting to a single-payer system in which the government would supplant private insurers.It meant including the tax increases that Republicans now seek to repeal in order to keep the proposal from blowing out the budget deficit, soothing deficit hawks.The Affordable Care Act included other provisions that angered some on the left, such as a so-called Cadillac tax (disliked by labor unions) on expensive health insurance plans, and a powerful board focused on reducing the growth of Medicare costs over time.Congress and the Obama administration did extensive back-and-forth with health policy experts and the C.B.O. to figure out which tweaks to the various subsidies in the bill would do the most to expand coverage.Essentially, in the Affordable Care Act debate the Obama administration and Congress rejected a major overhaul that some liberals would have preferred in favor of a gradualist approach that didn\u2019t disrupt existing industries but did result in a large expansion of health insurance availability and federal subsidies.One hope was that this strategy it would not only help the Affordable Care Act pass in the first place, but would also make it more resilient no matter which direction the political winds might shift. Sure enough, the health insurance industry, hospital and doctors\u2019 groups, and other major interests oppose the Republican plan.But what happens on the floor of the Senate in the days ahead will determine whether Mr. Obama\u2019s bet was correct. And the nation will, or will not, get to experience a very different philosophy of government\u2019s role in health care.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank at Center of U.S. Inquiry Projects Russian \u2018Soft Power\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has offices in a sleek Manhattan skyscraper. Its bonds are accessible to millions of American investors. And it holds ties to some of New York\u2019s biggest banks.Despite this presence on Wall Street, detailed in previously unreported financial records, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, is no normal bank. It is wholly owned by the Russian state. It is intertwined with Russian intelligence. And the Russian prime minister is, by law, the chairman of its supervisory board.Now VEB is at the center of an international firestorm that threatens the Trump presidency because the bank\u2019s chief \u2014 a prominent graduate of Russia\u2019s spy school \u2014 met with Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, during the presidential transition. That meeting is a focus of a federal counterintelligence investigation about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.Three years ago, in response to Moscow\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on VEB that have effectively kept it from taking on most new business in the United States. Since then, however, VEB has quietly kept up appearances on Wall Street in the event that sanctions would be lifted, according to interviews with American bankers and former government officials.That moment appeared to be nearing with Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. And so the bank\u2019s chief, Sergey N. Gorkov, traveled to New York in December for what he described as a \u201croadshow\u201d promoting the bank that was largely hinged on the prospect of improved diplomatic and business relationships between the United States and Russia.During that trip, The New York Times has found, Mr. Gorkov met with bankers at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and another, unidentified American financial institution. Goldman Sachs bankers also tried to arrange a meeting but ultimately had a scheduling conflict. The meetings, which are not prohibited by sanctions, were confirmed by three people briefed on the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly about them.None of the American banks were new to VEB. Citi and JPMorgan had long, established relationships clearing financial transactions for VEB in the United States, activities not affected by the sanctions. And before the sanctions, securities filings show, Goldman and others had helped the Russian bank issue bonds, activity that was blocked by the sanctions and that VEB was eager to resume.After a few painful years, continuing Western borrowing had become a pressing priority for Moscow. The Russian Finance Ministry has spent about $10 billion to prop up the bank over the past three years, according to banking analysts.On that same trip, Mr. Gorkov met with Mr. Kushner. The nature of the meeting, which remains in dispute, followed a session between Mr. Kushner and the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, about opening a communications channel with Russian officials during the presidential transition, according to current and former American officials.The F.B.I. and congressional investigators are now scrutinizing whether Mr. Kushner may have met with Mr. Gorkov to help establish a direct line to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, or for other reasons not cited by the White House.The White House and VEB have issued contradictory statements about the purpose of the Gorkov meeting.The White House has said that Mr. Kislyak requested the meeting and that \u201cMr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official.\u201d But VEB said Mr. Gorkov had met with Mr. Kushner, who was still running his family\u2019s real estate company, to discuss business. The statement said VEB\u2019s management had met with \u201ca number of representatives of the largest banks and business circles of the U.S.,\u201d a claim supported by the Times\u2019s reporting about Mr. Gorkov\u2019s meetings with banks in New York.VEB has not disclosed specifics of the conversation with Mr. Kushner, which is of keen interest to investigators.The subject of sanctions was also freshly topical in December. The rolling back of sanctions was an essential part of Mr. Gorkov\u2019s strategy in visiting New York, and was central to the health of his bank. The next month, during Mr. Trump\u2019s first week in office, administration officials signaled they were considering lifting the sanctions that stemmed from the conflict in Ukraine.Separately, Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, had several phone conversations late last year with Mr. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. In one, the two men discussed additional sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in response to the Russian government\u2019s efforts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.The meeting with Mr. Kushner was not VEB\u2019s only connection to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or associates.A banker who pleaded guilty last year to spying for Russia out of VEB\u2019s office in New York was part of an unsuccessful Russian scheme to recruit Carter Page, an American businessman who later became a Trump campaign adviser, as a spy. VEB also obtained shares in a Ukrainian steel smelter when it was sold by a business partner of Mr. Trump\u2019s who built a Trump hotel in Toronto, according to previously undisclosed documents from the vast leak known as the Panama Papers. The VEB involvement in the smelter deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.These interactions have stirred concerns over whether the bank, which few Americans have heard of despite its ties to Wall Street and big companies like Boeing, has been spreading Russian influence along with its financial footprint.A representative for the bank would not comment.VEB and Mr. Putin are inextricably linked.The bank stepped up lending after 2008 when Mr. Putin, then prime minister, became chairman of the board. And during the oil boom, VEB was seen as embodying Russia\u2019s new financial might.Under a 2007 law, VEB\u2019s mandate was to lend to important but underfinanced sectors of the Russian economy, including infrastructure and businesses that help diversify the economy beyond oil dependence.There are other government-controlled banks in Russia, Sberbank and VTB, but they are primarily retail banks. VEB serves a very different role, lending mostly to large borrowers, many of them politically connected.To that end, VEB over the last decade has lent freely in ways that dovetail with government priorities and make it a tool of Russian soft power. The purse strings opened for two influential groups in particular: oligarchs building Olympic sites in Sochi and companies in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.\u201cThis is not a bank,\u201d said Karen Vartapetov, a public finance analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cWe should rather treat this bank as a government agency. It is used by the government as a tool to invest in politically and socially important but not always financially viable projects.\u201dVEB\u2019s role as a projector of state influence was on display in 2010 with a deal that potentially affected a Trump hotel in Toronto.At the time, Alex Shnaider, a Russian-Canadian businessman developing the hotel, was looking to sell a steel plant in Ukraine. His Midland Resources Holding Ltd., which owned the Zaporizhstal steel factory, sold at least half its stake to a collection of five offshore companies that received funding from VEB, according to documents in the trove of files from the law firm Mossack Fonseca that were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.The documents show that one year after acquiring the Zaporizhstal stake, the five companies \u2014 based in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands \u2014 transferred it to Russian control.In each case, the companies\u2019 shares were \u201ccharged in favor of\u201d VEB, meaning the bank effectively took ownership of them in exchange for financing the steel plant acquisition.Nothing in the Panama Papers linked VEB\u2019s financing to the Trump project, which Mr. Trump did not own. Rather, the deal underscored VEB\u2019s strategy to venture into Ukraine at the behest of the Russian government.More broadly, the bank\u2019s plan had been to tap capital markets in New York to help finance the Ukraine lending, but the plan collapsed with the imposition of sanctions in 2014.The bank today, not unlike Mr. Putin\u2019s government, expanded its sway abroad in a way that appears unsustainable. Weighed down by sanctions and the oil price collapse, the Russian economy has slipped to 12th in the world, below South Korea\u2019s, according to a World Bank ranking.At the time sanctions were imposed, the bank\u2019s total debt ran about $20 billion. It has since been reduced to $17 billion, according to financial disclosures at the end of last year. But the Ukraine lending in particular is affecting the balance sheet, with outstanding Ukraine debt totaling $14.2 billion at the current exchange rate, banking analysts say.Last week, the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti reported that about 40 percent of VEB\u2019s loans were at risk of default.Mr. Gorkov, who previously worked at the Yukos oil company and was a senior executive at Sberbank, became director of VEB in February 2016, partly with a mandate to find market solutions to the bank\u2019s financial woes.For Mr. Gorkov, fixing VEB would require a new focus, and that, according to the bank\u2019s statement, became the reason for a meeting with Mr. Kushner.The two met as Mr. Gorkov traveled to gather ideas for a new strategy for the bank, published a month after the meeting with Mr. Kushner in a document called \u201cStrategy 2021.\u201d It called for shifting some risks directly to the Russian budget, selling assets not considered central to the bank and trying to resume borrowing in places like the United States.The document suggested that the bank was expecting some relief from sanctions. \u201cThe forecasts for the term of the strategy predict certain decrease of geopolitical risks and gradual weakening of the restricted access to global capital markets,\u201d it said.Robert Amsterdam, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Gorkov\u2019s former boss at Yukos, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, said it was essential that sanctions be lifted for the VEB turnaround to succeed.\u201cPutin doesn\u2019t have to worry about what the voters think of him,\u201d Mr. Amsterdam said. \u201cPutin has to think about the top 100. And the top 100 are those who are sanctioned.\u201dLong before VEB became saddled with sanctions, it had deep ties to Washington and Wall Street.In 2010, Mr. Gorkov\u2019s predecessor appeared at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington to unveil a pact with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the federal agency that supports American exports. Under the deal, the two institutions agreed \u201cto cooperate in financing U.S. exports to Russia.\u201dThe arrangement was followed by two little-noticed deals. In 2013, the Export-Import Bank guaranteed a loan of about $500 million so that, in effect, a VEB subsidiary could acquire a number of Boeing 777 aircraft \u2014 planes that VEB then leased to Aeroflot Russian Airlines. A year later, shortly before the sanctions hit, the American agency guaranteed another loan of about $700 million for a similar deal.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Export-Import Bank said, \u201cThese transactions all supported the sale of U.S. exports and thus supported American jobs.\u201dSince the sanctions took effect, the spokeswoman said, there have been no new VEB transactions, and deals involving any Russian entities have been placed on \u201cadministrative hold.\u201dThe sanctions also limited VEB\u2019s relationship with American banks. The sanctions prohibit United States banks and companies from \u201ctransacting in, providing financing for or otherwise dealing\u201d in new long-term debt.For years, issuing debt was a good business for both Wall Street and VEB. Between 2006 and 2013, Goldman, Citi and Morgan Stanley helped the Russian bank issue one bond deal after another, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Now, American banks can work for VEB only in more limited roles.JPMorgan, Citi and BNY Mellon, for example, remain registered to clear VEB\u2019s transactions through the United States, clearinghouse records show, though such transactions have waned since the sanctions were imposed. Many major American banks and investment firms also continue to include VEB debt in mutual funds, including those of Fidelity and Pimco, securities filings show.It would not be out of the ordinary, then, for a VEB official to have brief courtesy meetings with New York bankers about continuing business, though they would not be allowed to discuss new bond deals, said Aaron Wolfson, a partner at Lewis Baach who previously worked at JPMorgan and prosecuted banks for skirting sanctions.Still, Zachary K. Goldman, a former Treasury Department official who worked on financial sanctions issues, said the banks needed to be cautious.Mr. Gorkov, 48, graduated in 1994 from the university of the Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B. \u2014 a school for spies. Like many in his generation of security agents in the early post-Soviet period, he ventured into banking and the oil business.In fact, say businessmen who have worked in Russia, so many F.S.B. agents are in the upper management of state-owned companies that the roles of spy and executive blend almost seamlessly.\u201cIn Putin\u2019s Russia, they don\u2019t draw a distinction,\u201d said Mr. Amsterdam, the lawyer who represented Mr. Gorkov\u2019s former employer.Highly educated and often speaking foreign languages, former F.S.B. officers include Mr. Putin himself, senior officials throughout his government, and board members and top executives at state-run corporations.Mr. Gorkov\u2019s biography on VEB\u2019s website does not suggest he ever served in the F.S.B. The bank did not respond to questions about whether he worked for the agency.But the bank has been known to employ spies. In 2015, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington announced charges against Evgeny Buryakov, an employee at VEB\u2019s New York office, accusing him of acting as a covert agent of the S.V.R., the Russian foreign intelligence agency.At the time, the authorities suspected that some VEB managers were aware of Mr. Buryakov\u2019s spy activities, according to a person briefed on the investigation. Federal authorities recorded a conversation between the two co-defendants discussing how an S.V.R. official told Mr. Buryakov\u2019s supervisor at VEB that Mr. Buryakov was an \u201cemployee of the service.\u201dReporting was contributed by Michael Corkery, Steve Eder, Christopher Drew, Kitty Bennett and Peter Baker.Advertisement"}

Now, 14 years after retiring, Ms. Switzer is helping schools around the city, in a variety of neighborhoods, do what she did at P.S. 234.While Ms. Switzer developed her approach \u2014 and many of her curricular materials \u2014 at P.S. 234, a later experience cemented her belief in the importance of social studies, particularly for students from poor backgrounds.Ms. Switzer recalls that when third graders from a school in Harlem were asked to write about their aspirations, several said they wanted to work as ushers in movie theaters.That lack of a broader view confirmed her feeling that \u201cwhat we want kids to study first is their own surroundings, their own communities, and understanding how they work together and how people affect what happens.\u201d\u201cIt should create a dialogue where people are saying, \u2018What are they doing that\u2019s so right?\u2019\u201d she said of Success Academy\u2019s results.While spending anywhere from several weeks to half a year on a topic might seem excessive, she said, students are really learning not just about that particular topic, but about how to study something. They\u2019re learning that, when studying a culture, they need to look at a variety of features, like religious beliefs, economy and gender roles. When studying a system or an organization, they need to look, as Ms. Switzer often says, at \u201cthe tools, the rules, the consumers, and the workers.\u201dIn a kindergarten unit on bread, students learn that all bread comes from grains, how different types of grains are grown and how to use a stone grinder to turn grain into flour. They make their own bread and visit a local bakery to learn who works there and what tools they use.At P.S. 309, the George E. Wibecan Preparatory Academy, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Ms. Switzer plans to create a unit for second graders about the neighborhood, in which the students study local businesses, look at historical photographs, interview longtime residents, and examine the roles played by institutions like churches.\u201cYou want kids to feel the richness that they own, as well as the poverty that they own,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always want to start with what they know, and they know more than you think they know.\u201dNell K. Duke, a professor of education at the University of Michigan, said that in an era of high-stakes testing, many elementary schools are neglecting social studies and science in favor of focusing on literacy and math. This is despite the fact that the Common Core learning standards call for elementary students to spend more time reading what the standards call \u201cinformational texts,\u201d which social studies and science are full of.Ms. Switzer\u2019s approach allows students to gain access to material in a variety of ways, including drawing, watching videos and going on field trips, which is helpful for students with disabilities or students learning English. But the major emphasis is on reading and writing.Studying each topic requires learning a new vocabulary. At P.S. 130, the students had written important terms related to New Amsterdam \u2014 like \u201cDutch West India Company,\u201d \u201csettlers,\u201d \u201cdomestic\u201d and \u201cindentured servant\u201d \u2014 along with definitions and illustrations, on a poster, called a word wall.\u201cAs much as possible is written by the kids,\u201d Ms. Switzer said of materials on classroom walls.After discussing the similarities and differences between the plastic spice containers and the mortar and pestle, the students at P.S. 130 dispersed to examine a variety of other new-and-old pairs of objects: a plastic bottle of Poland Spring water and a ceramic jar; an iPhone and a pair of marbles. Some of the old objects were easy to identify, while others, like a carpet beater, were mystifying to the students, and it took them a while to figure out what they were.At the end Ms. Switzer asked the students if the lesson would have been as good if the teachers had just showed them pictures of the objects, or told them what the objects were and what they were used for.Django Spadola, who was wearing a jacket and tie, said the project approach was better.\u201cIf the teacher is telling you, \u2018This is a broom and you sweep with it,\u2019 then you\u2019ll know it, and you\u2019ll just know that thought,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you go and try to work with it, then you start knowing how to figure something out, so it will make you better off in the long run.\u201dAn analogy came to his mind. \u201cIt\u2019s like taking $1,000, just to keep, so you can be richer,\u201d he suggested, \u201cor taking $10 and investing it carefully so you can have more.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a teacher at Public School 130 in Brooklyn. She is Anne Bartholomew, not Ann Bartholemew.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Strategy on Climate Change: Work With American States", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 The timing was coincidental, but the meeting had a new urgency.One day after President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord \u2014 saying he was elected to serve Pittsburgh, not Paris \u2014 the transport minister in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s cabinet visited with the mayor of Pittsburgh to discuss climate change.The meeting was part of a broad strategy by the Canadian federal government to work directly with American states and cities on global warming, and to become a leader on the issue. Though the effort began several months ago, Mr. Trump\u2019s rejection last week of the Paris agreement has energized it.\u201cI think it\u2019s disappointing that the United States\u2019 administration has not stepped up,\u201d said Catherine McKenna, Canada\u2019s environment minister, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on the climate pact. \u201cBut the United States is bigger than the administration.\u201dMr. Trudeau has made battling climate change a top priority since his election in 2015, and Canadian provinces and American states have been dealing directly with one another on a variety of initiatives. Quebec and California have linked their cap-and-trade programs \u2014 an effort that Ontario, the most populous province, is set to join. Ontario and Manitoba participate in a climate coordination group primarily made up of Midwestern states.The government is also working on building alliances with Florida, Indiana, Texas, Michigan, New York and other states.Immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement about the Paris accord, Ms. McKenna was on the phone with Jerry Brown, California\u2019s governor, and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington. Both back the agreement, and Canada hopes to coordinate its climate efforts with their states, she said.On Monday, Mr. Trudeau made it clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the accord would not change the bigger Canadian strategy \u2014 without mentioning either the president\u2019s name or that of the United States.\u201cCanada will not back down from its commitment to fight climate change \u2014 and we are not alone,\u201d the prime minister said after kayaking briefly with Ms. McKenna to observe World Environment Day. \u201cAround the world, nearly every country is on our side.\u201dThe Canadian government has not entirely given up on the administration in Washington, Ms. McKenna said in an interview on Monday. She said she would again push the issue during meetings with Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, at a gathering of Group of 7 environment ministers in Rome which begins on Saturday.Privately, though, officials in Canada acknowledge that it is unlikely that the Trump administration will reverse its stand, making working with states and local governments even more critical.In both the United States and Canada, federal governments set the overall rules and regulations on environmental policy, but as a practical matter the states and provinces are largely responsible for putting them into effect. Carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems, for example, are established at that level.About two and a half months ago, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government divided up the United States among its cabinet members based somewhat on past relationships to work on climate issues, as well as on trade matters. For example, Marc Garneau, the transport minister who met with William Peduto, the Pittsburgh mayor, has also been to Florida, where he spent several years as an astronaut and flew on three space shuttle flights.States like New York and Pennsylvania, with businesses that have large export markets in Canada, are also being seen as potential allies. Other states, like Indiana, the home of Vice President Mike Pence, were picked because of their ties to the Trump administration.Although the early meetings were heavily trade-focused, climate change is now expected to assume greater importance.The strategy has some potential risks. States cannot conduct diplomatic relations, so there is no mechanism for them to assume Washington\u2019s role in international climate change bodies.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for California to talk to Quebec or British Columbia about carbon trading,\u201d said Kevin Book, a research analyst with Clearview Energy Partners in Washington. \u201cBut it\u2019s quite another to suggest that states replace the United States at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. There\u2019s no reason for Canada to invite that conflict.\u201dAlso, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government potentially risks clouding the relationship with the Trump White House if it is seen as overtly undermining the president\u2019s agenda within American borders.In discussions with state and local officials, emission reduction programs are a particular focus. And in this area, California will play a special role.While Canada has a large automotive industry, the cars and trucks it produces are overwhelmingly exported to the United States. That makes setting unique emissions or fuel economy standards for the Canadian market economically unviable. But California, one of the world\u2019s most important car markets, has long been ahead of the United States government on emissions rules. Canada now plans to work closely with the state as it again effectively becomes the American vehicle emissions regulator.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly no question that California is a world leader and is leading the United States on vehicle emissions,\u201d said Mr. Garneau, Canada\u2019s transport minister.Mr. Garneau said he anticipated that a group of experts he just gathered to recommend zero-emission vehicle rules for Canada would closely watch California\u2019s decisions.Coming directly after the president\u2019s speech, the meeting between the mayor and Mr. Garneau centered on the role of transit in reducing emissions, as well as trade issues.\u201cU.S. states and cities are reaching out and soliciting this kind of contact,\u201d said Paul Bodnar, the managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute in Boulder and a former climate policy adviser to the Obama administration. \u201cPreviously states and others often played second fiddle to the federal government on the international plane. Now, for the first time, governors and mayors are in the international area. Canada also now has an opportunity to provide significant leadership.\u201dFollow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianraustenAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Trump Strategy: Go Around Him", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterTORONTO \u2014 As President Trump disrupts alliances across the map, nearly every level of government in Canada has taken on new duties in a quietly audacious campaign to cajole, contain and if necessary coerce the Americans.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s strategy for managing Mr. Trump is unlike anything tried by another ally. And he has largely succeeded where even experienced leaders like Angela Merkel of Germany have fallen short.More than perhaps any other country, Canada relies on the United States, which accounts for 70 percent of its trade. Its sizable manufacturing industry is tightly integrated with American production, meaning even a slight hardening of the border or prolonged trade negotiations could put its economy at risk.Laid in the first days after Mr. Trump\u2019s election win, the plan even enlists Brian Mulroney, a former Conservative prime minister and political nemesis of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s father, who had also been prime minister. Mr. Mulroney knows Mr. Trump and his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, from social circuits in southern Florida, where all three keep vacation homes.Mr. Mulroney\u2019s former chief of staff and ambassador to Washington, Derek Burney, said they urged Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government to \u201ccultivate access, but not just within the White House. To work the American system as never before.\u201dBy organizing a grass-roots network of American officials, lawmakers and businesses, Canada is hoping to contain Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist and nationalist impulses. Though emphasizing the benefits of harmony, the Canadians are not above flexing muscle, with a provincial government at one point quietly threatening trade restrictions against New York State.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury that the Germans have of an ocean between us,\u201d Mr. Burney said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have a Plan B.\u201dIn the weeks before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mr. Trudeau reorganized his government to focus on his now uncertain ally.His new foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, a former journalist with long experience in the United States and an unapologetic champion of the global liberal order, is seen as able to coax the Americans when possible and defy them when necessary.Ms. Freeland\u2019s team of America-whisperers includes Andrew Leslie, a former lieutenant general and Afghanistan veteran who knows many of the American generals filling out Mr. Trump\u2019s administration.Mr. Trudeau established a \u201cwar room\u201d dedicated to the United States, headed by Brian Clow, an operative with the governing party who had worked on some of its most important election victories.The efforts initially paid off. Mr. Trump\u2019s February address to Congress mentioned only one foreign leader: Mr. Trudeau, whom he praised for his panel with Ms. Trump.A few days later, the White House exempted the Keystone XL pipeline, overseen by the Canadian firm TransCanada, from Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order requiring pipelines in the United States to be built with American steel.But the honeymoon did not last. Mr. Trump accused Canada of unfair trade practices and threatened to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would devastate Canada\u2019s economy. Though he agreed to renegotiate instead, officials here fear the uncertainty could scare off investors or prompt factories to relocate.Other foreign leaders found their administration allies similarly unable to temper Mr. Trump. Many shifted from absorbing his attacks to returning them. The Canadians felt they could not afford such a downturn.So Canada turned to courting every other level of government, forming something like a doughnut around a White House-shaped hole.Canadian officials have fanned out across the United States, meeting with mayors, governors, members of Congress and business leaders on matters from trade to the environment.Ministers\u2019 schedules resemble those of rock bands on summer tours. They travel armed with data on the precise dollar amount and number of jobs supported by Canadian firms and trade in that area.\u201cThey\u2019re going to great lengths, going into parts of America that few cabinet ministers from Canada have gone to,\u201d Mr. Burney said.\u201cSomething snapped in the last few weeks,\u201d said Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trudeau. With trade threats looming, Mr. Trump\u2019s break on climate convinced Canadian leaders of the need for drastic steps.Since then, Mr. Paris said, \u201cthe approach has been to maintain cordial relations with the White House while going to extraordinary lengths to activate American decision makers at all levels of the political system.\u201dThe phrase \u201cfederal government\u201d was intended to signal Mr. Trudeau\u2019s plan to cut his losses with Mr. Trump and focus instead on state and local governments, according to a Canadian official close to policy decisions toward the United States, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of relations between the two countries.The official said Canadian leaders plan to individually contact every lawmaker in Congress.Officials here, sensitive to Mr. Trump\u2019s influence on politics, feared the measure could inspire more protectionist policies. But they also saw an opportunity to demonstrate Canada\u2019s growing muscle.Provincial governments in Ontario and Quebec, which border New York, sent high-level delegations to Albany, where they hired the lobbying firm Bolton-St. Johns. New York-based business leaders were urged to intervene.Premier Kathleen Wynne of Ontario, the province\u2019s equivalent of governor, said she led with positives, like the benefits of cross-border manufacturing, under which plants from both countries collaborate on a single product.But as Mr. Cuomo pressed forward, Ms. Wynne issued a quiet warning: If the measure passed, Ontario would reciprocate, imposing similar restrictions on trade with New York.\u201cIf this was going to go ahead, we had to be prepared to protect our industry,\u201d Ms. Wynne said in an interview. \u201cNobody wants a trade war, but we also have to be clear on what we will and won\u2019t stand.\u201dMs. Wynne is working against another \u201cbuy American\u201d measure, in Texas, and proactively building ties. Last week, she spoke with Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, the 13th governor she has been in touch with since the inauguration. She will meet the rest in July, when she attends the National Governors Association meeting in Rhode Island.Other provincial governments are doing the same, as is the federal government, chiefly to recruit allies for the big one: Nafta renegotiations.Should Mr. Trump seek to withdraw from or significantly weaken the trade deal, American governors, mayors and members of Congress can expect a call or in-person visit from their Canadian counterparts, asking them to pressure Mr. Trump to keep the deal in place.Canada\u2019s secret weapons appear to be proximity and language.Allies of the United States typically work with the White House and federal agencies. Those have proved less reliable under Mr. Trump, leaving many adrift. Only the Canadians enjoy such easy access to mayors and governors.American news and entertainment are ubiquitous in Canada, giving officials a nuanced understanding of political and cultural issues.Whereas flights from Europe or Asia take a full day, forcing allies to visit selectively, Canadian leaders can be in Washington for breakfast and home by lunch.Domestic politics have also helped. Mr. Trump polls poorly in nearly every allied country. Leaders, particularly those up for re-election, feel pressure to respond to slights. Mr. Trudeau, who is popular at home and faces little organized opposition, is freer to politely ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s outbursts.Still, Ms. Wynne acknowledged that little could solve for Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictability.\u201cI\u2019m anxious about how all this could change if there\u2019s a decision that puts up an insurmountable barrier,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, and I will say quite candidly, our businesses here in Ontario are very nervous.\u201dAmanda Taub contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tax Cut Might Be Nice. But Remember the Deficit.", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn the debate about federal tax policy, one question looms large: Should we have a tax cut that increases the budget deficit?Mr. Trump wants to cast himself in the role of a tax-cutting Republican president, along the lines of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. But before drawing a comparison with these predecessors, let\u2019s recall the economic circumstances they faced.When Mr. Reagan moved into the Oval Office in January 1981, the economy had recently experienced a recession. The recovery was just six months old. Unemployment was still elevated at 7.5 percent.Worse yet, another downturn was on the horizon. Within six months, the economy would again be in recession. Unemployment rose to 10.8 percent at the end of 1982, its highest level since the Great Depression.In August 1981, Mr. Reagan signed into law a bill that phased in tax cuts over three years. These cuts helped usher in a robust recovery. By the end of 1988, as Mr. Reagan was leaving office, the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.3 percent.To be sure, these large tax cuts, together with the deep recession, reduced government revenue and led to sizable budget deficits. Later in his administration, with the economy in better shape, Mr. Reagan agreed to some tax increases to shrink the deficit. And when he and Congress took up the task of tax reform in 1986, they aimed to make it revenue-neutral. Lower rates were achieved by closing loopholes.When George W. Bush became president in January 2001, he faced a situation that, in some ways, was similar to that of 1981. (Disclosure: I was one of his economic advisers from 2003 to 2005.)The economy was heading toward a recession, attributable largely to the bursting of the dot-com bubble. From March 2000 to April 2001, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite average lost about two-thirds of its value. A recession officially began in March 2001. Unemployment rose from 3.9 percent at the end of 2000 to 6.3 percent by the middle of 2003. Without the tax cuts President Bush signed into law, unemployment would have probably gone higher.Yet Mr. Trump faces a vastly different set of circumstances. The economy has not experienced a recent recession. The recovery from the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2008-2009 is now eight years old.The Federal Reserve is responding to these events by raising interest rates. It believes, correctly in my judgment, that incipient inflation is a greater risk than recession. Keynesian pump-priming is not what the economy needs now.In short, Mr. Trump finds himself not in the position of Ronald Reagan in 1981 or George W. Bush in 2001 but rather of Ronald Reagan in 1986. He should follow the Reagan of the later period and aim for revenue neutrality. He should broaden the tax base, lower rates and reform the tax code to promote saving, investment and growth.A key question is how revenue neutrality is to be judged. Traditional analyses of the effects of tax proposals rely on what is known as static scoring, a method based on the simple but dubious assumption that changes in the tax code do not alter the path of national income. An alternative approach, called dynamic scoring, accounts for the possibility that lower tax rates will promote growth.Of course, not all tax cuts are typical. One virtue of dynamic scoring is that it would apply a different discount to different tax changes. For example, research suggests that modest reductions in the corporate tax rate would most likely be the most self-financing, while increases in the standard deduction would probably do little to improve incentives and promote growth.When judging revenue neutrality, policy makers will need to rely on a credible, impartial arbiter, like the Congressional Budget Office. In this era of alternative facts, it would be far too easy to pass irresponsible tax cuts and hand the bill to future generations.N.

{"Headline": "Janet Yellen and the Case of the Missing Inflation", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsInflation has stubbornly stayed lower than the Federal Reserve has desired for the past eight years, and it has been falling in the last few months. In a move that could well define her chairmanship of the central bank, Janet Yellen is betting that falling prices are a temporary blip that will soon be forgotten.If her forecast is right, the Fed policy meeting on Wednesday will turn out to be a nonevent in a gradual return to normal policy. If she\u2019s wrong, the June 2017 meeting will look like a giant unforced error that unnecessarily prolonged an era in which the Fed proved impotent to get inflation up to the 2 percent level it aims for and lost credibility needed to fight the next downturn.She is a labor market scholar, after all, and in her view the labor market looks pretty darn good, with a 4.3 percent unemployment rate and the economy still producing more new jobs than it is new workers.Using the economic models on which the Fed has traditionally relied and which were taught to generations of undergraduates, that would seem to set the stage for higher inflation. Employers would compete for workers and hike wages, fueling broader price increases for all types of goods and services.But there is little evidence this cause-and-effect is actually happening.The Fed has defined stable prices as inflation of 2 percent. Right now, not only are key inflation measures below that level, but they are also falling. The most recent reading of the inflation measure favored by the Fed is at only 1.5 percent. And the Consumer Price Index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.7 percent over the year ended in May, down from 2.2 percent in February.In other words, the jobs side of the mandate would seem to offer Ms. Yellen and her colleagues a green light to raise rates steadily to keep the economy from overheating, while the inflation side would seem to offer instead a yellow light, and arguably a red one.But at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, only one official with a vote dissented from the rate increase: the Minneapolis Fed president, Neel Kashkari. Moreover, 12 of 16 Fed officials think that at least one more rate increase this year would be justified, based on newly released projections the central bank released.This sure looks like a central bank that has set its course for 2017 and will continue on it unless strong evidence emerges that it has misread the state of the economy. The line between intellectual confidence and mere stubbornness can be thin, however.Ms. Yellen emphasized that monetary policy \u201cis not on a preset course\u201d and that she and her colleagues \u201chave taken note of the fact that there have been several weak readings\u201d on inflation lately.But, she added, \u201cit\u2019s important not to overreact to a few readings, and data on inflation can be noisy.\u201d Twice, she mentioned factors that seem to be temporarily depressing inflation measures. A pricing war among mobile phone service providers has led to falling prices for cellphone plans, and prescription drug prices have made what appears to be a one-time drop.In effect, she argued, brushing off those one-time drops is the equivalent of brushing off a one-time surge in, say, energy prices that may drive inflation higher but not affect the long-term trend on inflation.But evidence from the bond market suggests that global investors aren\u2019t so sure. The gap between rates on regular and inflation-protected bonds suggests that consumer prices in the United States will rise only 1.6 percent a year in the next five years, down from 2 percent in March. Even for the five years after that, the rate of inflation implied by bond prices has fallen from 2.1 percent to 1.9 percent.The recent inflation numbers are not so low as to suggest some deflationary spiral is imminent. It\u2019s probably not worth obsessing too much over prices rising 1.5 percent instead of the targeted 2 percent. The direct cost of mildly undershooting the Fed\u2019s inflation target is low, favoring creditors over debtors, for example, but it\u2019s not likely to cause any broad economic distress.What is worrisome is not direct economic damage, but the fact that the Fed has missed its (arbitrary) 2 percent target in the same direction \u2014 undershooting \u2014 year after year. If it\u2019s not a drop in prices for cellphone plans, it\u2019s a falloff in oil prices, or cheaper imports because of a strong dollar.That in turn implies that the low-growth, low-inflation, low-interest-rate economy since 2008 isn\u2019t going anywhere. This would prove especially damaging if the economy ran into some negative shock; a lack of Fed credibility could leave it less able to prevent a recession. Already, the combination of lower inflation and interest-rate rises adds up to higher \u201creal,\u201d or inflation-adjusted, interest rates, which could constrain growth in the quarters ahead.Setting monetary policy, it has been said, is akin to driving a car by looking only in the rearview mirror. When Federal Reserve officials set interest rate policy, they can look only at how the economy has performed in the past and feed information into models to make decisions that will not show their effects until months into the future.Ms. Yellen has earned the benefit of the doubt as an economic forecaster: Her abilities to peer into the rearview mirror and direct the car appropriately are strong. She was early to understand the peril of the financial crisis and the need for aggressive monetary intervention, according to transcripts of Fed meetings from 2007 to 2010. Her decision to plod ahead with gradual rate increases as chairwoman looks pretty good so far \u2014 the job market is looking healthier than it has in a decade.There\u2019s a good chance the Yellen chairmanship will end early next year, if President Trump declines to reappoint her. For the sake of the economy, we should hope she has one more good call in her, and that the June 2017 Fed meeting is one we soon forget.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The M.T.A. Has Enough Money", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe first thing Mr. Lhota will need to tackle is the inadequately maintained signal system, which accounts for almost 15 percent of all subway delays. It is a huge problem and puts the city\u2019s regional economy in jeopardy. But there are other basic issues \u2014 track work, communication, power \u2014 that must be addressed, and difficult decisions will need to be made.Cries for \u201cbottom-to-top reviews\u201d are designed to convince the public that swift action is coming. But commuters have heard this before, and they are rightfully skeptical. Money is only part of the problem, and not the heart of it: To get real results, the governor needs to insist on accountability and strong M.T.A. leadership.During the city and statewide fiscal crisis of the 1970s, the transit system faced a true crisis. The regional economy and its transit system were in shambles. Through hard work and political persuasion, Richard Ravitch, who was chairman of the M.T.A. from 1979 to 1983, developed the authority\u2019s first five-year capital plan. This ambitious $8.7 billion endeavor was followed by six other multibillion-dollar plans to address the system\u2019s needs.The current capital plan, which runs from 2015 to 2019, contains $32 billion, half of which is dedicated to New York City Transit. Critics decrying the lack of investment in the system ignore the billions available and provide no real solution for attacking today\u2019s problems. Money is available; accountability and prioritization are what\u2019s really needed.Charles Moerdler, who has been an M.T.A. board member for seven years, recently said that the system is suffering from insufficient investment over the past four decades. But how about stewardship of the existing billions of dollars the authority receives? Board members are responsible for holding the M.T.A. accountable for spending money effectively where it is critically needed. Governor Cuomo and the board must insist on answers and results.The board and committee meetings must be genuine forums for holding agencies\u2019 and contractors\u2019 feet to the fire. They must push senior leadership to keep projects on schedule and within budget. Once a project is set, changes that could result in delays and added costs should not be allowed, except in extreme circumstances.Of course the M.T.A. could always use more money, but the bottom line is that it should be able to provide safe, reliable service with the money it has in its capital plan. Certainly, with this level of funding, we should not be facing the crisis we are today.The current $32 billion plan contains about $21 billion in what is called the \u201crenew\u201d category, which is the nuts and bolts of the system \u2014 track, signals, stations, fleet replacement. Another nearly $10 billion is for service enhancements or system expansions.The 80-year-old signal system must take precedence over enhancement and expansion projects, which, with the minor exception of those underway, must be halted. This may mean that extension of the Second Avenue Subway and the Long Island Rail Road third track may have to be deferred, but this is the price to pay for ensuring an existing system that is safe and reliable. While new projects like the Moynihan Station are nice, they deliver little transit benefit. The M.T.A. board, along with Governor Cuomo\u2019s office and state legislators, must immediately review the capital plan and determine which portion of the funding for enhancements or expansions can be redirected toward more urgent repair projects.Governor Cuomo and the board also need to look at cost overruns. Capital projects invariably result in delays and added expenses, and they shouldn\u2019t. Just look at the Long Island Rail Road\u2019s East Side Access into Grand Central. This project, which was slated for completion in 2009, for a price of $4.3 billion, is now expected to be completed by 2022 at a cost of more than $10 billion. A lot of signal systems could have been replaced for that cost overrun.And leadership counts. From late 2007, when I stepped down as head of the M.T.A., until Mr. Lhota became chairman the first time around in 2012, there were a couple of unimpressive chairmen who lacked the management skills and gravitas to head such a crucial agency. Bad decisions were made that cost the agency millions of dollars. The M.T.A. chairman must be able to run and inspire a large organization and select people who can execute a plan. He or she must have a solid relationship with the governor and legislators in Albany and Washington as well as the respect of federal and state funding partners. The ability to give the governor candid, and not always pleasant, advice is crucial. In this regard, we\u2019re lucky: It sounds like Mr. Lhota has Governor Cuomo\u2019s ear.Commuters should not have to wonder when or if they will arrive at their destinations. Accountability, prioritizing capital spending and real leadership will go a long way toward restoring safe, efficient mass transit to the people of New York and the economy they power.Peter S.

{"Headline": "The G.O.P. Plan to Unleash Wall Street", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorRepublicans in the House of Representatives passed the Choice Act on Thursday, a sweeping deregulation of the financial sector. It passed 233-186, with no Democratic support. One Republican, Walter Jones of North Carolina, voted no. This bill rolls back or weakens most of the protections put in place since the 2008 financial crisis through President Barack Obama\u2019s Dodd-Frank Act.Though it is very unlikely to gain the 60 votes it needs to pass in the Senate, important parts of it could pass through the budget reconciliation process. But even if it goes nowhere, it reveals a Republican Party that is focused on destroying reform based on a false narrative of the crisis, largely to the benefit of the financial sector.The Choice Act isn\u2019t a matter of conservatives simply preferring less regulation than liberals, or Congress readjusting reform in light of new evidence. What passed today isn\u2019t a result of liberals turning the financial reform dial up to 11 and conservatives want to turn the dial down. Instead, it\u2019s a surgical strike, gutting specific parts of the reforms that have been effective in preventing another crisis.That explains why the bill entirely repeals the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which should be referred to as the Bank Bailout Prevention Authority. This power ensures that when a large bank collapses, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can wind it down, i.e., enable the bank failure without a government bailout and in a way that minimizes any disorder for other banks and the economy. This is a power that regulators lacked to manage the collapse and failure of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. The Choice Act repeals this critical authority, and since it has an emergency funding stream, it could be eligible for Senate reconciliation, which means it would need only 51 votes to pass.It takes a radical and out-of-touch ideology to say that Lehman Brothers\u2019 bankruptcy and the subsequent chaos in the financial system was just the market working as it normally does and that the near collapse of Wall Street did not expose any need for reform. But this way of thinking explains why Republicans go after such integral parts of the reform.Republicans want to replace Dodd-Frank with a bank-friendly form of bankruptcy. Yet bankruptcy can\u2019t be coordinated internationally among regulators, a vital part of preparing for failure in a global marketplace. Regulators who are familiar with the firms won\u2019t be involved, having been replaced by a random bankruptcy judge who will wake up one morning to learn that the fate of financial markets rests in how they know a situation with the steepest learning curve.That is what happened to the George W. Bush administration, which went on to bail out the financial sector. It will happen again without these protections. Bankruptcy was never intended to handle these fast-paced and complex financial problems; this is why we\u2019ve created special failure processes for financial firms like banks and insurance companies, and why Dodd-Frank created a new one for large, global financial institutions.The Republicans argue that the Choice Act makes Wall Street angry. It\u2019s tough to imagine how, when the vast number of changes amount to an industry wish list of the biggest banks. It repeals the miniature Glass-Steagall reform known as the Volcker Rule, which separates out high-risk proprietary trading from commercial banks. It removes the F.D.I.C.\u2019s role of reviewing banks\u2019 living wills \u2014 new procedures that make banks and regulators plan for a potential bank failure, presumably because the F.D.I.C. demands that they be stronger. It takes out language requiring firms that got bailouts to continue to be subject to stronger regulations. It allows industry to choose to ignore a wide range of regulations if they decide to adopt a single, easy-to-manipulate, balance-sheet metric. It eliminates a consumer complaint database the C.F.P.B. maintains.It isn\u2019t just the largest players who win under this bill. The Choice Act would remove the requirement that private equity firms register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and be subject to reviews. These types of firms were previously opaque, even though they are a major source of investment funds and exert a large amount of influence over the corporate sector. Preliminary examinations by the S.E.C. into private equity\u2019s fees and expenses found abuses, conflicts of interest and fraud in over half of the cases, things that make the capital markets not work for investors or for companies.A lot of attention these days focuses on the Trump administration. But the Choice Act shows that President Trump has no monopoly on bad ideas, a poor understanding of what is going on in the economy or an instinctive deference to the rich and powerful at the expense of everyone when it comes to the Republican Party.Mike Konczal is a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Men Don\u2019t Want to Be Nurses. Their Wives Agree.", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIt seems like an easy fix. Traditionally male factory work is drying up. The fastest-growing jobs in the American economy are those that are often held by women. Why not get men to do them?The problem is that notions of masculinity die hard, in women as well as men. It\u2019s not just that men consider some of the jobs that will be most in demand \u2014 in health care, education and administration \u2014 to be unmanly or demeaning, or worry that they require emotional skills they don\u2019t have. So do some of their wives, prospective employers and women in these same professions.The rage and despair of some of them helped propel Donald Trump to the White House. They may be waiting for him to deliver on his promise to bring back well-paid manufacturing jobs. Economists fear a long, fruitless wait.And it is not only blue-collar men who recoil at taking traditionally female jobs.Ofer Sharone, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has studied middle-aged white-collar professionals who have lost their jobs. He found that some men who might have been willing to consider lower-paid jobs in typically feminine fields encountered resistance from their wives, who urged them to keep looking.\u201cMarriages have more problems when the man is unemployed than the woman,\u201d Professor Sharone said. \u201cWhat does it mean for a man to take a low-paying job that\u2019s typically associated with women? What kind of price will they pay with their friends, their lives, their wives, compared to unemployment?\u201dThat may be, he said, because other sociologists have found that while work is important to both men\u2019s and women\u2019s identities, there remains a difference. \u201cWork is at the core of what it means to be a man, in a way that work is not at the core of femininity,\u201d he said.Sherwin Sheik, president and chief executive of CareLinx, which matches caregivers with families, said that many clients remain suspicious of male home health care aides, worried about abuse or sexual predation, and convinced that women will be more caring.\u201cA lot of families prefer females,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad because there\u2019s a lot of patients who could stay at home longer if there were more males in the field. They need assistance like getting in and out of the bed, transferring to the shower \u2014 it\u2019s a very physically demanding job.\u201d He has also found that many patients, often older women because they live longer, enjoy having male home health aides to talk to.Timothy Dage, who has worked for 25 years as a nurse and home health care aide with CareLinx, said he loses some prospective clients who would prefer a woman, but once a patient is in his care, the concern goes away. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a patient who had me who ever requested going back to a female,\u201d he said.Professor Sharone said he interviewed recruiters for female-dominated jobs that are also expanding in this economy, such as administration. They were outspoken about their preference for women, he said. \u201cTheir rationale was that men are going to be bored in this job,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man who is applying for this kind of job would be desperate. And you\u2019re going to leave as soon as you get that other job.\u201dMen can also face resistance from their female peers. Jason Mott, an assistant professor of nursing at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, said some of his male students were teased by their female classmates. \u201cThey feel they need to really express their manhood, stressing the athletics they take part in,\u201d he said.Nursing offers a perplexing case study. In theory, nursing should appeal to men because it pays fairly good wages and is seen as a profession with a defined skill set. Yet just 10 percent of nurses are men, despite \u201cAre You Man Enough \u2026 to Be a Nurse?\u201d posters and other efforts to enlist men.The hope is to focus on millennials who may be less bound by notions of traditional masculinity, said Brent MacWilliams, president of the American Assembly for Men in Nursing and a former commercial fisherman who is now an associate professor of nursing at Wisconsin-Oshkosh. He has seen more men apply to nursing schools, but he acknowledges his group will fall short of its goal of 20 percent male nurses by 2020.Nursing and teaching, another growing field dominated by women, may require levels of education or training that can be daunting for those men who were less successful in school but made a good living in manufacturing.Jobs that are in high demand but require less extensive training, such as home health care aides, often do not pay well and are an even harder sell for men.David Rolf, president of the Service Employees International Union Local 775 in Seattle, said the union runs one of the largest schools for home care aides, training 40,000 students a year. Just 20 percent of the students are men, although that represents an increase from 10 percent 15 years ago.Women and members of minority groups, by contrast, are more willing to take such jobs because they may have started out with fewer options. Men who become home health care aides are more often minorities, according to Janette S. Dill, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Akron who has studied gender and the health care industry.\u201cI sometimes wonder if health organizations don\u2019t want men to come into these jobs because they\u2019ll demand higher wages,\u201d Professor Dill said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to have a work force of women they can pay $8 or $9 an hour.\u201dLittle will change unless the jobs do, too.\u201cPink-collar jobs are crap jobs for anyone,\u201d said Joan C. Williams, professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. \u201cWe need to reinvent pink-collar jobs so men will take them and won\u2019t be unhappy \u2014 or women, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Should Keep Our Word on Refugees", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorYears ago, United States refugee admissions were based on geographic and ideological preferences \u2014 specifically, for refugees from Communist countries and repressive regimes in the Middle East. The Refugee Act of 1980, first introduced by Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, was intended to create a more systematic and equitable process for admitting refugees. The act changed the definition of refugee to a person with a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d \u2014 and in that way, conformed United States law to United Nations conventions and protocols.The act affirms that it is \u201cthe historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their homelands,\u201d including caring for them in asylum areas and promoting opportunities for resettlement. While a previous shutdown of all Syrian refugees resettlement was dropped from Mr. Trump\u2019s revised executive order, a 120-day moratorium on all refugee admissions remains. This leaves vetted refugees in dangerous and uncertain conditions \u2014 seemingly in violation of the opening declaration of the Refugee Act.The law also requires presidents to consult with Congress in setting annual targets for refugee admissions. This consultation must take place before the start of the fiscal year. The only exception to changing this determination is to increase admissions in the face of a refugee emergency, also with appropriate congressional consultation. Given that the fiscal year 2017 quotas were set at 110,000 by President Obama, in consultation with Congress, it exceeds President Trump\u2019s authority to unilaterally change the number set by his predecessor.The process of setting admissions has now begun for fiscal year 2018, which begins in October, with the recent submission to Congress of the president\u2019s budget. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires this process to include a comprehensive proposal and report from the president regarding refugee and resettlement activity, and in-person discussions with the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress this fall. As the Harvard report explains, the president\u2019s executive order would seem to violate the immigration law by prematurely and unilaterally reducing the refugee cap. It also disregards the law\u2019s call for extending \u201cspecial humanitarian concerns\u201d to refugee populations \u2014 language that would support enhancing emergency allocations for Syrian refugees rather than decreasing the number of admissions.The executive order also breaches United States obligations under international agreements. The United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees are the precursors to the Refugee Act. They eliminated criteria that limited refugee status to people from certain locations and to events predating 1951. As a signatory to these acts, the United States is bound by their key principles: to not discriminate based on country of origin; to not penalize refugees for illegally entering or staying in the country; and to not expel refugees against their will to a territory where they may be threatened.The preamble to the 1951 convention recognizes \u201cthat the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries,\u201d and requires solutions based on \u201cinternational cooperation.\u201d This underpins the United Nations High Commission on Refugees annual worldwide calls for refugee resettlement. Historically, the United States has accepted 50 percent of U.N.H.C.R.\u2019s total request to all host nations. In the case of Syrian refugees, that would have meant resettling 65,000 in this country. However, only about 18,000 Syrian refugees have been resettled here since the start of the war. By reversing its customary acceptance of half the U.N.H.C.R. request, the United States is failing to shoulder its historic share of the burden.With 20 million refugees worldwide \u2014 25 percent of whom are Syrian \u2014 a reduction in refugee admissions is also contrary to United States national security interests. The brunt of the Syrian exodus is being borne by Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq \u2014 all strategic allies of the United States. Jordan and Lebanon are being destabilized by the sheer number of refugees. Europe, too, is facing political upheaval because of the desperate flow of humanity onto their shores.Refugees are being left to languish for years in camps or as urban squatters. Children are going without schooling. These conditions create fertile ground for the radicalization that is our greatest fear. By failing to rescue them, we are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy and are complicit in their suffering.In attempting to reduce the number of resettled refugees, the United States is also acting against its economic interests. Syrians have a track record of success here: They have the highest average income of any foreign-born group and greater educational attainment than the norm. And 49 percent of Syrian men work in high-skilled occupations, including 4,000 Syrian doctors. It has been well established that refugees in general are job creators, not job takers. A study in Columbus, Ohio, showed that refugees were twice more likely than the general population to start a business. At the same time, Cleveland, which spent $4.8 million in refugee services, found that this investment generated almost $50 million for the economy. In studies in Lebanon and Jordan, the International Rescue Committee has demonstrated that every $1 in cash given to refugees results in $2.13 circulating in the economy.The Trump administration is justifying the reduction of the refugee cap on grounds of national security. But here, too, there is a potential violation of international agreements. Article 9 of the 1951 convention recognizes that in times of war \u201cor other grave and exceptional circumstances,\u201d a contracting state may take \u201cprovisional measures\u201d to protect national security. But this exception applies only to individual refugees who have already entered a host country. Furthermore, the United States is not in a state of war and the order would bar the admission of certain refugees with no evidence that they pose a security threat. On the contrary, the Cato Institute has documented that, on an annual basis, the odds of being murdered by someone born in America are 269 times higher than for being killed in a terrorist incident in the United States by a refugee.This all may seem like legal hairsplitting to supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s order. But the issue cuts to the well-being and moral heart of our nation. This is a country that prides itself in the depth and diversity of its religious faith. But Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order violates the fundamental precepts of the great religions: to provide sanctuary and care for strangers.Georgette F. Bennett is the founder of Multifaith Alliance for Syrian Refugees.Advertisement"}

Such trickle-down economics encourages business polices that make the work force less secure.At the same time, the Federal Reserve, apparently concluding that the economy is at or near \u201cfull employment,\u201d appears ready to cool it down with still higher interest rates.

A rate increase would continue to prop up stock prices but would hurt workers. Such an outcome would be impossible to square with the Fed\u2019s mandate to promote full employment and stable prices.The White House and Congress show no sign of altering the path they are on, but the Fed has generally shown flexibility in the face of changing conditions.

{"Headline": "Vatican Sex Abuse Scandal Reveals Blind Spot for Francis", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis came to power promising not only to create a more inclusive church and to clean up an ossified Vatican bureaucracy, but also to remove the stain of child sex abuse.A global pedophilia scandal plagued his two immediate predecessors. With Francis\u2019s election in 2013, many expected progress. Francis talked about powerful committees to safeguard children, tribunals to try bishops and a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for offending priests.It hasn\u2019t exactly worked out that way.\u201cWe talked about my need to take leave to clear my name,\u201d Cardinal Pell, 76, stone-faced in simple black cleric\u2019s clothes, said as he sat next to the Vatican\u2019s spokesman and reiterated his innocence. \u201cSo I\u2019m very grateful to the Holy Father for giving me this leave to return to Australia.\u201dIt was unusual and jarring, bad news for a pontificate that has mostly bathed in global adoration and done wonders to improve the public image of the church.But for all of Francis\u2019s good works, good will and popularity, disappointed critics saw Cardinal Pell\u2019s removal as only the latest evidence that a pope who has focused the world\u2019s attention on issues from climate change to peace on earth has his own blind spot when it comes to sex abuse in his ranks.He said that despite the pope\u2019s talk, \u201cthe fight against pedophilia is not a priority for Francis.\u201dSome have long questioned why Francis brought Cardinal Pell to Rome in 2014 in the first place, charging that he had offered the prelate an escape hatch just as the Australian Royal Commission examining institutional responses to child sexual abuse had begun its work in earnest.At the very least, the choice seemed to demonstrate that the pope\u2019s determination to dismantle the power hierarchies of the Roman Curia, which he had hoped Cardinal Pell could help him with, was a greater priority and had led him to overlook warning signs.Despite serious ideological differences, Francis handpicked the arch-conservative Cardinal Pell to lead his Secretariat for the Economy, bringing him to Rome to use his well regarded financial acumen to clean up the church\u2019s muddied finances. Right away, Cardinal Pell acknowledged that \u201chundreds of millions of euros\u201d had been \u201ctucked away\u201d off the Vatican\u2019s books.Pope Francis then brought Cardinal Pell onto his powerful Council of Cardinals, a nine-person group that wields enormous power in the Curia. The Australian\u2019s brashness made him enemies among entrenched Vatican officials who took his calls for financial transparency as a threat to their power.Even as Cardinal Pell struggled to improve one aspect of the church\u2019s image, he came with a separate cloud of scandal. The Australian Royal Commission found more than four thousand people who alleged they had been sexually abused in the church as children.Cardinal Pell testified that he had made \u201cenormous mistakes\u201d in failing to remove priests accused of abuse when he served as archbishop of Melbourne, and then Sydney.But if the Pope was displeased with Cardinal Pell, it was not publicly evident.Victims rights groups generally see the pontificate of John Paul II as a disaster with respect to sex abuse in the church, as he presided over vast cover-ups and a period of little accountability.His successor, Pope Benedict, who read many of the ghastly reports during his time as the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal watchdog, made key policy changes to protect children and hold priests accountable for abuse. But he largely left bishops untouched.Francis initially raised expectations that he would be more serious than his predecessors about rooting out abusers and demanding accountability.Nine months after he became pope, he created a commission of outside experts to advise the church on how to protect children and prevent abuse.The pope later issued an edict, titled \u201cAs a Loving Mother,\u201d saying that the Vatican already had all the offices necessary to investigate and discipline negligent bishops, and would do so. But no discipline or sanctions have ever been announced.\u201cPope Francis has a lot of explaining to do,\u201d said the Rev. James E. Connell, a priest in Milwaukee, a canon lawyer, and a founding member of Catholic Whistleblowers, a group of priests, nuns and others who advocate for victims. \u201cHe sets up these things and then kills them and doesn\u2019t follow through. And these are all matters of justice.\u201dFather Connell said the group had sent files of documents to Pope Francis and the Vatican on three American bishops the group accused of particularly egregious cover-ups of child abuse, and heard nothing back.Pope Francis\u2019 focus on mercy as a central teaching may also be a blind spot, Father Connell said. \u201cWe hear a lot from the pope about mercy, and fine, we hope the Lord is merciful. But at the same time, justice must be rendered,\u201d he said.She said Cardinal Pell should have stepped down from his Vatican position long ago, even before he faced charges of sexual offenses.\u201cHe should never have been allowed to hide out in the Vatican to avoid having to face those in his home country who needed answers,\u201d she wrote, adding that Cardinal Pell\u2019s case has shown \u201chow little reliance we can put on assurances from the Catholic Church that bishops and religious superiors will face sanctions if they mishandle abuse cases.\u201dAdvocates of sex abuse victims were affronted once again in February when, in keeping with his vision for a more merciful church, he reduced sanctions against some priests convicted of pedophilia. The Vatican has also been criticized as retreating into a bunker mentality when accusations were made against its own.\u201cIt is important to recall that Cardinal Pell has openly and repeatedly condemned as immoral and intolerable acts of abuse committed against minors,\u201d the Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke, said on Thursday after Cardinal Pell read his statement.Jason Horowitz reported from the Vatican, and Laurie Goodstein from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Won\u2019t Move Embassy to Jerusalem, at Least for Now", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAides said the decision was just a delay and that he still planned to move the embassy to Jerusalem when conditions were right, although past presidents have said the same without ever acting. In a statement issued by the White House, officials said that Mr. Trump\u2019s move should not be considered \u201ca retreat from the president\u2019s strong support for Israel\u201d and its alliance with the United States.\u201cPresident Trump made this decision to maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, fulfilling his solemn obligation to defend America\u2019s national security interest,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBut, as he has repeatedly stated his intention to move the embassy, the question is not if that happens, but only when.\u201dMr. Trump made no mention of his pending decision during a visit to Jerusalem just last week and waited to announce it until almost the last minute he could under law, demonstrating the deep political sensitivity of a city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. The order waives for six months a congressional edict requiring the embassy be located in Jerusalem, meaning he will have to consider the matter again by Dec. 1.Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian Authority representative in the United States, welcomed the decision, saying it cleared away one obstacle to negotiations. \u201cThis is in line with the long held U.S. policy and the international consensus and it gives peace a chance,\u201d he said.Anticipating that Mr. Trump would back off the embassy move, some in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition had hoped that the president at least would say during his trip last week that Jerusalem was Israel\u2019s capital, but he did not do that.Mr. Trump did visit the Western Wall, the holiest Jewish prayer site in the country, becoming the first sitting American president to do so \u2014 an act that some interpreted as indirect recognition since the wall is in a part of the city that Israel took control of during its 1967 war with Arab neighbors.By the time Mr. Trump signed the waiver, Israeli officials had already assumed he would and sought to discount its significance on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited 69 years, we will wait 70 years,\u201d said Yoav Galant, the Israeli minister of housing. Tzachi Hanegbi, another minister, called it a \u201cmarginal\u201d issue that had to do with \u201creal estate,\u201d and that Mr. Trump had made a \u201cresonant statement\u201d with his visit to the Western Wall.But Naftali Bennett, a leader of a pro-settlement party within Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, said delaying the embassy move would actually damage the prospects for peace by fostering Palestinians\u2019 false hope that they would gain control of East Jerusalem. \u201cOnly recognizing a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty will end illusions and pave the way to a sustainable peace with our neighbors,\u201d he said.But he has become enamored of the idea that he, unlike all of his predecessors, could be the one to finally negotiate a permanent peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, and he was persuaded that an embassy move would hinder that.Khaled Elgindy, a former adviser to Palestinian leaders who is now at the Brookings Institution, said there would be \u201ca collective sigh of relief\u201d among Arab leaders and others invested in peace talks. \u201cWhile there is likely to be some backlash from his conservative base, especially evangelical voters, the fact that Trump is now personally invested in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking may be something of an insurance policy against his having a change of heart further down the road,\u201d he said.Dan Shapiro, an American ambassador to Israel under Mr. Obama, said moving the embassy now \u201cdoes not make sense\u201d given Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in peace talks. But Mr. Shapiro said he agreed that the embassy ultimately did belong in Jerusalem and that Mr. Trump still could make it happen if handled right.\u201cIf they plan it smartly, coordinate the timing with key parties, and ensure that its placement in West Jerusalem reinforces, rather than undermines, the ability to achieve a two-state solution, they can still mark this accomplishment before the end of the president\u2019s term,\u201d said Mr. Shapiro, a senior visiting fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter @peterbakernytIsabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Britain\u2019s Labour Party, a Mild Defeat May Be Worst of All", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI\u2019ve always been Labour, but people have lost trust in the current leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s got the personality and strength to be a leader,\u201d Dipak Desai, a teacher, said, echoing the sentiments of many others.But Mrs. May has run a rough, uncertain campaign, while Mr. Corbyn, beginning with low expectations, has had a good one. Although some Labour moderates privately hoped that a cataclysmic defeat would sweep him away, now it looks as if the party will do well enough to maintain its uneasy status quo, and Mr. Corbyn and his proto-Marxist program will survive.For Corbynistas, as his staunch supporters are known, a vaguely successful, better-than-expected outcome is fine enough. But for Labour\u2019s less ideological, more politically ambitious lawmakers, it would be nothing short of disaster, leaving them \u201cto the thought of a decade out of power, of a whole career at Westminster without power,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.\u201cYou would normally think that Labour, like the Tories, would want to win the next election,\u201d said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. \u201cBut Labour under its current leadership doesn\u2019t see that as the overwhelming purpose. Rather, it is to keep the machine in the hands of Jeremy Corbyn or someone like him.\u201dLabour is suffering from a deep division between well-educated, globalized urbanites like Mr. Corbyn and its traditional white working-class constituents. Those voters supported Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d and could be tempted for the first time in generations to support a Tory on Thursday.On a tactical level, there is also a split between a leadership that wants to build a left-wing social movement and those, including most of its elected legislators, who want to move to the center to try to win an election.All these political stresses and strains are on display in Northfield. The area is about 86 percent white and mixed between urban and suburban. A third of its population lives in what are classified as \u201cdeprived\u201d neighborhoods, and a third of its children live in poverty.About 9 percent of the population is between 18 and 24, a group that tends to support Labour but typically has a low voter turnout. But about 15 percent are 65 or older, a population that votes in higher numbers and tends to favor the Tories.The representative for Northfield, Richard Burden, who is no fan of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s, won the seat in 1992 with a margin of just 630 votes. He beat back a major Conservative push in the last general election, just two years ago.His main opposition is the Conservative candidate, Meg Powell-Chandler, a former adviser to former Prime Minister David Cameron, and the Tories smell victory. Last year, 62 percent of the district\u2019s voters in the Brexit referendum chose to leave, including large numbers of Labour voters.On paper, Northfield seems ripe for Conservative plucking. In 2015, Mr. Burden won with an advantage of only 2,509 votes over the Conservatives, while the candidate of the nationalist, anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party got 7,106 votes.In this election, UKIP is not running a candidate, Mrs. May is promising Brexit and most UKIP voters do not identify politically or culturally with Mr. Corbyn.But Mrs. May has proved to be an inept retail politician, establishing little emotional rapport with voters and being mocked as \u201cweak and wobbly\u201d instead of the \u201cstrong and stable\u201d image she has sought to project.According to a variety of polls, Mr. Corbyn is attracting growing support by promoting a set of left-wing policies that promise more state money for nearly every social problem, from health to education. The policies include offering free tuition and renationalizing the railroads and water systems, while taxing corporations and the comparatively wealthy.Mr. Burden is sounding a bit more confident. He is emphasizing local issues on the doorstep, he said, and \u201cthe importance of having a strong local voice to speak for the area, whoever is in Downing Street.\u201dHe added that \u201cpeople are understanding that Theresa May is not so strong and stable, and her policies on education and social care have caused outrage among some traditional Tory voters, and people are hearing what Jeremy Corbyn is saying, not just what people say about him.\u201dIf the current polls that show Labour gaining hold up \u2014 which, in recent years, has not been a sure thing \u2014 Mr. Corbyn may well avoid the sort of electoral disaster that befell his predecessor, Ed Miliband, who resigned immediately after the resounding Labour defeat in 2015. That should be enough to keep him \u2014 and his policies \u2014 ruling Labour.\u201cThere will be an attempt to keep Corbyn on board as leader,\u201d said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. \u201cEven more widely, there will be an attempt to keep the program he\u2019s associated with.\u201dLabour is likely to lose, Mr. Fielding said. \u201cBut it all depends on how bad it is, and I don\u2019t think it will be bad enough,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere will be too many loopholes, so people can say, \u2018O.K., Jeremy wasn\u2019t popular, but the policies are fine.\u2019\u201dPart of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s recovery in the polls comes from people who are opposed to \u201cthe system\u201d and from younger voters. But many younger voters, like Catherine Pritchard, 22, do not vote, considering it \u201ctoo confusing,\u201d as she said, or useless. \u201cThey all lie,\u201d she said of politicians.Mr. Corbyn is doing a good job of holding on to voters who dislike him but like the Labour Party, and who are having doubts about Mrs. May. But that does nothing to resolve the underlying issues eroding the party, Mr. Bale said.\u201cLabour\u2019s working class base is crumbling underneath it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s shrinking anyway as the economy becomes more services and more middle class. And even in that shrinking part, views on immigration, law and order and education values are very different\u201d from its better educated urbanite supporters.There is \u201ca deep structural problem for social democrats,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent. The left, he said, \u201cis now a movement that relies on a coalition of voters who think very differently about new identity issues of immigration, ethnic change and Europe.\u201dProfessor Goodwin cited \u201ca new urban middle class, broadly liberal and at ease with globalization and Europe and low-skilled service and manual workers anxious about ethnic change, opposed to transnational identities and with a premium on the nation state.\u201dThe problem for Labour, he said, is that \u201cthese groups are essentially incompatible and their views can\u2019t be reconciled.\u201d\u201cCan Labour cobble these two groups together and find a more coherent agenda that allows them to win elections?\u201d Professor Goodwin asked. \u201cSo far, they\u2019re not pushing themselves out of their comfort zone.\u201dBut in Northfield, for now, Brexit and Mr. Corbyn are much on people\u2019s minds, which favors the Conservatives.\u201cWhen I was growing up, Birmingham was Labour,\u201d said Gail Williams, 50. \u201cBut it\u2019s shifting to the Tories.\u201dMs. Williams, who voted for Brexit, said that though Mrs. May wasn\u2019t perfect, \u201cshe\u2019s taking the country in the right way, and I think she\u2019ll take us to the Brexit we voted for.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been Labour all my life,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like where it\u2019s going, and I don\u2019t trust Jeremy Corbyn to lead the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba Predicts Strong Sales in a Sign of Strength From China", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Alibaba Group signaled on Thursday that for all the global worries about China\u2019s rising debt and bloated state industries, its economy still enjoys a strong pillar of support: online shoppers.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said Thursday during an investor conference that it expected revenue for its current fiscal year to grow at a much higher rate than analysts had forecast. It cited expectations for growing sales volumes on its online marketplaces and, even more strongly, surging demand by merchants for its digital ad space.China\u2019s digital growth will not last forever, though, and even Alibaba\u2019s numbers show that China\u2019s online world cannot counter the laws of diminishing returns. Still, the ranks of China\u2019s online shoppers grew nearly 13 percent last year to a considerable 467 million, according to official statistics, showing the already vast market is still growing.During a speech at the conference, Alibaba\u2019s chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said that the company expected revenue for the year that will end next March to grow between 45 percent and 49 percent. That is slightly down from the 56 percent growth the company registered in fiscal year 2017, which ended in March. Still, it nonetheless shows the company is expecting to keep growing at a fast pace in the coming year.Although Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, it does not directly sell the goods on its websites. Instead, it provides marketplaces where anyone from small village dwellers to big global brands can set up online shops and sell to Chinese customers. To reach those customers, Alibaba also offers online advertising space.That space is looking increasingly valuable.During her speech, Ms. Wu said the company got about 60 percent of its revenue from its Alimama advertising platform, which works as an auction site on which Alibaba\u2019s many vendors can bid for advertising space on its sites. On that platform the price for ads has been rising as a result of market forces, Ms. Wu said.At times in the past, Alibaba\u2019s merchants, many of which are small businesses that duke it out with other small sellers on the company\u2019s Taobao marketplace, have complained about increases in what the company would charge for promotions. Such criticism even led to several protests at the company\u2019s offices.Still, the pricing of online ad space in China has long lagged behind what it can cost in more developed markets in Europe and the United States. Alibaba\u2019s high revenue growth target shows that gap may be starting to close, which is good news for a company that is in essence an advertising company.\u201cWe\u2019re not holding a gun to merchants\u2019 heads to make revenue grow,\u201d Ms. Wu said.\u201cIt\u2019s all determined by merchants,\u201d she said. \u201cThey bid for every single click.\u201dThe big revenue growth target is important because investors have been concerned about the slowdown in the total value of the merchandise Alibaba sells on its online platforms. That figure, which Alibaba calls gross merchandise value, grew 22 percent in 2017, a figure smaller than what the company had posted in recent years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The View From Behind the Velvet Rope", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhether you\u2019re covering a political campaign, a rock concert or the launch of a new cruise ship, one of the privileges of being a reporter is being allowed behind the velvet rope \u2014 to the front of the line, onto the stage or into the limo \u2014 to interview subjects. It\u2019s not something I seek out (far from it), but as a business reporter who covered Wall Street and C.E.O.s for years, it came with the territory.Some theme-park experiences are even more rarefied. Located next door to SeaWorld in Orlando, and owned by the same company, Discovery Cove is quadruple the price, costing a family of four nearly $1,300 for a day. Here, attendance is capped, and instead of just watching the dolphins, visitors can actually swim with them.When I donned a wet suit at Discovery Cove to learn what justified the price of admission and to let a dolphin gently tug me around a lagoon, I was delighted. It was a rare, special experience \u2014 and one that bore no resemblance to crowded but affordable amusement parks where Americans of all classes waited in line together, as I remember them from my childhood in the 1980s.The proliferation of class-segregated, but side-by-side experiences \u2014 like Discovery Cove and SeaWorld, or the priority and regular lines at the airport \u2014 convinced me this was more than a single story. So I began writing a series on what I call the velvet rope economy.Unlike theme-park visits or air travel, health care can be a matter of life and death. And I was troubled by the growing practice of spending $40,000 a year for access to a concierge doctor, even if I could empathize as a parent with the desire to get the best care at any cost.The one consolation, and perhaps the biggest surprise in my reporting, was that the doctors themselves, and more than a few of their patients, felt similarly uncomfortable about how class-bound our once-seemingly egalitarian society has become.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What We Lose by Barring Refugees", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s eruption of tweets in response to the London terror attacks doubled down on his self-described travel ban: \u201cWe need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the travel ban as an extra level of safety!\u201dMr. Trump knows that banning travel to the United States from a half dozen Muslim-majority countries would do nothing to enhance our security \u2014 and everything to undermine it. The threat we face is mostly home grown. The perpetrators of recent attacks in Britain, France and Belgium were all citizens or longtime residents of those countries \u2014 and none of those attackers would have been subject to the ban had they wanted to bring terrorism to the United States. By alienating Muslim communities and our closest allies, Mr. Trump would destroy the partnerships we need to effectively fight terror.Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban has never really been about security. Rather, it\u2019s the tip of the spear in a much broader battle: to drastically curtail immigration to the United States that is changing the complexion of our country. One week before the London attacks, Mr. Trump waged his latest offensive in that effort at the meeting of the Group of 7 leading economic powers.Taormina, the Sicilian coastal city that hosted the G7, has long been a playground for the jet set. But Italy chose the locale to spotlight a different dimension of the human condition: the hundreds of thousands of refugees who, in desperation, put their lives on the line to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa and the Middle East every year.While Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on trade and climate change drew most of the attention, behind the scenes the drama over migration policy was just as intense \u2014 and just as far-reaching in its consequences.We are in the midst of the largest wave of human displacement since World War II. Around the world, 65 million people \u2014 including 21 million refugees \u2014 are on the move, forced from home by war, violence, economic deprivation and climate change. If they all came together in one country, it would be about the size of Britain. Instead, they are spread across the planet \u2014 putting pressure on national borders; straining budgets, infrastructure and social services; reshaping economies and communities; affecting our sense of security; but most of all challenging us to live up to our common humanity.Italy hoped the G7 would issue a detailed stand-alone policy statement and emphasize the obligation of developed nations to resettle more migrants and refugees, who on average spend 10 years away from their home countries. Most G7 members rallied behind Italy\u2019s action plan and conviction that a global problem demands a global response.The United States said no. The White House scuttled the stand-alone statement and sought to water down any migration references in the summit conference\u2019s final communiqu\u00e9 \u2014 especially language that implied an obligation to take in more refugees. Only a furious effort by Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy preserved a bare-minimum mention of Italy\u2019s proposed migration plan in the communiqu\u00e9. That plan would have committed the G7 to find more permanent homes for refugees, increase financial assistance and support schooling for children and jobs for adults.Back home, the Trump administration seeks to halve the number of refugees admitted each year while pressing its travel ban, which has been struck down by federal courts and may soon wind up before the Supreme Court. It has proposed draconian budget cuts for humanitarian and development assistance, diplomacy and the United Nations \u2014 whose agencies play a key role in supporting refugees and their host communities. And Mr. Trump returned from the G7 just in time to walk away from the Paris climate accord.This completes Washington\u2019s own perilous journey: In less than one year, it has gone from mobilizing the international community in search of solutions to the migration crisis to a total abdication of leadership.Just nine months ago, President Obama convened a special leaders summit meeting on refugees during the United Nations General Assembly. Fifty-two countries made commitments to increase their financial contributions to international humanitarian organizations by $4.5 billion over 2015 levels, double the number of refugees they resettle, and improve access to education for one million refugee children and to lawful work for one million adults. As well, 50 leading American companies committed to provide education opportunities for 80,000 refugees and employment possibilities for 200,000.And the United States did more to lead by example, raising the ceiling on annual refugee admissions to 110,000, including 10,000 Syrians. That was not enough, but it was a step toward reclaiming America\u2019s place as the last best hope on earth.That hope gave life to my own family, as it did so many generations of new Americans.My father\u2019s father fled a pogrom in Russia in the early 20th century and was welcomed to the United States. So was my stepmother, who escaped as a young girl from Communist Hungary in 1950.And then there was my stepfather, one of 900 children in his school in Bialystok, Poland, but the only one to survive the Holocaust, after four years in the concentration camps.At the end of the war he made a break from a death march, into the Bavarian woods. Days later, he heard the rumbling sound of a tank and looked out from his hiding place. Instead of the dreaded swastika, he saw a five-pointed white star. He ran to the star. The tank\u2019s hatch opened and a large African-American soldier looked down at him. He fell to his knees and said the only three words in English that he knew, taught to him by his mother: God bless America. The G.I. lifted him into the tank, into America, into freedom.That\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s what America represents to the world, however imperfectly. And that\u2019s what we now risk losing, piece by piece, with an administration that would keep that tank hatch slammed shut.Advertisement"}

After two and a half hours, I turned around, defeated.That was years ago, but President Trump\u2019s infrastructure rollout this week brought the memory back to me.When politicians talk about infrastructure, people generally think of roads and bridges. But these are just a part of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, and not necessarily the most important part for millions of poor and working-class Americans who have limited access to public transportation, broadband and even clean water. If we\u2019re going to talk about how infrastructure can get America back to work, Mr. Trump needs to think beyond concrete and steel spans.Increasing broadband access would help people throughout the country, especially in rural communities. We\u2019re leaving those communities behind by refusing to adequately invest in the modern-day infrastructure they need.On the campaign trail, the president promised to fix roads, bridges and airports. His proposals so far have focused on private investment and development to spur new projects. But private investment works only where there is quick money to be made; it does nothing for those in underserved and low-income areas.Instead of making the rich richer and well-off areas better off, a smart infrastructure investment plan would focus on vulnerable communities, making strategic improvements to benefit a greater number of people.Like curb cuts, expanded broadband, clean water systems, improved public transportation \u2014 and yes, better roads and bridges \u2014 that lift up the most vulnerable among us actually lift us all up. These investments can create a nimbler work force, better educated society and healthier families.We cannot let the Trump administration champion a shortsighted infrastructure plan that primarily serves the wealthy. Democratic leaders must block any legislation that does not prioritize those most in need. Anything short of a forward-looking, equitable infrastructure plan would be a road to nowhere.Angela Glover Blackwell is the chief executive of PolicyLink, a research and advocacy group focused on racial and economic equity.Advertisement"}

That was Trump\u2019s decision to tear up the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade deal in his first week in office \u2014 clearly without having read it or understanding its vast geo-economic implications.(Trump was so ignorant about TPP that when he was asked about it in a campaign debate in November 2015 he suggested that China was part of it, which it very much is not.)Trump simply threw away the single most valuable tool America had for shaping the geo-economic future of the region our way and for pressuring China to open its markets. Trump is now trying to negotiate trade openings with China alone \u2014 as opposed to negotiating with China as the head of a 12-nation TPP trading bloc that was based on U.S. values and interests and that controlled 40 percent of the global economy.It is hard to think of anything more stupid. And China\u2019s trade hard-liners are surely laughing in their sleeves.\u201cWhen Trump did away with TPP, all your allies\u2019 confidence in the U.S. collapsed,\u201d a senior Hong Kong official told me.\u201cAfter America stopped TPP, everyone is now looking to China,\u201d added Jonathan Koon-shum Choi, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong. \u201cBut China is very smart \u2014 just keeping its mouth shut.\u201dBeijing is now quietly encouraging everyone in the neighborhood to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, China\u2019s free-trade competitor to TPP, which, unlike TPP, lacks environmental or labor standards; China\u2019s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank; and its One Belt, One Road development project.Carrie Lam, the new chief executive of Hong Kong, told me that TPP countries like Australia are quickly reaching out to Hong Kong to forge closer and freer trade ties, now that the Americans have pulled TPP down. It\u2019s a \u201cpity\u201d that the Americans are leaving, she said, but \u201cthis will give our country this opportunity to lead.\u201d China is not just looking for growth, she added, but also for \u201cinfluence.\u201dJust to remind: TPP was a free-trade agreement that the Obama team forged with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.It was not only the largest free-trade agreement in history, it was the best ever for U.S. workers, closing loopholes Nafta had left open. TPP included restrictions on foreign state-owned enterprises that dumped subsidized products into our markets, intellectual property protections for rising U.S. technologies \u2014 like free access for all cloud computing services \u2014 but also anti-human-trafficking provisions that prohibited turning guest workers into slave labor, a ban on trafficking in endangered wildlife parts, a requirement that signatories permit their workers to form independent trade unions to collectively bargain and the elimination of all child labor practices \u2014 all to level the playing field with American workers.Countries like Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore made big concessions to the U.S. to be part of TPP \u2014 precisely because they wanted America embedded in their own economies, as a hedge against Chinese economic domination. A young Vietnamese businessman I met at a Wharton economic forum in Hong Kong asked me, \u201cDo we have to choose between Russia and China now?\u201dOut here everyone gets it: China has Trump\u2019s number. Its officials were afraid of him at first \u2014 with his tough trade talk. But they quickly realized how easy it was to distract him with shiny objects, like promises to defuse the North Korea threat for him or by giving stale sector-specific trade concessions, such as for American beef exports to China \u2014 things China has promised multiple presidents before \u2014 that Trump could brag about.Beijing watched Trump threaten to abandon America\u2019s adherence to the one-China policy if he did not get trade concessions \u2014 and then just fold the minute China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, said he would not take a phone call from Trump unless he reaffirmed the \u201cOne-China\u201d policy.You have to admire the Chinese combination of toughness, patience and savvy. One day I hope America again will have a president with such attributes \u2014 not a sucker for flattery, not an ignorant ideologue who rips up treaties he hasn\u2019t even read, not a made-for-television negotiator who throws his best leverage out the window \u2014 the ability to negotiate with China as the head of a trading bloc controlling 40 percent of the world\u2019s economy \u2014 before he sits down at the table.We may call him \u201cTrump\u201d in America, but here it\u2019s pronounced \u201cChump.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Democrats Regroup, Spotlight Turns to New Jersey Governor\u2019s Race", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNION CITY, N.J. \u2014 The door cracked open slightly, about as far as the chain lock allowed, and Philip D. Murphy hunched over to peer inside.\u201cDo you think there\u2019s some trepidation with these families opening their door given the age of Donald Trump and deportation?\u201d he asked, addressing no one in particular.While a handful of congressional and mayoral special elections have attracted outsize national attention, Mr. Murphy is vying for one of the two big statewide electoral prizes this year following Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.In a party searching for direction in the populist era sparked by Mr. Trump, Mr. Murphy is something of a throwback to the pre-Occupy Wall Street period. A former Goldman Sachs banker who won his first political job \u2014 ambassador to Germany \u2014 by raising millions of dollars for the Democratic Party, he looks at first glance more like a traditional Democrat.As he seeks to navigate a party confronting anti-Wall Street populism and the liberalism embodied by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Murphy, 59, has opted to steer an uneasy course, somewhere to the left of Hillary Clinton but bearing right of Mr. Sanders.\u201cI think we\u2019ve done a really good job of avoiding that civil war almost entirely,\u201d he said in an interview.Still, New Jersey, which hosts one of just two statewide elections in 2017, is not necessarily the best barometer of the party\u2019s future. Democratic voters significantly outnumber their Republican counterparts, Mrs. Clinton easily beat Mr. Trump here, and Mr. Murphy\u2019s November opponent, Kim Guadagno, the lieutenant governor, must deal with the fact that she served under Chris Christie, who is leaving office as one of the most unpopular governors in recent times. No matter how he frames his campaign, or whether his 23-year tenure at Goldman Sachs hurts him among liberal voters, Mr. Murphy enjoys a clear advantage in what is not considered a swing state.As for many Democrats in solidly blue territory, Mr. Murphy has seized on Mr. Trump as the ultimate rationale to cast a vote. One more Democratic governor, he tells crowds, can be a check to an out-of-control White House on issues like immigration and the environment.Other Democrats have also sought to elevate the significance of the New Jersey race. \u201cThe American people are with us, we just got to start talking to them again, and this is the man who knows how to do it,\u201d former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said at a rally for Mr. Murphy. \u201cThis is a man who will not only lead New Jersey, he will help lead America.\u201dThroughout the day, his BlackBerry buzzed incessantly with texts and emails from national political figures, including John D. Podesta, the former chairman of the Clinton campaign. At night, as Mr. Murphy was winding his way through a hotel kitchen toward the stage to deliver his victory speech, he received a congratulatory call from another major Democratic figure, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia.The next morning, as he made thank-you calls to mayors and county leaders, he fielded calls of advice and support from former President Barack Obama and Mr. Biden, and had a long phone conversation with Mrs. Clinton.Though Mr. Murphy\u2019s views lean progressive, he tempers some of the more idealistic elements of the platform with his state\u2019s budget realities.Health care is a \u201cright,\u201d he said, without missing a beat.But probably more doable at the federal level.\u201cThe problem is in New Jersey or at any state level, maybe you\u2019ve seen different math than I have, but it\u2019s jaw-droppingly expensive,\u201d he said referring to health care. \u201cAre we open to it at the state level? Absolutely. But it\u2019s billions of dollars a year.\u201dThe same goes for education. He embraces fundamental progressive ideas, like universal preschool and tuition-free community college.But only once the economy improves.\u201cIf we are able to grow at this rate, and find these sources, we\u2019re left with surpluses,\u201d he said, explaining the economic expansion he believes will take place under his policies. \u201cSo we want to also take that and the first steps toward phasing in universal pre-K and free community college.\u201dRunning alongside his progressive streak is a degree of pragmatism. He counts Lyndon B. Johnson as a political role model, along with Robert F. Kennedy. He admires Mr. Kennedy for his \u201ccalls to service,\u201d and Mr. Johnson for his accomplishments.\u201cAll that ideology is well and good, but Lyndon Johnson got stuff done,\u201d he said. \u201cThis state needs a leader who not only stands for the right things but gets stuff done.\u201dThat\u2019s why he has made what he considers his most tangible goals the priority of his potential first days in office. Those include fulfilling the state\u2019s $7.5 million commitment to Planned Parenthood, which he says is a modest sum of money, and signing into law a bill in the Democratic-controlled Legislature that would strengthen gun control.But at the top of Mr. Murphy\u2019s list is addressing New Jersey\u2019s last-place ranking among states in the amount of federal money it receives compared with the taxes it sends to Washington. He believes that can be dealt with by working more closely with the state\u2019s congressional delegation.He\u2019s also prepared to use a potential bully pulpit to try to help turn some of the vulnerable Republican seats in the state to Democrats in 2018.\u201cMacArthur and Rodney, I mean these guys know better, and they think they can get away with being one thing in New Jersey and another in Washington,\u201d he said, referring to Representatives Tom MacArthur and Rodney Frelinghuysen, adding, \u201cThese guys have to pay a political price for the votes they\u2019ve taken.\u201dThough his goal is to claim the State House in Trenton, Mr. Murphy is well aware of the bigger spotlight now shining on him, and he is projecting himself as a candidate not just with New Jersey credentials, but one who can speak to the country.As he practiced his speeches \u2014 one for victory and one for defeat \u2014 two hours before polls closed, he leaned over a chipped wooden lectern in a nondescript Newark hotel room to run a last-second addition to his speech by his staff.\u201cI want to say something about Ramadan,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to say salaam aleikum.\u201dHis aides nodded in approval.\u201cAfter I do the Dr. King \u2018judge people from the inside,\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018And in that respect, I want to wish all of our Muslim brothers and sisters tonight who are celebrating the month of Ramadan, salaam aleikum and Ramadan Mubarak.\u2019\u201dWhat went unmentioned in his speech was his tenure at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank often vilified by Mr. Sanders and the progressive movement.Mr. Murphy casts off the criticism of his tenure at the bank, which he retired from in 2003, as an obsession held by the news media and his opponents, and not by voters. He said he was surprised by the negative tone that came from his Democratic rivals late in the primary campaign.\u201cIt got nastier than I actually thought it would, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve not done this before so I\u2019m probably the least qualified person to pass judgment on this.\u201dIndeed, Ms. Guadagno immediately seized on his background as she started a \u201cMain Street, not Wall Street\u201d campaign swing across the state in the days after Tuesday\u2019s election.How his tenure as a Wall Street banker plays out in the general election remains to be seen. Mr. Murphy promises that he will not be \u201cchanging my stripes\u201d in the coming months, even though more than just the voters in New Jersey may be watching.As he practiced his speech, he paused again at a line describing when Mr. Obama named him ambassador to Germany in which he emphasized that \u201cdespite what Donald Trump thinks\u201d Germany is \u201cone of our most important and dependable allies in the world.\u201dHe turned to his top aides and, referring to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said, \u201cI got the word to Merkel I was going to say that tonight if I won.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Officers in Helicopter Attack Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rogue faction of the Venezuelan police attacked the country\u2019s Supreme Court in Caracas on Tuesday, dropping grenades from a helicopter, government officials said. It was a rare uprising by government personnel in a country that has been on edge from mass protests and economic crises.\u201cWe are nationalists, patriots and institutionalists,\u201d the man said. \u201cThis fight is not against other state security forces. It is against the impunity imposed by this government. It is against tyranny. It is against the death of young people fighting for their legitimate rights.\u201dIt was not clear if the assault resulted in any casualties or where the attackers were on Tuesday night. Despite Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s claims, it could not be determined how much support, if any, the attackers had. In any case, they did not come close to overthrowing the government.In pictures of the helicopter attack that circulated online, a man who looks like Mr. P\u00e9rez appeared to be piloting the aircraft as a second man, in a balaclava, held a sign that said, \u201cArt. 350, Libertad.\u201dExperts said it was a reference to Article 350 of the Venezuelan Constitution, which encourages people to \u201cdisown any regime, legislation or authority that runs counter to democratic principles and guarantees, or that undermines human rights.\u201dElsewhere in Caracas, opposition members of the National Assembly said they were being besieged by armed government supporters.Ernesto Villegas, Venezuela\u2019s minister of communications and information, said on national television that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had been briefed on \u201can act of violence\u201d launched from a helicopter that belongs to a law enforcement agency.Mr. Villegas characterized the event as an \u201cuprising against the republic, the Constitution.\u201dMr. Maduro condemned the attack in a televised address, calling it part of a \u201ccoup plot.\u201dHe said the assailants had launched grenades, including one that did not explode, while a \u201csocial event\u201d was taking place in the court complex. The gunmen fired from the helicopter into offices and then flew over the building, he said.\u201cThey could have left several dozen deaths,\u201d Mr. Maduro said.Mr. Maduro said \u201csooner or later, we will capture the helicopter and those who have committed this armed attack.\u201d His remark suggested the assailants were at large and in control of the aircraft.Adding to the mystery around Mr. P\u00e9rez is a 2015 Venezuelan film called \u201cMuerte Suspendida,\u201d or \u201cSuspended Death,\u201d in which he plays a police officer and is listed as a producer.The trailer tells the story of a kidnapping in which a gang armed with automatic rifles and rocket launchers captures a wealthy man at a gas station. The family pleads for the help of the police, who mount an ambitious rescue. Mr. P\u00e9rez appears at the end of the trailer, apparently part of the rescue team, emerging from water in scuba gear.\u201cA story based on true events,\u201d the trailer\u2019s opening says.The Supreme Court, the target of Tuesday\u2019s attack, has become a focus for the rallies, chiefly because its bench is stacked with allies of the president who are seen as doing his bidding.On Tuesday, the court appeared to be chipping away at the power of the attorney general\u2019s office, transferring many of its investigative abilities to Tarek Saab, a high-ranking official in Mr. Maduro\u2019s party. The move was seen at curbing the authority of Luisa Ortega, the attorney general, who has become famous during protests for openly opposing the president, the highest-ranking official to do so.In 2002, a few years after Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was elected president, senior military officers who opposed the new socialist government\u2019s policies tried to overthrow Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.But few in Venezuela saw Tuesday\u2019s attack as having any chances of immediately succeeding in its stated goals.Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Teenage Life, Streamed Live and for Profit", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookOn a recent afternoon in Los Angeles, 15-year-old Bryce Xavier went to the Olive Garden with his mom, pulled out his phone and broadcast lunch. Across the country, teenagers\u2019 phones lit up with a push notification: Bryce was live.The phone framed Bryce in close-up. His mom sat off-camera across the table; her son had really come to eat with his fans. Tens of thousands of them poured into a virtual chat room that layered over his image. A bright stream of emoji floated up the side of Bryce\u2019s face, the product of hundreds of fingers tapping the \u201clike\u201d button at the same time.In the streaming of Bryce\u2019s life, lunch is a recurring event. He calls it \u201cA Bite With Bryce.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re going on a lunch date,\u201d Bryce told me later. \u201cI go to my favorite places, and then they can become my fans\u2019 favorite places, too, through the phone screen.\u201dOnline influencers occupy the gap between celebrities and friends, and skate between mass cultural performances and moments of perceived accessibility. At wildly popular national meet-and-greet tours like Magcon and Digitour, fans can pay to claim hugs and selfies from their online idols; Live.ly digitizes that experience. It feels a little like a spontaneous fan club meeting. Videos vanish instantly, which creates a vibe of temporal exclusivity: When a favorite user goes live, it\u2019s like being invited to a show that only you and a few dozen to thousand people can see.Plus, fans can have questions and comments answered in real time. (They are often some variation of \u201cHow old are you?\u201d \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d and \u201cWill you go out with me?\u201d) All of that elevates forms of extemporaneous, unstructured play that would feel amateurish on other platforms. You\u2019ll often find groups of girls sitting on the floor, mixing up homemade slime, or boys running their hands through their hair as if they\u2019re staring into the bedroom mirror. One account trails a home\u2019s four cats as they prowl countertops and bat curtains.This has the trappings of an old capitalist trick: Create a problem, sell its solution. Live streaming isn\u2019t a repudiation of the personal brand. It\u2019s an extension of it. And on Live.ly, the stakes of the performance are heightened, because there, unlike most other teenage-centered social networks, you can actually earn money.This is a boon for online influencers like Bryce, who work hard to bring a high volume of traffic to these sites, and deserve compensation. (It\u2019s good for Musical.ly, too, which takes a 20 percent cut, and the phone\u2019s app store, which takes 30 percent.)Bryce told me that virtual gifts bring him between $100 and $1,200 a broadcast, depending on the timing and length of the show. (Brands also ship him merchandise to wear on camera.) In May, the top 10 broadcasters on Live.ly brought in an average of $16,000 each. But the monetization of Live.ly has also quickly turned it into a highly commodified zone, a frenetic virtual marketplace where social media performers angle at cashing in on their elusive celebrity status and fans shell out for the illusion of greater intimacy. Everything follows the money.On Live.ly, users pay real cash for Live.ly coins that can be traded for virtual \u201cgifts\u201d that are delivered to broadcasters midstream in the hopes of extracting some kind of recognition from them. When Bryce appears on Live.ly, fans can conjure his image in a way that feels similar to calling up a friend on FaceTime. But the fans who join the stream to interact with him are relegated to the realm of text and symbol. He\u2019s the star of the raw video; they\u2019re frantically tapping the \u201clike\u201d button and thumbing out comments that zoom past faster than he can possibly read them.That\u2019s where the coins come in. Buy a gift, and your user name will be lifted above the textual scrum, beaming a bright cartoon animation and signal that you\u2019ve paid anywhere from 5 cents to $50 for the chance to catch the broadcaster\u2019s eye. Popular live streamers can conjure expensive gifts on command by promising to recognize the most generous contributors with live shout-outs or with a social media follow.Cash donations are so central to the Live.ly community that the biggest spenders are ranked on the app, turning spending into its own competition. One day this month, the No. 1 contributor shelled out 120,000 Live.ly coins \u2014 the equivalent of around $1,200. At the meager end of the Live.ly economy, penniless teenagers toil to scrape together enough to buy the cheapest gifts. Those who can\u2019t afford to buy coins can watch 30-second ads to earn the equivalent of 1 cent in Live.ly currency \u2014 an exchange that makes the attention economy undergirding the web explicit.When animated gifts are flying, the authentic streamer is leveled into a kind of avatar who can be paid to perform certain actions. And with tens of thousands of people clamoring for recognition, it\u2019s often the simplest and least meaningful requests that end up being honored. (Bryce recently complied with a fan\u2019s request to say \u201ctoy boat\u201d 10 times.)Nowhere is this more obvious than among one particularly category of Live.ly star: kids. Across the app, children are learning to perform back flips on command or dab on cue when a big contribution comes in. One girl\u2019s parents recently live streamed her playing a game on her iPad. Another mom live streamed her child\u2019s preschool graduation.Bryce said that he looked forward to live streaming, and that \u2014 even without a regular school schedule \u2014 the biggest challenge is finding time to fit it into his day. But for Live.ly stars half his age, live streaming isn\u2019t an extracurricular activity or a career path: It\u2019s something that happens to them. There\u2019s something viscerally destabilizing about those videos, which reveal the moments when unsuspecting children at play collide with the demands of capitalist exploitation. Now that\u2019s real.Advertisement"}

Takata has promised the United States government that it will pay $125 million in compensation to victims. The costs from the recalls are continuing to rise. Takata said it could not yet estimate the scale of the liabilities that it would ultimately face, but the figure is expected to be more than $10 billion.The bankruptcy is thought to be the largest by a Japanese manufacturing company.The sale to Key Safety, a company based in Michigan but owned by a Chinese company called Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corporation, is noteworthy because Japanese politicians and officials have often cajoled domestic businesses to save competitors rather than let them fail or be scooped up by foreigners.The European Central Bank said on Friday that the banks had failed or were likely to fail \u2014 a precondition for winding them down.The two banks account for 2 percent of Italian deposits, but there was a risk that their troubles could undermine confidence in Italy\u2019s fragile financial system.The money for the rescue plan will come from a fund established by the Italian government for the banking system, which has been criticized for being at odds with officials\u2019 vows not to spend taxpayer money to save sick banks.But there was fear that imposing losses on middle-class depositors and investors, like those who bought the troubled banks\u2019 senior bonds, might drive people who suffered losses into the arms of extremist parties and add to political turmoil in the country.And there were concerns that the failure of these banks could imperil the economies of the northern Italian regions they serve.The rescue plan protects depositors from losses and will spare investors who own senior bonds in the two banks.Owners of junior bonds, which earn a higher interest rate but are riskier, will lose their money. As will shareholders in the banks, which will be liquidated. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy\u2019s second-largest bank, after UniCredit, is expected to buy the healthy operations of the two banks for a symbolic purchase price.After President Trump fired Preet Bharara as United States attorney in March, speculation swirled about Mr. Bharara\u2019s next move. Would it be to a white-shoe law firm? Would he run for office?He will become executive vice president at the company, which Vinit Bharara started in 2014, and he will host a podcast called \u201cStay Tuned with Preet.\u201dThe show will explore justice and fairness issues, as well as providing in-depth analysis on legal cases.Advertisement"}

More than half a million Kosovars live abroad and the economy is highly dependent on remittances from those expatriates, accounting for as much as 15 percent of the national economy, according to the World Bank.Hashim Thaci, a former leader of the P.D.K. who now serves in the ceremonial role of president of Kosovo, emphasized on Sunday the need to for \u201ca pro-European government that will swiftly address immediate priorities.\u201dThough Serbia and its ally Russia refuse to accept Kosovo\u2019s independence, the country is recognized by the European Union and the United States.

Before the vote, European Union officials had expressed concerns over reports last week of voter intimidation.The electoral commission estimated that 41 percent of registered voters participated in the election, down from 43 percent in the last election in 2014.Once the results are confirmed, Mr. Haradinaj and the coalition will have 45 days to try to form a government.Political analysts predict the process will be quick, because voters have made clear their desire for change.\u201cThe people are tired of political issues with their neighbors; they want to see them resolved,\u201d said Nezir Kraki, a political analyst and professor at the Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est Cr\u00e9teil. \u201cThey are tired of talking about dealing with corruption. They want to see results in that fight.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about the election in Kosovo on Sunday referred imprecisely at one point to the role that Ramush Haradinaj, whose coalition won the most votes, once played in the Kosovo Liberation Army, which fought a war for independence from Serbia in the 1990s. As noted correctly elsewhere in the article, Mr. Haradinaj was one of the group\u2019s leaders, but not its overall head.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Russia Investigation Entangled Rick Gates, a Manafort Prot\u00e9g\u00e9", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year, The Times profiled Rick Gates, the longtime Paul Manafort prot\u00e9g\u00e9 whose rapid ascent in President Trump\u2019s orbit was brought to an abrupt halt by the special counsel\u2019s investigation of the Trump presidential campaign. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, announced money-laundering charges against both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates in October. On Friday \u2014 one day after a federal grand jury handed up a superseding indictment \u2014 Mr. Gates pleaded guilty to lying to investigators in the special counsel inquiry. He will cooperate with the investigation.As investigators examine Mr. Manafort\u2019s financial and political dealings at home and abroad, they are likely to run into Mr. Gates wherever they look. During the pair\u2019s heady days in Ukraine, it was Mr. Gates who flew to Moscow for meetings with associates of Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch. His name appears on documents linked to shell companies that Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm set up in Cyprus to receive payments from politicians and businesspeople in Eastern Europe, records reviewed by The New York Times show.Following an inquiry from the Department of Justice, Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort are also now weighing whether to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act in connection with an effort in Washington several years ago to burnish the image of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.Mr. Gates said late Thursday night that federal investigators had not been in contact with him. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing and, in recent interviews, he said that criticism of him and Mr. Manafort was based on flawed news media reports and documents whose authenticity the two men question.\u201cEverything was done legally and with the approval of our lawyers,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cNothing to my knowledge was ever done inappropriately.\u201dMr. Gates\u2019s rapid ascent into Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit, and his sudden ejection from it, is just one example of how the Russia-related controversies have shaken the Trump administration. The federal investigations are also casting a harsh light on the crossroads of Washington lobbying and international deal making, where Mr. Manafort made his fortune \u2014 and Mr. Gates once hoped to follow.The investigations into Mr. Manafort\u2019s relationships overseas, Mr. Weaver said, are \u201cthe only reason Rick Gates isn\u2019t in the West Wing and why Paul Manafort doesn\u2019t have a thousand clients in Washington.\u201dThe two men met nearly three decades ago when Mr. Gates was an intern at Black, Manafort, Stone, Kelly, a high-powered Washington consulting firm.The firm specialized in running Republican campaigns and then lobbying the politicians they had helped elect. In Washington, Mr. Manafort worked to smooth the rough edges of various dictators and strongmen, among them Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Trump Organization was also a client, employing the firm to lobby the Treasury Department on casino transaction rules and to guide Mr. Trump\u2019s ill-fated New York-Washington airline venture.From an office in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, the firm was working a variation on Mr. Manafort\u2019s Washington business model. While rebranding Ukraine\u2019s Moscow-aligned president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, as a reformist candidate who favored closer ties to the European Union, they sought investment deals with politically connected industrialists in Eastern Europe. One of them was Mr. Deripaska, the Russian aluminum magnate and an ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, who has been denied a visa to the United States, apparently because of allegations linking him to organized crime \u2014 charges Mr. Deripaska has denied.When Mr. Davis left the company to manage Mr. McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign, Mr. Gates took over his duties in Eastern Europe, meeting with potential business partners, developing deals, and negotiating contracts. He often flew to London or Paris, according to a former colleague in the Kiev office, and made at least two business trips to Moscow.Foreign capitals, of course, have long been a lucrative destination for American political consultants: Big-name campaign operatives can earn a small fortune working for controversial or disreputable candidates, largely out of sight of the American news media. Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s operation boasted numerous veterans of both George W. Bush\u2019s and John Kerry\u2019s presidential campaigns.\u201cRick was Paul\u2019s business guy,\u201d said Tad Devine, a Democratic political consultant who worked with Davis Manafort on the Ukraine campaigns. (He quit in 2012, after Mr. Yanukovych jailed a former rival for the presidency.) Working for Mr. Yanukovych, Mr. Devine said, helped position Mr. Gates and his bosses to do business in the country.\u201cYou elect Yanukovych, he is going to make it a market economy, so you work to do deals and get foreign investment \u2014 and that\u2019s where the real money was,\u201d Mr. Devine said.One Davis Manafort venture, a private equity fund called Pericles, was set up to buy small companies in Russia and Eastern Europe within industries that had yet to consolidate: cable television, for example, or pharmaceutical manufacturing. The fund\u2019s biggest investor was Mr. Deripaska, the Russian oligarch.For Mr. Gates, then in his mid-30s, partnering with moguls such as Mr. Deripaska seemed like a route to the kind of financial success enjoyed by Mr. Manafort, a multimillionaire with vacation homes in the Hamptons and in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Gates had read news reports of Mr. Deripaska\u2019s problems with the State Department, but said he was not overly troubled by them; the Russian was already in business with blue-chip American firms like General Motors.In 2007, Mr. Gates and his wife traded in their $700,000 home in Richmond, Va., taking out a $1.5 million loan for a house in one of the city\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods, public records show.\u201cWe thought we had a good business model,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cWe thought we were going to be successful.\u201dMr. Manafort has insisted that the ledgers were forged and that he never received any secret cash payments. \u201cPaul\u2019s payments for his work abroad have all come through traceable wire transfers to his U.S. accounts,\u201d said Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Mr. Manafort.Davis Manafort used shell companies in Cyprus both to receive payments for its political consulting and for business investment activities. Documents reviewed by The Times show that Mr. Gates was among the employees who dealt with the Cypriot law firm that registered those companies.Mr. Gates explained that Mr. Deripaska had recommended the firm, Dr. K. Chrysostomides & Co. Five shell companies were set up to facilitate anticipated business deals with Mr. Deripaska; four others were for payments received for political consulting services in Ukraine, he said.Cyprus has long been a popular tax haven for Russian oligarchs and businesses. Mr. Gates said he was told that Davis Manafort clients had instructed the firm to use Cyprus as a financial transfer point, because American banks preferred to work with the island\u2019s European Union-regulated banks rather than those in Eastern Europe. A representative for Mr. Deripaska and his companies did not respond to questions from The New York Times. Mr. Davis, who now works at a private equity firm, did not reply to an email seeking comment.After protesters forced Mr. Yanukovych from power in early 2014, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates began looking for potential political clients elsewhere: Hungary, Uganda, and Kenya. But then another revolution began to crest \u2014 the one back home, in the Republican presidential primary.In the spring of 2016, when Mr. Trump found himself outmaneuvered in the arcane battle for Republican convention delegates, he turned to Mr. Manafort. Mr. Gates came along as his deputy \u2014 the man behind the man in charge. In a campaign known for its factionalism, Mr. Gates won over colleagues by managing the mundane but essential work of daily operations. He traveled often with Mr. Trump and forged relationships with Reince Priebus, the future chief of staff, and Brad Parscale, the campaign\u2019s digital director.\u201cWhat made him valuable was, people trusted him, No. 1, and No. 2, he was effective,\u201d said Richard F. Hohlt, a longtime Republican lobbyist who worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.Mr. Gates was soon established in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. Before the first presidential debate, he glad-handed with Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s top security adviser \u2014 now also a subject of the federal investigations \u2014 and Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino mogul. At an election night party, Mr. Gates hit it off with Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the wealthy Los Angeles investor, who hired Mr. Gates to help run Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural.After Mr. Trump was sworn in, Mr. Gates joined Mr. Parscale and other Trump aides to raise $25 million for a new pro-Trump group, America First Policies. Mr. Gates lined up office space adjacent to the Willard Hotel, a Washington power-breakfast spot, and became a frequent visitor to the White House, hoping to join the new Trump era elite.\u201cHe did it to stand on his own,\u201d Mr. Hohlt said. \u201cHe wanted his own presence with Trump.\u201dBut his work in Ukraine cast a long shadow. Amid the Russia investigations, reports on Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for Mr. Deripaska rattled colleagues at America First Policies. Mr. Gates was let go.Mr. Gates said he and Mr. Manafort were being unfairly smeared by Democrats and Mr. Trump\u2019s enemies. \u201cEverybody has tried to take these instances of anyone in the Trump orbit doing something in Russia, and then fast-forwarding however many years, and then saying it is evidence of collusion with Russia on the election,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally ridiculous and without merit.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an erroneous example in a list of locations where Paul Manafort has vacation homes. Though he has such homes in the Hamptons and in Palm Beach, Fla., he does not have one in France.An article on Saturday about how the Russia investigation entangled Rick Gates, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, referred incorrectly to work Mr. Gates and Richard Holht did on behalf of President-elect Trump. They worked on his inaugural committee; they were not part of the presidential transition team.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fifty Years of Music and Politics in Berlin, East and West", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Paul Hockenos has written a detailed, doggedly researched, personally involved history of Berlin\u2019s political and musical underground over the last 50 years. \u201cBerlin Calling\u201d should be of interest to anyone who wants to know more about the German capital\u2019s still-hip music and street politics, and to get a flavor of that turbulent city\u2019s dark history and stubborn spirit.At the same time, Hockenos leaves out so much, and deluges the innocent reader with such a plethora of undescribed bands and techno D.J.s and communes and protest movements that the book turns into something of an obsessive blur. This is a kind of Baedeker or Lonely Planet guide to underground Berlin, though as Hockenos himself writes, \u201conce it\u2019s in the travel books, it\u2019s dead.\u201d He\u2019s a serviceable writer but not an eloquent or evocative one.Yet his story remains fascinating, and he seems to have pulled together primary and secondary sources, alongside his own interviews and firsthand knowledge of the city, to tell it. He begins with a portrait of West Berlin before the Wall came down in 1989. Isolated within grim East Germany, the city became a subsidized showcase for capitalism and democracy inside the Soviet bloc, full of young West Germans fleeing what they saw as their country\u2019s hypocritical commercialism and, for the men, the draft (since residence in Berlin exempted them from military service). The result was a large community of underground music, politics, drugs and lifestyle experiments that lured foreigners along with West Germans, including the likes of David Bowie and Iggy Pop, who were drawn to a dream vision of Weimar Republic libertinism. But Bowie and Iggy also managed to make some wonderful albums while living in West Berlin. Curiously content within their bubble, the Western hipsters tended to ignore East Berlin, Hockenos writes, but in fact there was a lively if necessarily secretive scene there, too.The fall of the Wall was greeted with euphoria among young people both East and West, even if the Westerners felt their underground idyll was being threatened by exposure to the wider world and the Easterners felt patronized. Helmut Kohl\u2019s successful push for rapid German reunification looked to overwhelm Berlin\u2019s underground. Yet protest, musical and political, persisted. It was forced to the city\u2019s margins but is still alive, as of now.Hockenos tells a lot of this story well \u2014 particularly his summary of the political developments. Here he seems to have relied more on his research than firsthand experience, but he makes good use of his sources. His personal involvement with communes and squats and concerts and musicians and scene-makers is often vividly portrayed, even if he fails to really evoke the music and the personalities with writerly flair.At one point he describes the young members of an East Berlin movement called Church From Below as having \u201cfused counterculture and politics so tightly that it was impossible to pry them apart.\u201d That\u2019s justification for his narrow focus, but it ignores so much of what made and still makes Berlin exciting. Yes, depressing East Berlin had a secretive rock scene unknown to most West Berliners. But it also had brilliant writers and thrilling opera and theater (Hockenos mentions in passing the Swiss stage director Benno Besson, long active in the East, but ignores so much more). High culture was vital in West Berlin, too, and interacted more fluidly with the underground than Hockenos allows. In the 2000s, was the West Berlin left really so cold and dogmatic as portrayed here? Were the eastern Berlin post-Wall squatters so nobly creative? And while it might have diffused his story, was all of Berlin\u2019s \u201chigh art\u201d (museums, opera, classical concerts, theater, dance) so utterly irrelevant to young Berliners from the \u201970s to now? (He\u2019s a little better on film.) Even within his chosen scene, Hockenos seems to slight much, as when he refers to \u201cthe ethnic politics of Berlin\u2019s violent underground\u201d without pursuing the matter.In describing a mass demonstration on the eve of the Wall\u2019s fall, he concedes that his underground participants amounted to \u201can inconspicuous fleck\u201d in the multitude of 500,000 people who had gathered in the Alexanderplatz. He also says that the left\u2019s idealism about a new kind of democratic socialism was \u201csteamrolled by the nationalist juggernaut.\u201dDo we need a whole book about a steamrolled fleck? Maybe. Later on, with a life partner and a son, living in formerly radical, now gentrified Prenzlauer Berg just east of the old Wall, surrounded by his friends in the \u201ccreative class\u201d that has contributed much to Berlin\u2019s shaky economy, he strikes a more optimistic tone. Always suspicious of the troublemaking anarchists, he concludes that his underground musicians and life-style experimenters didn\u2019t sell out; they \u201cchallenged the status quo \u2014 and changed it, inspiring others along the way.\u201d Even if diluted, the underground exerted a beneficent influence, Hockenos believes. \u201cThe subculture\u2019s loss is the mainstream\u2019s gain. It becomes broader, richer, more hybrid.\u201d With its evocations of that hybrid scene, \u201cBerlin Calling\u201d can serve as a Baedeker for those eager to visit Berlin and to experience its still lively spirit for themselves.John Rockwell, The Times\u2019s rock critic in the 1970s, wrote his doctoral dissertation on left-wing opera reform in Berlin in the 1920s and has lived in or regularly visited the city for the last 71 years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: White House Looks to Defang Financial Watchdog", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration has offered its most detailed plans to date for the unraveling of financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.In a report issued on Monday, the Treasury said that the president should be able to remove the bureau\u2019s director and recommended greater exemptions from the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d which bans banks from trading for their own gain.The report also called for relief from regulatory scrutiny, such as stress tests for community banks.The plan sets up a clash between President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was her brainchild.According to the Treasury report, \u201cThe C.F.P.B. was created to pursue an important mission, but its unaccountable structure and unduly broad regulatory powers have led to predictable regulatory abuses and excesses.\u201d\u201cThe C.F.P.B.\u2019s approach to rule making and enforcement has hindered consumer access to credit, limited innovation and imposed unduly high compliance burdens, particularly on small institutions,\u201d the report added.Critics argue that the plan would put the economy at risk.\u201cWe need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.Chief executives say they\u2019re optimistic about the economy and about the prospect of lower regulation and lower tax.And investors have bid up the stock market.Usually, when corporate leaders are confident, they do deals.But that has not happened since Mr. Trump was elected. In fact, the number of mergers have fallen off a cliff.Bellwether companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google led a two-day sell-off, after a relentless three-year ascent.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dUBS published a research report noting the heavy influence of these stocks on investor portfolios. Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far the stocks had run. Two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple.Hedge funds could be bailing out, too.The question now is whether retail investors will stick with them.The group of Uber executives that formed the inner circle around Travis Kalanick, the chief executive, is fraying.The A-Team, as it was informally known, shared Mr. Kalanick\u2019s aggressive approach and helped him barrel into new markets around the world.\u2022 Emil Michael, Uber\u2019s senior vice president for business and its second in command, left the company.\u2022 Eric Alexander, a top executive in Asia, was fired for mishandling the rape case of an Uber passenger in India.\u2022 Thuan Pham, Uber\u2019s chief technology officer, is under scrutiny for what many see as his shortcomings in listening to employee complaints.Uber staff members who sell even part of their stock back to the company under a repurchase program must give the voting rights associated with all their shares to Mr. Kalanick, according to a copy of the buyback agreement obtained by The New York Times.That voting power is crucial as the ride-hailing service wrestles with its issues and as the board considers whether Mr. Kalanick should take a three-month leave of absence.Even if he took time off, his ability to influence the direction of the company would appear to be secure, thanks to his \u201csuper-voting shares.\u201dAnd employees must follow the \u201cinstructions of Travis Kalanick,\u201d according to the buyback agreement, \u201cwith respect to any and all matters\u201d that are submitted to a shareholder vote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Two Paths Arise for Democrats in Race for Virginia\u2019s Governor", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEESBURG, Va. \u2014 Tom Perriello acknowledges that he is running the most progressive campaign for governor in modern Virginia history. He speaks stirringly about undocumented immigrants who fear deportation and transgender teenagers who face a \u201cbullier in chief,\u201d while vowing to put \u201ccommunity policing ahead of paramilitary policing\u201d and to confront the state\u2019s utility giant.At a Loudoun County Democrats meeting last week in this booming Washington exurb, it was easy to see why leading liberals such as Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have endorsed the upstart candidate.Yet while Mr. Perriello\u2019s call to arms drew an enthusiastic ovation, it did not sway Matt Leslie, who long ago committed to Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the other Democrat in the race. Mr. Northam came to Loudoun County two years ago to raise money for Mr. Leslie\u2019s boss, a member of the county board.\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to pull out some new voters if he\u2019s going to catch up with the lead Northam has,\u201d Mr. Leslie said.The closely contested primary, which will be decided on June 13, has emerged as the most significant intraparty Democratic contest yet in the Trump era. Mr. Perriello, a one-term House member who was turned out in 2010, is testing whether party activists in a tradition-bound state that typically rewards political moderation will respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency by rallying to the candidate mounting the most unapologetically liberal and Trump-focused campaign.The race has assumed importance beyond Virginia\u2019s borders because it will offer broader insights into the nature of politics today: How much, or how little, do traditional markers of strength, like endorsements, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and fund-raising, even matter in statewide elections?\u201cIf we can show that they have unleashed a new political energy in key swing states like Virginia, some of those Republicans in Congress will start to distance themselves from the hate and bigotry and, frankly, incompetence of the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Perriello implored the Loudoun Democrats.New Jersey is the only other state electing a governor this year, but it is Virginia, which has swung toward Democrats in presidential races yet remains competitive down the ballot, that will be looked to as an early barometer for how voters respond to the political scene across the Potomac River.The winner of the Democratic contest will most likely face Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chair and Washington lobbyist, in the general election.By the traditional rules of primaries, Mr. Northam should not be vulnerable to a challenger. He has the endorsement of every Democratic statewide officeholder and state legislator in Virginia, as well as powerful interest groups like Naral Pro-Choice America and the Virginia Education Association. He has raised more money, and he has effectively been running for governor since being sworn in as lieutenant governor four years ago, appearing at 180 events for other Democrats and picking up countless chits along the way.And since state law bans the sitting governor, currently the Democrat Terry McAuliffe, from seeking a second consecutive term, Mr. Northam is effectively the incumbent.But Mr. Perriello, who has found over half of his campaign financing from out-of-state, is betting that his party is hungry for something more than continuity in the Trump era.\u201cWhen Democrats run on change, we win,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we run on the status quo, we generally lose.\u201dA former state senator, Mr. Northam, 57, is not running as a moderate alternative to Mr. Perriello, 42, but as a consensus-oriented insider who knows his way around Richmond, the state capital.\u201cThe next governor has to hit the ground running, they need to have an agenda of what they want to get done, and they\u2019ve got to have relationships with legislators and know how to get things done,\u201d Mr. Northam told a group of progressive activists gathered near Mount Vernon last week.\u201cThis is an election for the next governor of Virginia,\u201d he continued in response to question about his opponent\u2019s out-of-state supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Vermont.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s decision to wade in for Mr. Perriello not only offered a contrast to the deep establishment support Mr. Northam enjoys, it also prompted suggestions that the clash was evolving into a replay of last year\u2019s Democratic presidential primary.But this contest may better resemble an earlier presidential nomination fight: the epic contest between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\u201cThe closest comparison is the \u201908 race in terms of a candidate with institutional support versus the insurgent,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a national Democratic strategist reared in Richmond.Mr. Perriello\u2019s backers, not surprisingly given the 2008 results, welcome the analogy. The one-time congressman lost his seat largely for embracing the Obama agenda, and his comeback effort bears echoes of the former president whose State Department he worked for in recent years. Mr. Perriello calls for a new politics beyond traditional left-and-right lines and dismisses what he calls a lazy \u201c\u201990s mind-set\u201d about what is and is not possible. The primary, he said, is turning on \u201cwhether we need small change or big change.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve actually been talking about the issues of automation and the monopolization of the economy,\u201d Mr. Perriello said in an interview, \u201cand the number of times the media covers that has been next to zero because it\u2019s a new set of issues they don\u2019t understand.\u201dBut Mr. Obama ultimately bested Mrs. Clinton because, unlike anti-establishment candidates in other Democratic primaries, including Senator Sanders, he was able to forge a coalition that linked educated white progressives and black voters.Mr. Perriello has yet to prove that he can do the same, and the biggest impediment to his doing so has been Mr. Obama himself. While he stands by his praise of the former lawmaker from a 2010 rally, video that Mr. Perriello has made into an ad, Mr. Obama does not want to create a precedent of engaging in primaries and has denied Mr. Perriello a coveted endorsement.In a sign of how potent a force Mr. Obama remains with African-Americans, and the degree to which he could have upended the race, Mr. Northam telephoned former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to ensure the former president\u2019s neutrality, according to three Democrats briefed on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Acknowledging the conversation, Mr. Northam said he told Mr. Holder, a close friend of the former president, that he had been the second elected official in Virginia (after then-Gov. Tim Kaine) to endorse Mr. Obama in the run-up to the 2008 primary. (In fact, other Virginia Democrats backed Mr. Obama before Mr. Northam.)\u201cI just reminded Attorney General Holder that I had been very loyal, as has my wife, too, to President Obama,\u201d Mr. Northam said. \u201cThat message got back to him.\u201dWithout Mr. Obama\u2019s backing, Mr. Perriello has scrambled to appeal to African-Americans, who could make up about a third of the primary vote, with a robust economic and criminal justice agenda. He is wagering that the \u201cinstitutional gatekeepers\u201d in Virginia\u2019s black community have no more clout than those African-American leaders who backed Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Obama in 2008.But Mr. Perriello allows that he is no Barack Obama, and he has bowed to some of those same gatekeepers.He appeared last month at a black church in the suburbs of Richmond, a crucial battleground, and surprised the pastor by staying for the entire service. Tyrone E. Nelson, the minister at Sixth Mount Zion Baptist, had already endorsed Mr. Northam.\u201cIn central Virginia, as it relates to African-Americans, they just don\u2019t really know Tom,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.That is the other key way this race differs from a presidential primary: Statewide primaries can turn on relationships or connections to the candidates themselves.This is particularly the case in an odd-year primary held in June, when colleges have emptied out for the summer and many voters are on vacation. Mr. Perriello is cognizant of his challenge in a friends-and-neighbors primary. He is hoping to broaden the electorate beyond the 319,000 voters who cast ballots in 2009, the last time Virginia Democrats had a contested campaign for governor.\u201cWhen we started the race, we thought if we changed the electorate we would win, with the old electorate we lose,\u201d Mr. Perriello said. \u201cNow if we change the electorate we definitely win, and with the old electorate we\u2019re at about 50-50.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "There Goes the Gayborhood", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPride 2017SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The artist John Criscitello of Seattle first became angry a few years ago about the changes in his beloved neighborhood, Capitol Hill, historically the city\u2019s enclave for gay men and lesbians. The area had become decidedly more straight and, in his view, infuriatingly obnoxious.\u201cOn Friday and Saturday nights, it\u2019s like Mardi Gras,\u201d Mr. Criscitello said. He called the area \u201ca puke-and-leave drinking destination\u201d for the city\u2019s young heterosexuals, who seemingly have little regard for, and some hostility toward, the gay people who have lived there since the 1960s.So Mr. Criscitello responded with art, creating a series of provocative and sometimes vulgar street murals that excoriated the invading masses as homophobic and insensitive.\u201cI wanted to poke a stick at the beehive of what was going on,\u201d he said.Similar culture clashes are playing out across the nation in historically gay districts, nicknamed gayborhoods. Places like Greenwich Village in Manhattan and the Castro district in San Francisco, once incubators for the gay rights movement, have \u201cstraightened\u201d in recent decades, leading to incidents of resistance and some angst about the effects on the L.G.B.T.Q. community.The changes are due in large part to the increased expense that comes with the rising popularity and gentrification of many inner cities. But growing acceptance, legally and societally, of the L.G.B.T.Q. community is also responsible. Less discrimination means more options of where to live, and many residents, especially millennials, no longer believe they must huddle among their own kind to survive and thrive.Not long ago, gay men and lesbians had to create their own communities for safety and opportunity.\u201cThe concentration of young gay men and lesbians in urban centers altered their cultural imagination,\u201d Mr. Ghaziani wrote. \u201cBars that catered to them opened in larger numbers, and, over time, the first formal gay neighborhoods, or gayborhoods as we now call them, emerged.\u201dAs news of these neighborhoods spread, they became magnets. It was a phenomenon called the Great Gay Migration, a phrase coined by the anthropologist Kath Weston.Cleve Jones, the longtime gay civil rights activist and creator of the AIDS quilt, was part of this diaspora, moving to San Francisco from Arizona in 1973. He found relative safety, acceptance and a diversity that had been forged by America\u2019s open enmity toward gay men and lesbians.\u201cWhen I came to San Francisco, all of us, regardless of skin color, or ethnicity, or economic status or gender, we were all criminals \u2014 in the eyes of the law, we were all unapprehended felons,\u201d Mr. Jones said in an interview. \u201cIn many cities it was illegal for us to even gather. That outlaw status broke down many of the barriers that exist in the larger society.\u201dThese initial gayborhoods offered the first opportunities for many to interact openly with people of the same sexual orientation. The concentration of gay men and lesbians also created political clout, Mr. Jones said.Such a dense community could be rallied: In San Francisco, it helped elect Harvey Milk to the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors in 1977. He had the highest profile among openly gay candidates at the time, and his election was a watershed in the national struggle for gay rights.The seeds sown back then have led to greater tolerance and new rights, including marriage equality. Acceptance also means a growing number of heterosexuals have no qualms about sharing a neighborhood with gay men and lesbians.But the main force driving the changes in the nation\u2019s gayborhoods is economic.The Castro, in San Francisco, for example, had been somewhat abandoned by a working class exodus to the suburbs, creating an opening in the 1970s for gay and lesbian residents. Today the area is one of the most expensive residential districts in the nation. The average single-family home there sells for more than $2 million, according to a 2016 report compiled by the Paragon Real Estate Group, which studies the neighborhood. Market-rate two-bedroom apartments rent for about $4,400 a month, according to Rent Jungle, a company that tracks rents.\u201cCities are changing in a very profound and new way,\u201d Mr. Jones said, \u201cwith the rich claiming the inner cities.\u201dMr. Criscitello said gay residents there were priced out and outnumbered as thousands of new housing units were built in response to the booming local tech economy. New residents tend to be \u201cheavily straight and heavily male,\u201d Mr. Criscitello said, and able to pay higher rents.\u201cIt would be na\u00efve for us to presume that gay neighborhoods were somehow protected from the tides of change that affect all other neighborhoods in all other cities,\u201d Mr. Ghaziani said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201dBut as many longtime gayborhoods change, others are emerging or growing. Mr. Jones said Palm Springs, Calif., had transformed in recent decades into a popular retirement community with housing less expensive than in San Francisco.In Chicago\u2019s Boystown, gentrification has replaced some gay-centric retail stores with more mainstream offerings. But in the neighborhood of Andersonville, a few miles north, the number of gay bars and businesses has increased in recent years. And just outside the city, the Village of Oak Park has become a destination for same-sex couples with children, a type of gayborhood few would have imagined in years past.Efforts are also being made in places not well known for tolerance of gay men and lesbians. The group LGBT Detroit has established a new community center in the city\u2019s Murray Hill neighborhood. \u201cWe\u2019re in the business of changing some hearts and minds,\u201d said Curtis Lipscomb, the group\u2019s executive director, noting that people should not have to run off to San Francisco or New York City to be gay. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t leave family to be free,\u201d he said.In Providence, R.I., a section of the city\u2019s downtown is strewed with rainbow banners on utility poles, advertising its gayborhood of bars and cafes. Plans are also in the works for an L.G.B.T.Q. community center.\u201cThere\u2019s a very large craving to have a space where you can meet like-minded people,\u201d said Davide Gnoato, board president of Rhode Island Pride.Mr. Ghaziani referred to these new efforts as \u201ccultural archipelagos.\u201d He warned that gay men and lesbians still face discrimination. But, he said, \u201cPlurality is the name of the new game,\u201d as shown by newly emerging gayborhoods.Still, some worry that much could be lost as the old famed gayborhoods become watered-down versions of their former selves. Political clout, services and opportunities could be diminished.\u201cThis is not about nostalgia,\u201d Mr. Jones said.He bemoaned a lack of thoughtful conversation about the issue. \u201cThe gayborhoods are going away,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere do we go now? The old ways of organizing and defending ourselves are being changed. What are the new strategies?\u201dAnd those raising concerns are struggling to be heard. In Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill, there are few remaining neglected buildings for Mr. Criscitello\u2019s protest murals, and when they do go up, \u201cthey\u2019re taken down immediately,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Occupy Wall Street and the Bernie Sanders campaign are lodestars. But Mr. Camp covers many of the same topics (net neutrality, global warming) that John Oliver and Samantha Bee do, except that is, when it comes to Russia.Mr. Camp\u2019s hard-edge critique of corporate greed and American policy is genuine; he was taking this line in his stand-up act before working for RT. But context matters.Liz Wahl is a former journalist for RT who quit on air, accusing the network of \u201cwhitewashing the actions of Putin\u201d in its coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ms. Wahl calls Mr. Camp a \u201cstooge\u201d and told me that his comedy plays into the channel\u2019s disinformation campaign.\u201cThe tactic is to use American anger against itself,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know our divides and aim to make them bigger. To make the angry angrier and the paranoid more paranoid, to push people to extremes.\u201dSquirming in his chair, Mr. Camp abruptly pivoted to a critique of American foreign policy: \u201cWe\u2019re blowing people up.\u201dMs. Wahl said it was precisely this kind of comment that made him useful to RT. \u201cIt creates the notion that we have no position to assert any moral authority,\u201d she said. \u201cIt serves the Russian narrative.\u201dBefore he worked for RT, Mr. Camp was a mainstay of the New York comedy scene who had written for The Onion and toured abroad, with a solo show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe called \u201cYet Another American Mistake.\u201d According to several people in the comedy scene, his stand-up diatribes succeeded with like-minded fans but had more trouble with crowds that didn\u2019t share his point of view. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t book him for a weekend, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d said Cris Italia, one of the owners of the New York comedy club the Stand.Last month, Mr. Camp returned to New York to perform with two fellow stand-ups. \u201cIn Trump\u2019s America, I feel freer,\u201d he said archly at the Cutting Room, a small East Side concert space, before explaining that even if he were to defecate onstage, it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be the craziest thing you see all week.\u201dHe was funniest at his most cynical, describing everyone as replaceable in our economy, including himself. \u201cMy job?\u201d he said with a Dennis Miller twang. \u201cIt can be replaced by a mop, a joke book and a sense of disillusionment.\u201dAt one point, a fan interrupted his set, yelling, \u201cDraft Bernie Sanders!\u201d Mr. Camp looked momentarily thrown off guard. Then the heckler started cursing about the Democratic National Committee.\u201cI hear you, but I\u2019m just trying to do a comedy show here.\u201d Mr. Camp responded, employing Mr. Stewart\u2019s old tactic of deflecting political comments by saying he\u2019s just a comic looking for laughs. Mr. Camp pointed at the door and said, \u201cYou can have the rally after the show.\u201dOnce Mr. Camp finished and the crowd had filed out, I lingered for a minute on the sidewalk. And while there wasn\u2019t any rally, I couldn\u2019t help noticing two beefy guys speaking in Russian and laughing uproariously.An article last Thursday about the comedian Lee Camp, host of the comedy news show \u201cRedacted Tonight\u201d on the RT America network, described incorrectly the departure of an employee at the network, Liz Wahl. She was a journalist for the network during the gestation of \u201cRedacted Tonight,\u201d but quit the network before \u2014 not after \u2014 the show\u2019s premiere. The article also described incorrectly two comedians who performed with Mr. Camp at a stand-up show at the Cutting Room last month.

American companies and citizens will be barred from doing business with firms controlled by the Cuban military or its intelligence services, thus denying Americans access to critical parts of the Cuban economy, including much of the tourism sector.Mr. Trump\u2019s policy rests on a cynical and historically bogus foundation. The aim, he says, is to force Cuban leaders to end repression, embrace democracy and open their economy. \u201cWe will not be silent in the face of Communist oppression any longer,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Obama\u2019s brief d\u00e9tente has only empowered the Communist government and enriched the military. But 50 years of isolationist, hard-line sanctions never produced the ouster of Cuba\u2019s Communist regime that anti-Castro activists had hoped for.Mr. Trump\u2019s sudden concern for human rights is particularly hard to swallow. No recent president has been so disdainful of these rights or embraced so lovingly authoritarians who abuse their people, like Vladimir Putin of Russia and the Saudi royal family.About the best that can be said is that his reversal is not as bad as it might have been. Embassies in Washington and Havana will stay open, direct flights between the two countries will continue, and Cuban-Americans will still be able to travel freely to Cuba and send money to relatives there.That\u2019s little comfort, given Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh tone. The president leaves real questions about the future of bilateral agreements on health care cooperation, joint planning to mitigate oil spills, coordination on counternarcotics efforts and intelligence-sharing \u2014 and real questions about a truly productive relationship with an old adversary that Mr. Trump seems determined to turn into a new one.Advertisement"}

The hope, shared by Cuban-Americans who harbor a deep resentment of the Castro government, is to encourage a more democratic state that upholds human rights and holds free fair elections.Under the new restrictions, Americans will no longer be able to travel to Cuba on their own, and educational tours will be subject to strict new rules and audits.American companies and individuals will also be barred from doing business with any firm controlled by the Cuban military or its intelligence or security services. Much of the tourist industry is controlled by the military.But the move to inhibit the flow of American tourism and investment will certainly have an effect on the Cuban economy \u2014 as well as the entrepreneurs making livings in the tourism industry. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said that kind of pressure had not succeeded in the past and would not work now.\u201cThe measures announced will not accomplish their declared objectives, to the contrary,\u201d he said. \u201cThese measures do not recognize the overwhelming majority opinion of the Cuban people that want to have a better relationship with the American people.\u201dThey will have an economic impact not only in the state-owned companies, but also the cooperatives and private business owners,\u201d he added.Since relations have been restored and Americans have been allowed to visit, Cuba\u2019s private sector has flourished, with new restaurants and private homes being rented on Airbnb.Among Mr. Trump\u2019s demands of the Cuban government was to extradite Americans fugitives living in Cuba who are wanted for crimes committed in the United States.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Real Estate Mirage", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than just a place to live, private housing in the past two decades came to underpin the aspirations of urban Chinese. Homeownership, especially in cities, proved to be a reliable investment outlet. The skyrocketing values of housing have been providing money for sickness and old age in a country where the state has largely dismantled the welfare system. Real estate profits have allowed parents to finance their children\u2019s education abroad.But the impressive size and wealth of the propertied class belies the growing strains plaguing new home buyers. The country now has some of the least affordable housing markets in the world. The ratio of median home price to median income, a common measure of affordability, in most first-tier cities has soared to higher than that of London.To cool the markets, local governments have issued myriad purchasing restrictions, like requiring high down payments and banning the purchase of multiple apartments. The proliferation of red tape, together with the increasingly unaffordable real estate, has become a potent symbol of the thwarted economic hopes and the dwindling social mobility that characterize today\u2019s urban China.In newspapers and dinner table conversations, stories abound of husbands and wives filing fake divorces to get around stringent real estate purchasing restrictions for families. There are also tales of acrimonious disputes between the parents of divorcing couples when both sets claim ownership of the couple\u2019s apartment because they contributed to the purchase. Recently, more than 10,000 home buyers in Beijing found themselves stuck in financial limbo when the government suddenly increased down payment requirements after they had agreements to buy, leaving them short overnight.Nowhere are home buyers\u2019 struggles better reflected than in the saga surrounding \u201cschool-district apartments.\u201d Homeownership guarantees owners access to public schools, and the fierce competition among parents for apartments near highly valued schools has long been considered a culprit of the exorbitant housing prices in prosperous metropolises. In certain areas in Beijing, families are now asked to own homes for at least three years before they can qualify for local schools.Exasperated by the bureaucratic shackles, a growing number of the wealthy Chinese people are turning their eyes abroad, to homes in suburban America or luxury condos in Australia. According to a survey by the National Association of Realtors, the Chinese rank first among foreign nationals buying property in the United States. Their spending, at $27.3 billion for the year ending March 2016, exceeds the combined total of the next four countries in the ranking.To address the overheated housing market, city governments should stop relying on stopgap measures that encumber urban residents and just exacerbate the problem over time. Instead, they need to devise long-term structural solutions, such as delinking housing and public services like schooling, or increasing the subsidized-housing supply, to fix market imbalances.The best solution may also prove to be the most controversial. Implementation of a property tax, many advocates believe, will bring down prices by making speculative purchases more costly. Bringing it to fruition will require governments to overcome vested political and corporate interests, as well as adopting a measured approach to avoid causing a market crash.Among those people left to confront the housing market, there is a prevailing sense that the rules of economic reform have changed. Many Chinese people believe that \u201chard work alone leads to success,\u201d Xu Jin, an economics editor at FTChinese, wrote in a recent column. \u201cBut they are having a harder time believing the same for their children.\u201dRural migrant workers living in cities \u2014 who account for more than a third of the population in Beijing and in Shanghai \u2014 are by and large excluded from the local housing markets because of their nonnative residential status. It means they have missed out on one of the largest wealth transfers from the state to the people.That is why when the government declared its decision in April to build a new special economic zone, equal in status to the southern economic hub of Shenzhen, on a piece of rural land roughly 80 miles south of Beijing, local villagers reacted with elation. Suddenly their humble villages seemed to be on the verge of a real estate boom like those they\u2019ve witnessed in neighboring cities.In less than a day, local average apartment prices tripled. But two days later, Beijing banned housing sales in the region.Helen Gao is a social policy analyst at a research company and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

He announced the proposal in a conquering-hero-returns speech in Iowa, his first trip back to the political battleground state since his inauguration.And he \u2014 mostly \u2014 managed to avoid raising the topic he struggles to stop talking about: the investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with his campaign.\u201cThey have phony witch hunts going against me,\u201d Mr. Trump said nearly an hour into a speech that veered off script repeatedly. \u201cAll we do is win, win, win. We won last night.\u201dThe rally, Mr. Trump\u2019s first since the end of April, served as a venting session for a pent-up president who has stewed and brooded from inside the gilded cage of the White House over attacks from investigators, Democrats and the news media, his interview schedule drastically pared down and his aides imploring him to stay off Twitter.Style-heavy and substance-light, the speech went over an hour: an epic version of the fact-challenged, meandering and, even for his detractors, mesmerizing speeches he gave during his upstart presidential campaign.Mr. Trump gave few details about his plan for the solar panels, beyond that it creates \u201cenergy and pays for itself,\u201d or about his coming proposal to greatly curtail welfare for new immigrants \u2014 including how it would differ from existing laws that do just that. He called it a \u201ctotal rewrite of our immigration system into a merit-based system,\u201d words consistent with the public tone he has struck on immigration restrictions.The president, whose approval rating is mired below 40 percent, told the crowd of roughly 6,000 people at the U.S. Cellular Center that he was thrilled to be out of the \u201cWashington swamp.\u201dFree from his handlers for roughly 70 minutes, Mr. Trump described his administration as he wished it to be: one in which he had made historic governing accomplishments and been stymied solely by the \u201cresistance.\u201d\u201cI think health care is going to happen, and infrastructure is going to happen, and I look forward to being able to produce it,\u201d he said.He derided trade deals despite an Iowa economy that relies in part on exports. He denounced the $6 trillion spent and the lives lost in the Middle East over the last 15 years, despite his administration\u2019s decision to reauthorize troops in Afghanistan.He toggled back and forth between telling farm-rich Iowa that he had fought for forgotten voters and lauding the wealth of Gary D. Cohn, his top economic adviser and a former executive at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street giant that Mr. Trump derided in commercials in 2016.\u201cIn those particular positions, I just don\u2019t want a poor person \u2014 does that make sense?\u201d he said of Mr. Cohn\u2019s job and that of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, another immensely wealthy man whom Mr. Trump lauded as a \u201clegendary Wall Street genius.\u201d\u201cBrilliant business minds\u201d are what the economy needs, he said.And the president frequently embellished details during his speech, or told outright falsehoods. He tried to catch himself at one point, saying, \u201cI have to be a little careful, because they\u2019ll say, \u2018He lied!\u2019\u201d\u201cLike hell it\u2019s nonbinding!\u201d thundered Mr. Trump, who in fact called the accord nonbinding in his Rose Garden speech announcing the withdrawal this month.\u201cWe\u2019re not even campaigning, and look at this crowd!\u201d he said at another point. The rally was advertised, sponsored and organized by his campaign committee.He also repeated his frequent, untrue campaign refrain that the United States is one of the world\u2019s highest-taxed nations.And he vented throughout against the news media: \u201cthe fake news,\u201d he said, one of his favorite and most therapeutic invocations.Mr. Trump also condemned Democrats as \u201cobstructionists\u201d \u2014 but then added that he wanted to work with them and might be damaging those prospects. \u201cBut who cares,\u201d he concluded. He ignored the fact that Republicans hold majorities in Congress.When he mentioned Hillary Clinton, the crowd lustily chanted, \u201cLock her up,\u201d as if the election had not taken place.It was the first trip Mr. Trump had taken west of the Mississippi River since he became president. His opening acts included his pregnant daughter-in-law, Lara, who is married to his son Eric. She suggested that complaints against the president were generated by people who \u201care very scared of what he\u2019s going to do.\u201dJeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, took an unusual shot at Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, a frequent Trump critic who has himself been perceived as a potential presidential candidate.Throughout the arena, Mr. Trump\u2019s fans were adamant about whom they blamed for his troubles.\u201cWhat I\u2019m frustrated about, and I hear this, that people are saying he\u2019s not doing anything \u2014 how can you do something if people are resisting?\u201d said Wendy Lemke, 65, of Cedar Falls.After Mr. Trump had talked for over 60 minutes, diverting from his teleprompter repeatedly, he decided to wrap it up. Someone in the crowd yelled that they did not want him to go.\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave, either!\u201d Mr. Trump called back.An article on Thursday about President Trump\u2019s rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Wednesday, referred incorrectly to his return to the state. The trip was his first since the inauguration, not since the election.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Adds More Trademarks in China", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 President Trump is poised to add six new trademarks to his expanding portfolio in China, in sectors including veterinary services and construction, potentially renewing concerns about his possible conflicts of interest.The latest trademarks expand Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy and a country he frequently blamed during the election campaign for the decline in American industrial jobs. Since taking office, he has softened that rhetoric.He has nevertheless continued to receive approval in China for new trademarks. The country\u2019s trademark office gave the president preliminary approval for six trademarks on June 6, according to the agency\u2019s website.Under Chinese law, a trademark with preliminary approval is formally registered after three months if the agency receives no objections. If granted, the trademarks could allow Mr. Trump to expand his business interests in scientific and technological services, construction projects and medical and veterinary services.He now has at least 123 registered and provisionally approved trademarks in China. Of those, four are registered under DTTM Operations \u2014 a holding company \u2014 while the rest are registered under his name, according to Chinese data. The Trump Organization, the family company now run by Mr. Trump\u2019s two adult sons, said the trademarks registered under his name had been transferred to DTTM.\u201cAll of our marks in China are registered to an affiliate of the Trump Organization and have nothing whatsoever to do with Mr. Trump,\u201d Alan Garten, executive vice president and chief legal officer at the Trump Organization, said in an email.It is unclear how Mr. Trump plans to use his trademarks. He does not have any businesses in China, and the Trump Organization has said it will not do any further international deals.For Mr. Trump, obtaining trademarks in China could allow him to license his name in the country, potentially giving him a new source of income. It also protects his brand name in a country that is known for counterfeiters.In China, many celebrities and foreign companies pre-emptively file for trademarks in a wide range of sectors to prevent expensive and time-consuming lawsuits against \u201ctrademark squatters\u201d \u2014 people who register the names of widely known brands in bad faith.Unlike trademarks in the United States, trademarks in China are generally awarded to those who are first to file with the government, and applicants do not have to give a reason for filing.Because of this, Mr. Garten said that since 2006, \u201cthe Trump Organization has been forced to build its trademark portfolio in China to protect its brand and overall intellectual property rights from third-party infringers.\u201dThe news of Mr. Trump\u2019s new preliminary trademarks in China will give further ammunition to his critics, who allege that his business interests violate the emoluments clause in the United States Constitution that bars presidents from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments.Zhang Tiantian contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi King Rewrites Succession, Replacing Heir With Son, 31", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Even two steps away from the Saudi throne, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 31-year-old son of the king, had already pushed the titanic state oil company toward a public offering, loosened some social restrictions that rankled young people and waded into a costly war in Yemen with no plans for how to end it.The move further empowers a young and ambitious leader while Saudi Arabia, a close American ally, is grappling with huge challenges, including low oil prices and intensifying hostilities both with Iran and in its own circle of Sunni Arab states.In favoring his son over Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who is respected for his security acumen, the king, who is 81, also marginalized a large cadre of older princes, many with foreign educations and decades of government experience that the younger prince lacks. If Prince Mohammed bin Salman does succeed his father, he could give Saudi Arabia what it has not seen in more than a half-century: a young king with the potential to rule for decades.Prince Mohammed\u2019s swift rise and growing influence had already rankled other princes who accused him of undermining Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. But such complaints are likely to remain private in a ruling family that prizes stability above all else.\u201cA lot of people are happy that a younger generation is coming to power, but those who are upset are the older generation,\u201d who are not used to such dramatic change, said Joseph A. Kechichian, a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, who has extensive contacts inside the family. \u201cEven if people are uncomfortable, at the end of the day this is a monarchical decision, and people will either have to accept the new arrangement or they will essentially have to keep their mouths shut.\u201dHis supporters praise him as working hard to fulfill a hopeful vision for the kingdom\u2019s future, especially for its large population of young people. His critics call him power hungry and fear that his inexperience has embroiled Saudi Arabia in costly problems with no clear exits, like the war in neighboring Yemen.Since the death of the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz al-Saud, in 1953, control of the absolute monarchy has been passed between his sons, a system that raised questions about the future as the brothers aged and began dying.After ascending the throne, King Salman addressed the issue by naming Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince, the first time a member of the third generation was put in the line of succession.Now, the royal reordering has ended the career of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who served as interior minister and was widely respected by Saudis and their foreign allies for dismantling Al Qaeda\u2019s networks in the kingdom after a string of deadly bombings a decade ago.Another of the king\u2019s sons, Prince Khalid bin Salman, was recently named ambassador to the United States. He is believed to be in his late 20s.Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s rise has been meteoric.Since his father named him deputy crown prince, or second in line to the throne, he has led the development of a plan, Saudi Vision 2030, that seeks to decrease the country\u2019s dependence on oil, diversify its economy and loosen some of the conservative, Islamic kingdom\u2019s social restrictions.As defense minister, he had primary responsibility for the kingdom\u2019s military intervention in Yemen, where it is leading a coalition of Arab allies in a bombing campaign aimed at pushing Houthi rebels from the capital and restoring the government.\u201cWe are a primary target for the Iranian regime,\u201d he said, accusing Iran of aiming to take over Islamic holy sites in Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca and Medina. \u201cWe won\u2019t wait for the battle to be in Saudi Arabia. Instead, we\u2019ll work so that the battle is for them in Iran.\u201dSaudi Arabia and Iran stand on opposite sides of conflicts in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen while they seek to lessen each other\u2019s influence across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.The removal of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who had warm relations with the emir of Qatar and his father, could make it even harder for the tiny nation to reach an accommodation with its neighbors, analysts said. And some wondered whether the young prince\u2019s assertiveness would further destabilize the region.\u201cThis is a time when we really need some quiet diplomacy,\u201d said Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. \u201cWe need coolheaded politicians who are able to defuse tensions rather than inflame them. There has been a far more aggressive stance in Saudi foreign policy under King Salman, and now it might get worse.\u201dPrince Mohammed bin Salman faces great economic challenges, with low oil prices continuing to sap the state budget, scarce job opportunities for the kingdom\u2019s youth and declining consumer confidence.Saudi Arabia reported a 4 percent rise in its domestic stock market after the changes were announced. But oil prices continued to fall on Wednesday.Traditionally, the Saudi royal family largely left the operation of the energy industry to technocrats, but Prince Mohammed has taken a more direct role.In particular, he has drawn criticism for driving an initial public offering of the state oil giant, Saudi Aramco, a highly secretive company that has underpinned the kingdom\u2019s economy and generated tremendous wealth for decades. He has also made pronouncements on oil production policy that sometimes seemed to undercut more experienced Saudi energy officials.\u201cThe problem is that he is unpredictable, and it is not clear who he is relying on for advice,\u201d said Paul Stevens, a Middle East oil analyst at Chatham House, a research group based in London.Prince Mohammed\u2019s promotion comes at an awkward time for the Saudi oil industry.Production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, largely orchestrated by the Saudis last year, have so far failed to lift prices, presenting the Saudis and other big oil producers with few good options. Major oil exporters could further cut output, or the Saudis could resume a policy they pursued in late 2014: allowing prices to fall, forcing smaller, lower-margin producers out of the market and, as a result, grabbing more market share.Prince Mohammed has pursued a uniquely public profile for the traditionally private kingdom, giving interviews to Western news organizations and taking high-profile trips to China, Russia and the United States, where he ate with Mr. Trump in March.The departing prince\u2019s profile had waned as that of his younger cousin grew, although he remained popular with the Western officials he cooperated with on security and intelligence matters.Stanley Reed and David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Expect in the Air This Summer", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayBetween flight cancellations last month at Spirit Airlines that led to a brawl in the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and viral cellphone videos of crew and passenger altercations \u2014 most notably a United Airlines passenger being wrestled from his seat and dragged down the aisle \u2014 the airline industry has experienced a turbulent spring.The busy summer season presents its own challenges, beginning with congestion. But a combination of new airline classes of service and security practices seems poised to compound the confusion, even as airlines incrementally increase some of the perks common in decades past, such as free meals.Here are four ways in which flying this summer will differ from last year.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be crowded this summer, and I think we will have a record number of air travelers in part because of low fares,\u201d said George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, a site that tracks fare sales.\u201cLow-cost carriers are definitely exerting pressure on traditional carriers,\u201d said Alex Chang, a data scientist at Hopper. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen quite a few exciting fare sales as airlines try to compete against each other, and also through the major airline alliances.\u201dFor those who don\u2019t mind connecting flights, alliance wars can yield low fares. For example, American Airlines and British Airways, which are allied, may go after routes dominated by other alliances such as Delta Air Lines and Air France, by offering cheap flights to Paris with a stop in London. In response, Delta and Air France may offer bargains to London via Paris.Earlier this year, the largest American airlines further compartmentalized their economy cabins, adding basic economy on the low end and premium economy on the high end.With basic economy, legacy airlines are taking on no-frills carriers like Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant. New to American and United, and already in place at Delta, basic economy does not permit passengers to make a seat selection before check-in. American and United prohibit basic fliers from bringing aboard luggage that requires space in overhead bins. Travelers on these tickets can check their bags at check-infor $25 one way.Though the airline booking engines make clear what the ticket does and does not include, the most potentially distressing aspect of the ticket is that a family may purchase this bottom-barrel fare only to discover that they will most likely not be seated together. Middle seats may be the only remaining options by the time they get seat assignments.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like putting up a virtual curtain between the last few rows of the cabin, and saying not all economy is the same anymore,\u201d said Seth Kaplan, the managing partner of the industry newsletter Airline Weekly. \u201cIt basically gives people who really just want safe, cheap, reliable travel a way to get that but not anything else.\u201d\u201cPremium economy on American will resemble their domestic short-haul business class,\u201d said Mr. Hobica of Airfarewatchdog. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger, more comfortable seat with more padding.\u201dDelta is introducing its own version, called Delta Premium Select, in the fall. It will include upgraded chairs, amenity kits, blankets and food described as \u201cseasonal, regional meals.\u201dIf you are flying back to the United States from 10 airports in the Middle East or northern Africa, expect to check your large electronic devices either in your bags or at the gate.Fliers may find extra inspections of their devices at security lanes. Ten American airports are testing expanded screening of smaller electronic devices, such as tablets, at some security lanes. As laptops are now treated, smaller items are to be fished out of bags and placed in separate bins for security screening at the major airports in Boise, Idaho; Boston; Colorado Springs; Detroit; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Los Angeles; Lubbock, Tex.; San Juan, P.R.; Las Vegas and Phoenix.When my laptop and 35-millimeter camera were flagged during a plane change in Doha recently, I was forced to turn them over to a patient Qatar Airways employee who wrapped them in plastic, packaged them in a cardboard box, bagged the box in a strong plastic bag with a tamper-proof seal and ticketed it as checked baggage. After landing in Chicago, I redeemed them from a staffed area in baggage claim, costing me anxiety, of course, but just a little extra time.It\u2019s not all bad news at 30,000 feet. Some airlines, including Delta and American, have reintroduced free food service in economy, largely on transcontinental flights. And where they haven\u2019t offered free food, they have upgraded what\u2019s for sale. Now instead of just snack boxes, United Airlines offers a cheeseburger and fries or penne pasta and meatballs for purchase during lunch and dinner hours on domestic flights.Many major foreign carriers do not participate in PreCheck, and the expedited security lanes are consequently not available in most international terminals at airports here. But this year, the T.S.A. announced 18 new partner airlines, including Avianca, Copa Airlines, Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic among foreign carriers, bringing the total to 37 participating carriers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Fallout of Climate Move? It Depends on How We Value Time", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsPresident Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the Paris climate accord \u2014 and his broader unwillingness to fight climate change \u2014 will have broad economic consequences.Exactly what those consequences will be, though, depends on many things. It\u2019s not just the political decisions that will matter, but also the pace of scientific advances around renewable energy, the vicissitudes of commodity markets, and the investment decisions of businesses, governments and individuals worldwide.The very discussion rapidly turns to questions that are as much philosophical as economic. How much do you value existing jobs versus different jobs that might be created? And how much do you value the future versus the present?Consider a relatively narrow question involving the economics of climate change mitigation: How much will the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, a key element of its efforts, increase the electricity prices that Americans pay?Industry-funded research from NERA Economic Consulting estimated that it would increase retail electricity bills by 0.3 percent in the 2020s; the Environmental Protection Agency estimated a 2 to 3 percent increase in 2020 and a decrease by 2030; and Synapse Energy Economics and M.J. Bradley & Associates both projected a significant decrease in electricity costs, as much as 17 percent by 2030.In this case, not only is the extent to which the plan will affect power bills uncertain, but also the direction. In these forecasts, it matters a great deal how quickly prices fall for generating solar and wind power; how much energy-efficiency programs reduce demand for electricity; the future price of natural gas; and how aggressively states cooperate to achieve emissions targets.This challenge of projecting the consequences of climate action gets all the harder when you go from a narrow question like the cost of electricity a few years down the road to broader questions about jobs, incomes and G.D.P.Any credible effort to combat climate change endangers millions of jobs involved in the extraction and processing of fossil fuels. But the reality of the modern economy is that industries are constantly in flux, and the workers who lose jobs may well find better ones.But that\u2019s the way the labor market works in general, with some sectors expanding at any point in time and others contracting. Right now, the retail sector is bleeding jobs as physical stores give way to more online shopping. The information-services sector shed more than a million jobs from 2001 to 2012. The share of jobs in manufacturing has been falling pretty much continuously since World War II.So the real question is not whether some jobs involving fossil fuels will go away if greenhouse gases are regulated more stringently; what matters is whether the jobs that emerge to replace them will pay better or worse.If no jobs emerge at all and unemployment rises, then that\u2019s a failure of macroeconomic stabilization \u2014 which is to say, it\u2019s the Federal Reserve\u2019s fault for keeping interest rates too high.There\u2019s a parallel with trade policy. Major trade deals have minimal effects on the overall number of jobs, and increase incomes on average, but may have a particularly large job-reducing effects in particular locations and among particular workers.In other words, it\u2019s one thing to say that jobs drilling for oil and mining coal will go away even as jobs installing solar panels will be created. That sounds comforting \u2014 but if different people in different locations are doing those jobs, there can still be disruption.And beyond the complexity of modeling how climate policies will affect the economy, and the judgment call of how much value to assign to preserving existing jobs, there is an even bigger question.In pessimistic forecasts of the impact of climate change, the cost to adapt to a warming planet will be eventually be huge, potentially including vast expenditures to try to protect cities from rising seas, adjusting agriculture to new climate patterns, and countless other changes to business and the economy.We don\u2019t know exactly when those costs will arrive, how big they will be, and how much the kinds of climate action contemplated as part of the Paris agreement would shift the risk patterns. To use a business concept, we have to apply some kind of \u201cdiscount rate\u201d when thinking about future climate economic impacts.A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow and a lot more than a dollar in 100 years. But what discount rate you set determines how much more.So the question for the economy is not just how much more an aggressive climate policy would cost today; it\u2019s how it would change those costs in the decades ahead, and how, as a society, we count the value of time.Advertisement"}

The future, not at all.Even as more Americans say the economy is improving, a clear majority remain fearful about their children\u2019s financial prospects, according to a study released Monday.The pessimism is not limited to the United States, either, according to the report, which was produced by the Pew Research Center. In France, more than 70 percent of respondents said they doubted that their children would be better off financially, with a similarly bleak outlook reported in Britain, Spain, Italy and Germany.\u201cEven in advanced economies where people think they are doing well, like Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, they are worried about their kids\u2019 financial prospects,\u201d said Bruce Stokes, director of global economic attitudes at Pew. \u201cClearly, even though unemployment is falling and growth is returning after the financial crisis, this pessimism raises questions about whether this is a temporary phenomenon.\u201dWhile 86 percent of Germans feel good about current economic conditions, the most in the eurozone, only 21 percent in neighboring France feel similarly sanguine. Still, even in Germany, only 36 percent think their children will be better off; the figure in France is 9 percent.In Britain, where voters shocked political leaders at home and abroad last June by voting to exit the European Union, 51 percent approve of the state of the economy, a figure nearly unchanged from 2015, while 24 percent think the next generation would do better.In the United States, the outlook has improved steadily in recent years, with 58 percent terming the situation good, up from 40 percent in 2015. Despite that, only 37 percent of Americans believe their children will be better off financially.After decades of struggling to recover from the collapse of the Soviet Union, more than half of Russians expect things to be better for the next generation. Faster-growing countries like India, the Philippines, Nigeria and Ghana, which have undergone an economic transformation in recent decades, also show high levels of optimism.The survey was conducted through telephone or face-to-face interviews in each country.\u201cWe in the West have always thought the future would be better, and we invested in it and saved for it,\u201d Mr. Stokes said. \u201cBut this hasn\u2019t been the case in recent years.\u201dIn the United States, the gloom about what lies ahead for the economy is evident on both sides of the aisle. Among Republicans, 50 percent are doubtful about future economic prospects; 62 percent of Democrats are in the pessimistic camp.At roughly 2 percent, the American economy\u2019s growth rate in recent years has been tepid by the standards of past recoveries, disappointing both policy makers and consumers looking to regain ground lost during the recession from late 2007 to mid-2009.But steady hiring, a recovering housing market and soaring stock prices have helped lift spirits, even with the anemic annual growth.Pew\u2019s data tracked that divergence, with 69 percent of Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree satisfied with the economy\u2019s condition, compared with 55 percent of workers with just a high school diploma.\u201cThese people are experiencing a different economy,\u201d Mr. Stokes said. \u201cEverything we know from the economic statistics shows there is an income premium if you have a college education. It\u2019s another reminder that we live in a very divided society, not just politically but economically.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Layovers That Give Travelers a Break and Hub Cities a Boost", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long ago, a traveler who mentioned spending a night in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, might draw a blank look. Helsinki, Finland; Istanbul; Reykjavik, Iceland; and Seoul, South Korea, elicited similar reactions. Yet now these cities and others have seen tourism skyrocket as airlines have reframed an inconvenient change of planes into an opportunity for travelers to see one place on their way to another.Nowhere is that better demonstrated than in Iceland, which since the 1960s has been encouraging passengers to enjoy the layover on the way to Continental Europe by leaving the airport and having a look around. Some airlines allow up to a seven-day stay at no additional charge, though hotels and excursions are extra.\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing stopover promotions through the years, and it\u2019s been successful, but nothing like this,\u201d said Gudmundur Oskarsson, Icelandair\u2019s senior vice president for sales and marketing.Tourism has increased to 1.75 million in 2016 from 400,000 in 2006 as Icelandair and a newcomer, Wow Air, have opened additional routes from the United States and Canada, offering travelers a cheaper way to Europe than the nonstop competition. The lower airfare comes with a connection at Keflavik International Airport, roughly midway across the Atlantic.\u201cMore people are able to experience Reykjavik,\u201d said Alex Chang, a data scientist with the airfare prediction app Hopper, who noted that airlines are advertising the stopover option on both sides of the Atlantic.Other airlines got into the game after watching what happened to Dubai when Emirates Airlines adopted the stopover idea in 2002. Emirates and other airlines in the region benefit from a home base at the midpoint of many global routes.When the stopover began,, 16 million travelers passed through the Dubai airport. By 2016, it was the world\u2019s busiest international airport, with 86 million travelers. Today Dubai has become a stand-alone, luxury-oriented destination and Emirates does not always offer the stopover.Even when it does, the company still makes money by selling city tours, theme park visits and desert safaris through its travel company, Arabian Adventures, which is listed on its website. Because the tour company is part of the Emirates Group, travelers are likely to be reassured that they\u2019ll make their onward connection, said Smita Natalia Deans, a spokeswoman for Emirates. The company takes responsibility for making sure its customers get to the airport.Making stopovers work involves government coordination of visas and other paperwork to ease the way for short-time visitors. \u201cThere are a lot of factors that go into building a city like that,\u201d Mr. Chang said. \u201cBut having people go through Dubai and contribute to the economy is part of the road map, and it\u2019s been successful, so that other cities and other countries are looking to replicate that.\u201dEven well-known European capitals now see the advantages of routing travelers through one airport on their way somewhere else. Finnair\u2019s location in Helsinki, close to the Arctic Circle, means the airline can offer the shortest flight times between Asia and Europe.\u201cIt\u2019s a geographical fact we can benefit from travel between U.S.A. and India because the majority of those routes are flown over Nordic airspace,\u201d said Juha Jarvinen, chief commercial officer for Finnair. Last fall, in coordination with Visit Finland, Finnair began a multiday stopover program but also offered excursions as short as five hours, aimed at travelers from the United States bound for Asia.Jay Sorensen, a consultant specializing in airline revenue, explained that in Helsinki and Dubai, the hubs produce long layovers, creating time to fill. \u201cFlying in from the U.S. and connecting to China, their China services leave at night,\u201d he said of Finnair. \u201cThere\u2019s no connection until evening, so they have shopping and sauna excursions.\u201dSince the stopovers began, Finnair has seen an increase in passengers opting to visit Helsinki. Overnight stays in March 2017 were 20 percent higher than in 2016, and 30 percent higher among travelers from the United States, according to Statistics Finland.While Finnair\u2019s sweet spot is connecting Asian travelers and particularly the fast-growing numbers of Chinese who are beginning to travel internationally to Europe, an airline spokeswoman, P\u00e4ivyt Tallqvist, said stopovers appealed to people of all nationalities who were trying to get the most out of their time away from home. \u201cIt makes sense to combine several European destinations on a trip to Europe,\u201d she said.At Hopper, Mr. Chang agreed. Compressing a few destinations into one round-trip airline ticket (especially if the stopover city is not well known) is appealing, particularly to younger travelers.\u201cLook at the way they\u2019re marketed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2019Go someplace exotic you might not have experienced before.\u2019 They\u2019re trying to get at your sense of curiosity.\u201dThe success of Icelandair\u2019s long-running stopover fare prompted the airline to add an extra perk in 2016. Passengers could ask to be paired with airline employees who would act as local tour guides during their visit. Hundreds of passengers embraced the program, but looking ahead to the busy summer season, the airline concluded that employees were too valuable to be squiring tourists around town one or two at a time.So the program was suspended indefinitely. Travelers can still stop and explore Iceland on their way to Europe, as they always have, but they\u2019ll have do it on their own.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Towns Already Hit by Steel Mill Closings, a New Casualty: Retail Jobs", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Thousands of workers face unemployment as retailers struggle to adapt to online shopping. But even as e-commerce grows, it isn\u2019t absorbing these workers.Supported byJOHNSTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Dawn Nasewicz comes from a family of steelworkers, with jobs that once dominated the local economy. She found her niche in retail.She manages a store, Ooh La La, that sells prom dresses and embroidered jeans at a local mall. But just as the jobs making automobile springs and rail anchors disappeared, local retail jobs are now vanishing.\u201cI need my income,\u201d said Ms. Nasewicz, who was told that her store will close as early as August. \u201cI\u2019m 53. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dMs. Nasewicz is another retail casualty, one of tens of thousands of workers facing unemployment nationwide as the industry struggles to adapt to online shopping.Small cities in the Midwest and Northeast are particularly vulnerable. When major industries left town, retail accounted for a growing share of the job market in places like Johnstown, Decatur, Ill., and Saginaw, Mich. Now, the work force is getting hit a second time, and there is little to fall back on.Moreover, while stores in these places are shedding jobs because of e-commerce, e-commerce isn\u2019t absorbing these workers. Growth in e-commerce jobs like marketing and engineering, while strong, is clustered around larger cities far away. Rural counties and small metropolitan areas account for about 23 percent of traditional American retail employment, but they are home to just 13 percent of e-commerce positions.E-commerce has also fostered a boom in other industries, including warehouses. But most of those jobs are being created in larger metropolitan areas, an analysis of Census Bureau business data shows.Almost all customer fulfillment centers run by the online shopping behemoth Amazon are in metropolitan areas with more than 250,000 people \u2014 close to the bulk of its customers \u2014 according to a list of locations compiled by MWPVL International, a logistics consulting firm. An Amazon spokeswoman noted, however, that the company had recently opened warehouses in two distressed cities in larger metropolitan areas, Fall River, Mass., and Joliet, Ill.The Johnstown metropolitan area, in western Pennsylvania, has lost 19 percent of its retail jobs since 2001, and the future is uncertain. At least a dozen of Ooh La La\u2019s neighbors at the mall have closed, and a \u201cGoing out of business\u201d banner hangs across the front of the sporting goods store Gander Mountain.\u201cEvery time you lose a corner store, every time you lose a restaurant, every time you lose a small clothing store, it detracts from the quality of life, as well as the job loss,\u201d said John McGrath, a professor of management at the University of Pittsburgh Johnstown.This city is perhaps still best known for a flood that ravaged it nearly 130 years ago. After rebuilding, Johnstown eventually became prosperous from its steel and offered a clear path to the middle class. For generations, people could walk out of high school and into a steady factory job.But today, the area bears the marks of a struggling town. Its population has dwindled, and addiction treatment centers and Dollar Generals stand in place of corner grocers and department stores like Glosser Brothers, once owned by the family of Stephen Miller, President Trump\u2019s speechwriter and a policy adviser.When Mr. Trump spoke about \u201crusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation\u201d in his Inaugural Address, people like Donald Bonk, a local economic development consultant, assumed that Mr. Miller \u2014 who grew up in California but spent summers in Johnstown \u2014 was writing about the old Bethlehem Steel buildings that still hug long stretches of the Little Conemaugh River.The county voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, eight years after it helped to elect Barack Obama. (It also voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, but not by as wide a margin.)Here and in similar towns, when the factory jobs left, a greater share of the work force ended up in retail.Sometimes that meant big-box retailers like Walmart, which were often blamed for destroying mom-and-pop stores but at least created other jobs for residents. The damage from e-commerce plays out differently. Digital firms may attract customers from small towns, but they are unlikely to employ them.Some remaining retailers are straining for solutions.Randy Clark remembers when his Miller\u2019s Clothing Store, a family-run men\u2019s wear shop, employed twice as many people and sold 20 pairs of pants a day. He knows he needs a website, but attracting digital customers is the least of his concerns. Brands that he sells, like Tommy Bahama and Southern Tide, will not even let him sell their products online, where he would compete with their own e-commerce operations, he said.So instead, Mr. Clark has focused on the store itself. He renovated the first floor to attract customers from farther away, customers who might have more money to spend and more places to go than Johnstown. He bought new furniture and new floors, installed a coffee machine, and donated old sports coats and corduroy jackets to make room for fresh inventory. He wears a suit and tie to work six days a week, and says he does not own a pair of jeans.\u201cNot a lot of people dress up anymore,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t dress the part, who will?\u201dTom Apryle IV takes the opposite approach at his jewelry store.Metalworkers, office clerks and executives \u2014 thousands of workers used to stream in and out of the factories here every day. When they got engaged or celebrated anniversaries or just wanted a nice diamond bracelet, they often went to Apryle\u2019s, a jewelry store that Mr. Apryle\u2019s great-grandfather opened in 1902.But fewer people can afford his products now that the good jobs are long gone, and Mr. Apryle has had to make adjustments.A cash-for-gold sign hangs in the window. He started selling knickknacks on eBay. Eventually, he stopped wearing a tie.\u201cI might as well be comfortable,\u201d Mr. Apryle, 46, said, gesturing to his wrinkled T-shirt and tennis shoes. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here to impress.\u201dThe story of America\u2019s Johnstowns is not just the story of retail, or e-commerce, or how men don\u2019t buy suits and ties at Miller\u2019s the way they used to. It\u2019s also about men like Mr. Apryle, who wouldn\u2019t even have a place to wear them.\u201cI was the last generation to see it booming and prosperous, and people were employed,\u201d said Mr. Bonk, 53, the economic development consultant, who grew up in Johnstown. \u201cIt disappeared in my lifetime.\u201dJust as Johnstown scrambled to adapt to the decline in manufacturing that began a generation ago, local leaders are now looking at how to navigate a future with a much diminished retail economy.To help revitalize the area, the county hired Mr. Bonk, whose parents ran a corner grocery store here for more than 40 years and made enough money to send him and his brother to college.Mr. Bonk has returned, determined to make downtown thrive again. But he does not have dreams of bringing back the department stores of his youth. He knows that consumers these days want to spend their money more on experiences than things, and that neighborhood stores are competing against digital upstarts that do not need as many workers and often have far more resources.As he walks briskly down Main Street, Mr. Bonk points out the new businesses that stand shoulder-to-shoulder with empty storefronts. There is The Vault, a day spa in an old bank building, and the Press Bistro, which, he excitedly points out, has an area for live music.These places are evidence, he says, that other people are committed to restoring Johnstown.\u201cThey want to see it be a healthy, thriving community, like where they grew up,\u201d he said.Mr. Bonk is inspired by Pittsburgh, another former steel town that revived its economy by attracting new businesses, including an Amazon distribution center and the fleet of trucks that came with it. But he knows that the Pittsburgh metro area, with a population of 2.4 million, is 17 times as large as Johnstown.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about what\u2019s next,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially thinking of Johnstown as an economic development laboratory.\u201dMr. Bonk isn\u2019t counting on Amazon coming here.A picture caption on Monday with an article about the loss of retail jobs misspelled, in some copies, the surname of a jewelry store owner and the name of the business in Johnstown, Pa., that carries his name. He is Tom Apryle IV of Apryle\u2019s jewelry store (not Arpyle).Rachel Abrams reported from Johnstown, Pa., and Robert Gebeloff from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bermuda Hopes the America\u2019s Cup Doesn\u2019t Go Sailing Away", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFLATTS VILLAGE, Bermuda \u2014 As sailing fans wait for the America\u2019s Cup to be decided, quite a few sea turtles are waiting, too.Oracle Team USA\u2019s surprising decision to defend yachting\u2019s most prestigious trophy in tiny Bermuda instead of in the United States has had many knock-on effects: A small island has been created in the Royal Naval Dockyard as a site for the America\u2019s Cup village. Elsewhere, historic buildings have been renovated; hotel projects greenlighted; super-yacht slips constructed; and lots of overtime worked at hotels, restaurants and government offices.But few lives have been disrupted as thoroughly as those of the sea turtles that normally reside in the Great Sound, which is being used as the racecourse for this America\u2019s Cup.Turtles surface regularly, which puts them at risk of collisions with the large spectator fleet and especially with the fast AC50 foiling catamarans. Many turtles were caught and relocated in May, and although plenty have been spotted on the Great Sound this week, scores more reside in a temporary chain-link enclosure in the waters of Harrington Sound behind the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo.On Tuesday, a majority of the detainees pressed their beaks to the edge of the fence, looking in the direction of open water and freedom.\u201cThey won\u2019t have to wait much longer,\u201d said Bryan Simons, 33, a boat captain who regularly dodges turtles in the Great Sound.The America\u2019s Cup match between Oracle and Emirates Team New Zealand could be over by Sunday if the New Zealanders, who lead 3-0, can sweep the four scheduled weekend races to win the series. The match could be extended and decided as late as June 28 if Oracle manages to improve its boat speed during this week\u2019s five-day break. Oracle and its combative skipper, Jimmy Spithill, rallied from a much bigger deficit to defend against New Zealand in San Francisco in 2013.\u201cHopefully, Jimmy can do what he did last time,\u201d Mike Winfield, the chief executive of the America\u2019s Cup Bermuda Development Authority, said in an interview Tuesday.Team New Zealand appears to have more support at the cup village, where hundreds of Kiwi fans have gathered before and after races. But many Bermudans, understandably concerned with their return on investment, are in Oracle\u2019s camp even if they are not as demonstrative as the Kiwis.If Team New Zealand reclaims the trophy after a 14-year chase, it plans to stage the next defense at home in Auckland. If Oracle wins, there is still an outside possibility that the cup could stay in Bermuda \u2014 although Chicago, which bid for this year\u2019s event, has continued to show interest in staging the next one on Lake Michigan, in 2019.\u201cLook, we\u2019re not bright, shiny object chasers,\u201d said Peter Durhager, chairman of the development authority. \u201cThis is about a very methodical process and what makes sense for Bermuda.\u201dHe said he could also imagine a scenario where the cup organizers put the next match elsewhere and \u201cthe teams stay here and practice year-round and use Bermuda as a base.\u201dDurhager and Winfield \u2014 along with Grant Gibbons, Bermuda\u2019s minister of economic development \u2014 were instrumental in bringing the cup to Bermuda. They initially thought Russell Coutts, Oracle\u2019s former skipper and now head of the America\u2019s Cup Event Authority, was using them as a stalking horse to extract better offers from American bid cities. Since the cup began in 1851, no American team had chosen to defend the trophy outside the United States.But Coutts, a New Zealander working for Larry Ellison, Oracle\u2019s billionaire owner, could not get the financial package he was seeking in the United States and also liked the idea of the regatta\u2019s being the big fish in a small pond after it struggled for traction in San Francisco in 2013. Coutts and Ellison picked Bermuda, which agreed to pay $15 million as the cost of entry and underwrite a $25 million guarantee against commercial sponsorship.Durhager expects the $25 million figure to fall to $15 million to $20 million, he said, because of an agreement allowing Bermuda to receive a certain percentage of any sponsorship it introduces.Including capital and operational expenditures initially estimated at $40 million, Durhager puts Bermuda\u2019s investment in the cup at $77 million, although some opposition politicians here think the figure will turn out to be significantly higher. Such an investment would be a small one for a large, developed country, but it is a big ask for an isolated British overseas territory with a population of about 65,000 and a transaction-based economy that has been in the doldrums in recent years.So was it worth it? It will take years to know, but there will be a referendum of sorts with Bermuda\u2019s premier, Michael Dunkley, having called a snap general election for July 18.Dunkley has been a strong supporter of the cup and even donned a helmet and flak jacket and sailed on the foiling AC50s during training. At a dinner last week at Bermuda\u2019s Government House, he lobbied Coutts and the cup community to keep the event in Bermuda.There are concerns here about \u201ctwo Bermudas\u201d and a growing gap between the largely white elite and the predominantly black lower-income population. The cup, long a magnet for tycoons like Ellison, is a playground for the elite, but the success of Bermuda\u2019s ethnically diverse Red Bull Youth America\u2019s Cup team, which unexpectedly reached the finals here, has generated enthusiasm across the divide in Bermuda.So has the Endeavor program, a youth education and sailing program run by the America\u2019s Cup that has engaged more than 1,500 students under the age of 13 in Bermuda. The program\u2019s dinghies with pink sails have become a regular sight in the waters here.It is uncertain whether the event will generate a longer-term uptick in youth sailing. For now, if you say \u201ccup match\u201d here, Bermudans still think first of the annual intra-island cricket match between Somerset and St. George\u2019s.What is clear is that in a country this small \u2014 only about 21 square miles \u2014 it should be easy to measure the impact of the other cup.\u201cWe are a good petri dish,\u201d said Durhager, who has projected $240 million in economic impact linked to the America\u2019s Cup.With a number of new high-end yachting facilities built for the event, Bermuda\u2019s leaders want to attract more of the lucrative super-yacht trade as affluent sailors transit between the United States or the Caribbean and Europe.In a pricey country ill-suited to the budget traveler, Bermuda\u2019s leadership also wants an increase in individual tourism, arriving by flight, rather than relying predominantly on the cruise-ship trade. It wants more significant international regattas \u2014 perhaps a Volvo Ocean Race stopover \u2014 and more competitions. Durhager said the International Triathlon Union had agreed to hold several events here \u201con the back of the America\u2019s Cup.\u201dAbove all, Durhager said, he hopes the effort involved in the archipelago\u2019s staging the biggest sports event in its history will boost Bermudans\u2019 confidence.\u201cEighteen months ago this was water,\u201d he said proudly, as he walked around the cup village on Tuesday.But Durhager also knows that 18 months from now, the America\u2019s Cup could be 9,000 miles away in Auckland, perhaps never to return.The turtles, however, should be back where they belong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Democratic Party Is in Worse Shape Than You Thought", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySifting through the wreckage of the 2016 election, Democratic pollsters, strategists and sympathetic academics have reached some unnerving conclusions.What the autopsy reveals is that Democratic losses among working class voters were not limited to whites; that crucial constituencies within the party see its leaders as alien; and that unity over economic populism may not be able to turn back the conservative tide.people of color (41% African-American, Hispanic, or Asian), young (22% under the age of 29), female (60%), and unmarried (46% single, separated, widowed, or divorced).Priorities found that drop off voters were distinctly lukewarm toward Hillary Clinton:Just 30% describe themselves as very favorable to Clinton, far lower than the 72% who describe themselves as very favorable to Barack Obama.To say that this constituency does not look favorably on the Democratic Party fails to capture the scope of their disenchantment.The accompanying chart illustrates this discontent. A solid majority, 77 percent, of Obama-to-Trump voters think Trump\u2019s economic policies will either favor \u201call groups equally\u201d (44) or the middle class (33). 21 percent said Trump would favor the wealthy.In contrast, a plurality of these voters, 42 percent, said that Congressional Democrats would favor the wealthy, slightly ahead of Congressional Republicans at 40 percent.Geoff Garin is a partner in the Garin-Hart-Yang Research Group which, together with the Global Strategy Group, conducted the surveys and focus groups for Priorities USA. Garin wrote in an email:The biggest common denominator among Obama-Trump voters is a view that the political system is corrupt and doesn\u2019t work for people like them.Garin added thatObama-Trump voters were more likely to think more Democrats look out for the wealthy than look out for poor people.\u201cAfter economics,\u201d Garin wrote,the other main drivers for Trump were very specifically about immigration and race, and feelings about both things were powerful and raw.Garin described Trump\u2019s use of the race issue as \u201cboth masterful and dastardly\u201d in exploiting \u201cthe polarization on race around Black Lives Matter and the shootings by and of police.\u201d In doing so,Trump accentuated people\u2019s feelings that battle lines were being drawn in the country and that the forgotten American (a.k.a. working class whites) had to take sides.I asked Nick Gourevitch, a partner in Global Strategies, to rank the importance of economics, race, immigration and cultural alienation in driving support for Trump. He emailed:My take is that economics and culture/race are quite intertwined. The Obama-Trump shift happened in places that are no doubt economically distressed and when you do focus groups with Obama-Trump voters, the conversation always starts about the economy, jobs leaving, towns and places that are no longer as vibrant as they used to be.As focus group discussions continued, Gourevitch noted, cultural and racial issues began to emerge in force:So it may be that within economically distressed communities, the individuals who found Trump appealing (or who left Obama for Trump) were the ones where the cultural and racial piece was a strong part of the reason why they went in that direction. So I guess my take is that it\u2019s probably not economics alone that did it. Nor is it racism/cultural alienation alone that did it. It\u2019s probably that mixture.If the Priorities analysis is bleak, the 13 American Prospect essays are even more so.The Democrats don\u2019t have a \u201cwhite working-class problem.\u201d They have a \u201cworking-class problem,\u201d which progressives have been reluctant to address honestly or boldly. The fact is that Democrats have lost support with all working-class voters across the electorate, including the Rising American Electorate of minorities, unmarried women, and millennials. This decline contributed mightily to the Democrats\u2019 losses in the states and Congress and to the election of Donald Trump.Greenberg voiced an exceptionally sharp critique of his own party and its candidates. First, he takes on Barack Obama:Working-class Americans pulled back from Democrats in this last period of Democratic governance because of President Obama\u2019s insistence on heralding economic progress and the bailout of the irresponsible elites, while ordinary people\u2019s incomes crashed and they continued to struggle financially.Hillary Clinton does not escape Greenberg\u2019s wrath:In what may border on campaign malpractice, the Clinton campaign chose in the closing battle to ignore the economic stress not just of the working-class women who were still in play, but also of those within the Democrats\u2019 own base, particularly among the minorities, millennials, and unmarried women.Greenberg does not stop there, shifting his focus from individual Democratic politicians to the Democratic Party itself:Past supporterspulled back because of the Democrats\u2019 seeming embrace of multinational trade agreements that have cost American jobs. The Democrats have moved from seeking to manage and champion the nation\u2019s growing immigrant diversity to seeming to champion immigrant rights over American citizens\u2019. Instinctively and not surprisingly, the Democrats embraced the liberal values of America\u2019s dynamic and best-educated metropolitan areas, seeming not to respect the values or economic stress of older voters in small-town and rural America. Finally, the Democrats also missed the economic stress and social problems in the cities themselves and in working-class suburbs.Rather than debating whether Democrats should appeal to white working-class voters or voters of color \u2014 both necessary components of a successful electoral coalition, particularly at the state and local level \u2014 a more important question emerges: Why are Democrats losing support and seeing declining turnout from working-class voters of all races in many places?Griffin, Halpin and Teixeira argue thatDemocrats allowed themselves to become the party of the status quo \u2014 a status quo perceived to be elitist, exclusionary, and disconnected from the entire range of working-class concerns, but particularly from those voters in white working-class areas.In the 2016 campaign, they continue,rightly or wrongly, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign exemplified a professional-class status quo that failed to rally enough working-class voters of color and failed to blunt the drift of white working-class voters to Republicans.\u201cMany analysts and leading Democrats,\u201d Molyneux writes \u201chave attributed Donald Trump\u2019s impressive 2016 vote margin among white working-class voters to his embrace of economic populism.\u201d He quotes Bernie Sanders\u2019 postelection comments:Millions of Americans registered a protest vote on Tuesday, expressing their fierce opposition to an economic and political system that puts wealthy and corporate interests over their own.... Donald J. Trump won the White House because his campaign rhetoric successfully tapped into a very real and justified anger, an anger that many traditional Democrats feel.While \u201cDemocrats can take obvious comfort in a story about Trump winning in large measure because he stole our ideas,\u201d Molyneux writes, \u201cthis assessment misses the mark in important ways.\u201dWhy? BecauseTrump\u2019s brand of populism \u2014 and more importantly, that of working-class whites \u2014 differs in important ways from the populism of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.Molyneux writes:White working-class voters\u2019 negative view of government spending undermines their potential support for many progressive economic policies. While they want something done about jobs, wages, education, and health care, they are also fiscally conservative and deeply skeptical of government\u2019s ability to make positive change. So political populism not only differs from economic populism, but also serves as a powerful barrier to it.For decades, the perception that an intrusive federal government promotes policies favoring African-Americans and other minorities at the expense of whites has driven anti-government animosity.more than half (52%) of white working-class Americans believe discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minoritiesand that \u201cfour in ten white working-class Americans agree\u201d with the statement that \u201cefforts to increase diversity almost always come at the expense of whites.\u201dIn a separate argument, Nicholas Carnes and Noam Lupu, professors of political science at Duke and Vanderbilt, challenge a basic premise on the left \u2014 that the populism of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could have stemmed the loss of non-college whites to Trump.Carnes and Lupu contend instead that the oft-cited theory that Trump won because of support from the low-income white working class is itself wrong.among white people without college degrees who voted for Trump, nearly 60 percent were in the top half of the income distributionand thatwhite non-Hispanic voters without college degrees making below the median household income made up only 25 percent of Trump voters.Democratic pessimism today stands in contrast to the optimism that followed the elections of 2006, 2008 and 2012.At that time, the consensus was that Democrats had found the key to sustained victory. The party saw its future in ascendant constituencies: empowered minorities, singles, social liberals and the well-educated.Democratic activists saw the Republican Party as doomed to defeat without a radical change of course because it was tied to overlapping constituencies that they viewed as of waning significance \u2014 for example, older, non-college, evangelical white Christians.Today, in a world of angry, fearful voters, it is liberal optimism that is at a low ebb \u2014 buffeted by a drumroll of terrorist incidents, rising levels of hostility toward immigrants and a broad animus toward difference, the unknown and the other.Before 2016, no one, Democrat or Republican, thought that the man who would bring about radical change would be Donald Trump, except, perhaps, Trump himself.For all the harm he has done, continues to do and proposes to do, Trump has successfully forced Democrats to begin to examine the party\u2019s neglected liabilities, the widespread resentment of its elites and the frail loyalty of its supporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Is Ed Gillespie, Virginia\u2019s G.O.P. Nominee for Governor?", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA top aide in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, Mr. Gillespie, 55, is very much a creature of the pre-Trump, establishment wing of his party. He will face a stiff test in the general election against the Democrat Ralph S. Northam, as he seeks to retain the support of conservatives who are enthusiastic backers of President Trump while not turning off the state\u2019s often pivotal moderates, a decidedly anti-Trump voter bloc.This is Mr. Gillespie\u2019s second bid for statewide office. In 2014, he ran unsuccessfully against Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat. It was not expected to be one of the marquee Senate races that year, but Mr. Gillespie gave Mr. Warner a scare, losing by less than a single point.Running such an unexpectedly strong race gave Mr. Gillespie a leg up this year as a host of other high-profile Virginia Republicans deferred to him. If they had known how vulnerable he was on the right, some of those other would-be candidates may not have opted out of the race.A New Jersey-raised congressional aide-turned-Washington insider may not sound like the typical profile of a statewide candidate in a tradition-bound state like Virginia. But Mr. Gillespie has a model of sorts in the governor\u2019s mansion today: Terry McAuliffe.Mr. McAuliffe was raised in Syracuse before making a name for himself in national politics as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The governor and the would-be governor, who have a friendly relationship born of the greenroom circuit, have something else in common: Both came to the nation\u2019s capital to attend college at the Catholic University of America.Mr. Gillespie, a firm devotee of Mr. Bush\u2019s \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d is not generally fond of Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-edge nationalism. In fact, it can be difficult to even hear him say the name of the president.Mr. Gillespie often refers to supporting \u201cthe ticket\u201d of his party in 2016, and he appears more comfortable around Vice President Mike Pence, a more conventional conservative. But given that Virginia is likely to be the most competitive race in the country this fall, Mr. Trump will probably take notice if Mr. Gillespie shuns him entirely during the campaign.Mr. Gillespie has already raised just shy of $5 million for the governor\u2019s race and, with the help of the well-funded Republican Governors Association, he will not lack for financial resources this fall. He has a nationwide fund-raising network thanks to his time at the helm of the party in the Bush years, his Senate bid and his work with a group of third-party conservative organizations that have helped Republicans win congressional and statehouse races.There are no limits on fund-raising in Virginia. Mr. Gillespie may be the best-connected Republican to seek the Virginia governorship in the state\u2019s history.Even as the two Democrats running for governor, Mr. Northam and Tom Perriello, veered to the left, Mr. Gillespie largely resisted targeting them on the sort of social issues that used to be staples of conservative attacks in Virginia. He has instead kept a focus on economic growth and cutting taxes, ignoring his Republican rivals.This strategy imperiled him in his primary, but Mr. Gillespie feared getting pulled too far right and driving away more centrist general electorate voters. But Mr. Gillespie\u2019s approach reveals the degree to which Virginia has shifted away from Republicans: His overarching message is indistinguishable from that of most mainstream Republican candidates running in blue states.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can a New Generation in the Banlieues Change French Politics?", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "FeatureA Muslim city councilor in a stagnant Paris suburb makes the case for modernizing the nation\u2019s Republican values.Supported byNine days later, 3,000 people gathered in the muddy yard in front of the courthouse that serves the \u201c93\u201d \u2014 the department to the north and east of Paris that includes Aulnay. Most of the protesters were in their 20s, first- or second-generation French, their parents or grandparents having arrived from Morocco or Mali or Algeria in the 1960s and \u201970s. Among them was Mehdi Bouteghm\u00e8s, a 28-year-old city counselor in the neighboring suburb La Courneuve. When news of the incident first spread on social media, where the campaign for the presidential election was also heating up, Bouteghm\u00e8s took to Facebook. \u201cIn my vision of the Republic, the election campaign should come to a halt,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAll the candidates should focus on and make a priority of resolving the problem of the role of the police in this country.\u201d Then he posted the opening lines of \u201cWhat Is the Third Estate?\u201d a tract published by the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s in January 1789, that took up the cause of the common classes: \u201cWe have three questions before us. One \u2014 What is the Third Estate? EVERYTHING. Two \u2014 What has it been until now in the political order? NOTHING. Three \u2014 What is it asking for? TO BE SOMETHING.\u201dThe election campaign did not stop; instead Bouteghm\u00e8s found himself here, surrounded by the citizens he represented. A handful of gendarmes loitered on a steel walkway that ran above the complex, peering down at the crowd. A dozen young men hoisted themselves onto a parapet, fists raised. \u201cWe\u2019re finished with this savagery,\u201d one shouted into a microphone. \u201cWith this violence that\u2019s been going on for 30 years. Today you can kill an African, rape an African. Some of you experience daily humiliations. It\u2019s a myth, the country of the rights of man. Do you feel like the country respects you?\u201d The crowd yelled back: \u201cNo!\u201dThe protesters began to sing \u201cThe Marseillaise.\u201d Someone set off a mortar that burst red into the sky with a pop like gunfire, close enough to shed ash on the crowd. A humming sound floated up from behind. Everyone turned to watch a group of kids rush up the steps of the walkway toward the gendarmes, hurling stones at their riot shields until the officers charged, forcing them back down. A truck belonging to the radio station RTL went up in flames, sending a dark column of smoke skyward. Police reinforcements arrived and set off tear-gas, pushing the crowd out of the courtyard, into the surrounding streets and down into the metro station.The next morning, newspapers ran pictures of streets filled with fumes and burning cars; inside one, reports said, was a child rescued just in time. Far-right activists took to Twitter to denounce the protesters as savage anarchists. \u201cSupport goes out to police confronting those who take advantage of an unfortunate accident to attack the police and spit on France,\u201d Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, the niece of the president of the National Front, tweeted. Another party leader wrote, \u201cRiots in Bobigny \u2014 there you have it: the result of 40 years of mass immigration, judicial cowardice and political blindness.\u201dI was separated from Bouteghm\u00e8s in the chaos, and he messaged me later to make sure I got out all right. \u201cWhat happened was predictable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe speeches weren\u2019t clear, weren\u2019t calming. We need only to be able to communicate in order to make things just a little bit better. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible anymore.\u201dHe had plenty of ideas. Architecture was a passion, and he had studied urban planning to understand how new buildings might be designed to resist the kind of rapid degradation that plagued the town\u2019s infrastructure. He even helped start a program for architecture students in Paris, who could propose ideas for La Courneuve as their final thesis. The results were sometimes outlandish \u2014 one student drafted a blueprint for a perfume museum \u2014 but Bouteghm\u00e8s still found them useful. \u201cIt makes you dream a bit,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich changes what you can do.\u201dThe mayor encouraged Bouteghm\u00e8s and his friends to run on his ticket; he needed to join forces with young men of their background to win a majority in a town that has more than 100 nationalities. Once elected, though, they felt constrained by a decades-old political machine. In the fall of 2015, Poux shut down the Samaritain Roma camp in La Courneuve that was home to 300 people; he stated that what was needed was a national, not a local, solution. For months, Bouteghm\u00e8s had helped organize protests to keep it open, and as it became clear the Roma would not prevail, he worked with local nongovernment organizations to help find temporary squats. He felt that he could no longer share a political identity with the mayor, and he and three others split off to form the \u00c9lan Populaire Courneuvien, on the theory that as a bloc they could wield some power. Eventually, one of them might even run against the mayor.\u201cIn the beginning, in my head, identity was important,\u201d Bouteghm\u00e8s told me. I met him at an Illy cafe behind the Op\u00e9ra Garnier in late January, when all the surfaces of the city are darkened from incessant rain. He is tall and unfailingly well put together; that day he had on a navy blue shawl-neck sweater over a pressed white button-down shirt, dark, slim-fitted wool pants and large glasses with clear-plastic frames that were slightly out of tune with his otherwise sober demeanor. We talked for nearly an hour and a half before he smiled for the first time. \u201cIn reality, identity doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said. What had been, initially, an American-style venture in identity politics led him back to the French Republican ideals of universalism. \u201cYou have a group of people who all look alike, they criticize the old white guys who keep everything to themselves. But then we do the same thing. The Arabs complain about racism, but they\u2019re racist toward the Roma. Identity is a trap.\u201dBouteghm\u00e8s\u2019s father was born near Constantine, in the Algerian east, in 1950, when the country was still a part of France. He left at 23 for France and met Bouteghm\u00e8s\u2019s mother, a Tunisian, while they were working at a hotel near the Gare de l\u2019Est in Paris. He went back to Algeria, as he always planned, but after a few months he returned to France to be with Bouteghm\u00e8s\u2019s mother. They bought an apartment in La Courneuve, when suburban design was still confidently utopian. Bouteghm\u00e8s\u2019s father eventually became a site manager for a construction company and a union representative. \u201cHe paid for it dearly,\u201d Bouteghm\u00e8s told me. \u201cIn front of him were the bosses attacking him, next to him people who deserted him, betrayed him.\u201d He would negotiate a pay raise, and they would increase everyone\u2019s salary except for his. \u201cMy father would always say to me, \u2018Don\u2019t do what I did.\u2019 And now I\u2019m living the same thing he lived. Exactly the same.\u201dThe problems facing the suburbs, Bouteghm\u00e8s asserted, could not be addressed without taking on the larger national malaise. \u201cFor me, today, being named Mehdi Bouteghm\u00e8s, my father was born in a French colony, my mother was born in a French protectorate, if I want to question the political methods, practices, Republican institutions, people will say I\u2019m an Islamist,\u201d Bouteghm\u00e8s told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal.\u201d At 18 he joined the Young Muslims of France, a community youth group, and during a phase in college read extensively in Islamic philosophy and theology. Islam was part of his identity, but now, 10 years later, he was certain this would be used against him if he decided to enter national politics. \u201cThey\u2019ll attack me, twist positions I may have taken before, activities I might have been involved in in the past,\u201d he said.Bouteghm\u00e8s attended high school in the neighboring suburb Aubervilliers, at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri Wallon, where, in 2003, during his first semester, the Affaire Alma and Lila L\u00e9vy, which led to the 2004 law banning religious symbols, unfolded. \u201cIn my opinion, that was the breaking point of the Republic,\u201d he said. That fall, two sisters, daughters of an Algerian mother who was baptized Catholic and an atheist Jewish father, refused to remove the head scarves they had recently begun to wear. The school suspended them for \u201costentatious\u201d attire that was \u201cdisturbing\u201d to the public order. \u201cWe had debates about it in the schoolyard,\u201d Bouteghm\u00e8s said. \u201cBut with the teachers, there was an incredible racism.\u201d He went on: \u201cYou crack. It becomes us against them, against those who want nothing of us \u2014 everyone.\u201d His parents weren\u2019t particularly religious, but social dynamics led him, for a time, to delve into Islam. \u201cI would go around talking about values: \u2018No, that\u2019s no good. No, this is what Islam is.\u2019 But people allowed me to make my mistakes, let me evolve, realize my errors. I didn\u2019t know who I was yet. Today, if you\u2019re an 18-year-old kid, you talk about Islam like that, you go straight to prison.\u201dTo Bouteghm\u00e8s, the hysteria in France about Islam, on display most recently in the \u201cburkini\u201d controversy, smacked of the anti-Semitism of the \u201930s. \u201cThey are attacking people who don\u2019t represent what people are saying they represent,\u201d he said. Women in head scarves had become symbols, flash points, everything except individuals with complicated personal reasons for expressing themselves in a particular way. Even for the people who did turn to fundamentalism, religion was often a question of economic and political exclusion. Solve the economic problems \u2014 find people jobs, help them educate their families \u2014 the \u201cwoman question\u201d would resolve itself.The politics of French culture now seem intrinsic to the country\u2019s sense of itself, but it wasn\u2019t until the early 1980s, as Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, notes in a new book, \u201cDire la France,\u201d that \u201cculture\u201d became mixed with \u201cnational identity.\u201d It was a theme of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s Socialist Party, a bid to recapture power. \u201cWithout knowing it, they engendered a monster they could not control,\u201d Martigny says. The far-right took up the theme and unity became confused with uniformity. \u201cThere is a gap between civic culture, the culture of the Republic, which is defending the principles of France, and the majority culture,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople think \u2018real France\u2019 is like us. It\u2019s not all these other people: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s good if they claim that they are French, but they\u2019re not white, they\u2019re not from Christian families, they don\u2019t come from a small village, we don\u2019t have enough dead people buried in the same cemeteries.\u2019\u2009\u201dFor decades the far right has been obsessed with a speech that the Algerian revolutionary leader Houari Boumediene supposedly gave in the 1970s, in which he predicted that one day the famished masses would travel from the south to the north in a wave of immigration that would be \u201cneither fraternal nor pacifist.\u201d France has been so transformed by terrorism \u2014 more than 230 deaths over nine attacks since 2015 \u2014 that a significant part of the intellectual and cultural establishment is now comfortably aligned with the far right. The Figaro columnist \u00c9ric Zemmour, a ubiquitous presence on TV and a top-selling nonfiction writer, asserted that the French Army has a secret plan, called Operation Brambles, to clear out Muslims from the suburbs, developed in consort with Israeli military specialists who refined their technique in Gaza. The ostensibly liberal feminist \u00c9lisabeth Badinter recently denounced in an introduction to \u201cFrance in Submission,\u201d a collection of testimonies from local politicians and civil servants about their battles with Islam, the \u201cseparatism, indeed secession\u201d sought by elements of society, and she encouraged the French to fight against \u201cthose who aspire to impose their laws and values on us.\u201dIn early March I attended a conference dedicated to de-Islamizing Europe. It was organized by a Catholic activist group and held in B\u00e9ziers, a southern town whose famously provocative mayor, Robert M\u00e9nard, warmly welcomed the attendees. The conference offered a daylong workshop in which to learn how to become a \u201cvector\u201d in society to fight against a plot cooked up by Islamic nations to set up colonies across Europe, by way of European Muslims, who were adherents of Sharia law. In attendance were a number of local officials from across the south, people who considered Marine Le Pen a liberal and were sworn devotees of her father. But there was also a couple sitting behind me who supported Fillon. They lived in Figeac, a small town north of Toulouse, and they had observed worrisome changes there over the last decade. There was more drug dealing, more crime, more incivility. The solution, they said, was to fight the spread of Islam.The ambivalence that many residents of La Courneuve exhibited toward the presidential campaign was reciprocated. Most of the candidates on the left made some effort to meet with organizations and businesses in the suburbs, but the candidates on the right mostly didn\u2019t bother. Marine Le Pen suggested that many of the terrorist attacks of the last few years could have been prevented by getting rid of \u201cthe birthright,\u201d automatic citizenship for anyone born on French soil.The remark made Yenbou want to cry. \u201cWhy,\u201d she said, \u201care you talking to me about Algeria and Morocco, I\u2019m talking about my country, France. I was born French, my parents were born French, it became Algeria later on, my grandparents were French, my great-grandparents were French, and I ask again: I don\u2019t have the right to criticize France, my country?\u201d She realized that these kinds of reactions were not fully conscious, but that didn\u2019t make them excusable. \u201cValues\u201d were something that only the country\u2019s minorities were required to prove they understood. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary that the idea of equality be taken into account, by everyone,\u201d Yenbou said. \u201cThere was a directive for teachers to talk about the values of the Republic in school, O.K. But when I learned that in the rich neighborhoods, teachers don\u2019t talk about values, what did they tell me? They said, \u2018But there\u2019s no problem with Republican values here \u2014 they know them.\u2019 Well, what about equality? Who will talk to these children in the rich neighborhoods about discrimination? Who will tell them that in our country, equality isn\u2019t real?\u201dThe Courneuviens I spoke with that weekend didn\u2019t hold out much hope for Macron. They were convinced he would turn out to be a continuation of Hollande, or worse. Legislative elections in June would determine whether Macron would be able to garner the power in Parliament to change the country\u2019s economy as he said he would; Bouteghm\u00e8s feared what Macron\u2019s plans to loosen regulations would do to the safety net, but he was loath to join the opposition of the aging far-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9l\u00e9nchon, who conducted politics as a personality cult and could be just as hostile to multiculturalism as other politicians of his generation. And if Le Pen won, well, one resident wondered whether it would \u201cbe possible to see the bad among the bad.\u201d Deciding between the two candidates, he said, was \u201clike being asked to choose your own death.\u201dElisabeth Zerofsky is a freelance writer living in Paris.

{"Headline": "Keep America Wild", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 1846, when he was 29, Henry David Thoreau tried to climb to the top of Mount Katahdin in Maine. Living in Massachusetts, where the virgin forest was long since cut down, Thoreau had never seen true wilderness, and the sheer power of the wild Maine woods sent him into an ecstasy of spiritual overload.Lost in fog at Katahdin\u2019s upper altitudes and defeated by the rugged mountain, Thoreau never did reach the summit. But his words have lived on in the deepest parts of the American mind, shaping this country\u2019s conscience toward nature. Last year, President Obama designated 87,563 acres of the land that so moved Thoreau as the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument \u2014 a win for the solid earth, the actual world.In a few weeks, Thoreau will turn 200, giving the nation a cause for celebrating. But just in time for the bicentennial, the Trump administration is considering stripping Katahdin Woods and Waters of its new designation.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke visited Katahdin this week as part of a systematic review of more than two dozen national monuments being considered for delisting. He\u2019s acting under the executive order of President Trump, who has called the creation of the monuments \u201cabuses.\u201d The president has set his developer\u2019s eye on public property, promising to \u201cfree it up\u201d and threatening that \u201ctremendously positive things are going to happen on that incredible land.\u201dOther targets for possible delisting include Basin and Range in Nevada, Canyons of the Ancients in Colorado, Grand Canyon-Parashant in Arizona, Craters of the Moon in Idaho and Giant Sequoia in California. A few of those locations might arguably have some economic potential beyond their incalculable worth as tourist destinations. The oil and gas industries have begun circling around the culturally significant Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, for example, with hopes of fracking it. Many of the monuments also serve as battlefields in the longstanding ideological war between federal power and states\u2019 rights.But such arguments over cash or ideology make no sense in the case of the Maine woods. Far from being a federal land grab, the more than 87,000 acres of forest and waters around Mount Katahdin were donated to this country by private owners, along with $40 million earmarked for the land\u2019s preservation and care in perpetuity. The land\u2019s status as a public monument has already begun to return considerable economic value to the local tourist economy.To his credit, Secretary Zinke concluded his visit to Katahdin by saying that he, at least, is comfortable with the site remaining in \u201cpublic hands.\u201d But the fight over this and other monuments across the country is far from over.Paul R. LePage, the Republican governor of Maine, opposed President Obama\u2019s creation of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, and he continues to oppose it. His opposition seems little more than an attempt to incite partisan rancor and now to ingratiate himself with the Trump administration, with an eye to aggrandizing his own political future. The fight to deprive the country of this public treasure feels like pure tribalism, sticking it in the eye of the enemy, like a boy defacing a prominent hillside just to leave his mark.Mount Katahdin stands as the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, the arrival and departure point of that 2,200-mile trek through what remains of Eastern American wilderness. The mountain shook Thoreau to his innermost core, and it still rocks countless American visitors who each year make the journey to experience it. How can it threaten us, to care for such a prize and its surroundings in common? Once we \u201cfree it up\u201d and spend these lands in the name of development, what then?In \u201cWalden,\u201d Thoreau wrote that a \u201cman is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.\u201d For Thoreau\u2019s 200th birthday, let\u2019s let the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument \u2014 and all those other deeply treasured, absurdly beautiful American vistas \u2014 alone. We can afford to.Let\u2019s call these places ours, the solid earth, the actual world, held and revered and looked after in common, as common members of this magnificent country. Let\u2019s make America rich again, as deliriously rich as it was on the day Thoreau tried to climb that wild mountain.Richard Powers is the author of 12 novels, including the forthcoming \u201cThe Overstory.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Governor Revives Stalled Transgender Bathroom Bill", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Gov. Greg Abbott reignited one of the most divisive issues in Texas politics on Tuesday, calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session of the Legislature in part to consider a bill that would reinforce the state\u2019s effort to regulate bathroom use by transgender people in public buildings.An attempt during the regular session by conservative lawmakers and pastors to pass legislation to regulate bathroom use had been unsuccessful by the time the session ended on Memorial Day. But on Tuesday, Mr. Abbott, a Republican, ordered a 30-day special session starting in July and put on the agenda a bathroom bill that would prevent municipalities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances designed to protect transgender people. The special-session agenda also includes bills that would limit property taxes and keep several state agencies operating.\u201cAt a minimum, we need a law that protects the privacy of our children in our public schools,\u201d Mr. Abbott told reporters at the Capitol in Austin.In doing so, Mr. Abbott ignored the concerns of local and national business leaders but earned swift praise from social conservatives, some of whom had complained that he had remained largely on the sidelines in the debate. Critics said Mr. Abbott, a former judge who is viewed by many as more cautious than his predecessor, Rick Perry, had capitulated to the extreme right, and to one of his Republican colleagues, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who led the push for the restrictions.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Patrick praised what he called the \u201cbig and bold special-session agenda,\u201d which he said \u201csolidly reflects the priorities of the people of Texas.\u201d\u201cMy take is that he is clearly panicked about the far right, and he feels the need to shovel as much red meat to the far right of his party as he can,\u201d said State Representative Chris Turner, a Democrat who was the campaign manager for Wendy Davis, Mr. Abbott\u2019s Democratic rival in 2014.In a recent interview at his Capitol office, Mr. Abbott pushed back against that idea. \u201cThe positions that I\u2019ve fought for in my first session and in this session are unalterable conservative principles, so it\u2019s just who I am,\u201d he said.Mr. Straus\u2019s attempt to loosen the bathroom restrictions in the House was rejected by Mr. Patrick and Senate leaders. The resulting stalemate threatened the operation of several state agencies, including the one that licenses doctors. The failure by the Legislature to pass legislation to keep those agencies operating put added pressure on Mr. Abbott to call a special session.\u201cA special session was entirely avoidable,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThere was plenty of time for the House and Senate to forge compromises.\u201dIt would effectively ban local regulation of discrimination. The bill would prohibit cities, counties and school districts from passing anti-discrimination measures to protect any class of people already protected under state law. And it would nullify existing policies in San Antonio, Dallas and other cities that allow transgender people to use the public bathroom that matches their gender identity.Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, and David Montgomery from Austin, Tex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit, Spending and Security: British Voters on the Issues", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The general election campaign in Britain has reached its final phase and voters must decide whether the country should continue on the course set by Prime Minister Theresa May and her Conservative Party, or change it.Here are selected responses, edited for length and clarity.For me it\u2019s all about Brexit. I voted \u201cRemain\u201d and feel that the Conservative and Labour parties are blindly leading us to a hard Brexit and the subsequent economic hardship that that will bring.I used to be a Conservative voter but that ended when Theresa May committed the country to a hard Brexit. I am now a member of the Liberal Democrats and have delivered 3,000 election leaflets in my local area. Brexit has stirred up a political rage inside me that didn\u2019t exist before!\u2014 Stephen Marfleet, 45, a teacher who lives in Solihull, in the West Midlands.I joined the Liberal Democrats the day after the E.U. referendum because I recognized they were the only party who would fight for my identity as a European citizen. This means more to me than any other policy on health or education as I am lucky to be middle class and comfortably off. I used to vote Labour when they were more centrist and not led by a Eurosceptic.\u2014 Esther Lam, 37, a private tutor in London.Over the following years, we will be going through the complicated process of becoming independent from the European Union. It is the right time for an election to input a government best equipped to take the country through this. Parliament should stand together and people need to accept the outcome of recent elections, rather than rail against it because they didn\u2019t get their way.\u2014 Rachel Tapp, 32, a children\u2019s social services manager in London. An election that was supposed to bring certainty and now looks like it will create more confusion. A Conservative win plunges us into years of Brexit chaos, a Labour win brings me a higher tax bill. I will vote Conservative but with a heavy heart. I don\u2019t believe May has run a good campaign and is showing herself to be out of her depth. Whereas Corbyn is not fit to govern in the slightest.\u2014 Stephen Moon, 60, a sports nutritionist who lives in London.Conservative. They seem more capable and more unified. They won\u2019t go crazy with the country\u2019s economy and will encourage more people to get jobs by keeping low benefit payments. The Labour Party shadow cabinet are incapable and inexperienced. I don\u2019t trust them to run the country. I want a clean break from the E.U. so that we can trade with the rest of the world as well as the E.U.\u2014 Paddy Goggin, 24, a student of business management in Manchester.Personally, a continued commitment to protect my rights as a worker once we leave the E.U. and the prospect of an extra 10,000 police officers. To live in a country where my children have the same opportunities as those who are born into great wealth and where the overbearing attitude isn\u2019t to look out solely for yourself before thinking of society as a whole. A nonprivatized N.H.S. and railways. More regulated energy companies. Hopefully lower bills. More housing. (Note: N.H.S. is the National Health Service.)Brexit is incredibly disruptive and unhelpful. We need to get beyond it quickly so we can start to plan with certainty. I\u2019ve always voted Tory and believed in its core ideology. Having this election was a smart move but the party is totally unprepared and has made a shambles of the campaign. Have been largely unimpressed with May so far despite feeling positive about her prior to the campaign.\u2014 Adam Ross, 36, lives with his family in London but works in Berlin at an online advertising company.\u2014 Jen Payne, 31, works at Goldsmiths, University of London. Having voted Conservative in the last election, on the vain hope that the party might stick to their manifesto pledges to improve the economic position of the U.K. in a stable way, I now see a party that does what it likes and pleases, as the country is focused on the issue of Europe. The party has projected their own divides over the issue onto the country at large, and has made life much worse for many people across the country as a result. I could agree with the former prime minister David Cameron\u2019s One-Nation conservatism, which had many liberal elements to it, but the current cabinet has lost the plot, and I can no longer support it.\u2014 David Lakin, 20, a student from Wales, currently studying abroad.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Commission Approves Billions in Aid for 2 Italian Banks", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sometimes creaky machinery of the European Union moved swiftly on Sunday to keep the struggles of two small Italian banks from undercutting confidence in the country\u2019s fragile banking system.Together, the two banks account for only 2 percent of Italian deposits. But there was a risk that their troubles could undermine confidence in other Italian banks, many of which suffer from bulging portfolios of problem loans and thin capital cushions.But Spanish banks are considered generally more resilient than Italian lenders. The risk of market turmoil in reaction to the difficulties of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca helped account for the unaccustomed speed displayed by the European authorities over the weekend, as well as the large injection of aid, which the Italian government said would initially amount to \u20ac5.2 billion. The Spanish government did not spend any taxpayer money to rescue Banco Popular.By late Sunday, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the Italian authorities had moved to make sure Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca would open for business as usual Monday. In addition to protecting depositors from losses, the plan will also spare investors who own so-called senior bonds in the two banks \u2014 debt that is supposed to be the safest from losses.However, owners of junior bonds, which earn a higher interest rate but are riskier, will lose their money. So will shareholders in the banks, which will eventually be liquidated. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy\u2019s second-largest bank, after UniCredit, is expected to acquire the healthy operations of the two banks for a symbolic purchase price.The money in the rescue plan will come out of a \u20ac20 billion fund established by the Italian government for the banking system. The fund, which recently received preliminary approval from Brussels, has been criticized for being at odds with vows by the government authorities not to spend taxpayer money to save sick banks.But in Italy, there is fear that imposing pain on middle-class depositors and investors \u2014 such as those who bought senior bonds in Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca \u2014 might drive people who suffered losses into the arms of extremist parties on the left or the right, adding to political turmoil in the country.The official explanation on Sunday for the state aid was that the failure of the two banks would be a threat to the economies of the northern Italian regions they serve. The Italian authorities said there was a good chance that the aid would eventually be recovered.\u201cThe commission decision allows Italy to take measures to facilitate the liquidation of the two banks,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner in charge of competition policy, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Grenfell Tower Fire, U.K. Asks: Has Deregulation Gone Too Far?", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is a partisan debate, wrapping in the bitterly fought election this month, the recent terrorist attacks in Manchester and London, the anger about rising inequality, and years of budget cutting that is generally known as austerity.Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative member of Parliament first elected in 2015, described Britain as, without question, \u201cdefinitely more divided on the issue.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the state as provider and the state as guarantor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while stepping away from the state as provider, we\u2019ve moved too far away from state as guarantor.\u201dSimon Tilford, an economist and deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London, said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the biggest challenge to this 40-year drive to marginalize or discredit the state and its role in the economy and society. Grenfell Tower had such impact because it symbolizes for many in Britain the retreat of the state, visible in badly maintained social housing and the failure to build more social housing.\u201dThe debate is an important one. Britain has been a laboratory of sorts for deregulation and the shrinking of the state since Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979. The concepts were embraced by the Conservatives and then by New Labour, and helped rescue the country from the gloom and strikes of the 1970s and early 1980s. The \u201cbig bang\u201d of deregulation of the financial industry gave rise to the London boom, turning it into a global city.The issues encapsulate the renewed ideological battle between the wounded but governing Conservative Party and the revived opposition Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn. A man of the harder left, Mr. Corbyn has brought back the arguments used against Mrs. Thatcher in the 1980s, calling for a reversal of the policies she championed \u2014 privatization, deregulation, corporate tax cuts, and a shrinking of the Labour-built, semi-socialist state.During the campaign, Mr. Corbyn and Labour called for renationalizing the railways, the water supply and some utilities, spending much more on social services like the National Health Service and social benefits and ending tuition fees at universities. After the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London, Mr. Corbyn, long an opponent of surveillance and enhanced police powers, called for more beat police officers, complaining about austerity and arguing that \u201cyou can\u2019t protect the public on the cheap.\u201dHis left-wing populism (marked by a longstanding contempt for American foreign policy) was a sharp break with the neoliberal consensus of the past 30 years or so, which included Labour\u2019s last prime ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. But the Grenfell Tower fire, Mr. Freedland said, \u201cappeared to make the Corbyn argument for him.\u201dWhile preparing a platform for the June election, Prime Minister Theresa May sensed the mood turning against austerity, loosening debt targets, trying to reach out to disaffected working-class voters and penalizing, though mildly, the better-off. But her campaign ended in tears, and \u201cMayism\u201d has had a shorter life than the Edsel.Mrs. Thatcher is often held up as the icon of the Conservative Party\u2019s move to shrink what she called \u201cthe nanny state,\u201d which she felt promoted dependency instead of initiative.Mrs. Thatcher introduced the \u201cright to buy\u201d social housing to its tenants in 1980, in an effort to promote homeownership and responsibility. Over time, the nature of social housing changed, as some apartments simply became private rental properties \u2014 including an unknown number in Grenfell Tower itself \u2014 though their maintenance was controlled by the local council through a nonprofit management agency. And local councils did not build housing fast enough to keep up with demand, especially in big cities.Under Conservative efforts since 2010 to reduce the national budget and the national debt, state funding was reduced or frozen for many parts of the government, including local councils. Deregulation also meant outsourcing responsibility for fire inspections to owners and builders, instead of civil servants. Private companies were required to use \u201cauthorized inspectors\u201d for fire safety, but, as Mr. Freedland pointed out, they worked for builders and developers, and \u201cthere was a classic conflict of interest.\u201dHere the two trends of saving money and deregulation come together: The council had recently spent some $11 million on Grenfell Tower to insulate apartments and cut energy costs, using cladding that was approved under existing building regulations. And those regulations, however inadequate they have proved, are the same for all buildings, not just those of the poor.The cladding aside, there were other fire-safety issues that were not dealt with by anyone, including the questionable installation of new gas pipes, inadequate fire proofing, and the lack of a central fire alarm or a sprinkler system, though neither was required for a structure built in 1974.Still, as Mr. Lammy, the Labour lawmaker, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t contract out everything to the private sector. The private sector can do some wonderful things, but they have for-profit motives, they cut corners. We\u2019ve all been up to those tower blocks \u2014 they exist right across the country. Where are the fire extinguishers on every corridor? Where are the hoses? Are the fire doors really working? Where are the sprinklers?\u201dThe questions are the right ones. But the fight over who is responsible, and over the causes and solutions, will continue, and will continue to mark British politics, divided more now than at any time since the election of Mrs. Thatcher.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Will Be Part of a Popular Stock Index, Opening the Door to Foreign Money", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s effort to open its door to foreign investors has received a big push, as its stocks were accepted into a closely followed global index.The index provider MSCI announced in New York on Tuesday that it would add domestic Chinese stocks to its influential emerging markets benchmark. As a result, investment funds representing $1.6 trillion will be under heavy but informal pressure to start buying Chinese domestic stocks next year, leading to $17 billion in fresh money being pumped into the stock markets, according to MSCI.Currently, foreign investors own just under 1.5 percent of Chinese stocks.The decision is a symbolic victory for China. The Chinese government had lobbied MSCI for years to include in its indexes the so-called A shares traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets.Those stocks would account for just 0.73 percent of the overall MSCI emerging market index at first. But that share could grow if China continues to reform its financial markets.\u201cMSCI is very hopeful that the momentum of positive change witnessed in China over the past years will continue to accelerate,\u201d the index company said.Many investors measure the performance of money managers, like mutual fund and hedge fund managers, against MSCI indexes. That puts pressure on active managers to buy the shares in the index, and then add or subtract a few stocks in an effort to beat the index.China\u2019s inclusion, even on a limited scale, means that money managers will find the indexes more attractive. Many investors have also gravitated toward index funds that try to match the indexes directly, by buying all or nearly all of the stocks in them.The Chinese government had long sought MSCI inclusion because it could help establish Shanghai and Shenzhen as global financial centers.It could also push international money managers to pay more attention to corporate governance in China and demand that Chinese executives improve business practices, such as providing greater financial disclosure and limiting insider transactions.\u201cMSCI inclusion not only mandated global investors to allocate more funding into the Chinese A share market, but also provided a much-needed impetus to move Chinese stock markets closer to global standards,\u201d said Shen Jianguang, a China economist at Mizhuho Securities.\u201cHaving exhausted the ability to use state-owned banks as A.T.M.s, Beijing would love to entice foreign money into China\u2019s stock and bond markets,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, a China specialist at Enodo Economics, a financial advisory firm. \u201cBut the MSCI symbolic move falls well short of diverting global passive money into China\u2019s equity markets.\u201dAt the Lujiazui Forum, an annual gathering of top Chinese economic and financial policy makers in Shanghai, Chinese officials underlined on Tuesday their desire for foreign participation in the country\u2019s financial markets.\u201cThe financial service industry is a competitive service industry which benefits from opening up, and will continue to expand its opening up,\u201d said Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the country\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China.But international companies have to some extent been exempted from those restrictions, particularly since the start of this year, in an effort to convince them that if they put more money into China, they will be able to take it out someday. Limits on the repatriation of dividends have been removed, and limits on foreign trading of Chinese bonds have been lightened.On the previous occasions that MSCI chose not to include Chinese shares, it was also considering whether to include them as a sizable percentage of its emerging markets index. The index company disclosed in a draft paper this year that it was considering a much smaller percentage role for Chinese shares in its emerging market index than in previous years, notably by reducing by two-thirds the number of Chinese stocks that would be tracked in the index.Chinese shares traded on markets outside mainland China, such as in Hong Kong, already represent the largest concentration of companies from a single country in the MSCI emerging markets index, fluctuating at about a quarter of the entire index.While China received a greenlight from MSCI, another emerging market hopeful, Argentina, was not so lucky.Despite Argentina\u2019s successful sale of a 100-year government bond on Monday, the index company said it was not ready to upgrade the country to its emerging markets index because recent market reforms \u201cneeded to remain in place for a longer time period to be deemed irreversible.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong, and Alexandra Stevenson from New York.

{"Headline": "What a World Tour of Tax Codes Can Teach the U.S. About How to Reform Its Own", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Tax ranks high among global economic activities. Federal taxes alone constitute more than a quarter of the American economy. Including state and local levies brings the total tax burden to more than a quarter of Gross Domestic Product. Taxes account for about 45 percent of the economies of Denmark, France and Belgium, while in less prosperous countries like Chile and Mexico taxes are a fifth or less of the economy. Overall taxes, and disguised taxes like government fees, account for about 21 percent of the global economy. Given those numbers, researchers coming here from another planet might report back home that Earthlings love taxes, especially those humans living in rich countries, because high-tax countries tend to be the most prosperous.Of course, we don\u2019t even like taxes, ranking the subject near death among those things we find most disagreeable. That\u2019s because we think of what we could do with the money we are forced to part with more often than we contemplate how taxes finance benefits like education, infrastructure, justice and the military, which form the foundations of both liberty and private wealth creation. We don\u2019t think much about the fact that in a society with no taxes the ruthless rule, free to take our property and our lives, while as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, taxes buy us civilization.Our aversion to considering the benefits of taxes helps explain why, as T. R. Reid shows in his charming book, \u201cA Fine Mess,\u201d our elected leaders piece together tax systems far more complex than Rube Goldberg machines. This aversion also helps explain why we keep voting for politicians who hand out tax favors to the political donor class, creating a system that burdens some heavily while allowing others, like Donald Trump, to boast that not paying taxes shows they are smart. Under our current tax system multinational companies and some individuals literally turn the burden of taxes into a profit center, an open secret among top tax accountants and lawyers.Reid takes us on a world tour of tax systems and the efforts to reform them. He approaches this most disliked specialty of the dismal science of economics with a wry voice and a light touch. And while his reporting includes some technical flaws, they are mere lint on a rich and sturdy fabric of facts presented in plain English.As a longtime Washington Post foreign correspondent, Reid knows how to make the distant seem close. His eye for the telling detail is sharp.For example, a running thread through the book involves tax simplification. After Senate Republicans staged hearings in 1997 and 1998 on supposed abuses of taxpayers (the testimony was later shown to be malarkey), Congress enacted an anticomplexity provision: \u201csubsection IX of subpart (ii) of Section 7803(c)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201dReid shows how the design of a tax system can enhance rather than hobble economies. He cites tax reforms in Estonia, a hotbed of digital age innovation, and New Zealand, which despite few natural resources and a remote location, prospers by importing tourists and exporting wines. In both cases a tax code redesign was central to economic success. He also shows that sometimes tax changes work out because of luck or economic circumstances that are fleeting.Americans are accustomed to regarding the I.R.S. as the source of their tax miseries. Reid relates what happened when Congress considered impeaching John Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner, in 2016. \u201cI didn\u2019t write the tax laws, Congressman,\u201d Koskinen testified. \u201cYou did that.\u201dReid smoothly explains the concept of tax expenditures. These totaled about $1.2 trillion in 2014, almost as much as the $1.4 trillion that individuals paid in federal income taxes. When Congress makes mortgage interest tax deductible or gives a tax credit for purchases of plug-in electric cars it is the same as if Congress wrote a check to homeowners and Chevy Volt drivers like my wife and me. Fewer than half of homeowners take the mortgage interest deduction and only the affluent buy electric cars, showing how tax expenditures are stealth welfare for people who don\u2019t need a government handout. Reid argues that \u201cif a government giveaway is justified by social benefits, its backers should make their case and ask Congress to appropriate the money\u201d because a $1 tax break and a $1 government-issued check are, in economics, the same thing.Reid does not recommend what tax expenditures, if any, should be eliminated. He just uses plain English to explain the concept and others, especially how Congress enables offshore tax avoidance by the rich and multinational corporations. His one overall recommendation for tax reform is simplify, simplify, simplify.Those unfamiliar with economics, accounting or tax law will be better able to understand these subjects by reading \u201cA Fine Mess.\u201d It will help them grasp why our tax code, designed more than a century ago for a national industrial economy, is so at odds with our 21st-century needs, and why, instead of helping us prosper, it throws sand in the gears of commerce. With enough readers, Reid might even help us to initiate real tax reform by replacing a tax code so complex it includes the anti-complexity rule in Section 7803(c)(2)(B).David Cay Johnston, who was awarded a 2001 Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of taxes in The New York Times, is drafting a new federal tax code for the 21st-century economy that he calls the Prosperity Tax.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airbnb Hosts More Likely to Reject the Disabled, a Study Finds", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Crystal Marie Garcia decided to try the home-rental service Airbnb for the first time, she had a few questions.Ms. Garcia, who is from El Paso, was planning a May trip with her family to the Chicago area and wanted to know if the places she was considering could accommodate her needs as someone with muscular dystrophy. Unfortunately, she said, her questions appeared to scare off at least two potential hosts.She said she feels that if she had not mentioned her disability, \u201cthey would have rented to me, no issue.\u201dHosts granted preapproval to 75 percent of travelers who made no mention of a disability, according to the study. That rate fell to 61 percent for those who said they had dwarfism, 50 percent for those with blindness, 43 percent for those with cerebral palsy and just 25 percent for those with spinal cord injuries.Some of that disparity can be explained by hosts who followed up with questions for the travelers with disabilities, the researchers said, thus preventing the request from being classified as preapproved. Requests were sent to hosts throughout the country over a nearly six-month period last year.The researchers could not solely blame the findings on personal prejudice. They said physical inaccessibility was a major factor behind the disparity in hosts\u2019 responses. That, they said, raised concerns that businesses like Airbnb could exclude users with disabilities even as they expand access to services over all.\u201cHere\u2019s the flip side of our tech revolution: Platforms like Airbnb seem to be perpetuating or increasing opportunities for exclusion, both economic and social,\u201d said Lisa Schur, a professor in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations and one of the study authors.Still, like many businesses in the sharing economy, Airbnb operates in a regulatory haze, and protections imposed on other forms of lodging under the Americans with Disabilities Act may not always apply to Airbnb listings, which are often a homeowner\u2019s primary or secondary residence.\u201cIf we\u2019re entering an era where these new types of hotels, which are essentially private homes, can\u2019t offer accommodations, it defeats and undoes all of the progress we\u2019ve made with the A.D.A. as far as equal access is concerned,\u201d said Mason Ameri, one of the authors of the Rutgers study and a postdoctoral fellow at the university\u2019s School of Management and Labor Relations. \u201cThe law needs to catch up with services like Airbnb.\u201dAlice Wong, a former member of the National Council on Disability and founder of the Disability Visibility Project, said that if Airbnb did not lay out and enforce strict guidelines for listings that claim to be handicapped accessible, the company was making a false promise to travelers.\u201cDiscrimination is often based on ignorance,\u201d said Ms. Wong, who is in a wheelchair. \u201cPeople with disabilities deviate from the image of a typical customer, so the way they are discriminated against is hard to pin down but very real.\u201dSome hosts in the study, like the ones who denied Ms. Garcia, rejected inquiries from Mr. Ameri and his colleagues with little explanation. Others referred the fictitious traveler to listings that could better accommodate their needs or asked what could be done to make the listed space more accessible. A few made rude or insensitive remarks.To improve access to homes by the disabled, the researchers suggest that Airbnb make sure hosts understand and follow federal disability guidelines, and engage with advocacy organizations and travelers with disabilities to understand their needs and frustrations.Technology has long created opportunities for people with disabilities, Ms. Wong said, whose life has been \u201ctremendously positively impacted by tech,\u201d she said.\u201cBut tech is really slow to catch up with regard to human rights issues,\u201d she added. \u201cThe new platforms amplify the way people already do things.

Without naming the United States or the Trump administration, he also said that it was wrong to blame free trade for economic or social problems.\u201cWhen we sprain an ankle when walking on the road, we should not blame the road and stop walking,\u201d Mr. Li said, later adding that \u201cin international economic relations, one should not impose unilateral rules.\u201d\u201cOnly in this way can we achieve free and fair trade.\u201dMr. Li\u2019s stance nonetheless represents a clear contrast to the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric, said Eswar Prasad, a Brookings Institution specialist in trade and monetary policy who is attending the conference. \u201cThere\u2019s really a cognitive dissonance coming from Washington to here,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cWashington is all about tearing down things.\u201dYet while Mr. Li briefly mentioned that China would open up its services and manufacturing sectors, a repeated Chinese promise over the last quarter-century, he offered no details. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has repeatedly accused China of being the most heavily protected large economy in the world.World Trade Organization data shows that China has much higher tariffs on imports than the United States, the European Union or Japan, though its tariffs are lower than those of some developing countries such as India. China also has many regulatory barriers to imports and consistently runs large trade surpluses, particularly in manufacturing \u2014 a category that has created tens of millions of jobs in China as companies around the world have moved factories to the country.Mr. Li also addressed two other subjects of broad economic interest during his keynote speech: financial risks in China, and the country\u2019s long but gradual slowing of economic growth.China\u2019s steeply rising level of domestic debt recently prompted Moody\u2019s to downgrade the country\u2019s sovereign debt. Bank lending has been rising strongly, although much of it is to state-owned companies with implicit government guarantees of repayment.Chinese bankers and insurers have increased sales of often speculative, weakly regulated investments called wealth management products to raise money for loans to real estate developers and small and medium-size businesses. Small and medium-size businesses are also borrowing heavily from peer-to-peer internet lending groups and other new, lightly regulated financial innovators.Mr. Li acknowledged financial risks and provided a broad assurance that they would be managed. But he provided no details on how this would be done and emphasized the importance of continued economic growth \u2014 the latest hint of the government\u2019s wariness of cracking down too hard on lending for fear of hurting growth.\u201cWe do not deny these risks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very aware of these risks, but lack of development is the greatest risk.\u201dThe Chinese economy grew 6.9 percent in the first quarter, helped partly by a flood of credit. Mr. Li said that the growth momentum in the first quarter was continuing in the second quarter.But he also cautioned that the sheer size of the Chinese economy these days no longer makes it feasible for the economy to grow at the double-digit rates it used to achieve, and he offered what he said was his favorite explanation for why this was the case.\u201cFor a little child to do a dozen somersaults at one go is quite easy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for an adult to do even three or four somersaults is quite an accomplishment.\u201dMr. Li did mention the importance of \u201cstability,\u201d a favorite term of China\u2019s Communist leaders, who like to attribute to a lack of social stability the country\u2019s severely lagging economic performance for several centuries, until the last three decades. As the world faces a variety of economic challenges, Mr. Li said, \u201cwe are responding to those changes and uncertainties with stability.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherAdvertisement"}

The Diridon station plan does not immediately address this problem: It calls for office space for 15,000 to 20,000 workers and only 2,500 units of housing, according to the mayor.But through a web of public transportation it could connect Silicon Valley to more affordable areas.By 2025, Diridon station would host Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains and, if fierce opposition by the state\u2019s Republican Congressional delegation is overcome, a high-speed rail line already under construction in the central valley, which would allow someone to live in Fresno and get to San Jose in less than an hour.Diridon station, named after Rod Diridon, a tireless advocate of public transport for the Bay Area and already a hub for Amtrak, Caltrain and San Jose\u2019s light-rail system, will be the \u201clargest intermodal transit hub in the West,\u201d according to the mayor.\u201cThis is very early on,\u201d Mr. Liccardo said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even started dating yet and folks are already talking about the size of the ring.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Stretching across a bend in the Sacramento River, the Tower Bridge serves as the western portal to the city\u2019s downtown.Shelley Green, a reader from Vacaville, shared a photo she captured of the bridge lit up against the night sky.The vertical lift bridge was erected during the Great Depression to relieve transportation pressure in the fast-growing city.Built in the Streamline Moderne architectural style, it became a beacon of civic optimism.Gov. Frank Merriam declared during the bridge\u2019s dedication in 1935: \u201cCalifornia during the Depression has been a bridge building state. And the bridge right here is the most beautiful.\u201dAside from the Capitol dome, the Tower Bridge remains Sacramento\u2019s most visible landmark.In recent years, it\u2019s also been the setting for one of the hottest events of the city\u2019s social calendar.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Stopping Pandemics Before They Start", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesImagine that enemies possessed a class of weapons with which they attacked your people from time to time. Decades could go by with no attack, but eventually one would come. Imagine also that these weapons were growing more potent, and the attacks were becoming more frequent.Now imagine that there was a way to protect your people from these threats. But making it would be expensive, and could take years. So it was not being made.Each attack brought death, panic and an outcry: \u201cWhere is our defense? Why are we not protected?\u201d But as soon as the attack passed, so did interest in preparing for the next one.As you probably have guessed, this is about Ebola. And SARS. And Zika. And MERS, bird flu, swine flu, Lassa fever, Marburg, Rift Valley fever and the whole range of pathogens \u2014 including the ones we don\u2019t know about yet \u2014 that can rapidly go from outbreak to epidemic to pandemic.These diseases are not going away. They are called zoonoses, which means they are harbored in animal populations \u2014 pigs, monkeys, bats, camels, birds \u2014 and so can never be eradicated.\u201cThere will be more and more outbreaks developing into big epidemics,\u201d said Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the first head of Unaids. (He was also a member of the group that discovered the Ebola virus.) \u201cWith greater mobility, population pressures and climate change, we\u2019ll see more of that.\u201dA United Nations panel studying epidemics recently concluded: \u201cThe emergence of a highly pathogenic influenza virus, which could rapidly result in millions of deaths and cause major social, economic and political disruption, is not an unlikely scenario.\u201dWhy don\u2019t we develop vaccines for these pathogens? Many are relatively uncomplicated \u2014 scientifically.But they are economically complicated. Developing a new vaccine costs hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 and that\u2019s to make a product with no commercial demand. No pharmaceutical executive could be expected to put that kind of money into a product that would be needed largely by poor people in poor countries \u2014 if it\u2019s ever needed at all.And they are politically complicated. Outbreaks tend to begin, and spread most widely, in countries where people live in proximity to animals, especially where the surveillance and health systems are poor.\u201cWe\u2019re always fighting to make sure it\u2019s about caring about people who are affected, and not defending yourself from the affected person,\u201d said Joanne Liu, international president of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders).Building a wall against disease is not only an ugly strategy; it\u2019s a losing strategy. Ebola, swine flu, Zika, and SARS all reached wealthy countries. What protected Americans from Ebola was ending the epidemic. And that meant \u2014 among other strategies \u2014 creating vaccines.In January 2016, Piot led a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with pharmaceutical executives, government ministers, epidemiologists and foundations such as Gates and Britain\u2019s Wellcome Trust. Officials from Norway and India were particularly active. \u201cWe were trying to determine, is there an appetite for this?\u201d said Piot. \u201cIs there a need for this? There were different opinions about how to do it, but the answer was yes. Ebola was the wake-up call.\u201dAt Davos a year later, CEPI was officially started \u2014 an unusually fast beginning in a world that routinely sleeps through endless wake up calls. Its headquarters are in Oslo, with offices in London and New Delhi so far. Richard Hatchett, an American, became CEPI\u2019s chief executive in mid-April. He said the organization wants to raise a billion dollars for its first five years and has raised nearly $800 million so far \u2014 from the governments of Norway, Japan and Germany, the European Commission, Gates and Wellcome. India is preparing a donation.A lot of money? Not if you\u2019re talking about vaccine development.Over the next five years, CEPI aims to develop multiple viable vaccine candidates against three pathogens: Lassa fever, Nipah and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The three were chosen because they are geographically diverse, having stricken Africa, South Asia and the Middle East in recent outbreaks with high fatality rates. And vaccines for those diseases looked promising.The organization plans to take these candidates through all the trials and regulatory approvals possible before an outbreak, and then to produce a stockpile of vaccines that can be quickly tested for efficacy \u2014 and then used \u2014 during an epidemic.Developing a vaccine is never easy, and getting it approved can be even more complex, possibly requiring assent from every country that could be hit. One of CEPI\u2019s goals is to create simpler, more agile structures for approvals.CEPI\u2019s second goal is to create a vaccine delivery system that can be quickly adapted to stem new pathogens \u2014 just as scientists simply plug a new strain into the flu vaccine each year. Once the vector is fully proven, a new agent or strain requires little testing.That became possible because promising vaccine candidates had been sitting in storage in Canada and the United States; they had been developed by researchers worried that a terrorist might weaponize Ebola. The W.H.O. coordinated a huge effort to get them tested, approved, produced and into the field in just six months. The process can normally take a decade.No large-scale efficacy trials were possible, however, because the epidemic was winding down by the time candidates were ready. Still, in Guinea, one of the candidates was used on an investigatory basis, employing a method called ring vaccination \u2014 in which an Ebola patient is identified, and all of his or her contacts are vaccinated. The vaccine proved 100 percent effective, and finally ended that epidemic.Nevertheless, it still lacks the formal approvals needed for large-scale production and use. And other promising candidates need to be developed as well.CEPI has no manufacturing facilities. It will, instead, finance research and development at pharmaceutical or biotech companies. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just giving the money and going away,\u201d said Hatchett. \u201cWe have internal experts and capabilities. And through our partnership with the World Health Organization, I would hope to be able to facilitate connections with public health officials and scientists in countries at risk.\u201dCreating vaccines is not the same as guaranteeing that people who need them can get them. CEPI will require its awardees to sell vaccines to the poorest and lower-middle-income countries (more likely, to donors who will buy vaccine for them) at the lowest possible price.CEPI also agreed to cede intellectual property to the companies \u2014 also business as usual. Hatchett said that CEPI will retain the rights to use the knowledge if manufacturing partners can\u2019t or won\u2019t meet their obligations.Rohit Malpani, director of policy and analysis at MSF, points out that such rights exist in the United States when the government funds drug development \u2014 but they have never been used. The pharmaceutical industry is too powerful. \u201cCEPI will pay for it, so they should own it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like to see a public return on public investment.\u201dCEPI\u2019s value may go beyond the success of any single vaccine. The organization\u2019s ability to streamline a vaccine process will likely matter more than any new product, said Seth Berkley, the chief executive of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, which works with pharmaceutical companies to gain accessibility to vaccines for poor countries. \u201cIf they are successful in building a vector that can be rapidly scaled up for new agents, in how to do regulatory approvals, in how to do rapid clinical trials, that will be very useful.\u201dThe biggest threat to this mission is not scientific, but political \u2014 our short attention span. \u201cTrying to raise money for Ebola now is impossible,\u201d said Berkley. \u201cThe same with yellow fever, Zika, cholera. The biggest problem will be sticking with the program and having consistent long-term financing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The move is the latest in a series of steps taken by Mr. Pruitt to relax or delay several major environmental regulations put forth by the Obama administration under the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. Mr. Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, had in his previous position taken a leading role in many multistate lawsuits against those regulations, calling them deeply burdensome to industry.The oil-refining industry had led a multiyear lobbying campaign against the ozone rules, complaining that the regulations would require them to install costly equipment to remove the smog-causing chemicals from gasoline and other fuels. And Republican lawmakers who have long complained against President Barack Obama\u2019s regulatory agenda cheered the delay.But environmental groups assailed it as a move by allies of the fossil fuel industry granting favors to industry cronies.\u201cThe delay is flagrantly illegal as well as a direct assault on our right to breathe safe, clean air,\u201d said John Walke, the director of the clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Driven Off Course: How Volkswagen Got on the Road to Scandal", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionOn Sept. 18, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency accused Volkswagen of equipping its diesel engines with software that circumvented emissions testing, thereby allowing some of its cars to emit a particularly noxious substance, nitrogen oxide, in amounts that were as high as 40 times the legal limits. Since that time, Volkswagen has pleaded guilty to civil and criminal charges and paid over $20 billion in fines, and six executives have been charged with running a decade-long scheme to equip Volkswagen diesel engines with that software \u2014 nicknamed \u201cdefeat devices\u201d \u2014 which makes an engine appear to meet emissions standards only when it\u2019s being tested in a lab.This will go down in history books as a great corporate scandal, but the story told by the New York Times reporter Jack Ewing in his new book, \u201cFaster, Higher, Farther: The Volkswagen Scandal,\u201d is also much more than that. It\u2019s a rich history of a company whose cars, for better and worse, have touched millions of lives, a character study of a brilliant but deeply flawed leader, and a case study in how a corporate culture can turn toxic \u2014 or as Ewing writes, Volkswagen \u201cvividly shows how a dysfunctional corporate culture can threaten the existence of even the mightiest corporations.\u201dVolkswagen\u2019s rise to a global powerhouse was itself, in a way, a sleight of hand. Ferdinand Porsche, who designed what became the company\u2019s first and signature car, the Beetle, was a favorite of Hitler\u2019s. The Beetle was originally called the \u201cStrength Through Joy Car\u201d and was part of Hitler\u2019s plan to provide an affordable car to every German. Very few were produced during the war, as the Volkswagen factory in Fallersleben instead was used mostly for military production and staffed by forced labor, including Jews and prisoners of war. Porsche \u201cwas so focused on technical and production goals that he willfully ignored the human cost,\u201d Ewing writes.Despite the horrible history, the Porsche family somehow managed to keep hold of the license for Volkswagen design. Even more, thanks to a brilliant advertising campaign, Volkswagen Beetles and vans, decked out with psychedelic colors, became a ubiquitous symbol not of war, but rather of peace, love and understanding: \u201cThe transformation of the Volkswagen from Nazi propaganda project to counterculture phenomenon was one of the most spectacular examples of rebranding in the history of marketing.\u201dEwing also tells the tangled, intertwined history of Porsche and Volkswagen, and the families who ruled the companies, but it is Porsche\u2019s grandson, Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, who is the central character in this book. Pi\u00ebch, who whether through luck or consummate corporate skill was ousted from his role at Volkswagen just before the world learned about the emissions scandal, was a visionary engineer. \u201cLike Steve Jobs at Apple, Pi\u00ebch was among a handful of executives who put an unmistakable personal stamp on the companies they ran,\u201d Ewing writes. But he was also a demanding boss whose style created a saying at Volkswagen \u2014 \u201cImpossible doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d His rise to power was greased by corporate machinations that would make Machiavelli proud. His fearsome style of management \u201cemboldened subordinates to behave the same way toward their underlings,\u201d Ewing notes. \u201cThat is how corporate cultures \u2014 the unwritten rules that govern behavior inside a large organization \u2014 come into being.\u201dEwing makes a compelling case that it was Pi\u00ebch who \u201ccreated a company culture that allowed the diesel fraud to fester,\u201d a culture in which there were few clear guidelines about ethical limits and \u201cunderlings always suffered the consequences.\u201d During his tenure, there was both an infamous sex scandal and a dramatic case of corporate espionage, both of which led to criminal investigations and neither of which caused any soul searching within the company or any renewed focus on ethics. Not only did Pi\u00ebch want market leadership, but he \u201cwanted total dominance,\u201d Ewing writes, \u201cand he was prepared to deploy new tactics to achieve it, whatever the consequences.\u201dSince Volkswagen didn\u2019t want to make those trade-offs \u2014 doing so might affect its goal to become the world\u2019s largest automaker \u2014 the company\u2019s engineers arrived at a technical impasse. The answer? To cheat, of course, by using a defeat device. \u201cThere was a tolerance for breaking the rules and a lack of checks and balances. \u2026 Employees who had reservations about the illegal software \u2014 and there were some \u2014 had no place to turn,\u201d Ewing writes. And \u201chigher-ups overruled engineers who objected to the illegal software.\u201dWhat adds a special layer to the Volkswagen scandal, though, is that the company didn\u2019t stop at cheating. In effect, Volkswagen doubled down on its bad behavior by putting out an immense advertising campaign to convince American buyers that they were doing the environmentally virtuous thing by buying a diesel car. It worked, in one way. \u201cVolkswagen was single-handedly responsible for a sixfold increase in diesel passenger car sales in the United States,\u201d Ewing writes. But as he also notes, \u201cThat strategy elevated the emissions cheating from a mere violation of regulations to a gigantic consumer fraud.\u201dThe engineers didn\u2019t think they could get caught, because they didn\u2019t know that it was possible to measure emissions from a car that was actually being driven on a road. In car world, emissions technology is so uncool that it had become the specialty of the not-so-prestigious West Virginia University, which was one of the few places willing to take it on. But under the leadership of Dan Carder (who eventually was named one of Time magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People of 2016 for his work), West Virginia University had made huge advances. And when a European regulator came knocking in search of an answer as to how diesels in the United States were complying with clean air rules, Carder\u2019s team found that in fact, Volkswagens were not. \u201cWe never set out to get crosswise with anyone,\u201d Carder said later. \u201cWe were just kind of doing our jobs.\u201dAs the truth very slowly began to come to light, Volkswagen, instead of taking the opportunity to be transparent, once again doubled, or maybe quadrupled, down. Ewing recounts a pleading email in May 2015 in which a Volkswagen engineer who is being asked by regulators for data writes to his managers, \u201cCome up with the story please!\u201d According to the eventual criminal plea, Volkswagen executives \u201cconcocted an elaborate cover up when regulators became suspicious, and \u2026destroyed evidence once they realized they would be exposed,\u201d Ewing writes. \u201cVolkswagen was portrayed as a place where the people in charge were all too willing to resort to illegal behavior to fulfill the company\u2019s ambitions.\u201dEwing also details how, for a long time, Volkswagen tried to pass it all off as the fault of a small group of low-level employees, a scenario he calls \u201cimprobable.\u201d While the man who had replaced Pi\u00ebch as chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, was forced to step down as the scandal grew, Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board did not discipline any members of the management board. In fact, they not only kept their jobs and most of their bonuses, but there haven\u2019t been any legal consequences for them, either \u2014 at least, not yet.If there\u2019s a weakness to Ewing\u2019s book, it\u2019s that the saga is still taking place, and all the evidence hasn\u2019t yet come to light, so the book is lacking in some of the you-were-there drama of who did what when. It\u2019s more a story of how Pi\u00ebch, and to some degree Winterkorn, established a culture where something like this could and did happen. But then again, maybe that\u2019s the truer telling of the story.Bethany McLean is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and a co-author, with Joe Nocera, of \u201cAll the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Paris Climate Deal: What You Need to Know", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump announced Thursday that he would pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. The decision makes good on a campaign promise and aligns with Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d message. It is also a major setback for the worldwide effort to combat global warming.What does the decision mean? We have extensive coverage here at The New York Times, but it is a complex issue and you may be wondering where to start.In December 2015, nearly every country in the world \u2014 195 in all \u2014 agreed to the first global pact aimed at reducing emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. It was a landmark diplomatic achievement and the pinnacle of President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental agenda.Scientific studies show that if the world\u2019s carbon emissions continue unchecked, atmospheric temperatures will continue to rise. The planet won\u2019t just be hotter, but it will also suffer from rising sea levels, more powerful storms, droughts that lead to food shortages and other extreme conditions.The idea of the Paris climate accord was that every country, rich and poor, would set goals to curb carbon emissions in an effort to avert the worst effects of climate change.The president has called climate change a hoax, and he pledged during the campaign to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris deal. Few expected him to announce that the United States would remain committed to the pact.Mr. Trump is now making clear his belief that joint global action on climate change is antagonistic to his \u201cAmerica first\u201d message and could be harmful to the economy. Environmental advocates dispute the argument that the Paris accord would cost jobs.Under the terms of the agreement, the United States cannot exit until Nov. 4, 2020 \u2014 the day after the next presidential election. That could make climate change a future campaign issue.While Americans make up just over 4 percent of the world\u2019s population, they are responsible for almost a third of the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. China emits more carbon into the atmosphere today, but as our climate reporter Justin Gillis explains, the United States has a long head start on burning coal, oil and natural gas. Some said it was a moral imperative for the United States to stay in the Paris pact.But since Mr. Trump has decided to leave, other countries \u2014 especially the poorer ones \u2014 could consider doing the same. That could reverse years of hard-won progress on climate change.The United States will join Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries that are not a part of the Paris agreement.The red line shows what will happen to carbon emissions without the Paris agreement: up, up, up. The United States\u2019 contribution to the emissions goal was substantial. But other countries have pledged to continue their programs with or without American participation.Advertisement"}

I market and sell my own product that I have total control over.\u201dMr. Trump and White House officials outlined several major reversals to Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, most notably scaling back the ability of Americans to travel to Cuba, which Mr. Obama had vastly expanded. Mr. Trump is also curtailing American transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military, which largely runs the tourism industry.Mr. Trump said the restrictions would pressure the Cuban authorities to embrace democracy and human rights by cutting off one of their most important lines of income \u2014 American dollars.\u201cFor nearly six decades, the people of Cuba have suffered under Communist domination,\u201d Mr. Trump said Friday in Miami after calling out the names of Cuban dissidents in the crowd. \u201cThe previous administration\u2019s easing of restrictions on travel and trade does not help the Cuban people. They only enrich the Cuban regime.\u201dBut from the perspective of many Cubans, the biggest victim will not be the state. Instead, they say, the small but growing group of entrepreneurs who have ridden the wave of tourism to a prosperity unthinkable even a few years ago will feel the brunt of the restrictions.\u201cThey want to return to a failed policy,\u201d said Carlos Alzugaray, a former Cuban diplomat in Havana. \u201cThe failed policy is that by punishing Cuba and the Cuban people, they can produce a regime change in Cuba. That was the old way of thinking, and that didn\u2019t work.\u201dHundreds of thousands of American visitors have landed in Cuba over the past two years, bringing an enormous infusion of cash into an anemic economy that has long been starved of foreign currency.Under the new policy described by the White House, Americans will be restricted from spending money at many military-controlled enterprises, like restaurants and hotels. That could represent a serious disruption for government revenue.But Cuba\u2019s budding private sector could take a serious hit as well. The surge of American visitors has been fed by a constellation of private restaurants, and many Americans have chosen to stay in a private residences through services like Airbnb as opposed to a state-run hotel.In short, many Cubans believe that the Trump administration\u2019s new policy will hurt those it is ostensibly meant to help: the average Cuban who has struggled under the weight of a battered economy for decades.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the people who have rental homes or who have a private business specifically targeted at an American audience like myself,\u201d said Marla Recio, an event planner who created a business to serve the booming demand of Americans wanting to host celebrations on the island. \u201cBut there are also the people who have simple cafeterias or beauty salons whose audience is mainly Cuban, and those people are also stimulated by the flow of people who bring money to the island.\u201dMr. Trump is taking aim at one of the principle changes made under Mr. Obama, who allowed Americans to organize trips to Cuba for cultural or educational purposes on their own, without special permission from the American government and without a licensed tour company.Now, these trips, often called \u201cpeople to people\u201d exchanges, will again require a licensed tour group. That is expected to increase the costs of traveling to Cuba and significantly reduce the number of American visitors.Policy analysts and Cuban citizens alike fear that many of the Americans traveling to Cuba \u2014 those most likely to dine at private establishments and stay in private housing \u2014 will simply stop going if they risk breaking the law by doing so.\u201cTrump claims to be a businessman, so he should understand that reversing the new policies would be bad business,\u201d said Rafaelito Fiterre, 22, who is majoring in tourism at the University of Havana. \u201cThat should interest Trump.\u201dThe issue is complicated, experts said, because it is difficult to target the military without affecting the Cuban people at large.\u201cWhile I understand and sympathize with the argument that when you travel and stay in a Cuban hotel you enrich the military, it is not a zero-sum game,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a lecturer at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs.\u201cSome dollars actually create political and economic space: Look at the paladares,\u201d he said, referring to privately run restaurants, \u201cor even the small pizza shops. They will be at risk too.\u201dOver all, 614,433 Americans visited in 2016, including 329,496 Cuban-Americans and 284,937 other Americans, according to Cuba\u2019s government. While the travel restrictions are not expected to apply to Cuban-Americans, the restrictions on spending money at businesses controlled by the Cuban military are expected to apply to all Americans.\u201cIs the State Department going to print up a map that says where people can and can\u2019t go?\u201d asked John Kavulich, the president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.The impact on American business could also be heavy. Airlines from the United States have scrambled to arrange daily flights. Starwood Hotels & Resorts signed on to renovate and oversee three hotels in Havana. Airbnb in particular has had a profound entry into the market, offering more than 22,000 homes across the country and hosting more than half a million visitors.In Havana, the presence of Americans on the streets these days is palpable. Old Havana, especially, teems with visitors from the United States, many of whom say they are eager to see the nation before it changes and becomes more like any another Caribbean destination.Older Americans, Brooklyn fashionistas and families willing to pay top dollar come to stay in one of the opulent, albeit shabby, old homes that line Havana\u2019s boulevards. Even in the hot months of the otherwise off-season, some hotels began doubling rates, paving the way for a boom in private sector accommodations.Even though ordinary Cubans may find themselves hurt by a change in American policy, they are, in some ways, the best equipped to adapt. Having endured various iterations of hardship over the years \u2014 including the so-called special period in the 1990s, when Soviet largess vanished and daily life became a scramble \u2014 struggle has become something of a normal state of being for many Cubans.Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez, 38, a chemical engineer who is now a taxi driver, has seen benefits from the influx of Americans to his country. But he also understands the fickle nature of international politics and opportunity in Cuba.\u201cI used to drive a standardized route, mainly for Cubans, charging the legal rate of .50 per customer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now since there are more tourists, many of them American, I can drive direct routes and charge more. But I never relied on an inflated market and I never got used to that comfort. If the day after tomorrow the Americans suddenly vanish, we will be fine.\u201d\u201cWe Cubans are always fine,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "America in Retreat, Europe en Marche", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 As British conservatives licked their wounds a week ago, and French voters were electing hundreds of rookies to Parliament to strengthen the hand of President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainians at last had a reason to celebrate \u2014 and they did, partying by the thousands in Kiev. For them, June 11 was the dawn of the long-awaited era of visa-free travel to Europe. One local magazine called it \u201cUkraine\u2019s Berlin Wall moment.\u201dThis event, little noticed in the midst of so many political upheavals, is a fresh sign that Europe is moving forward. Giving some 45 million Ukrainians the right to travel freely through the 26 countries of the Schengen area is something of an achievement at a time when, across the European Union, the word \u201cimmigration\u201d sounds like a recipe for electoral disaster.Don\u2019t expect European Union leaders to boast about it; that is not something they are good at. Yet a new mood is taking hold in Brussels and other European capitals these days, a wind of hope and optimism rarely felt in the last two decades.After so many existential crises, believers in the European Union are suddenly waking up to realize that the reports of its death were greatly exaggerated. The eurozone has not collapsed. Britain\u2019s exit, which shocked and destabilized the union a year ago, is now perceived as an opportunity for the 27 remaining members to regroup.Does anybody remember that Frexit was supposed to come next? Against all odds, the French elected a president who campaigned on building a more tightly integrated Europe. In Britain, Theresa May\u2019s failed gamble on a snap election could have fed hopes on the Continent of a U-turn on Brexit; instead, it is seen as an annoyance by negotiators in Brussels who are eager to start divorce talks as soon as possible. Though Brexit is still regretted by many Europeans, its psychological shock has been absorbed. Now let\u2019s get on with it and move ahead.In Britain, France and Germany, the migration crisis is being contained, despite shamefully little progress in the search for long-term solutions. The public has held its ground in the face of devastating terrorist attacks. Populist movements are stalling, countered by re-energized democratic forces.Last but not least, the economy is looking up after years of stagnation. Gone is the obsession with the \u201clost decade.\u201d Instead, people talk of \u201cthe turnaround\u201d and a potential \u201cgolden decade,\u201d a phrase recently applied to Europe by Philipp Hildebrand, the vice chairman of BlackRock, in an interview with Bloomberg.The most spectacular turnaround, obviously, was provided not by the euro but by Emmanuel Macron\u2019s stunning victory in the French presidential election last month, followed by the overwhelming success of his new party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche, in the first round of legislative elections on June 11. Looking at computer graphics that projected a sweeping majority for the party in the next National Assembly \u2014 perhaps more than 400 of the Parliament\u2019s 577 seats once the second-round votes were counted \u2014 political analysts were scratching their heads last week: What kind of political life would such a chamber imply for France, with two thirds or more of its members supporting a very powerful president who faced no significant structured opposition?In both the presidential and legislative elections, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French far right, has suffered a blow so devastating that her National Front is in total disarray, as are all the traditional mainstream parties. Ideological lines have become confused in a major political realignment. Although it would be another leap into the unknown, the French now seem ready for all kinds of experimentation to replace a broken system. Their sulky, pessimistic mood has given way to \u201clet\u2019s turn the tables and start all over again.\u201dAt the very least, a huge parliamentary majority should allow President Macron to pass the economic and labor reforms he is committed to in his \u201ctransformative\u201d agenda. Such reforms are crucial to restart the Franco-German engine and rebalance the relationship between the two countries, itself essential to any European renaissance. German Chancellor Angela Merkel does not hide her enthusiasm for her new French partner, who has been equally keen to show how closely they are working together. These days, Paris-Berlin and Berlin-Paris flights have become crowded with civil servants heading to meetings.A new sense of urgency is crossing the Rhine. Mr. Macron\u2019s government is openly German-friendly; five of its members, including Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, speak the language fluently. The defense ministers of Germany and France, Ursula von der Leyen and Sylvie Goulard, speak the other\u2019s language and have hit it off, with ambitious plans for European defense. On July 13, the day before Bastille Day, both governments will hold a joint cabinet meeting in Paris to discuss proposals to strengthen and further integrate the eurozone. The Franco-German rapprochement seems to extend beyond the leadership: The latest ARD-Deutschlandtrend poll, published on June 8, showed that 94 percent of Germans saw France as a trustworthy partner, while only 21 percent thought the same of Russia \u2026 and of the United States.The last statistic points to another factor in Europe\u2019s revival: Donald Trump. The American president\u2019s belated profession of faith in Article 5 of the NATO charter on June 9 will not erase the damage done at the recent NATO and G-7 summits, and by his decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change. \u201cWe do have a problem with what he thinks, what he says and what he does,\u201d a senior French official told me. \u201cWe must find ways of moving forward without the United States if they don\u2019t want to come along. Merkel is right. The time has come to reform the E.U.\u201dFrench officials are quick to point out that partners on both sides of the Atlantic are in many ways interdependent and will continue to work together, in the fight against terrorism, for instance. Even on climate change, cooperation will find other routes, past the White House, to states and cities. \u201cThere are forces in the United States that we know we can rely upon,\u201d Ms. Goulard, the French defense minister, said in Singapore on June 3, \u201cand these forces will ultimately prevail.\u201dMost European leaders are waking up to this new reality. They don\u2019t believe in the \u201cadults in the room\u201d tale anymore, once floated to enhance the influence of men they felt they could trust, like James Mattis and H. R. McMaster, to temper the instincts of an unreliable leader. In turn, those Americans will need to adjust to Europe\u2019s own new reality.Sylvie Kauffmann is the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Tries to Behave More Like a Hotel", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Less chatting on the couch; fewer idiosyncratic toiletries in the bath. Pursuing growth, the company promotes consistency among its millions of hosts.Supported byDENVER \u2014 For nine years, Jill Bishop enjoyed the camaraderie of renting out her spare bedroom on Airbnb.Guests hung out on her comfy sofas. They dined together. They shared her bathroom, which was filled with half-empty shampoo bottles and an array of lotions.Then, things changed.When one of those travelers finally arrived last year, it jarred her. \u201cHe told me that he just uses Airbnb as an alternative to hotels and that he doesn\u2019t really want to talk to his hosts,\u201d said Ms. Bishop, 63, who lives in a single-story ranch house in the North Park Hill neighborhood of Denver. \u201cHe really did just come in and sit in his room, with the door closed, while I sat in the living room.\u201dAirbnb \u2014 the sharing-economy start-up born with a crash-on-my-couch informality \u2014 is now trying to professionalize its more than two million \u201chosts\u201d around the world.Travelers accustomed to hotels have come to expect that they can automatically book an Airbnb without having to ask first for the owner\u2019s permission \u2014 something that has long been a fixture of the hotel booking process. They want to know that their reservation is firm. They expect fresh linens and privacy. They also anticipate that hosts will act like hotel staff members, meaning they will be courteous and blend into the background.As a result, Airbnb\u2019s hosts have had to deal with more rules, fees and guidelines. Many have taken on responsibilities that would be handled at the front desk of a hotel, such as explaining (and sometimes collecting) an expanding list of fees and taxes. They are grappling with new tools that let travelers instantly book Airbnbs, much like a hotel reservation system. Airbnb has also introduced recommendations around cancellations and check-in times that mirror those of hotels, and it allows guests to hide listings that ignore that guidance.Airbnb cannot force homeowners who use its site to adopt its tools and policies; they are not full-time employees. But interviews with more than two dozen hosts showed that many felt pressured to comply. The lesson, Ms. Bishop said, is that Airbnb wants her spare bedroom to be more like a Hilton or a Hyatt, and for her to act like a mini-hotelier.\u201cAirbnb was so life-enriching for me,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m less in touch with how life-enriching it was and more in touch with the hassle.\u201dVina Ayers, a graphic designer, experienced the pitfalls when she stayed with her husband and friends at an Airbnb in upstate New York in 2015. She said the group became alarmed when they arrived at the rental home and found the house had an odd and offensive odor. On their last morning there, they were confronted by strangers who believed the owner of the home had stolen their dog. Those strangers followed Ms. Ayers to a nearby restaurant. Eventually, the police intervened.\u201cI would never use Airbnb again and have since deleted my account,\u201d she said.A spokesman for Airbnb said in a statement: \u201cOur initial response to this matter didn\u2019t come close to meeting the high standards we set for ourselves. While this host hasn\u2019t had a guest since 2015, we have formally suspended this account while we investigate, and we will take appropriate action.\u201dAirbnb\u2019s shift has divided its host community. Some are embracing the changes around instant booking and appealing to business travelers. Mark Scheel, 42, a software engineer who runs a monthly meetup for Airbnb hosts in Denver, began renting out his ski condo on Airbnb five years ago. He just bought a second vacation condo because the first was occupied by Airbnb guests all the time.\u201cThe changes that added more rigidity have also led to a better guest experience, which makes them happier and brings in more business for me,\u201d Mr. Scheel said.Other hosts are less comfortable with the added layers and new tools. \u201cThe Airbnb guys started the business as a way to make money to pay rent, with airbeds and cereal,\u201d said John Garber, a host in Denver who has rented out an apartment on Airbnb since August 2016. \u201cNow they do a lot of nudging to get you to do what they might call best practices. It\u2019s a little nanny state.\u201dChip Conley, Airbnb\u2019s former global head of hospitality and strategy, who remains an adviser, said the company continued \u201cto keep a good relationship with hosts, and they\u2019re consistently happy.\u201d On behalf of Airbnb, he cited data showing that over half of all hosts today are willing to recommend being a host, about the same as in 2014.The consistency of a guest\u2019s experience is a major issue that Airbnb wants to solve. That is because it bothers even some of the company\u2019s big fans.Consider Alex Tibbetts, 46, a marketer who lives in San Francisco and who began regularly using Airbnb in 2013 for work travel. While she likes the service and is trying to book an Airbnb for her family of four in Sydney, Australia, later this year, Ms. Tibbetts doesn\u2019t fully trust that Airbnb\u2019s hosts will behave reliably. As a result, she prefers listings where she does not have to interact with hosts once she arrives.\u201cThe big downside of using Airbnb instead of a hotel is the risk, because of the potential lack of consistency,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen an Airbnb is bad, it\u2019s really bad.\u201dAirbnb began tackling the predictability of its guest experience early on by providing a rating system, so people could read about Airbnbs from other travelers. In 2009, the company created a special designation called superhosts for those who could be depended upon to provide a strong guest experience. The program today includes hosts who average nearly one booking a month, do not cancel reservations, respond quickly to inquiries and have high ratings.In 2015, Airbnb also introduced a surge pricing tool, which lowers and raises room rates based on demand, much like a hotel. Over the past few years, the company has experimented with setting default cancellation policies and check-in and checkout times. Hosts who didn\u2019t want to participate could opt out.Some of Mr. Conley\u2019s ideas have not come to fruition, like a full-service cleaning operation and a transportation service. But the standardization of a guest\u2019s experience was in motion. All hosts were asked to confirm they had smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in 2014. (The company has since said the devices are not mandatory.)A year later, hosts could earn badges for having \u201cbusiness travel ready\u201d listings, which must have standard amenities like a hair dryer and Wi-Fi. Hosts cannot cancel such listings within seven days of the reservation date.The changes made it clear that Airbnb was \u201ctaking a page from the hotel industry,\u201d said Jan Freitag, a senior vice president at the lodging research group STR.Yet even as Airbnb has pushed hosts to be more hotel-like, it has not given them the same control over their businesses as a hotel. John Wong, an Airbnb host in Ottawa, who rents out a condo on the site, experienced this firsthand this year.After some guests had a party in Mr. Wong\u2019s condo, they refused to cover the cost of smoke and water damage. While a hotel would have had a guest\u2019s credit card on file and been able to charge the customer, Mr. Wong did not have that backup. He turned to Airbnb for help, and the company did little, he said.After The New York Times contacted Airbnb about the incident, the company began paying Mr. Wong for property damages. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown fast,\u201d Airbnb said in a statement, \u201cand we haven\u2019t always been perfect.\u201dMr. Wong said his overall experience with Airbnb was positive, but \u201cthere needs to be a better process to hold problematic guests accountable, rather than relying on the media to help intervene.\u201dMeantime, Airbnb has diversified its offerings by branching into tours and restaurant reservations. Mr. Chesky has said that these new services may someday account for more than half of the company\u2019s revenue. All of those may turn Airbnb into a full-service, online travel agency like Orbitz, making hosts a smaller part of the picture.For more than 20 years, Ms. Bishop taught English as a second language. In 2003, after separating from her husband, she moved to North Park Hill, which was close to the dance school of her daughter, who was a teenager at the time. To make the new house her own, she decorated it with portraits and still lifes by local artists.She immediately liked hosting. Visitors napped in her living room and ate at her table surrounded by family photographs, paperwork, stray mail and recycling items. She befriended guests who, in turn, later hosted her in Italy and Germany.\u201cPeople like it here because of how comfortable and at home they feel,\u201d Ms. Bishop said. In short order, she became a superhost.The company, by that time renamed Airbnb, sent flowers when Ms. Bishop hosted her 200th guest, and another time when she helped find alternative lodging for a man who was caught in a blizzard several towns away. In 2015, while waiting to speak at an event in Paris for Airbnb hosts, she met Joe Gebbia, one of the company\u2019s founders. He recognized her from her listing and thanked her for being an early host when so few others were willing to do it.In 2012, she decided that she was making enough money from Airbnb to retire early from teaching. She was booked all the time, and she enjoyed meeting travelers like the Ikrams, a Pakistani family of three who recently stayed with her. While the Ikrams initially seemed apprehensive about being in close quarters with a woman who was divorced, by their third day they offered to host her in Pakistan, even though she was unsure about the safety in the country.\u201cThe father changed his mind about me, and I realized I had preconceived notions I didn\u2019t think I had about Pakistan,\u201d Ms. Bishop said.Then hosting became more complicated. City officials in Denver, which has about 3,500 Airbnb listings, made it clear last year that they planned to regulate the short-term rental market. Ms. Bishop volunteered to meet with officials to help influence the legislation, essentially acting as an unpaid lobbyist.Ms. Bishop said she sometimes felt burned out by the complexities of hosting. In a hotel, some employees clean up after guests, while others handle concierge services and make conversation with visitors, while yet another group deals with regulators and bookkeeping. She was doing all of those tasks.\u201cSometimes I joke that my job is washing sheets and towels,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the right conversation with a guest makes it enriching again.\u201dMs. Bishop said she was too busy preparing her spare room for guests, attending host meetups and doing other activities to read the book. But now she no longer knows where the copy is. It has, she said, gotten lost somewhere in her house.Advertisement"}

Within six months after what she called her \u201caha! moment\u201d in San Francisco, a fleet of self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, the company\u2019s new electric car, was being built at a G.M. assembly plant in Michigan, the pace accelerated at the direction of Ms. Barra and her senior management team.It was a first for any major car company, and the first leg of a race she is determined to win. The question now is whether a company identified with the industry\u2019s bygone glory days can be a trendsetter in 21st-century transportation \u2014 and beat out Silicon Valley rivals like Google, Tesla and Uber with no legacy business to encumber them.\u201cThe auto industry is on the cusp of significant change, and G.M. has to prove that a longtime established player can be up to the task,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst with the car-shopping site Autotrader, who has followed the company since the 1980s. \u201cIf you look at their past performance, their record has been spotty at best.\u201dGeneral Motors is making a big wager that it can succeed, shedding overseas operations while investing $600 million this year in self-driving cars and other advanced technologies. It spent $1 billion on Cruise Automation, a Silicon Valley start-up that developed the driverless technology powering Ms. Barra\u2019s ride in San Francisco.But G.M. is making a case that it can be a leader in the auto industry of both today and tomorrow. \u201cWe are very, very serious and intent on putting something on the road,\u201d Ms. Barra said of the company\u2019s automated vehicles. \u201cWe definitely want to be first.\u201dIn shaping its future, G.M. is betting on products that have yet to gain a foothold in the marketplace and could take years to develop fully.The company is also fending off a campaign by a dissident investor to create two classes of stock, aimed at increasing G.M.\u2019s value to shareholders. One class would pay a steady dividend, while the other would appreciate based on the company\u2019s growth. The fight will culminate on Tuesday at the annual shareholder meeting.In a letter to investors last week, the hedge fund that floated the dual-class proposal, Greenlight Capital, called G.M.\u2019s board \u2014 including Ms. Barra, its chairwoman \u2014 \u201cuninspired\u201d for opposing its proposal. \u201cAfter seven years of a flat stock price, how much longer must shareholders wait?\u201d the letter said.While she agrees the company is undervalued, Ms. Barra insists that G.M.\u2019s performance will ultimately pay off in better returns. \u201cDoes it frustrate me?\u201d she said of the stock price. \u201cYes, but I want to do the right things over the long term to improve the business.\u201dIn beginning to assemble fully automated Bolts in January, G.M. was a step ahead of Google and Uber, which are converting mass-market minivans and sedans into driverless models. It went beyond what Tesla has achieved with autonomous controls on its own models. And it reflected the feverish competition underway.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cWe don\u2019t go in to compete,\u201d Ms. Barra said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go in to have an entry. With every new product we\u2019re doing, we are going in to win.\u201dFor Ms. Barra, 55, who took the helm at G.M. in 2014 as the first female chief executive of a major automaker, it is the latest chapter in the company\u2019s long comeback.Under Ms. Barra, the company weathered that crisis and is moving to become leaner and stronger. It is selling off its money-losing European division and unwinding its operations in other international markets like Australia, India and Russia. It has cut unprofitable sales of vehicles to rental fleets and reduced shifts and workers at some American factories that make slow-selling cars.\u201cG.M. used to constantly talk about where we were going to spend more money,\u201d said Mark L. Reuss, the company\u2019s executive vice president for product development. \u201cWhat we were doing was robbing our good businesses to fix the broken ones.\u201dAs G.M. streamlines operations in the United States and elsewhere, it is redirecting energy and capital to its self-driving initiative.\u201cI do believe General Motors is a tech company,\u201d Ms. Barra said. \u201cWe put these products on the road that integrate 30,000 parts and have hundreds of millions of lines of code in them already. And we have to make them durable and work in all environments.\u201dIts commitment is on display at a sprawling plant in Orion Township, Mich., about a 45-minute drive northwest of Detroit, where the company builds conventional subcompact cars as well as Bolts.One area of the factory is dedicated to a small-scale assembly line where workers customize Bolts with self-driving equipment, including a large computer in the trunk and modules packed with sensors on the roof and fenders.\u201cWe\u2019re on the cutting edge here,\u201d said Bill Rock, a 22-year G.M. veteran who works on the autonomous vehicle line. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated process, but it\u2019s the direction the company needs to go.\u201dG.M. has built about 140 autonomous Bolts to be used for testing in Arizona, California and Michigan by Cruise Automation, now a subsidiary. Kyle Vogt, a founder of Cruise, said G.M. had given its engineers a distinct advantage by building a state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle, rather than retrofitting a conventional car.\u201cThese vehicles coming off the assembly line have been built from the ground up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real car, and not a mash-up of off-the-shelf parts that need to be integrated into the system.\u201dMs. Barra\u2019s view of what G.M. can accomplish was forged in her years as one of its first female plant managers. And she believes G.M. can lead the self-driving revolution without additional acquisitions or partners. \u201cWe have everything we need,\u201d she said.Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a business professor at Yale and a leadership expert who has known most of Ms. Barra\u2019s predecessors dating back decades, is convinced of her resolve. \u201cMary is the right person at the right time, and she does it without an ounce of showmanship,\u201d he said.Ms. Barra methodically directed the company to fix the defective parts, revamp its safety procedures, compensate accident victims and their families and negotiate settlements and fines with regulators and the Justice Department.She says the episode informed her approach to self-driving cars, which she believes herald a new era of road safety, and left her impatient for results. And she says she is determined for G.M. to lead the technological revolution changing the industry.\u201cIf anyone can,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t we be the ones to do it?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Did China Detain Anbang\u2019s Chairman? He Tested a Lot of Limits", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chairman, Wu Xiaohui, has not been publicly accused of any wrongdoing, and the authorities in China sometimes detain financiers for questioning only to release them to resume their duties a few days later. Anbang said on its website on Wednesday only that Mr. Wu was temporarily unable to fulfill his duties as chairman for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201dAnbang embodies the contradictions of China\u2019s modern economy, with its potentially combustible mix of risk-taking capitalism and episodically draconian government control. Abroad, Anbang shocked Wall Street with its multibillion-dollar takeover efforts, even as Beijing moved to rein in deals. At home, it drew tens of billions of dollars from Chinese investors big and small looking for their own success stories \u2014 making it vulnerable at a time when Beijing is looking to limit potential financial explosions. And it played the fraught game of politics on both sides of the Pacific, including courting Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump.On paper, the company appeared to be a quiet, conservative insurer. But Anbang often seemed to behave as though the usual informal political guidelines did not apply \u2014 possibly because Mr. Wu was married to a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, a major Communist Party figure who was China\u2019s paramount leader in the 1980s.\u201cOne of the basic rules of operating in China is everybody is a dog on a leash,\u201d said Fraser Howie, a former banker in Asia who has co-written three books on the Chinese financial system. \u201cNobody has freedom. The party does not give anybody freedom. They merely give them a leash.\u201dOne bright line for Chinese companies: Try not to get mixed up in China\u2019s foreign policy without clear backing from Chinese leaders.Yet Anbang tried late last year to invest in an office building partly owned by Mr. Kushner. The potential investment, which was never consummated, became controversial in the United States because of Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in setting China policies in the Trump administration, and exposed Beijing to accusations that it was trying to meddle in American politics. No Chinese bank stepped forward to play any role in a possible transaction.Some analysts in China said that political considerations were likely to be the main reason that Beijing had detained Mr. Wu, pointing to a Communist Party meeting scheduled for late this year at which party officials are to consider changes in leadership. Anbang has a murky ownership structure that traces back to family and friends of Mr. Wu who live on apparently modest means, fueling speculation in China that other wealthy and powerful figures may be behind it.Anbang also pushed \u2014 and even defied \u2014 the government\u2019s often loosely defined limits on what Chinese insurers are allowed to do.That campaign continued even after the Shanghai stock market crashed in the summer of 2015, which prompted the Chinese government to begin stepping up its measures to discourage companies and individuals from taking large sums of money out of the country. Just last week came the disclosure that, starting in September, banks will be required to send daily reports to the government on every overseas credit card expenditure by their customers of more than 1,000 renminbi, or $147.Anbang has also argued that it did not depend on converting renminbi into foreign currencies to make its acquisitions, but has not explained how it was able to finance so many foreign deals without converting large sums.To fund its investments, Anbang aggressively marketed what in China are called wealth management products. Wealth management products are often short-term investments that offer investors considerably higher rates of return than are paid on bank deposits. While they are often sold out of the offices of banks and securities brokerages, giving investors a sense of confidence, the money often goes off the balance sheets of banks and into murky and sometimes speculative investments.Anbang\u2019s wealth management product sales contributed to eye-popping growth. In the six years through last December, the assets of Anbang\u2019s life insurance unit multiplied 2,876-fold, to $213 billion. Anbang also has a much smaller property and casualty insurance business.\u201cThe nature of insurance should be safety, mobility, and the least concern is yield,\u201d said Ju Lan, the director of the risk management and insurance research center at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University. \u201cSince we don\u2019t allow insurance companies to go bankrupt, once one gets into trouble, the government needs to save it.\u201dAfter the detention of Mr. Wu, investors in Anbang wealth management products lit up social media starting on Tuesday night with questions about whether to leave their money with the company or to demand it back immediately, incurring significant penalties for early redemption.\u201cI am worried something big will happen and I won\u2019t get my money back,\u201d wrote one investor. \u201cYet it costs a lot to quit as well.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong, and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing. Ailin Tang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sydney Art Museum Receives Big Funding Boost", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 After four years of uncertainty and controversy, a proposed expansion to Sydney\u2019s premier art museum, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, has received a major boost with a local grant of 244 million Australian dollars (about $184 million).The state treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, said the expansion would \u201cturn our 19th-century gallery into a global museum of the future,\u201d the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Tuesday. A government spokesman confirmed the grant.The expansion, called Sydney Modern, will also help the city catch up to its chief rival, Melbourne, as a destination for great art, and help prevent it from missing out on both exhibitions and gifts of art for want of adequate space, in the view of supporters of the project.The grant will cover only part of the cost of the expansion, which was designed by the Japanese architectural firm Sanaa. Another 100 million Australian dollars (about $75.4 million) must be raised from the private sector, of which the gallery says 70 million (about $53 million) has been pledged. A campaign to raise the rest will begin shortly.Although Sydney\u2019s state art museum is perennially popular \u2014 it attracts about a million people a year \u2014 it looks cramped and outdated in its current form. And in the last two decades it has lost ground \u2014 in terms both of visitor numbers and quality of experience \u2014 not only to Melbourne\u2019s National Gallery of Victoria but also to art museums in smaller cities like Brisbane and Canberra, which have benefited from their own expansions.The gallery\u2019s director, Michael Brand, has had to fight opponents of the plan on multiple fronts.Conservative voices from within Sydney\u2019s art world have questioned the need for any upgrade. A former prime minister \u2014 once known as a great champion of the arts \u2014 has publicly lambasted the project. Private donors have appeared reluctant to come on board. And the state government, which is ultimately responsible for funding the museum, had been unable to commit for years.A windfall created by the privatization of the state\u2019s electricity infrastructure changed the financial equation. But even as the government established a culture and arts fund of 600 million Australian dollars (about $452 million), it came under pressure to steer money away from so-called \u201celite\u201d arts institutions and toward less-established organizations in the outer suburbs and regions.To make the grant promised for the Sydney Modern project more palatable, the government announced a new Regional Cultural Fund of 100 million Australian dollars (about $75.4 million). Officials hope, meanwhile, that Sydney Modern will double attendance and bring an additional $1 billion into the economy over 25 years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Lies. China Thrives.", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the many dangers posed to our society by having a president who\u2019s a serial liar \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t behave like an adult, let alone a president \u2014 is that we more easily ignore him even if he happens to say something true.Yes, some things are true even if Donald Trump believes them. I explored one of them in China last week \u2014 Trump\u2019s charge that China is playing unfair on trade.Chinese men and women friends tell me they don\u2019t carry purses or wallets anymore, only a mobile phone, which they use for everything \u2014 including for buying vegetables from street vendors.\u201cAmerica has been dreaming of becoming a cashless society,\u201d Ya-Qin Zhang, president of Baidu, China\u2019s main search engine, remarked to me, \u201cbut China is already there.\u201d It has \u201cleapfrogged the rest of world\u201d and is now going mobile-first in everything.Wang Xing, the founder of Meituan.com \u2014 a Chinese mobile website that is a combination of Fandango, Yelp, OpenTable, Grubhub, TripAdvisor, Booking.com and Angie\u2019s List \u2014 told me that he has around 300,000 people on electric bicycles who deliver takeout food and groceries to 10 million Chinese mobile internet users daily. \u201cWe are the largest food delivery company in the world,\u201d said Xing.And in an age when raw data from the internet of people and the internet of things is the new oil, the fact that China has 700 million people doing so many transactions daily on the mobile internet means it\u2019s piling up massive amounts of information that can be harvested to identify trends and spur new artificial intelligence applications.Moreover, while Trump is pulling out of the Paris climate deal, China is steadily pulling out of coal. Xin Guo, C.E.O. of Career International, told me two of his hottest job openings in China are in \u201csoftware and new energy\u201d \u2014 everyone is looking for engineers for electric cars, solar and wind. Walter Fang, a top executive at iSoftStone, which helps design China\u2019s smart, sustainable cities, told me that \u201cjust two weeks ago I brought in about a dozen green energy start-up companies from Massachusetts\u201d to show them opportunities in China.And yet, as smart as China has been in adopting new technologies, Trump\u2019s broad complaint that China is not playing fair on trade and has grown in some areas at the expense of U.S. and European workers has merit and needs to be addressed \u2014 now. Before going to Beijing I emailed the smartest person I know inside China on trade (who will have to go nameless) and asked if Trump had a point.He answered: \u201cYour note has arrived as I slide across the Chinese countryside at 300 kilometers per hour from Beijing to Shanghai. There are nearly 60 trains going from Beijing to Shanghai every day, typically with 16 cars able to carry nearly 1,300 people. \u2026 We glide past endless brand-new factories and immaculate apartment buildings in practically every city along the way, with many more still under construction. As you suspect, I have been sympathetic to many of Trump\u2019s trade and industrial policy ideas. But if anything, Trump may be too late.\u201dOuch.The core problem, U.S. and European business leaders based in China explained, is that when the U.S. allowed China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 and gain much less restricted access to our markets, we gave China the right to keep protecting parts of its market \u2014 because it was a \u201cdeveloping economy.\u201d The assumption was that as China reformed and become more of our equal, its trade barriers and government aid to Chinese companies would melt away.They did not. China grew in strength, became America\u2019s equal in many fields and continued to protect its own companies from foreign competition, either by limiting access or demanding that foreign companies take on a Chinese partner and transfer their intellectual property to China as the price of access, or by funneling Chinese firms low-interest loans to grow and buy foreign competitors.Once those companies got big enough, they were unleashed on the world. China plans to use this strategy to implement its new plan \u2014 \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d \u2014 to make itself the world leader in electric vehicles, new materials, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, bio-pharmacy, 5G mobile communications and other industries.The latest annual survey of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, released in January, found that 81 percent of its members felt \u201cless welcome\u201d in China than in the past and had little confidence any longer that China would carry through on promises to open its markets. APCO Worldwide\u2019s James McGregor, one of the keenest observers of China trade, recently noted that China tells the world that its policy is \u201creform and opening,\u201d but on the ground its policy \u201cmore resembles reform and closing.\u201dToday, Alibaba can set up its own cloud server in America, but Amazon or Microsoft can\u2019t do the same in China. China just agreed to allow U.S. credit card giants, like Visa and MasterCard, access to its huge market \u2014 something it was required to do under W.T.O. rules but just dragged its feet on for years \u2014 but now domestic Chinese financial services companies, like UnionPay, so dominate the Chinese market that U.S. companies will be left to fight over the scraps. The world leader in industrial robots, the German company Kuka Robotics, was just bought by the Chinese company Midea; Beijing would never allow the U.S. to buy one of China\u2019s industrial gems like that.This is not fair. China needs to know that some people who disagree with everything else Trump stands for \u2014 and who value a strong U.S.-China relationship \u2014 might just support Trump\u2019s idea for a border-adjustment tax on imports to level the playing field. Because our economic relationship with China is out of whack \u2014 and not just because China makes great products, but because we do, too, and it\u2019s high time they are all allowed through China\u2019s front door.Advertisement"}

Also: Johnny Depp, and a Controversial Push to Decrypt", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Breakdown\u2022 Australia is older and more Asian, and the number of same-sex couples is rising, census data shows.\u2022 Johnny Depp and Barnaby Joyce are arguing over dogs again.\u2022 Is it really a good idea to let the government unlock our encrypted messages?The government\u2019s statisticians wonderfully dub these results \u201ca living biography we get to update every five years.\u201dSo, what does the fresh ink show?1. What a Diverse Country!Australia may be the most culturally diverse country in the developed world. Around one in two Australians have at least one parent born overseas.In fact, Australia has a higher proportion of people born overseas (26 percent) than Canada (22 percent), New Zealand (23 percent) and the United Kingdom (13 percent) \u2014 and nearly twice the proportion as in the United States (14 percent).Despite its historic ties to Britain, overseas-born Australians are for the first time more Asian than European, and all together, Australians speak more than 300 languages and subscribe to over 100 religions.It\u2019s also worth noting that Australians are increasingly faithless: The number of Australians who identify with \u201cno religion\u201d is up to 30 percent. Christianity is still Australia\u2019s most common religion, but it\u2019s down from 74 percent in 1991 to 52 percent in 2016.\u201cI think some of it comes from the types of populations who are coming to Australia, said Edith Gray, an associate professor and head of the school of demography at Australian National University. \u201cSome of our overseas-born population are more likely to be coming from China than in the past so some of that composition may be playing a role in the change in the structure of the religious affiliation.\u201d2. Home LifeFor many Australians, the \u201cAustralian dream\u201d of home ownership is looking a little more like a work in progress. Though a majority of Australians own a house with a mortgage, the proportion of people renting has increased around 20 percent since 1991. The percentage of Australians outright owning their homes has decreased to 31 percent in 2016 from 41 percent in 1991 \u2014 numbers that reflect Australia\u2019s increasingly unaffordable housing market.Same-sex couples can\u2019t marry in Australia \u2014 but there are more of them: The A.B.S. counted more than 47,000 same-sex couples last year, a 42 percent increase from the 2011 census. That means that around half a percent of Australian households are now headed by a same-sex couple.One more detail about home life that piqued our interest: 1 in 5 Australian men do zero hours of \u201cunpaid domestic labor,\u201d meaning helping around the house. Get to work, gentlemen!3. Australia Is GrayingThere\u2019s no escaping it: Australia is getting older. Its median age is now 38 \u2014 up from 37 in 2011 \u2014 and the proportion of its population aged 65 years and over is up to 16 percent, from 14 percent.How have some countries worked to balance the ledger and inject youth back into their wobbling economies? Migration, naturally.[12:11 p.m. AEST]Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce may, against all odds, have Johnny Depp in his sights again.The unlikely pair tangled in the news media after Mr. Depp illegally brought his dogs into Australia last year. That led to this awkward apology:Mr. Depp, who was criticized this week for joking about presidential assassinations at the Glastonbury Festival in England, is back on the radar here because documents from a lawsuit against his former business managers revealed that Mr. Depp may have been \u201cfully aware that he was illegally bringing his dogs to Australia.\u201dThat prompted a bit of a threat from Mr. Joyce. \u201cI might have another look at this,\u201d he said Tuesday on ABC TV.[2:20 p.m. AEST]Attorney General George Brandis and Immigration Minister Peter Dutton are in Canada today for a meeting of the so-called Five Eyes \u2014 an intelligence alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain and the United States.Australia\u2019s priority issue? Encryption. Specifically, they want better cooperation from encryption \u201cservice providers\u201d like Apple, WhatsApp and Signal.A key attraction of encrypted messaging apps is that intercepted messages cannot be read or deciphered \u2014 they rely on device-side authentication.

{"Headline": "How to Protest in Russia", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOne reason is that they offer evidence that Mr. Putin and his cohorts, despite all their power, have been unable to cow Russians into silence. Though a large majority cherish the stability Mr. Putin has brought or accept his claims that Russia\u2019s problems are the work of a devious West, Mr. Navalny and other critics of the government have succeeded in mobilizing the internet and social media to maintain a lively opposition in major cities. The thousands of demonstrators who were out in the streets on Monday may be only a small fraction of the population, but many were young and all went out knowing that there was a high risk of arrest. In fact, more than 700 were detained in Moscow and 300 in St. Petersburg.Mr. Navalny has shown himself a master of mobilization. Though he has been criticized by some liberals for his history of nationalist views, he has focused his indignation in his popular blogs and calls for protests on what is arguably the most vulnerable attribute of the ruling elite: its corruption. Though somewhat tolerated in better times, the wealth accumulated by Russia\u2019s rulers, which Mr. Navalny has documented, grates on people feeling the economy turn increasingly sour.Mr. Navalny\u2019s latest sally was a remarkable video cataloging the purported riches of Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, including estates, yachts and a European vineyard. Among the amenities on one of Mr. Medvedev\u2019s properties was a special shelter for ducks, which has provided demonstrators with a popular prop: large yellow toy ducks.Mr. Navalny called the protests for Russia Day, a national holiday, when Mr. Putin would be celebrating \u201cpolitical stability, unity of goals and the consolidation of the country.\u201d And instead of holding the demonstration at an authorized location outside Moscow\u2019s center, he shifted it at the last moment to the central Tverskaya Street, which had been cordoned off for re-enactments of major Russian historic events. That ensured a police crackdown on the protesters \u2014 many of whom carried Russian flags while chanting \u201cRussia without Putin\u201d to underscore that they are the true patriots \u2014 in the midst of holiday crowds and people in historical costumes. Mr. Navalny himself was arrested leaving his home and quickly sentenced to 30 days in jail.State television predictably took no notice of the protests, focusing instead on Mr. Putin presiding over a Russia Day award ceremony.

But less than 24 hours after the president\u2019s Rose Garden ceremony, leaders of the global effort to confront climate change welcomed that approach.Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for climate action and energy, told reporters in Brussels that the European Union would continue carrying out the Paris Agreement with the assistance of a variety of American individuals, companies and authorities.In announcing his decision to exit the Paris accord, President Trump scorned the Green Climate Fund. Does the United States contribute an outsize share?\u201cWe will establish a dialogue within the United States with all the players that in the United States support ambitious climate change policies,\u201d he said.Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the president would gauge the possibility of working with other world leaders and with Congress on ways to deal with climate change that safeguard the American economy.\u201cHe\u2019ll obviously continue to talk to world leaders,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a process that has to evolve.\u201dSeveral administration officials stressed that the federal government would continue to try to reduce pollution, though Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, have made it a top priority to roll back many of President Barack Obama\u2019s aggressive emission-reduction efforts.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to change our ongoing efforts to reduce those emissions in the future either, so hopefully people can keep it in perspective,\u201d Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said.Vice President Mike Pence asserted that the United States had demonstrated what he called \u201creal progress\u201d in reducing carbon emissions, and he accused liberal groups and Democratic lawmakers of trying to turn concern about the environment into a political cause.\u201cIt\u2019s long been a goal of the liberal left in this country to advance a climate change agenda,\u201d Mr. Pence said.But outside the United States, Mr. Trump\u2019s counterparts expressed deepening doubt about whether the world could depend on the United States government to help lead the way toward reduced pollution levels.Ms. Merkel spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone about the decision on Thursday, then gave a brief statement on Friday in Berlin that was broadcast live by German television stations.The United States has emitted more planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other country. Now it is walking back a promise to lower emissions.With sweeping language the chancellor has rarely used in the past, she added, \u201cFor all for whom the future of this planet is important, I say: Let us continue along this path together, so that we are successful for our Mother Earth.\u201dMs. Merkel, invoking her background as a scientist and a veteran of more than 20 years of international efforts to protect the planet, said it was especially important to help developing nations meet the challenges of global warming.\u201cWhat we began over 20 years ago and continued in Paris one and a half years ago with a historic quantum leap will lead to success,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\u201cI am so moved and enthused that so many states and enterprises in the United States of America want to travel this path with us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will travel it together.\u201dMotoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo, James Kanter from Brussels, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Matt Zames to Leave JPMorgan Chase, Seeking to Run His Own Business", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatt Zames, the tough-minded chief operating officer of the banking colossus JPMorgan Chase, is unexpectedly resigning.His departure was disclosed on Thursday in an internal memo from Jamie Dimon, the bank\u2019s chief executive, who spoke admiringly of Mr. Zames\u2019s career.Mr. Zames, Mr. Dimon wrote, \u201crecently informed me of his decision to leave our firm following 13 years of outstanding service.\u201d He has worked \u201ctirelessly across many disciplines to help make us a better company,\u201d Mr. Dimon added.In an interview on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Zames, 46, said he was leaving over a desire to run his own business, either at a financial company or perhaps in a role that combined finance and technology.\u201cI have been in this business almost 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI spent the vast majority of my time running businesses, driving things forward, facing off against clients, taking business risk.\u201d\u201cBut at its core, look: I\u2019ll be 47 in October,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to get back to running the railroad \u2014 running my railroad, running my business. So it\u2019s just a natural point.\u201dHis exit is sure to rekindle speculation about who will succeed Mr. Dimon, who at 61 is in his 11th year as chief executive of the large international bank and has shown little interest in leaving.More recently, the focus has shifted to up-and-comers like Marianne Lake, the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, as well as on established players like Gordon Smith, its chief executive of consumer and community banking, and Daniel Pinto, who runs the corporate and investment bank.Shares of JPMorgan rose 1.24 percent on Thursday.Mr. Zames, who had also been regarded as a potential candidate to be chief executive, said on Thursday that a feeling that he would not obtain that job was not a motivating factor in his decision to leave.The executive has long been associated with crisis management. Mr. Zames worked as a junior trader at Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that had to be rescued in 1998, before playing a leading role in JPMorgan\u2019s emergency takeover of Bear Stearns in 2008.He later recalled walking in to Bear\u2019s Madison Avenue office tower late one evening in March 2008. Bear\u2019s officers had realized that a series of client cash withdrawals had rendered their company insolvent, and Mr. Zames summed up the situation with some characteristically blue language, saying the \u201cwhole thing\u201d was headed in a very bad direction. That office building, one of the most valuable assets sold to JPMorgan in its hasty purchase of Bear, was where Mr. Zames later worked.He did his share of troubleshooting at JPMorgan, too. In the London whale episode, Mr. Zames helped unwind some exotic trades that had created billions of dollars in losses for the bank. He then took over the role of chief investment officer in 2012, reshaping the department that had made the risky transactions and marred JPMorgan\u2019s reputation.At the time, Mr. Dimon praised Mr. Zames as a \u201cworld-class risk manager.\u201dMr. Zames counted some of the most senior hedge fund managers as both clients and personal friends, and was known for giving tough advice, even to competitors.Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago money-management firm Citadel, said that he had been impressed with Mr. Zames since meeting him as a student at M.I.T., 25 years ago.\u201cMatt\u2019s profound impact on JPMorgan reflects the combination of brilliance I saw in him then, and the leadership skills he has developed as he\u2019s taken on challenge after challenge over the years,\u201d Mr. Griffin said in an email.His happiest years at JPMorgan were probably spent running its multi-thousand-person fixed-income business, walking the trading floors of the former Bear building. There he studied markets ranging from interest rates to currencies and mortgage bonds, looking for moments when traders seemed to be reaching consensus on the market\u2019s direction. At those times, he believed, prices were often on the verge of turning unexpectedly.He often called his bond shop the \u201cWalmart\u201d of trading because of its heavy and lucrative flow of buy and sell orders from clients around the world. At one point, he set up a trading floor office for the head of the investment bank at the time, Mr. Staley, now chief executive of Barclays of Britain, to give him more direct exposure to the market\u2019s dynamics.\u201cMy philosophy has always been if you can create a flood of volume through your pipes, you\u2019re meaningfully reducing your risk,\u201d Mr. Zames said on Thursday. \u201cAnd your business will trade at a higher multiple if you do it.\u201dUnder terms of an agreement with JPMorgan filed Thursday, Mr. Zames can collect more than $10 million in compensation in the coming two years if he avoids joining a competing company until February of 2018, among other requirements.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a former executive at JP Morgan Chase.

{"Headline": "All-Clear for Big Banks Raises Fears of a Return to Risk", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt took a decade \u2014 and $200 billion in fines \u2014 but the big banks are back.While some of the consequences will be felt sooner than others, they will be far-reaching. The immediate winners include investors as well as bank executives, who could see their already ample pay packages expand further.Even as the broader market fell Thursday, bank stocks surged as investors cheered the big dividend increases announced by JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and others following the Fed\u2019s statement.Looking out further, many big institutions might have more flexibility to lend, a major factor in promoting the long-term growth of businesses. And at least in theory, the more capital the banks now hold and less stringent oversight of the financial sector by Washington could give the economy a shot in the arm after years of caution.\u201cIt\u2019s not a sudden thing. It\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d said Guy Moszkowski, managing partner at Autonomous Research U.S., an independent firm in New York. \u201cBut American banks are more soundly capitalized today than at any time in my career, which started in 1979.\u201dOn the other hand, critics fear the easing of regulatory pressure and a more laissez-faire-oriented White House could set the stage for a return to the bad old days of enormous leverage and freewheeling deals until the music inevitably stops.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to put the brakes on regulation,\u201d said Mark T. Williams, a banking expert at Boston University and a former bank examiner for the Federal Reserve. He noted that with the 10 largest American banks holding 80 percent of all banking assets, \u201cthis concentrated financial power residing at the top banks should be carefully monitored.\u201d\u201cWithout regulators and cops in the corner, you will have incentives for banks to take excessive risks,\u201d Mr. Williams added.It was exactly 10 years ago this month, as the housing bubble collapsed, that the first cracks in what would nearly bring down the country\u2019s economic edifice appeared.Within 18 months, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were gone, and once invincible names like Citigroup and Bank of America teetered on the edge, necessitating a federal bailout.The economic and psychological scars of the financial crisis and the ensuing recession linger, as do the industry\u2019s public relations woes.But in terms of financial metrics like earnings, dividends for shareholders and the ability to absorb potential losses in the event of a recession, the financial sector has clearly turned a page. The banks tested by the Fed now have a $1.25 trillion capital cushion, compared with less than half that in 2009.In a statement on Wednesday, the chief executive of Citigroup, Michael Corbat, said, \u201cToday marks a significant milestone for Citi and our shareholders.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s assessment, he said, demonstrated that \u201cCiti has the ability to withstand a severe economic scenario and remain well capitalized, while also substantially increasing our level of capital return.\u201dAlthough President Trump has promised to roll back many of the rules imposed after the financial crisis while appointing regulators with a much lighter touch, many bank analysts say memories of 2008 and the penalties that followed will also inhibit risk-taking in the future.\u201cParts of the industry had a near-death experience, while some financial institutions actually had a death experience,\u201d Mr. Moszkowski noted. And as was the case following the crash of 1929, \u201cthe legislative and regulatory response was quite harsh.\u201dThe 2008 crisis \u201cforced the U.S. banking system to recognize its losses and recapitalize itself quickly,\u201d Mr. Moszkowski said. \u201cThe lack of that type of pressure in Europe has contributed to what has been a longer period of weakness and recovery there.\u201dWith European banks still hobbled, American firms have benefited in recent years, lifting their share of global revenues from underwriting and advice on mergers and acquisitions.Nearly a decade of historically low interest rates engineered by the Fed also helped banks rebuild their financial fortunes, even if savers and investors watched the yields on money market accounts and C.D.s shrink to the point of vanishing.\u201cThe banking industry has pretty radically de-risked its balance sheet,\u201d said Chris Kotowski, a senior research analyst at Oppenheimer. For example, in 2007 banks held more than a quarter of a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of corporate bonds on their trading desks and other accounts. By April 2017, that figure stood at just over $54 billion.The current rate of delinquencies on products like credit cards and commercial real estate loans is half what it was during previous periods of healthy economic growth, Mr. Kotowski said.At the same time, while banks may have the ability to lend more freely, anemic demand for credit and slow economic growth are likely to restrain new loan growth. And the Fed is in the process of slowly raising interest rates in the face of what policy makers see as stronger economic growth.If rates keep moving up, higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers would most likely offset whatever benefit slightly easier credit from a healthier banking system provides.There are other shifts by big banks wrought by the financial crisis and the long economic recovery since then that won\u2019t be reversed.After shedding tens of thousands of workers, and shuttering hundreds of branches, the banking industry isn\u2019t about to go on a hiring or building spree.\u201cNecessity is the mother of invention, and banks have been forced to operate more cheaply,\u201d Mr. Moszkowski said. \u201cChanging customer behavior, like use of mobile banking, has also enabled them to cut back on branches and staff.\u201dWhile bankers themselves might be more cautious about lending or blurring the distinction between traditional banking and Wall Street-style trading, one element of the go-go years has made a comeback recently: big pay packages for top executives.With the big rally in bank stocks since the election in November, the options packages and other stock-based incentives that bank executives received in recent years have swollen in value.\u201cExecutive compensation hasn\u2019t declined since the financial crisis. It\u2019s gone up,\u201d Mr. Williams said. In 2016, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, received a total pay package of $28 million. In 2006, his overall compensation equaled $27 million.In 2016, Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs was paid a total of $20.2 million, well below the $70 million he received a decade ago, but far above the postcrisis compensation package of $9.6 million in 2009.For his part, Mr. Kotowski believes that memories of Lehman, plus the enormous fines paid to regulators, will serve as a check on appetite for risk for years to come.\u201cEven if bankers all started behaving like drunken sailors tomorrow, it would take years before problems arose,\u201d Mr. Kotowski said. \u201cAnd with the stress tests by the Fed every year, and the memory of the fines, they\u2019re not about to do that.\u201dIt was painful for banks to give up the revenues and profits that came with added risk, Mr. Kotowski said, \u201cbut having made that adjustment, there\u2019s no point in going back to the old world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Saudi-Qatar Rivalry, Now Combusting, Reshaped the Middle East", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterThe crisis convulsing the Persian Gulf, entangling the United States and now threatening to pull in Turkey and Iran, can be traced to a dilemma facing a man who had just deposed his own father.He believed Qatar could find security only by transforming itself from Saudi appendage to rival. But how?The audacious plan he put in motion set off something of a regional cold war, in time remaking not just the politics of the oil-rich Persian Gulf, but also those of the entire Middle East, culminating in last week\u2019s crisis.It would be as if Cuba sought to break from American influence by becoming a global superpower overnight, competing with the United States across Asia and Europe.In the years before Sheikh Hamad took power, a few incidents deepened his desire to break from Saudi domination.In 1988, his father had established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, a Saudi adversary, giving Qatar a taste of an independent foreign policy.In 1992, a clash with Saudi Arabia along their short but disputed border left two Qatari soldiers dead. Two years later, when Yemen fell into a brief civil war, Qatar and Saudi Arabia backed opposing sides.Autonomy, Sheikh Hamad learned, could be both feasible and desirable.Marc Lynch, a political scientist at George Washington University, put Sheikh Hamad\u2019s view as: \u201cWhy be under the thumb of the Saudis if you don\u2019t have to be?\u201dThe Qatari emir also had ambitions to prove himself more than a Saudi vassal.\u201cA lot of it does come down to personality,\u201d Mr. Lynch said. \u201cWhen the new emir comes in, he really does have a chip on his shoulder.\u201dFew countries have ever grown from client state to regional power. Qatar managed it in just a few years.\u201cFrom the late 1990s on, Qatari foreign policy is a combination of: \u2018What can we do to get ourselves on the map?\u2019 and \u2018What can we do to annoy the Saudis?\u2019\u201d Mr. Lynch said.Qatar cultivated ties with Iran and established trade relations with Israel. It became host to a large American air base, in part to guard against Saudi bullying.It also made use of its history as a once-remote haven for Islamist exiles. If foreign governments had to deal with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Palestinian group Hamas, Chechen separatists or even the Taliban, they often went through Qatar.The United States found Qatar\u2019s diplomacy useful, if sometimes annoying, using it as a base for Afghan peace talks. It relied on its Qatari air base for the war in Iraq and, later, strikes in Syria.In 2002, Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Qatar, nominally over Al Jazeera\u2019s criticism of the Saudi government.\u201cIt takes until 2008 for Saudi Arabia to really digest the notion that Qatar is a fully independent state,\u201d said David B. Roberts, a professor at King\u2019s College London.The Saudi ambassador returned to Qatar in 2008, and the two neighbors might have found equilibrium if not for what came next.The Arab Spring, which saw uprisings across the region in 2011, provided Qatar with an opening.For all its rising influence, Qatar had never been able to crack Saudi regional dominance. Now, with Saudi-aligned autocrats under threat, it saw opportunity.It backed antigovernment movements, both secular and Islamist, with Al Jazeera airtime, diplomatic support and, later, money and sometimes weapons, hoping to install friendly new governments. When Islamists showed the most promise, Qatar threw its support behind them.To Saudi Arabia, the uprisings imperiled both the regional order and, potentially, its own rule; populist Islamist movements had long challenged it at home.Every time a vacuum opened, both gulf rivals would rush to fill it first. \u201cFrom 2011 to 2013, they\u2019re in open proxy warfare across the region,\u201d Mr. Lynch said.In Tunisia, for instance, each supported opposing political parties.Elsewhere, their rivalry fueled violence. In Libya, each backed armed groups that would later fight a civil war. In Syria, they sought to outbid each other in financing rebels, including extremists.In Egypt, Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood, whose candidate won the country\u2019s first real presidential vote in 2012. The next year, when the Egyptian military took power in a coup, Saudi Arabia and its allies awarded the new rulers a $12 billion aid package.These interventions, in addition to shaping the Arab Spring, helped realign the region\u2019s geopolitics.Turkey, for its own reasons, joined Qatar in backing the uprisings, forming the basis of Qatar\u2019s first real alliance.Sunni monarchies like the United Arab Emirates, fearing uprisings at home, consolidated behind Saudi leadership and against Qatar.The rivalry even extended to Washington, where Qatar spent lavishly on lobbying and think tank donations. The United Arab Emirates did the same, seeking to keep pace with Qatar\u2019s influence in the United States.\u201cIn 2013, you have more or less a rout of the Qatari position,\u201d Mr. Lynch said.Still, Qatar retained the autonomy and network of connections that had been its original goal.Saudi Arabia tolerated Qatar\u2019s autonomy, to focus on another regional proxy war, against Iran. This also served the interests of the United States, which relied on both Saudi Arabia and Qatar in fighting the Islamic State and wanted their rivalry stabilized.The 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, which Saudi Arabia opposed, further complicated the issue. It left Saudi Arabia more concerned by Qatar\u2019s links to Iran, however limited, but less willing to pressure Qatar, which the Saudis knew would inflame tensions with Washington over the Iran deal.The rivals were left in a tenuous, uneasy balance.Though Qatar had stepped back, its campaign taught Saudi Arabia a lesson: An uncontrolled Qatar posed a grave threat.Saudi Arabia, joined by other gulf states and Egypt, finally found its opportunity to reimpose dominance with last week\u2019s blockade.This would also force fence-sitters to choose sides, at a moment when Saudi Arabia is stronger. Riyadh is still working to re-establish regional dominance, under growing pressure from Iran.But Saudi Arabia appeared to quickly win the greatest prize of all: American backing.But forcing hands can be risky.Iran has offered food aid to Qatar, betting that it can expand its influence there and perhaps with two other gulf states, Kuwait and Oman, that seek a balance between it and Saudi Arabia.The most significant move could come from Turkey, which has sided vocally with Qatar. Its Parliament approved a measure allowing Turkey to deploy up to 3,000 troops to its base in Qatar, where 100 are currently stationed.Aaron Stein, an analyst at the Atlantic Council, a think tank based in Washington, said Turkey had recently patched up relations with Saudi Arabia, seeking a middle ground, \u201cbut there are limits to that.\u201dTurkey\u2019s state-dominated media, which has few pro-Saudi voices, has championed the defense of Qatar, an ally, as a nationalist cause.Though Turkey is a NATO member, over the past year it has joined Iran in aligning its regional strategy with Russia\u2019s. Moscow\u2019s position could gain in the crisis as American allies quarrel.Though few expect the standoff to escalate to violence, it remains far from clear how it will be resolved. This may be the end of the two-decade Saudi-Qatar rivalry, or it could bring just another layer of instability and crosscutting alliances to a region that already has plenty.A capsule summary on Tuesday for an article about the decades-long rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Qatar omitted the context in describing the population of Qatar. The country\u2019s population was one-seventh that of Connecticut\u2019s in 1995 when its crown prince seized power; that is not a current comparison. (Qatar now has about 2.6 million people and Connecticut about 3.6 million.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mis-Educating the Young", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few months ago I had lunch with a former student named Lucy Fleming, one of the best writers I\u2019ve taught. I asked her what she had learned in her first year out of college. She said she had been forced to think differently.While in school, her thinking was station to station: take that test, apply to that college, aim for a degree. But in young adulthood, there are no more stations. Everything is open seas. Your main problems are not about the assignment right in front of you; they are about the horizon far away. What should you be steering toward? It requires an entirely different set of navigational skills.This gets at one of the oddest phenomena of modern life. Childhood is more structured than it has ever been. But then the great engine of the meritocracy spits people out into a young adulthood that is less structured than it has ever been.There used to be certain milestones that young adults were directed toward by age 27: leaving home, becoming financially independent, getting married, buying a house, having a child. But the information economy has scrambled those timetables. Current 20-somethings are much less likely to do any of those things by 30. They are less likely to be anchored in a political party, church or some other creedal community.When I graduated from college there was a finite number of career ladders in front of me: teacher, lawyer, doctor, business. Now college graduates enter a world with four million footstools. There are many more places to perch (a start-up, an NGO, a coffee shop, a consultancy) but few of the footstools pay a sustaining wage, seem connected with the others or lead to a clear ladder of rungs to climb upward.People in their 20s seem to be compelled to bounce around more, popping up here and there, quantumlike, with different jobs, living arrangements and partners while hoping that all these diverse experiences magically add up to something.Naturally enough, their descriptions of their lives are rife with uncertainty and anxiety. Many young adults describe a familiar pattern. They try something out but soon feel trapped. They drink too much, worry about how to get out of a job or a relationship. Eventually they do, which is often easier than the anxiety beforehand. They put their life on pause, which is lonely, while they re-cohere. Then they try something else.All the while social media makes the comparison game more intrusive than ever, and nearly everybody feels as if he or she is falling behind. Recently I came across a website with popular message tattoos. The ones people chose weren\u2019t exactly about carefree youth. They were about endurance and resilience: \u201cI will break but I will not fold\u201d; \u201cFall down seven times, stand up eight\u201d; \u201cDon\u2019t lose yourself in your fear\u201d; \u201cThe only way out is through.\u201dAnd how do we as a society prepare young people for this uncertain phase? We pump them full of vapid but haunting praise about how talented they are and how their future is limitless. Then we send them (the most privileged of them) to colleges where the professors teach about what interests the professors. Then we preach a gospel of autonomy that says all the answers to the deeper questions in life are found by getting in touch with your \u201ctrue self,\u201d whatever the heck that is.I used to think that the answer to the traumas of the 20s was patience. Life is long. Wait until they\u2019re 30. They\u2019ll figure it out. Now I think that laissez-faire attitude trivializes the experiences of young adulthood and condescends to the people going through them.Jay\u2019s book is filled with advice on how to get on with life. For example, build identity capital. If you are going to be underemployed, do it in a way that people are going to find interesting later on. Nobody is ever going to ask you, \u201cWhat was it like being a nanny?\u201d They will ask you, \u201cWhat was it like leading excursions of Outward Bound?\u201dI\u2019d say colleges have to do much more to put certain questions on the table, to help students grapple with the coming decade of uncertainty: What does it mean to be an adult today? What are seven or 10 ways people have found purpose in life? How big should I dream or how realistic should I be? What are the criteria we should think about before shacking up? What is the cure for sadness? What do I want and what is truly worth wanting?Before, there were social structures that could guide young adults as they gradually figured out the big questions of life. Now, those structures are gone. Young people are confronted by the existential questions right away. They\u2019re going to feel lost if they have no sense of what they\u2019re pointing toward, if they have no vision of the holy grails on the distant shore.Paul Krugman is off today.Advertisement"}

Some seniors had won university scholarships. Others were counting on springboarding from community college to a four-year degree.But for a good number of the 18-year-olds here and at graduations across the country, there was no golden ticket to higher education. This was it for teachers and books: a hard-won diploma, a handshake from the principal, a walk offstage and into real life.What kind of American dream lies ahead?Nearly all make this calculation well aware that in a fast-changing economy, college is the surest shot at a better-paying job.Some 30 percent of this year\u2019s three million graduating seniors will not go straight to college, a number that is ticking up as an improving economy draws more graduates directly to work. They go to Walmarts and to welding shops, restaurants, salons, hospitals and construction sites, to start careers on the tougher side of the vast economic and cultural divide that is demarcated by a college degree.Some simply lack the money for college. Some need to help their families or want to save up for a first apartment. Some just want to build things with their hands.And some are so wary of going into debt that they choose instead to work to save up for college sometime down the road.

{"Headline": "In Whole Foods, Bezos Gets a Sustainably Sourced Guinea Pig", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "State of the ArtBy purchasing the upscale chain, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief, has a chance to tinker with how people buy groceries \u2014 and map the future of the physical store.Supported byWhen big tech companies make big moves, it\u2019s natural to see the news in earthshaking terms.Sure, all of this seems plausible at some point in the future. In particular, an Amazon presence in groceries might transform it from a company you shop at every once in a while to one you think about several times a week. This is not a novel idea: It was the key reason Walmart got into the grocery business in the 1980s, a move that accelerated its shift from a regional chain into the world\u2019s largest physical retailer.Yet if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, after years of watching Amazon, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time predicting future possibilities. He is instead consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer\u2019s eyes. The other thing to know about Mr. Bezos is that he is a committed experimentalist. His main way of deciding what Amazon should do next is to try stuff out, see what works, and do more of that.So the best way to think of this deal is to look at Whole Foods as a kind of guinea pig for Amazon \u2014 a pricey, organically sourced one, perhaps, but a guinea pig all the same.Amazon almost certainly doesn\u2019t know yet how exactly Whole Foods will fit into its long-term plans. You can expect it to make few dramatic changes to Whole Foods in the near future. Instead, Mr. Bezos and his team will most likely spend years meticulously analyzing and tinkering with how Whole Foods works. They will begin lots of experiments. When something works, they will do more of that, then more, and then even more. They may take over the world all the same \u2014 and, in the process, probably usher in big changes to large swaths of the economy, affecting everything from labor to urban planning \u2014 but they\u2019ll do it in ways we won\u2019t be able to predict now.\u201cI think they look at this as an opportunity to learn,\u201d said Venky Harinarayan, an early Amazon executive who later worked at Walmart, and who also ran a venture capital firm in which Mr. Bezos was a big investor. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for everyone \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone has figured out yet how to use a store to service online customers at massive scale. That\u2019s the experimental piece.\u201dIn this light, I suspect that the Whole Foods deal starts less with a strategic end-goal and more with this insight: Shopping for food is broken. Both the in-store experience and the many attempts at online delivery \u2014 from Webvan to Instacart to Amazon\u2019s own service, Amazon Fresh \u2014 have failed to create the sort of seamless buying experience we enjoy with nonfood e-commerce.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.But online grocery delivery also isn\u2019t so great. Delivery services tend to be far more expensive than in-store shopping, and it\u2019s still not quite painless: You have to order ahead of time, you often have to deal with last-minute substitutions, and the whole process is still quite labor-intensive and wasteful. (Ask me about the many pounds of ice-filled plastic bags I have to dispose of every time I shop at Amazon Fresh.)But wait a second, isn\u2019t $13.4 billion a lot for an experiment? Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u201cNo doubt it\u2019s a big deal; it\u2019s a large amount of money,\u201d Mr. Harinarayan said. But he also noted that Amazon is flying high.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lessons From the Collapse of Banco Popular", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameRather than panic, though, world financial markets shrugged, and eurozone regulators congratulated themselves for directing a big bank rescue without having to tap taxpayers.Isn\u2019t it good to know that everything is under control among eurozone banks?That is the view investors seem to be taking. Whistling past the Banco Popular graveyard, many seem eager to ignore the warnings this failure raises about rising risks in the European banking sector. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, too, seem unfazed by the incident as they continue their push to reduce the size of capital cushions that banks must set aside for bad times.But its rescue, European financial regulators say, proved that the mechanisms created after the 2008 crisis work well. After all, no taxpayer money was involved in the takeover; those on the losing end included investors in the bank\u2019s stock and in the $1.4 billion in debt-like instruments Banco Popular issued to provide a capital cushion.Santander\u2019s shareholders are also taking a hit: Their holdings are diluted by the bank\u2019s decision to raise $7.9 billion in equity to shore up its balance sheet.But there is much for investors to learn in the Banco Popular meltdown. Lesson No. 1: Don\u2019t trust bank stress-test results.Financial institutions must have capital on hand in order to absorb losses. And stress tests were designed by regulators to assess how resilient bank balance sheets will be during downturns. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Board released the results at 34 of the nation\u2019s largest banks. All exceeded their minimum thresholds.Consider, for example, the institution\u2019s common equity Tier 1 capital, a measure that takes its equity, or ready capital, and divides it by the risk-weighted assets it holds. In the 2016 report, that measure stood at 10.2 percent of assets, which was below the 12.6 percent average among 51 big European banks, but not the worst on the list.Even in a so-called adverse scenario, the 2016 test said, Banco Popular would have excess capital of 6.6 percent.This spring, amid a genuinely adverse situation, this supposed capital cushion vanished almost overnight. After top Banco Popular officials said they needed to raise capital in April, the institution began to experience a run. Then, in early June the bank received $4 billion in emergency assistance from the Spanish central bank; it was consumed in two days. The Santander deal quickly followed.Lesson No. 2 of the Banco Popular collapse is that regulators should require banks to maintain higher leverage ratios, another measure of capital adequacy. And yet this is a regulatory requirement the Trump administration wants to loosen.Leverage ratios are computed by dividing a bank\u2019s tangible common equity by its total assets. Currently, large United States bank holding companies must have a leverage ratio of at least 5 percent to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. European regulators are much more lenient, requiring a ratio of only 3 percent beginning in January 2018.Obviously, given the rescue, the bank\u2019s capital was inadequate.And yet, Mr. Hoenig said, the leverage ratio is under attack.Left unsaid is that looser capital requirements could also result in greater risk of a taxpayer bailout.Which leads us to lesson No. 3 from the Banco Popular mess: Don\u2019t reach for yield if you\u2019re not ready for the risk.Investors who bought contingent convertible securities issued by Banco Popular to fund its capital cushion learned this the hard way. They were wiped out literally overnight in the failure.These securities, also known as additional tier notes, are part of the regulatory regime in Europe and are designed to absorb losses when a bank gets in trouble. Mutual funds and insurance companies often buy these securities for their slightly higher yields.The idea is that the creditors holding these instruments, not taxpayers, will pay the price of a failure \u2014 and that is what occurred in the Banco Popular collapse.Trading in the Banco Popular securities has been stunning. In April they were above par, in bond parlance, or 100, but the day before the bank failed, they were trading around 50. The next day they went to zero.Still, the market for these types of securities issued by other European banks has not plummeted. This suggests investors are ignoring their perils.\u201cThe root of the problem is the nonperforming loans on the books of European banks,\u201d said Cliff Noreen, deputy chief investment officer at MassMutual. \u201cWe view the European economy as improving and are actively purchasing European corporate bonds and loans, both investment grade and high yield. But we are very leery of the banking sector.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Amazon-Walmart Showdown That Explains the Modern Economy", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsEach one is trying to become more like the other \u2014 Walmart by investing heavily in its technology, Amazon by opening physical bookstores and now buying physical supermarkets. But this is more than a battle between two business titans. Their rivalry sheds light on the shifting economics of nearly every major industry, replete with winner-take-all effects and huge advantages that accrue to the biggest and best-run organizations, to the detriment of upstarts and second-fiddle players.Men\u2019s dress clothing, mine included, can be a little boring. Like many male office workers, I lean toward clothes that are sharp but not at all showy. Nearly every weekday, I wear a dress shirt that is either light blue, white or has some subtle check pattern, usually paired with slacks and a blazer. The description alone could make a person doze.I used to buy my dress shirts from a Hong Kong tailor. They fit perfectly, but ordering required an awkward meeting with a visiting salesman in a hotel suite. They took six weeks to arrive, and they cost around $120 each, which adds up fast when you need to buy eight or 10 a year to keep up with wear and tear.I\u2019m on the fence as to which company will provide my next shirt order, and a new deal this week makes it a doubly interesting quandary: Walmart is buying Bonobos.Walmart and Amazon have had their sights on each other for years, each aiming to be the dominant seller of goods \u2014 however consumers of the future want to buy them. It increasingly looks like that \u201chowever\u201d is a hybrid of physical stores and online-ordering channels, and each company is coming at the goal from a different starting point.Walmart has thousands of stores that sell hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods. It is particularly strong in suburban and rural areas and among low- and middle-income consumers, but it\u2019s playing catch-up with online sales and affluent urbanites.Why are these two mega-retailers both trying to sell me shirts? The short answer is because they both want to sell everything.More specifically, Bonobos is known as an innovator in exactly this type of hybrid of online and physical store sales. Its website and online customer service are excellent, and it operates stores in major cities where you can try on garments and order items to be shipped directly. Because all the actual inventory is centralized, the stores themselves can occupy minimal square footage.So the acquisition may help Walmart build expertise in the very areas where it is trying to gain on Amazon. You can look at the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods through the same lens. The grocery business has a whole different set of challenges from the types of goods that Amazon has specialized in; you can\u2019t store a steak or a banana the way you do books or toys. And people want to be able to make purchases and take them home on the spur of the moment.Just as Walmart is using Bonobos to get access to higher-end consumers and a more technologically savvy way of selling clothes, Amazon is using Whole Foods to get the expertise and physical presence it takes to sell fresh foods.But bigger dimensions of the modern economy also come into play.The apparel business has long been a highly competitive industry in which countless players could find a niche. Any insight that one shirt-maker developed could be rapidly copied by others, and consumer prices reflected the retailer\u2019s real estate costs and branding approach as much as anything.That helps explain why there are thousands of options worldwide for someone who wants a decent-quality men\u2019s shirt. In that world, any shirt-maker that tried to get too big rapidly faced diminishing returns. It would have to pay more and more to lease the real estate for far-flung stores, and would have to outbid competitors to hire all the experienced shirt-makers. The expansion wouldn\u2019t offer any meaningful cost savings and would entail a lot more headaches trying to manage it all.But more and more businesses in the modern economy, rather than reflecting those diminishing returns to scale, show positive returns to scale: The biggest companies have a huge advantage over smaller players. That tends to tilt markets toward a handful of players or even a monopoly, rather than an even playing field with countless competitors.The most extreme example of this would be the software business, where a company can invest bottomless sums in a piece of software, but then sell it to each additional customer for practically nothing. The apparel industry isn\u2019t that extreme \u2014 the price of making a shirt is still linked to the cost of fabric and the workers to do the stitching \u2014 but it is moving in that direction.And that helps explain why Walmart and Amazon are so eager to put a shirt on my back.Already, retailers need to figure out how to manage sophisticated supply chains connecting Southeast Asia with stores in big American cities so that they rarely run out of product. They need mobile apps and websites that offer a seamless user experience so that nothing stands between a would-be purchaser and an order.Larger companies that are good at supply chain management and technology can spread those more-or-less fixed costs around more total sales, enabling them to keep prices lower than a niche player and entrench their advantage.These positive returns to scale could become even more pronounced. Perhaps in the future, rather than manufacture a bunch of shirts in Indonesia and Malaysia and ship them to the United States to be sold one at a time to urban office workers, a company will have a robot manufacture shirts to my specifications somewhere nearby.That in turn may help explain why the income gap has widened in recent years. Essentially, the corporate world is bifurcating between winners and losers, with big implications for their workers.How much of that is because of shifting technology \u2014 as opposed to changing corporate behavior, or loose antitrust policy \u2014 is an open debate.What isn\u2019t is this: The decision by Amazon and Walmart to compete for my grocery business \u2014 as well as for space in my closet \u2014 is a tiny battle in a war to dominate a changing global economy.And for companies that can\u2019t compete on price and technology, it could cost them the shirt off their backs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Banks Clear First Phase of Federal Reserve Stress Tests", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnce universally dreaded by banks, the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual stress tests are becoming less stressful.The banking system, according to the test results, has an even larger capital cushion than it did going into last year\u2019s exam. That is likely to increase calls from the financial industry and its allies in the Trump administration and Congress to start watering down the regulations.Even the Fed governor overseeing the tests this year has said he wants to pull back some rules.Banks have complained that regulators have unduly required banks to pile on capital that they could use to lend to small business and homeowners. The required capital buildup has also squeezed the industry\u2019s profits, which can cut into bankers\u2019 pay and bonuses.Thursday\u2019s results are very likely a good harbinger for next week\u2019s even more consequential test, when Fed officials will decide whether to approve the banks\u2019 plans to pay dividends and repurchase shares.Wall Street analysts expect that those payouts will increase this year \u2014 a big plum for investors who have gone through nearly a decade of lagging stock prices. Bank stocks, which rallied sharply in the wake of President Trump\u2019s election victory, are for the most part off the highs they reached earlier in the year.The Federal Reserve analyzes the banks\u2019 soundness by running their actual loans and other assets through a series of scenarios that would lead to huge losses.This year\u2019s fictional challenges for 34 banks included unemployment of about 10 percent and commercial real estate losses of 35 percent.The Fed governor overseeing this year\u2019s tests is Jerome H. Powell, a Republican former private equity executive appointed by President Barack Obama in 2011.Although the criteria for the stress tests are reviewed and approved by the entire Board of Governors, Mr. Powell has made it clear that some rules need to be adjusted now that the banks are well capitalized.America\u2019s biggest banks breezed through the first phase of the annual test. Next week, the Fed will decide whether to approve plans to pay dividends and repurchase shares.Banks have complained that the qualitative aspect of the test is subject to the whims of individual regulators, allowing them to fail a certain bank just to set an example.\u201cAs we consider the progress that has been achieved in improving the resiliency and resolvability of our banking industry, it is important for us to look for ways to reduce unnecessary burden,\u201d Mr. Powell said in his prepared testimony.The tone of Mr. Powell\u2019s remarks is different from that of his predecessor, Daniel K. Tarrullo, who had overseen regulation for the Fed before stepping down in April.On the eve of last year\u2019s stress tests, Mr. Tarrullo publicly signaled the need for higher capital surcharges on the eight largest banks.Looking ahead to future tests, banks have even more reason to feel relieved.Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who used to run OneWest Bank, wants to limit the number of banks that must undergo the stress tests. The Treasury recommends that only banks with assets of $50 billion or more be subject to the exercise. Currently, banks with at least $10 billion are tested.The Treasury also proposes doing away with the qualitative part of the stress test, which will be administered next week.It also would require banks to submit their dividend plans every two years instead of every year.Banking trade groups seized on the results Thursday as proof that the time had come to ease up on the tests. At the largest banks, overall capital levels have increased to $1.2 trillion, from about $500 billion in 2009.\u201cFrom this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,\u201d Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement.Senate Democrats warned that the Trump administration\u2019s proposals would allow banks to more easily \u201cgame\u201d the tests and hide their risks.\u201cThese recommendations would make the watchdogs\u2019 jobs harder and prevent them from spotting risks before they balloon out of control,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said in a statement.Banks have dedicated entire staffs to prepare for the tests, which had become, in some cases, an annual referendum on a banking chief\u2019s job performance.But as the capital levels have steadily grown, the outcome of the tests for most banks has become less in doubt.\u201cThe overall feel of it and the intensity of it has subsided significantly,\u201d said Bill Hines, a portfolio manager focused on banks at Aberdeen Asset Management.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Plans to Shift Infrastructure Funding to Cities, States and Business", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump will lay out a vision this coming week for sharply curtailing the federal government\u2019s funding of the nation\u2019s infrastructure and calling upon states, cities and corporations to shoulder most of the cost of rebuilding roads, bridges, railways and waterways.He will also endorse a plan to privatize and modernize the nation\u2019s air-traffic control system. That plan, which is to be introduced on Monday at the White House and the subject of a major speech in the Midwest two days later, will be Mr. Trump\u2019s first concrete explanation of how he intends to fulfill a campaign promise to lead $1 trillion in United States infrastructure projects. The goal is to create millions of jobs while doing much-needed reconstruction and updating. But the actual details of the initiative are unsettled, and a more intricate blueprint is still weeks or even months from completion.What the president will offer instead over the coming days, his advisers said, are the contours of a plan. The federal government would make only a fractional down payment on rebuilding the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure. Mr. Trump would rely on a combination of private industry, state and city tax money, and borrowed cash to finance the rest. It would be a stark departure from ambitious infrastructure programs of the past, in which the government played a major role and devoted substantial resources to paying the cost of large-scale projects.\u201cWe like the template of not using taxpayer dollars to give taxpayers wins,\u201d said Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council and an architect of the infrastructure plan, in an interview Friday in his West Wing office.His language evoked the corridors of Wall Street, where he previously worked. \u201cWe want to be in the partnership business,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cWe want to be in the facilitation business, and we\u2019re willing to provide capital wherever necessary to help certain infrastructure along.\u201dAs a model for the approach, Mr. Trump plans on Monday to send a proposal to Congress for overhauling the nation\u2019s air-traffic control system. He would spin it off into a private, nonprofit corporation that would use digital satellite-based tracking systems, rather than land-based radar, to guide flights in the United States. There would be no cost to the government, Mr. Cohn said, because a newly formed corporation would finance the entire enterprise, using loans to handle the initial costs of equipment and other needs.On Wednesday, Mr. Cohn said, the president will travel to the banks of the Ohio River to deliver a speech about overhauling the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including the inland waterways that are in dire need of attention.Mr. Trump is \u201ctrying to figure out, How do I get the most infrastructure improvements for the American citizens in the quickest fashion I can with the best return on investment for the U.S. taxpayers,\u201d said Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a businessman\u2019s model.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Trump will hold listening sessions at the White House with a group of mayors and governors. On Friday, he plans to cap off what members of the administration are calling \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d with a visit to the Transportation Department, where he will discuss drastically reducing the time it takes to obtain federal permits for projects.The Trump administration clearly hopes the infrastructure rollout will provide a sorely needed policy victory. Its first attempt to overhaul the Affordable Care Act was so unpopular, even among Republicans, that House Speaker Paul Ryan called off a planned vote and began a rewrite. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said he was uncertain whether he could find a majority to move a health care bill through his chamber.The president\u2019s principles for a \u201cmassive\u201d tax cut, encapsulated in what appeared to be a hastily written one-page document issued in April, were widely ridiculed for a lack of specifics and their underlying economic-growth assumptions, which many economists and policy experts considered overly rosy. And Mr. Trump has been roundly chastised for his recent decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, a multinational plan to limit global warming through curbs on emissions that Mr. Cohn and many prominent corporate executives supported.Despite the public push to promote the infrastructure package, Mr. Cohn acknowledged that the White House did not have a detailed proposal ready to release. He said, for example, that no decision had been made on whether the infrastructure plan would ultimately be married to a tax measure. Republicans and Democrats tried such a step during the Obama administration, in a plan that would have used revenue from repatriating corporate profits parked overseas to finance projects to improve roads, bridges, waterways, broadband and other areas.\u201cIt\u2019s undetermined yet,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cIt may come before. It may come during. It may come after.\u201dMr. Trump said in an interview with CBS News in April that his infrastructure bill was \u201clargely completed, and we\u2019ll be filing over the next two or three weeks, maybe sooner.\u201dMr. Cohn blamed the delay on lawmakers, saying the White House was reluctant to send its proposal to Congress until progress had been made on the health care bill, a budget bill, legislation to raise the debt ceiling and the as-yet-unformed tax bill.\u201cIf we thought it was the time to release an infrastructure bill, we would release an infrastructure bill,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t keep throwing stuff on Congress. We actually need them to get legislation done. And as they start getting legislation done, we\u2019ll come back with infrastructure.\u201dWhen that happens, the package is likely to meet with substantial criticism from Democrats, who were heartened to hear Mr. Trump focus on infrastructure spending during his presidential campaign but crestfallen to see the budget he unveiled last month. The proposed spending plan devoted only one-fifth of the money that he had spoken of for building and improving infrastructure.\u201cWhen Trump talked during the campaign about $1 trillion for infrastructure, people were taking him at his word that it would be $1 trillion,\u201d said Sarah Feinberg, a former senior official at the Transportation Department in the Obama administration. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal to spend $200 billion in the next 10 years falls far short of what is needed, she said.\u201cThe idea that this really minimal amount of federal investment will spur that level of private investment is hopeful but not realistic,\u201d Ms. Feinberg said. \u201cThe reality is, the state of infrastructure has become an existential threat to huge portions of the economy.\u201dFor now, Mr. Trump is focused on popular ideas that have been discussed by members of both parties for years. At the Transportation Department on Friday, he will pitch what Mr. Cohn called his \u201c10-to-two plan,\u201d an effort to cut permitting requirements so the process takes only two years instead of a decade. The current sluggish pace has prompted frequent complaints from construction and financing companies, who say the excessive bureaucracy that surrounds major infrastructure projects can be a costly and sometimes insurmountable hurdle.Mr. Trump\u2019s air-traffic control privatization plan is based on a bill sponsored by Representative Bill Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. It has drawn criticism from Representative Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the panel, who has said it would cater to large airlines at the expense of smaller operators.Jonathan Root, a senior credit officer for the ratings agency Moody\u2019s, said privatizing air-traffic control could be a welcome change. \u201cThe expectation is that a private organization will complete the modernization much quicker than if it remains with the F.A.A.,\u201d he said.Although many of the details of the privatized air-traffic control system are far into the future, administration officials said they did not anticipate higher airline-user fees or increases in ticket prices.In a statement, Thom Metzger, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, expressed cautious optimism about the air-traffic control reforms, which have been widely telegraphed in Mr. Trump\u2019s public comments and at White House gatherings. \u201cNatca considers the status quo to be unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Metzger stated, adding that the group shares \u201cthe administration\u2019s commitments to infrastructure modernization.\u201d It supports the notion of privatizing air-traffic control, he said, but only in a nonprofit entity.An earlier version of this article identified incorrectly those who said they did not think a privatized air traffic control system would result in higher fees and ticket prices. Administration officials took that position, but Jonathan Root of Moody\u2019s did not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America in Retreat", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe swiftness of President Trump\u2019s transformation of America\u2019s global image from a proud and valued leader to something more nearly resembling a whiny bully has heads spinning at home and abroad. Mr. Trump was elected on a slogan of \u201cAmerica First\u201d and a promise that the country would never again be bound by agreements and conventions that, in his view, compromised its sovereignty. But the policies and pronouncements that have flowed from this promise have in fact made the United States, and his presidency, the object of disbelief, alarm, even derision.America may be first in the eyes of the president, but in the eyes of the world it is in headlong retreat.The authors presumably meant this as praise of hardheaded realism. It is actually a vision of a world of cutthroat competition and zero-sum outcomes deeply at odds with the more cooperative, rules-based vision that has motivated America and its allies since World War II. Under the old model, the world looked to America to set the tone and agenda. Of course there were mistakes and misadventures, but on the whole American leadership and engagement were undeniably good for this country and, more often than not, a force for global peace and security.Determined to prevent another devastating war, the United States led the way in establishing institutions, rules and norms that would encourage countries to settle their differences peacefully and work together to solve problems that were beyond the capability of any one state. Trade agreements and financial institutions were put in place to expand economic growth and bring people out of poverty. Washington also led the way in promoting human rights and democracy.America\u2019s commitment to those institutions and values is now in question under a president who is arrogant in his disregard of history, nuance and, most important, understanding of American leadership and what in fact makes the country secure, prosperous and \u201cgreat.\u201dInstitutions and relationships need to grow and evolve. Events happen. Priorities change. Countries, like people, can be vulnerable to new risks and unable to exploit new opportunities if they don\u2019t pay attention. The world still hasn\u2019t figured out how to manage China\u2019s rise. Still, Mr. Trump and his team, embroiled in controversy over Russia and other matters, have shown no inclination, much less skill, to do the hard thinking that must precede any decision to alter America\u2019s role in the world. And even if they did attempt such preparation, it is hard to imagine any convincing argument for abrogating or even weakening the country\u2019s leadership responsibilities, its defense of NATO and Europe, its preference for cooperative problem-solving and its commitment to democratic values and human rights.Is this what Americans want? If not, they had better voice their opposition loudly and clearly. Mr. Trump, abetted inexplicably by people who should know better \u2014 General McMaster, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis \u2014 is moving fast down a dangerous and uncertain road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Corbyn Lost U.K. Election, but Is Still Its Biggest Winner", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 It was a scathing put-down. \u201cHe can lead a protest, I\u2019m leading the country,\u201d Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain said about the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn.Over the past seven weeks, Mr. Corbyn led the protest of his life. As Mrs. May faltered, stumbling her way toward an election she herself had called, the veteran left winger and serial campaigner turned his party into a movement.Even in his own party, many derided Mr. Corbyn as a hopeless and hapless leader, an unreformed Marxist who would sink the Labour Party into oblivion, and wanted him to lose the election \u2014 badly.Mr. Corbyn did lose the election. But he won more than anyone else. He deprived the prime minister who had treated him with such dismissiveness of both her Parliamentary majority and her authority. Far from obliterating Labour, he re-energized it, shifting its politics far to the left.By Friday afternoon, some of his critics were eating their words.\u201cHe\u2019s had a brilliant campaign,\u201d said Chuka Umunna, a senior member of the Labour Party who was among those openly disgruntled with Mr. Corbyn\u2019s leadership last year. \u201cJeremy has fought this campaign with enthusiasm, energy, verve, has clearly loved being surrounded in the mix with people. That\u2019s what politics is all about.\u201dAnd a striking contrast to Mrs. May, who was roundly criticized as wooden, robotic and manifestly uncomfortable when meeting voters.When the election campaign started last month, few took the 68-year-old Mr. Corbyn seriously. But his unorthodox path fits a broader pattern of outsiders and, some would say, populists who are shaking up the political center in Western countries from left and right.A five-time winner of the parliamentary beard of the year, Mr. Corbyn is Britain\u2019s Bernie Sanders, another grizzled firebrand who inspired a generation of young voters to become politicized and, at least this week, turn out to vote. Mr. Corbyn\u2019s fans call themselves Corbynistas.Some already say that with his rejection of free-market economics and his quiet but more compromising approach to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, he might not just change the Labour Party but also shift British politics more broadly.Mr. Corbyn is a different type of politician, one happier on the campaign trail speaking to fellow activists through a megaphone than debating in the neo-Gothic splendor of the British Parliament with its arcane rules and obscure traditions.In 2015, after more than three decades as a lawmaker, he had to be persuaded to stand for the party leadership, agreeing only reluctantly and in order to enable the left to present a candidate. No one, not even Mr. Corbyn himself, expected him to win. If ever there were an accidental leader, he is it.During his 34 years in Parliament, Mr. Corbyn has essentially been in permanent opposition, not just to Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party but also to his own Labour Party. He voted against the Iraq invasion, has opposed successive attempts to roll back civil liberties in the fight against terrorism and has long argued against deregulation and free-market reforms.The biggest problem, he has said, is that since Margaret Thatcher established neoliberalism as the dominant economic consensus in Britain in the 1980s, Labour allowed the Conservatives to set the agenda on the economy and never offered an alternative narrative.Mr. Corbyn offered that alternative: Under the banner of \u201cFor the Many Not the Few,\u201d he vowed to nationalize the railroads, make universities free again and inject billions into the National Health Service by raising taxes on companies and the top 5 percent of income earners.Yet how he might turn what he called a \u201cgood, losing campaign\u201d into a winning strategy remains unclear, said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham.Labour \u201cbet the farm\u201d on increasing the turnout among young voters by promising to abolish student tuition, at a cost of 11 billion pounds, Mr. Fielding said. \u201cIt gave a very tangible retail offer to young voters \u2014 the first time young voters have been given this.\u201dEven Mr. Corbyn\u2019s political enemies concede that his politics are principled, with one Conservative lawmaker saying that the Labour leader at least practiced what he preached.When dozens of lawmakers had to resign over rigging their expense accounts in 2009 and journalists scrutinized the finances of members of Parliament, Mr. Corbyn apparently had the lowest claim of all his colleagues: \u00a38.95 for a printer cartridge. He makes his own jam and rides a bike.Mr. Corbyn grew up in a political household (his parents met during the Spanish Civil War) and was himself galvanized into activism by the Vietnam War and environmental issues, particularly his opposition to nuclear power \u2014 and Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent policy.The causes that he has been passionate about are many, including the rights of Palestinians and South Africa\u2019s anti-apartheid struggle. But he has also come under fire for showing sympathy over the years to the Irish Republican Army and Hamas, the militant group ruling Gaza that is dedicated to eradicating Israel.All of that faded into the background on Friday.Yet while Mr. Corbyn is flying high, he still has not made the case that he can \u2014 and, perhaps more important, should \u2014 lead the nation.Mr. Corbyn, said Mr. Fielding, \u201chas rewritten the rules, but he hasn\u2019t won.\u201d The question, he added, was \u201chow viable is a Corbyn approach to winning power, rather than doing well in defeat?\u201dWith his core vote for now still far to the left of Middle England, Mr. Corbyn seems unlikely ever to run Britain. But that may not trouble a man who, almost uniquely among prominent politicians, shows few signs of wanting power, at least in any personal sense.Asked in a hostile television interview earlier this year whether he truly wanted to be prime minister rather than a \u201cserial protester, objector,\u201d Mr. Corbyn studiously avoided the obvious affirmative reply.\u201cI want to be in government so that we can conquer the housing crisis in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be in government so that people get a real chance in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Senate\u2019s Unaffordable Care Act", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn the days ahead, while the Congressional Budget Office totes up the bill\u2019s cost, and before a floor vote, some Republicans, President Trump included, might be tempted to see the Senate bill as an improvement over the draconian House measure passed in May that would take insurance away from 23 million people. Mr. Trump previously expressed the hope that the Senate version would be less brutal.It isn\u2019t. True, Mr. McConnell and his colleagues have made a few superficial improvements; the rollback of Obamacare\u2019s intended expansion of Medicaid would proceed more slowly than under the House\u2019s timetable. But the long-term damage might be worse. That is because the Senate bill would cap federal spending on Medicaid on a per-person basis. Currently, federal spending varies from year to year based on demand for medical services and the cost of care. Starting in 2025, the cap would be allowed to increase at the rate of inflation in the economy. But the overall inflation rate has typically been much lower than the inflation rate for medical services; in 2016, the overall inflation rate was 1.3 percent, whereas medical costs increased by 3.8 percent. Over time, this would means states will get a lot less money than they do under current law.Like its House counterpart, the Senate bill would also hurt millions of non-Medicaid beneficiaries of Obamacare, those who buy insurance on federal and state marketplaces. It would greatly reduce federal subsidies that help low-income and middle-income families buy health coverage, while allowing insurers to increase deductibles, forcing people to pay more for medical services. It would let states waive rules that now require insurers to cover essential health services like maternity care, cancer treatment and mental health care, which is likely to happen because this will be the only way that states can lower premiums. In sum, it will make health insurance more expensive and less useful, to the great misfortune of the poor, elderly and sick.Mr. McConnell seems determined to steamroll this travesty through the Senate before July 4, despite complaints by conservatives and moderates. Expect him and his colleagues to try to buy support of wavering lawmakers by offering sweeteners like a few billion dollars for addiction treatment and some extra cash for states with high medical costs. Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Rob Portman of Ohio and Dean Heller of Nevada ought not to fall for these cheap gimmicks. Instead, they should vote no on a bill that will take a devastating toll on millions of Americans and that no amount of tinkering around the edges can make better.Advertisement"}

A widely accepted positive correlation between happiness and wealth predicts that this growth should lead to higher life satisfaction, especially among the upper classes. Contrary to traditional understandings that equate increasing economic prosperity with increases in a nation\u2019s overall happiness, however, a recent paper on the paradox of Chinese progress draws an unusual conclusion:In recent decades in China, life satisfaction declined dramatically at precisely the time of its unprecedented economic growth. More educated respondents, those in urban areas, and those with insufficient rest and leisure, are much less satisfied with their lives than the average.The unhappiness of China\u2019s growing middle class illustrates the futility of equating material success with happiness. Long working hours and high workplace stress are usually the prerequisites for ascension to higher socio-economic status. Exposure to ever-higher standards for success triggers a persistent feeling of extreme pressure to succeed, and this phenomenon is especially conspicuous among the educated. Many find that their higher aspirations are combined with an increasing lack of security in the turbulent modern economy. A vicious cycle is formed, and those trapped within it begin experiencing feelings of anxiety and depression. An increase in the incidence of mental illness is a long-term manifestation of this phenomenon: China\u2019s psychiatric hospital admissions have increased by 183.21 percent from 2002 to 2012.Karma Ura, president of The Centre for Bhutan Studies and GNH (Gross National Happiness) Research, has introduced a formula to gauge a nation\u2019s wealth according to the following criteria: access to a \u201cravishing environment,\u201d \u201cvibrant health,\u201d \u201cstrong communal relationships\u201d as well as \u201cmeaning in life and freedom to free time.\u201d If this formula is used as the benchmark for success, China\u2019s economic development has clearly been achieved at the price of many people\u2019s happiness.In order to boost productivity, Deng Xiaoping converted the institutions of the highly-centralized planned economy to market institutions. This shift engendered a period of economic growth. While bringing economic prosperity to many, these largely-successful reforms also led to unchecked exploitation of land and natural resources, soaring average work intensity, rising income inequality and loss of communal beliefs. The legacy of reform includes severe environmental problems, a breakdown of social safety nets, and a conviction among the middle class that materialistic pleasure equals spiritual happiness. All these elements combined to create a sense of unhappiness among the bourgeoisie.It is time that Chinese society prioritized mental health over economic success. The government should encourage this change by introducing GNH as a complement to GDP, placing more emphasis on improving people\u2019s well-being and enacting policies that encourage a healthy work-life balance and a fair and secure environment for all.Works CitedGraham, Carol Shaojie Zhou, and Junyi Zhang. \u201cHappiness and Health in China: The Paradox of Progress.\u201d Brookings Global Working Papers.

Indigenous Australians are imprisoned at roughly 13 times the rate of nonindigenous Australians. They are just 3 percent of the country\u2019s population, with dozens of peoples or nations on the mainland and in the islands of the Torres Strait, but account for a disproportionate share of suicides in Australia. .Indigenous Australians also suffer disproportionate levels of poverty, addiction and unemployment in what they say is a racist society that dismisses them as second-class citizens.But the Australian government has yet to embrace these demands.Young indigenous Australians in particular, from various regions and backgrounds, described their country as a place where even when they have rights on paper, they do not always have them in practice. Having covered protests against the police in Ferguson, Mo., Minneapolis and other American cities, I am familiar with this complaint \u2014 and with the stories that racial minorities in Australia told me about how they feel that they face inherited disadvantages in their efforts to build successful lives.\u201cI think some of the kids who live in particularly difficult situations, often in remote areas, are extraordinarily strong and resilient people to survive as long as they do,\u201d said Geoffrey Winters, a Aboriginal man who works as a lawyer in Sydney. \u201cThe argument should be, Why are our common peers allowed to fall to that position and isn\u2019t it a national responsibility to solve the problem?\u201dIn three very different parts of Australia \u2014 the mining areas of the west; Murray Island in the north; and Sydney, a city of five million in the east \u2014 I met many indigenous millennials who exemplify the challenges and promise that Australia has yet to fully embrace. Here are three of their stories.Ms. Jessell, who had been teased on the bus to school, was so close with one of her cousins that they called each other sisters. They took a job training program together where they learned to prepare r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters. They went camping.One thing they did not do together was drink. Ms. Jessell, 19, said she usually avoided the drinking scene in their remote hometown, Kununurra.So when her cousin went out one evening last September after a camping trip, Ms. Jessell recalled, \u201cI told her I\u2019d be waiting for her.\u201dBut Ms. Jessell would never hear from her again.Instead, she said, at about 3 o\u2019clock the next morning, she awoke to someone banging on her door.It was a family member with grim news: Her cousin had attempted suicide. Ms. Jessell rushed to the scene, but an ambulance already had taken her cousin to the hospital. About an hour later, Ms. Jessell said, she got the news that her cousin had died.Ms. Jessell found herself squarely in the middle of one of the most depressing realities for Aboriginal people in her corner of Australia and beyond: suicide.Why, Ms. Jessell was left to wonder, did her cousin \u2014 who exhibited no real signs of stress in her life \u2014 suddenly decide to end it?The New York Times is expanding its coverage of Australia and the region and we\u2019re inviting subscribers to help us shape the project with questions and discussion.Ms. Jessell said she would later learn that her cousin had gotten into an argument with some relatives shortly before she killed herself. A lot of young people also feel shunned by families, who are sometimes too poor to provide properly for them, she said.Many young people think suicide is the answer.\u201cNow you have people over the age of 10 hanging themselves, wanting to commit suicide because of petty little things like alcohol, drugs,\u201d Ms. Jessell said.Her boyfriend, Mikey Cox, who turns 18 this week, said there was also often a lack of emotional support in indigenous families, as they are loath to talk about their problems with each other.\u201cLots of people have suicidal thoughts because they feel unwanted,\u201d he said.Ms. Jessell said she too had considered suicide after her cousin died. \u201cThat\u2019s the only person I talked to,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only person I run to for help. She meant everything to me.\u201dInstead of suicide, she is trying to pull things back together.Ms. Jessell graduated from high school but never went to college because, she said, she feared more racist taunting like what she had experienced at school.The number of indigenous university students has increased in recent years, to 1.1 percent of all higher education students, but while they are underrepresented there, they are overrepresented behind bars: Indigenous Australians are 15 times more likely to be incarcerated than nonindigenous Australians, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\u201cGetting the same racism,\u201d Ms. Jessell said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the life I want to live.\u201dFor now, Ms. Jessell has returned to a job training program she had quit after her cousin\u2019s death. She is hoping to work in the hospitality industry.Mr. Salee dreaded the question about prison because he knew the answer was not what anyone wanted to hear. By the time he was 21, he already had been locked up twice.That\u2019s when his mother felt it was time to make a change.When Mr. Salee was released from jail in 2009 in Cairns \u2014 this time he had been charged with hitting a police officer with a stereo \u2014 she sent him 500 miles north to his ancestral homeland, Murray Island.The remote outpost has about 300 residents, most of whom are related to each other, and sits in the Torres Strait. It is one in a chain of more than 250 islands that belong to Australia and stretch to Papua New Guinea.Most of the people on these islands, like Mr. Salee, are black. It reminded me a bit of the Caribbean, where I was born, in Trinidad and Tobago, and often feel most at home.Torres Strait Islanders, who are native to the island chain, fiercely embrace their autonomy, emphasizing that although they are native to the land they occupy, they are different from mainland Australia\u2019s Aboriginal people.The Torres Strait Islands are sometimes held up as a model for indigenous independence because traditional owners have a degree of control of the local government \u2014 around some fishing licenses, for example \u2014 and have tried to form their own state. But they are also a place where the rules and restrictions can look very similar to Indigenous communities on the mainland.At Murray Island\u2019s lone bar, an airy place with a pool table surrounded by tall wooden tables, patrons are allowed to purchase beer to take home, but only one six-pack per day. To get that privilege, they must pay 5 Australian dollars (or $4 U.S.) annually for a pub membership. That gets them a card that is swiped with each purchase \u2014 whether it is to take home or drink at the pub \u2014 essentially tracking people\u2019s alcohol consumption.High rates of alcoholism and related problems, such as domestic violence, have led to restrictive rules around drinking for some indigenous Australians across the country. But this was just another sign of Australian paternalism, said Jim Bero, one of the pub\u2019s seven board members. \u201cThey try to treat you like kids.\u201dWhen Mr. Salee was sent to Murray about eight years ago he was essentially left to chart his own course. The police would not be watching closely as they did in Cairns \u2014 just two police officers patrol the island, which has a single main road. There were very few jobs \u2014 the economy consists mostly of a small grocery store, a government office and infrastructure jobs that seem to go mostly to white outsiders.Giving someone who has regularly gotten in trouble with the law the freedom to roam might seem like a dangerous proposition. But for Mr. Salee, it turned out to be empowering.Mr. Salee said that in such a small, insular community, the pressure of not disappointing his elders kept him from acting up.On Murray, there are no restaurants, so if you want to eat you have to earn it. Mr. Salee learned to fish and dive for sea slugs. He is one of many young men who risk their lives plunging off white dinghies into turquoise, shark-infested waters to get their catch, which they sell for $10 to $20 per kilogram (or 13 to 26 Australian dollars).After years of receiving welfare payments, last September, Mr. Salee, 30, finally found stable work, snagging one of two coveted positions at the grocery store on Murray after two longtime employees left. He is earning about $830 every two weeks (1,100 Australian dollars) and envisioning a promising future.\u201cI would like to make my own small business. I want to do more,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was still in Cairns, I would be in and out of jail.\u201dMr. Salee said the way the government ran the welfare system, which he had relied on in Cairns and on Murray Island, only fostered dependency. The program required him to search for at least eight jobs every two weeks, he said. But he said the government office that was supposed to facilitate the jobs would never follow up, instead sending him back out to search again and again.One Sunday, Mr. Salee and some friends shaved coconuts and cooked up a turtle stew. An elder had died, and it was tradition to have a big community feast in the days after the death.Back in Cairns, those gatherings usually would draw the ire of neighbors, who get upset at all the cars parked in the streets and call the police. In Murray, this is a tradition that people hold dearly. It is what helps stabilize people like Mr. Salee.\u201cIt\u2019s their own place, it\u2019s their own land,\u201d said Jessie Ghee, Mr. Salee\u2019s mother, who still lives in Cairns. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be afraid of anything they do here. His life changed since he\u2019s been here on Murray.\u201dThe poster-size head shot in the lobby of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s headquarters in Sydney features a woman with long, dark hair, rosy cheeks and a wide smile.This is the Nakkiah Lui most Australians know: a star.She has written for the screen and the stage; is an actress whose starring roles have included an Aboriginal sketch comedy, \u201cBlack Comedy\u201d; and is an activist who gamely spars with conservative commentators.But Ms. Lui said that these accomplishments \u2014 and the pressure to serve as a model of Aboriginal success \u2014 weigh on her like an anvil.\u201cBeing a very public Aboriginal person and having my identity being so a part of my work, why that\u2019s so important is it comes down to equality,\u201d Ms. Lui told me. \u201cUntil we reach that equality, I think Aboriginality is always going to be a huge part of my identity and a huge part of Australian culture.\u201dHer public success belies her less-than-glamorous upbringing in Mount Druitt, a western Sydney suburb with a large indigenous community.Almost every man in her family has spent time in jail, Ms. Lui, 28, said. Her grandmother died by falling through a rotted-out wood floor in her public housing unit. And she said she wanted to quit school because of racist taunting, but had to stick it out because of her mother\u2019s insistence.Ms. Lui eventually got a scholarship to attend boarding school in Canada. It was the first time she started feeling proud of her heritage, she said. She wrote a one-woman show, \u201cProud,\u201d and was suddenly on a journey to success that eludes many indigenous Australians.It was not always smooth. About a decade ago, she got into an argument with a man she was dating at the time. He beat her bloody, she said, yet somehow she was the one who felt ashamed when the police showed up at her door.She was at once a burgeoning professional and a woman dealing with domestic violence and relatives\u2019 suicide, two of the scourges plaguing her community.\u201cI was at university, I was at law school,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just felt like: \u2018I am a failure for this. I have let my community down, that I have allowed myself to be a victim.\u2019\u201dBut she got strong support from her family. That, and immersing herself in storytelling, helped her to climb out of a rut, she said.Now Ms. Lui is boldly expressing her heritage and challenging racism through her art. Her new play, \u201cBlack Is the New White,\u201d which opened in Sydney in May, is about an affluent indigenous family dealing with urban life, young love and white supremacy.Ms. Lui also stars in and wrote a coming television series, \u201cKiki & Kitty,\u201d which is about an indigenous woman\u2019s vagina coming to life.When I joined her on the set of \u201cKiki & Kitty\u201d one day, she had a crew of about a dozen people catering to her needs. They brushed her hair and did her makeup. They slipped her into a red dress with white polka dots. And they adjusted the lights to make sure she looked just right for her close-up.\u201cI wanted to put black women in roles that they don\u2019t usually play,\u201d she said. She added that she wanted to show \u201cblack women who were living a modern life.\u201dIn other words, women just like her.ABC \u2014 Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Producer, Suzanne Smith; Photographer and Videographer, Greg Nelson.Ron Foley for the ABC and Brook Mitchell for The New York Times contributed additional video footage.

{"Headline": "On Campus, Failure Is on the Syllabus", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "A Smith College initiative called \u201cFailing Well\u201d is one of a crop of university programs that aim to help high achievers cope with basic setbacks.Supported byNORTHAMPTON, Mass. \u2014 Last year, during fall orientation at Smith College, and then again recently at final-exam time, students who wandered into the campus hub were faced with an unfamiliar situation: the worst failures of their peers projected onto a large screen.\u201cI failed my first college writing exam,\u201d one student revealed.\u201cI came out to my mom, and she asked, \u2018Is this until graduation?\u2019\u201d another said.The faculty, too, contributed stories of screwing up.\u201cI failed out of college,\u201d a popular English professor wrote. \u201cSophomore year. Flat-out, whole semester of F\u2019s on the transcript, bombed out, washed out, flunked out.\u201d\u201cI drafted a poem entitled \u2018Chocolate Caramels,\u2019 \u201d said a literature and American studies scholar, who noted that it \u201chas been rejected by 21 journals \u2026 so far.\u201dThis was not a hazing ritual, but part of a formalized program at the women\u2019s college in which participants more accustomed to high test scores and perhaps a varsity letter consent to having their worst setbacks put on wide display.\u201cIt was almost jarring,\u201d said Carrie Lee Lancaster, 20, a rising junior. \u201cOn our campus, everything can feel like such a competition, I think we get caught up in this idea of presenting an image of perfection. So to see these failures being talked about openly, for me I sort of felt like, \u2018O.K., this is O.K., everyone struggles.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to teach is that failure is not a bug of learning, it\u2019s the feature,\u201d said Rachel Simmons, a leadership development specialist in Smith\u2019s Wurtele Center for Work and Life and a kind of unofficial \u201cfailure czar\u201d on campus. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that should be locked out of the learning experience. For many of our students \u2014 those who have had to be almost perfect to get accepted into a school like Smith \u2014 failure can be an unfamiliar experience. So when it happens, it can be crippling.\u201dMs. Simmons would know. She hid her own failure (dropping out of a prestigious scholarship program in her early 20s; told by her college president that she had embarrassed her school) for close to a decade. \u201cFor years, I thought it would ruin me,\u201d she said.Which is why, when students enroll in her program, they receive a certificate of failure upon entry, a kind of permission slip to fail. It reads: \u201cYou are hereby authorized to screw up, bomb or fail at one or more relationships, hookups, friendships, texts, exams, extracurriculars or any other choices associated with college \u2026 and still be a totally worthy, utterly excellent human.\u201dA number of students proudly hang it from their dormitory walls.Nearly perfect on paper, with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s packed full of extracurricular activities, they seemed increasingly unable to cope with basic setbacks that come with college life: not getting a room assignment they wanted, getting wait-listed for a class or being rejected by clubs.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about flunking out of pre-med or getting kicked out of college,\u201d Ms. Simmons said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about students showing up in residential life offices distraught and inconsolable when they score less than an A-minus. Ending up in the counseling center after being rejected from a club. Students who are unable to ask for help when they need it, or so fearful of failing that they will avoid taking risks at all.\u201dAlmost a decade ago, faculty at Stanford and Harvard coined the term \u201cfailure deprived\u201d to describe what they were observing: the idea that, even as they were ever more outstanding on paper, students seemed unable to cope with simple struggles. \u201cMany of our students just seemed stuck,\u201d said Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford and the author of \u201cHow to Raise an Adult.\u201d\u201cThere is this kind of expectation on students at a lot of these schools to be succeeding on every level: academically, socially, romantically, in our family lives, in our friendships,\u201d said Emily Hoeven, a recent graduate who helped start the project in her junior year. \u201cAnd also sleep eight hours a night, look great, work out and post about it all on social media. We wanted to show that life is not that perfect.\u201d\u201cFor a long time, I think we assumed that this was the stuff that was automatically learned in childhood: that everyone struck out at the baseball diamond or lost the student council race,\u201d said Donna Lisker, Smith\u2019s dean of the college and vice president for student life. \u201cThe idea that an 18-year-old doesn\u2019t know how to fail on the one hand sounds preposterous. But I think in many ways we\u2019ve pulled kids away from those natural learning experiences.\u201dAnd so, universities are engaging in a kind of remedial education that involves talking, a lot, about what it means to fail.If it all feels a bit like a \u201cPortlandia\u201d sketch, that\u2019s because it actually was one: in which Fred and Carrie decide to hire a bully to teach grit to students, one who uses padded gym mats to make sure the children don\u2019t actually get hurt.\u201cLook, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything fundamentally wrong with trying to create experiences that are calming,\u201d said Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at Penn. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to spend a bit more time figuring out what\u2019s causing those stresses.\u201dResearchers say it\u2019s a complicated interplay of child-rearing and culture: years of helicopter-parenting and micromanaging by anxious parents. \u201cThis is the generation that everyone gets a trophy,\u201d said Rebecca Shaw, Smith\u2019s director of residence life. College admissions mania, in which many middle- and upper-class students must navigate what Ms. Simmons calls a \u201c\u2018Hunger Games\u2019-like mentality\u201d where the preparation starts early, the treadmill never stops and the stakes can feel impossibly high.It is fear about the economy \u2014 Is the American dream still a possibility? Will I be able to get a job after graduation? \u2014 and added pressure to succeed felt by first-generation and low-income students: of being the first in their families to go to college; of having to send money home; or simply overcoming the worry that, as one engineering student put it, \u201cmaybe I was a quota.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming from a low-income, predominantly African-American community where there just aren\u2019t resources,\u201d said Arabia Simeon, 19, a junior at Smith. \u201cSo there is this added pressure of needing to do well.\u201dAnd there\u2019s the adjustment, for many high-achieving students, of no longer being \u201cthe best and brightest\u201d on campus, said Amy Jordan, the associate dean for undergraduate studies in the school of communication at Penn. Or what Smithies call \u201cspecial snowflake syndrome.\u201d\u201cWe all came from high schools where we were all the exception to the rule \u2014 we were kind of special in some way, or people told us that,\u201d said Cai Sherley, 20, seated in the campus cafe. Around her, Zoleka Mosiah, Ms. Simeon and Ms. Lancaster nodded in agreement. \u201cSo you get here and of course you want to recreate that,\u201d Ms. Sherley said. \u201cBut here, everybody\u2019s special. So nobody is special.\u201dSocial media doesn\u2019t help, because while students may know logically that no one goes through college or, let\u2019s be honest, life without screw-ups, it can be pretty easy to convince yourself, by way of somebody else\u2019s feed, \u201cthat everyone but you is a star,\u201d said Jaycee Greeley, 19, a sophomore.It\u2019s what Ms. Simmons calls \u201ccompetitive stress\u201d: the subject of her afternoon workshop on the campus lawn, to which she was luring students with ice cream and bingo.When students arrived, the sundaes were there. But the bingo cards were a little different \u2014 filled with things like \u201cI have 20 pages to write tonight,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m too busy to eat\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so dead.\u201d It was called \u201cStress Olympics.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s basically a play on competitive suffering,\u201d said Casey Hecox, a 20-year-old junior. \u201cIt\u2019s when we\u2019re like, \u2018I have three tests tomorrow.\u2019 And then someone\u2019s like, \u2018I have five tests tomorrow, and all I\u2019ve eaten is 5-hour Energy, and my dog is sick.\u2019\u201dWith only a few weeks before school was to let out, the stress pinwheel over summer internships and jobs \u2014 applications, recommendations, networking \u2014 was already at a steady buzz. What if they didn\u2019t get one? Or the right one? \u201cI\u2019m not used to the whole \u2018summer job\u2019 concept, and I found the process quite intimidating,\u201d said Ms. Mosiah, 21, a sophomore. \u201cI had to ask for help from my friends and the on-campus resources to work through this. I\u2019m not used to asking for help or being rejected this often, so I was really taken aback.\u201dMs. Lancaster said, \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard not to take each and every rejection letter as a failure, but I\u2019m trying to stay positive.\u201dWhatever happens, there will be plenty of time to talk about it when students return to campus in the fall.An article last Sunday about colleges that offer courses in embracing failure misidentified the position that Amy Jordan holds at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the associate dean for undergraduate studies in the school of communication, not for the entire university.Advertisement"}

Maine may benefit from milder winters. Florida, by contrast, could face major losses, as deadly heat waves flare up in the summer and rising sea levels eat away at valuable coastal properties.In all, the researchers estimate that the nation could face damages worth 0.7 percent of gross domestic product per year by the 2080s for every 1 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperature. But that overall number obscures wide variations: The worst-hit counties \u2014 mainly in states that already have warm climates, like Arizona or Texas \u2014 could see losses worth 10 to 20 percent of G.D.P. or more if emissions continue to rise unchecked.\u201cThe reason for that is fairly well understood: A rise in temperatures is a lot more damaging if you\u2019re living in a place that\u2019s already hot,\u201d said Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and a lead author of the study.\u201cYou see a similar pattern internationally, where countries in the tropics are more heavily impacted by climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is the first study to show that same pattern of inequality in the United States.\u201dThe greatest economic impact would come from a projected increase in heat wave deaths as temperatures soared, which is why states like Alabama and Georgia would face higher risks while the cooler Northeast would not. If communities do not take preventative measures, the projected increase in heat-related deaths by the end of this century would be roughly equivalent to the number of Americans killed annually in auto accidents.Rising Temperatures May Exacerbate InequalityCounties grouped by income per person.MedianLikely rangePoorest 10% counties Richest 10%0%510152025Likely rangeMedianPoorest 10% counties Richest 10%0%510152025of county incomeThe authors avoided delving into politics, but they warned that \u201cclimate change tends to increase pre-existing inequality.\u201d Some of the poorest regions of the country could see the largest economic losses, particularly in the Southeast. That pattern would hold even if the world\u2019s nations cut emissions drastically, though the overall economic losses would be considerably lower.\u201cPast models had only looked at the United States as a single region,\u201d said Robert E. Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers and a lead author of the study. \u201cThey missed this entire story of how climate change would create this large transfer of wealth between states.\u201dThere are still limitations to the study. It relies heavily on research showing how hot weather has caused economic losses in the past. But society and technology will change a lot over the next 80 years, and people may find novel ways to adapt to steadily rising temperatures, said Robert S. Pindyck, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved with this study.Notably, the model also does not account for the effects of future migration within the United States. If Arizona becomes unbearable because of rising temperatures, more people may decide to move to states like Oregon or Montana, which would largely escape intolerable heat waves and could even see an increase in agricultural production. Such migration could reduce the country\u2019s overall economic losses, said Matthew E. Kahn, an economist at the University of Southern California.The researchers at the lab plan to expand their model to include more possible impacts and provide a detailed view of what individual counties can expect, so policymakers can begin to prepare  far in advance.\u201cThat\u2019s the hope, that this research can help prevent many of these outcomes,\u201d said Trevor Houser, a co-author of the paper who helps direct the Climate Impact Lab. \u201cIf cities take action to prevent heat wave deaths by building cooling centers, then costs would be lower than we project. But I wouldn\u2019t see that as a failure of prediction \u2014 that\u2019s a policy success.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Open Wound of Division", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Many Greeks were surprised when a mild-mannered former prime minister who tried to use unity and consensus to lead the country out of an economic and political impasse was seriously injured by a parcel bomb last month.What followed was even worse: The attack was not greeted with unanimous condemnation, suggesting that Greece has a long way to go to heal divisions that were exacerbated by the economic crisis, that have shaped politics and that obstruct efforts to get Greece on its feet.As Lucas Papademos, 69, lay in a hospital, members of a self-proclaimed anti-establishment movement threw pamphlets onto the hospital grounds proclaiming, \u201cDie, Papademos, so we can celebrate.\u201d (There were no arrests; there seldom are when members of the burgeoning anti-establishment scene attack police with gasoline bombs, stage sit-ins or vandalize property.) A senior official of the Athens journalists\u2019 union wrote on Facebook that he would not be \u201cat all upset\u201d if the current governor of the central bank, Yannis Stournaras, were also the target of a bomb. When a prosecutor reportedly started an inquiry into the comment, a government member, Deputy Health Minister Pavlos Polakis, asked sarcastically on his Facebook page, \u201cWhere are the sensitive defenders of free speech now?\u201dMr. Papademos, currently president of the Academy of Athens, a highly respected research foundation and briefly prime minister while head of a multiparty coalition from November 2011 to May 2012, would seem an unlikely target for Greece\u2019s domestic terrorists. Despite the intensity of Greek politics, no prime minister or former prime minister had been targeted this way since two failed attempts on Eleftherios Venizelos in 1920 and 1933, when the national schism between the liberal republican statesman and royalists dominated politics.In a sense, though, Mr. Papademos was an unsurprising target. Educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he served as governor of the Bank of Greece and vice president of the European Central Bank. He was an unelected technocrat who brought together three of Greece\u2019s fractious parties in order to reach agreement with international creditors and keep Greece in the euro at a time when the country\u2019s membership in the common currency was in jeopardy. He was called on when the socialist Pasok government, which had signed the first bailout in 2010, reached a dead end, and a respected personality was needed to head a coalition \u2014 someone who could do the job without being a threat to the party leaders\u2019 own aspirations.Mr. Papademos drew the enmity of populists and nationalists from the left and extreme right who were opposed to the bailout\u2019s demands for austerity and reforms, who saw it as a loss of Greece\u2019s sovereignty. He embodied the country\u2019s elite, leading a government of mainstream parties at a time when rage at elites was at a crescendo. Both the left and the extreme right claimed that his government was a \u201cjunta,\u201d a highly charged accusation in a country where the last military dictatorship ended in 1974. The unity expressed in such accusations and insults presaged the coalition that the radical-left Syriza and right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks would forge in January 2015 \u2014 and that is still in power. As prime minister, Mr. Papademos was a magnet also for internet trolls.In a commentary in the newspaper Kathimerini after the attack on Mr. Papademos, the political scientist Nikos Marantzidis described the \u201cnew populism\u201d of the bailout era as combining all the divisions \u201cthat anyone can imagine: patriots and traitors, the corrupt and incorruptible, ideologues and sellouts.\u201d He added: \u201cSuch a level of verbal violence has not been seen since the restoration of democracy. Never were such extreme things said in Parliament or from official lips as in this period,\u201d and continued: \u201cWhen you call someone a quisling, a sellout, a fascist, a traitor, why wonder when some hothead takes things further?\u201dOn the day that Greece\u2019s president gave him the mandate to form a government, Mr. Papademos made a point of saying that he was not a politician, implying that he would focus on helping Greece without seeking personal power. \u201cThe course ahead will not be easy. But the problems, I\u2019m convinced, will be solved,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be solved faster, with a smaller cost and in an efficient way, if there is unity, agreement and prudence.\u201dIt may sound modest, but to call for unity, agreement and prudence in the context of Greece\u2019s politics is to set the bar very high. And a few months later, one of the coalition members, the center-right New Democracy Party, pushed for national elections.At the start of the Papademos administration, three-quarters of Greeks supported it, polls showed. Fewer people blamed the political system for the country\u2019s troubles than when the first bailout was signed (17 percent in November 2011, down from 21 percent in May 2010). But by May 2012, this had shot up to 29 percent, and it was clear the coalition members could not keep their government together, even with a majority of 255 in the 300-seat Parliament. Anger, disappointment and fear had given way to hope, but hope had given way to disappointment.Mr. Papademos\u2019s government had reinforced the prejudices of populists on the left and right, who claimed that foreign interests were trampling over Greece\u2019s democracy; at the same time, it failed to break the pattern of fraternal squabbles that have plagued Greece\u2019s politics from the start of the modern Greek state. Inconclusive elections in May 2012 saw Syriza become a major force; new elections in June 2012 resulted in a new coalition, led by New Democracy; the January 2015 elections saw the Syriza-led coalition under Alexis Tsipras come to power.Mr. Tsipras was relentless in his attacks on previous governments, including Mr. Papademos\u2019s. Now, as he struggles to meet conditions demanded by Greece\u2019s partners in the European Union and by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for more loans, Mr. Tsipras finds himself isolated \u2014 both from those he undermined in the past and from erstwhile allies who accuse him of wanting only to stay in power. This makes it more difficult to agree to creditors\u2019 demands, which, in turn, imposes further uncertainty on the economy and society. Without \u201cunity, agreement and prudence,\u201d the country\u2019s wounds remain open.No group has claimed the May 25 attack on Mr. Papademos, who remains hospitalized, his injuries clearly not as light as initially reported.Nikos Konstandaras, the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Be Great, America Must Be Good", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Four and a half months is not long, but President Trump has accomplished an extraordinary amount in a short time. With shocking speed, he has wreaked havoc: hobbling our core alliances, jettisoning American values and abdicating United States leadership of the world. That\u2019s a whole lot of winning \u2014 for Russia and China.At NATO, the president\u2019s reckless refusal to reaffirm our commitment to the defense of our allies under Article 5, while hectoring them publicly about their military spending, made our allies conclude they must go it alone. Nothing could have thrilled President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia more, or done more damage to the strength and unity of the Western world. And now the president has pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, putting us at odds with virtually the entire world. Europe and China stand together on the Paris accord, while the United States is isolated.This last, disastrous decision is the coup de gr\u00e2ce for America\u2019s postwar global leadership for the foreseeable future. It was not taken from us by any adversary, nor lost as a result of economic crisis or collapse of empire. America voluntarily gave up that leadership \u2014 because we quit the field.How consequential is this choice? The network of alliances that distinguishes America from other powers and has kept our nation safe and strong for decades is now in jeopardy. We will see the cost when next we need the world to rally to our side.Contrary to the view of this White House, we do not live in a zero-sum world. We live in a world where our security and prosperity are maximized when others enjoy the same. Today\u2019s threats \u2014 terrorism, nuclear proliferation, disease, climate change, violent cartels \u2014 are not amenable to simple military solutions, nor can they be tackled by any one country acting alone. They require effective collective action, and thus, willing partners.It won\u2019t be long before a fresh crisis arises. In 2014, I saw President Barack Obama successfully coax our allies to help contain and eradicate the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. If there is a flu pandemic that requires a similar coordinated international response, will our European friends heed President Trump\u2019s call? Or if China takes aggressive action in the South China Sea, threatening our Asian allies as well as our own freedom of navigation, will our Western allies risk the economic repercussions of confronting China to stand beside an \u201cAmerica First\u201d president who refuses to affirm our NATO commitments?Our friends\u2019 profound disappointment with the United States is a measure of the damage already done to America\u2019s global standing by this administration. Most Americans surely still see the benefits of the United States being the strongest, most trusted and respected country in the world. So, we must take steps now to recover and regroup.Congress must insist, on a bipartisan basis, that the United States continue to play its traditional leadership role, by fully funding both defense and our foreign assistance programs. Congress should ensure the United States meets its obligations to the United Nations. It must also scrutinize foreign military sales to align our policies with our values.Congressional delegations, governors and mayors can reassure our key allies that the American people still value them and that we do not intend to cede our global leadership. We must make clear to our foreign partners that this present policy is an aberration, not the new normal.American corporations and civil society groups can assist by demonstrating that the United States remains committed to its integration into the global economy and to our democratic principles. In the absence of White House leadership, the American people should act as informal ambassadors, via contacts through tourism, study-abroad programs and cultural exchanges.We can all contribute to showing other nations that we hold dear America\u2019s place at the forefront of moral and political leadership in the world. And we must remain steadfast until, once again, we have a president willing to lead in accordance with American interests, traditions and values.Susan E. Rice was the national security adviser from 2013 to 2017 and the United States ambassador to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of Jeremy Corbyn and the Death Throes of Neoliberalism", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Money\u201cWe do not believe in untrammeled free markets. We reject the cult of selfish individualism. We abhor social division, injustice, unfairness and inequality.\u201dThis sounds like the manifesto of a hard-left political party, sternly aiming to cleanse society not only of a failed ideology (untrammeled free markets) but also of its cultural tenor (selfish individualism). Such critiques are now commonplace among insurgent left-wing movements in the United States and Europe, like the one that anointed Jeremy Corbyn leader of the British Labor Party and then increased the party\u2019s share of the popular vote. The above-quoted rejection of free-market capitalism, however, appeared last month in the manifesto of Britain\u2019s Conservative Party as it called an election designed to expand its parliamentary majority. It is the clearest evidence in plain prose, after the shocks of Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s victory, of a world in interregnum: Mass disaffection has ended an era and inaugurated a turbulent new phase.In this new reality, the rhetoric of the conservative right echoes that of the socialistic left as it tries to acknowledge the politically explosive problem of inequality. The leaders of Britain and the United States, two countries that practically invented global capitalism, flirt with rejecting the free-trade zones (the European Union, Nafta) they helped build. One sign of the general confusion is the desperate improvisation by politicians on the right as they try to respond to angry voters \u2014 often at the risk of failure, as Theresa May\u2019s election campaign proved this month. May opposed Brexit before the referendum last year and then became its hard-line advocate within the Conservative Party. She began to echo Trump\u2019s denunciation of cosmopolitan elites, announcing that \u201cif you believe you\u2019re a citizen of the world, you\u2019re a citizen of nowhere.\u201dBut in their appeals to the working classes, Trump and May also sound a lot like Bernie Sanders and Corbyn. Britain\u2019s Conservative Party mimicked its Labor rival by arguing for more transparency on executive pay and a higher minimum wage. The Tories, traditionally representatives of big business and the landed aristocracy, weirdly resembled the fiery trade unionists of the past in their demand that workers be represented on corporate boards.In trying to build an \u201ceconomy that works for everyone\u201d \u2014 a phrase that May lifted from Corbyn \u2014 politicians of all stripes seem to be hurriedly abandoning the experiment in neoliberal economics that, beginning in the 1980s, disempowered government, enriched a minority and made many more feel left behind. You need recall only a few resonant declarations from the 1980s to appreciate the extraordinary counterrevolution underway in Anglo-America. \u201cSociety? There is no such thing,\u201d the Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher proclaimed. \u201cThere are individual men and women, and there are families.\u201d Thatcher wanted to \u201croll back the frontiers of the state.\u201d From across the Atlantic, her ideological kin Ronald Reagan shared the sentiment: \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201dIn Britain, Conservatives today claim that \u201cgovernment can and should be a force for good\u201d and refuse to rule out tax increases for high earners. But back in the 1980s, they promoted a vision in which a community of self-interested individuals was a force for good. Government\u2019s role in economic planning, social welfare and wealth redistribution was stigmatized as a foe of individual initiative and self-regulating markets. \u201cThe market is a more powerful and more reliable liberating force than government can ever be,\u201d Thatcher asserted. Reagan promised: \u201cYou know, there really is something magic about the marketplace when it\u2019s free to operate. As the song says, \u2018This could be the start of something big.\u2019\u2009\u201dAnd so it was: a social and intellectual as well as an economic and political revolution that transformed Britain and the United States. Thatcherism, which emerged as a series of improvised responses to Britain\u2019s economic crisis in the 1970s, mutated into a revolutionary ideology \u2014 one that gave as much priority to \u201cmarket forces\u201d as Marxism once gave to class struggle.Thatcher did not simply insist that markets were more effective economically than centralized planning. In her view, society itself could be reorganized around the laws of the market, with myriad self-interested individuals voluntarily competing with one another and producing optimal outcomes for all. Not since the heyday of social Darwinism in the 19th century, as the intellectual historian Daniel T. Rodgers wrote in \u201cAge of Fracture,\u201d had \u201cthe idea of the beneficent results of competition cut so broad a swath through public and academic discourses or been called upon to do and explain so much.\u201dIt is also true that a range of cultural figures, from Harold Pinter to Angela Carter, denounced Thatcherism as wicked. But the harsh, moralizing critiques missed the true scale of Thatcher\u2019s reconstruction of social as well as economic realms. With her promise of prosperity, she managed to convince a significant part of the British population that with cheap credit and privatized public services, they would become stakeholders in the system. These invitations to private pleasures were adorned with invocations of British identity. Under Thatcher, there was a nationalistic surge of feeling \u201cgreat again.\u201d In 1982, her determination to take back the Falkland Islands from their Argentine usurpers baffled Reagan. But the exploits of the Royal Navy perfectly consummated a British fantasy, nurtured today among Brexiteers, of regained imperial vigor.Thatcherism was further entrenched by Tony Blair\u2019s \u201cNew\u201d Labor Party (1997-2007) and David Cameron\u2019s Conservative \u201cmodernizers\u201d (2010-16). Blair sought, with some help from Bill Clinton\u2019s triangulations, to put a human face on selfish individualism. Government, he suggested, was not the problem \u2014 or not entirely. Its main task was to help individuals help themselves in the universal competition opened up by globalized markets. Individual wealth creation remained the goal: As Peter Mandelson, a theoretician of New Labor, put it, \u201cWe are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich.\u201d During the long reign of New Labor, inequality grew in Britain, and Thatcher-style deregulation and privatization proceeded, often by stealth through public-private partnerships. David Cameron, who proudly claimed to be Blair\u2019s \u201ctrue heir,\u201d mounted a radical assault on the welfare state that revealed how deeply Thatcherism shaped a whole generation of British politicians (and journalists).An influential part of the British media \u2014 from the respectable Economist to the jingoistic Daily Mail \u2014 presumed, along with the bipartisan Thatcherites, that \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d to market forces. May, however, confirmed that not only is there an alternative (an interventionist state) but also that the right is eager \u2014 in Britain as much as in the United States \u2014 to appropriate this increasingly popular remedy of the left. Her party\u2019s manifesto was almost communistic in its assertion that the government\u2019s \u201cpower should be put squarely at the service of this country\u2019s working people.\u201d May even co-opted the Labor Party\u2019s old promise, originally denounced as \u201cMarxist\u201d by the Conservative Party, to cap energy prices.Such ideological cross-pollination angered and baffled those still faithful to the memory of Reagan and Thatcher. The Economist denounced May\u2019s leftish program as \u201cperverse\u201d and \u201crisky.\u201d George Osborne, a former chancellor of the Exchequer in Cameron\u2019s government, accused May of following Jeremy Corbyn in a terrible \u201cretreat\u201d from globalization.May broke many ideological taboos in her eagerness to turn angry disaffection with Thatcher\u2019s long revolution into electoral gains. She still failed to persuade a clear majority of the British electorate of her credentials as a savior of the working people. The Conservative Party\u2019s savage cuts to spending on public services belied her redistributionist rhetoric \u2014 which seemed more authentic when it came from Corbyn, who has promised to renationalize the railways and abolish tuition fees. For many British people, especially the young, the unabashedly socialist Corbyn seems more committed to reimposing the tax and regulatory regimes that force the rich to rediscover their social obligations.Confronted with the nearly impossible tasks of Brexit and a struggling economy, May and her successors are doomed to failure with their impersonation of the left, let alone their rightist fantasy of restored greatness. As economic growth slows and inflation rises on the heels of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, the \u201chard\u201d Brexit that May advocated looks even more like an imperial fantasy of self-sufficiency. It is most likely to be abandoned. In any case, the interventionist British state that could presumably heal the open wounds of inequality no longer exists. It has been hollowed out by decades of outsourcing and marketization. The Conservatives may cling to power by forming an alliance with an ultraright Northern Irish party. But increasingly forced to own their economic failures, they will struggle to rebrand themselves as partisans of an economy that \u201cworks for everyone.\u201dA new economic consensus is quickly replacing the neoliberal one to which Blair and Clinton, as well as Thatcher and Reagan, subscribed; politicians are scrambling to articulate it, often blatantly breaking with their own history. Certainly, May\u2019s frantic left-wing posturing against inequality and social division confirmed that the Anglo-American revolution of the 1980s \u2014 built around a strong prejudice against government and for free markets \u2014 is over. At least in Britain. May, the conservative daughter of a country vicar, will probably be best remembered for advancing, inadvertently, a counterrevolution of the left.Pankaj Mishra is the author, most recently, of \u201cAge of Anger: A History of the Present.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Innovation, Colleges Fill the Skills Gap", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClosing the gapThe Manpower Group, a human resources consulting firm, says the gap, which is often defined as the difference in job skills required and the actual skills possessed by employees, is a chasm. Of the more than 42,000 employers the firm surveyed last year, 40 percent said they were having difficulties filling roles, the highest level since 2007.While some experts say that businesses bemoaning the quality of talent emerging from colleges is a perennial complaint, no one argues the importance of developing programs to meet the needs of employers in a fast-changing workplace.\u201cThe economy and employers have changed,\u201d said Louis Soares, vice president of the American Council on Education. \u201cThey want you to come in with a hot skill set, ready to go. Colleges are paying attention at different levels to what that means and trying to develop programs.\u201dSome are doing that better than others. \u201cSome institutions are very good,\u201d said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey have their ear to the ground, they\u2019re listening to local employers and paying attention to what they need.\u201dThose needs may best be met by innovative and often collaborative programs, some of which, like the following, are upending traditional approaches and views on higher education.Creating 15- or 18-credit minors may be one of the more effective strategies for preparing students to enter high-demand fields. Because a minor requires fewer credits than a major and few, if any, prerequisites, these allow colleges to be more flexible and responsive to changing industries and emerging technologies.Case Western\u2019s minor in applied data science, for example, funnels students into this hot field from other disciplines. The students learn skills like data management, distributed computing, informatics and statistical analytics.The Case minor has attracted students from majors like arts and sciences, engineering, business and health care. Graduates enter the market with an important and salable credential. A 2016 poll conducted by Gallup for the Business-Higher Education Forum found that 69 percent of employers expected that by 2021, candidates with data science skills would get preference for jobs in their organizations.\u201cHow would you like to take a 12-week, 90-hour training program and be hired practically the minute after you\u2019ve been handed your certificate?\u201d That\u2019s the alluring promise from Farmingdale State College in New York for its new natural-gas technician certificate program, which is a partnership with National Grid, an energy provider.The claim, made on an online blog, is not just hype. \u201cIt\u2019s basically true,\u201d said Professor Marjaneh Issapour, who heads the program. \u201cEvery one of our first 12 graduates got a job with National Grid.\u201dAs the program grows, that may not be the case. But others could be interested in establishing such a talent pipeline, given the projected shortages in this and related technical fields.In a 2016 study of member organizations by the Associated Equipment Distributors, a trade association representing more than 800 equipment, distributors, manufacturers and industry-service companies, 50 percent reported that the inability to find qualified technicians hinders business growth and increases costs. More than 60 percent said that the skills gap made it difficult to meet customer demand.The Farmingdale certificate program, which began last summer, already has over 130 applicants. \u201cIt shows there\u2019s a need for these kinds of programs,\u201d Professor Issapour said. And while the college hopes some of the students return for associate\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s degrees, it realizes not all will. \u201cNot everyone is going to want to get a college degree,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd honestly, not everyone should.\u201dA collaboration with a major university and a nonprofit organization that identifies high-potential students who have shown interest but lack access and resources: That\u2019s the Caltech-Base 11 partnership, in which community college students from throughout California are mentored by Caltech graduate students through on-campus summer internships and semester-long programs.The emphasis is on STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) majors in general and aerospace engineering, a major employer in the state, in particular. It has worked.\u201cWe reviewed the students who have participated in both programs, and the vast majority have gone on to four-year colleges, and several of them have a full ride,\u201d said Beverley McKeon, the Caltech faculty director for the program.Others, she said, have gotten high-profile internships, including one with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Base 11, the nonprofit partner, offers two similar STEM career accelerator programs with the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Engineering and the University of California, Irvine.\u201cTightly knit student cohorts in clearly defined graduation paths with close connections to their industry-trained instructors has been a formula for success,\u201d said Michael Cartney, president of the Lake Area Technical Institute in Watertown, S.D., in testimony to the Senate Commerce Committee in March.In the announcement of the award in March, the organization cited the college\u2019s \u201coutstanding\u201d graduation rate, which is twice the national average compared with other community colleges, and its 99 percent job placement rate. The school\u2019s student-loan default rate is also about half the national average.A couple of key reasons: The college holds its 2,400 students accountable, as if they were in a job setting. And the college has close ties with local and regional industry (every major, for example, has an advisory board of industry professionals). Hence, they are able to develop programs that mirror the needs of employers.Mr. Cartney also takes a pragmatic view of education. \u201cWe view college as a pathway,\u201d he said, \u201cnot a destination.\u201dThe college\u2019s new degree in data analytics is one of the first in Florida. But what\u2019s particularly innovative is the way the training is offered. The program begins with a certificate in business intelligence, progresses to an associate in science in business intelligence and culminates in a bachelor of science in data analytics.The Labor Department defines this \u201cstackable\u201d approach as a sequence of credentials that can be accumulated to build up students\u2019 qualifications and help them move along a career path.\u201cThis provides flexibility for those students who might need to be in the work force while in school,\u201d said Karen Elzey, vice president of the Business-Higher Education Forum, which was a partner in starting the program.The demand for dental hygienists in the United States is expected to grow nearly 20 percent in the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We can look north for good ideas on how to train students for this field, while also addressing the health needs of lower-income communities.Each winter, dental hygiene students from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, head up to the remote Labrador village of Forteau (population: about 450). The clinic there does not have the funding for a dental hygienist.The students provide the majority of oral hygiene and education for the community. The students also see stark contrasts with what they would normally encounter in more-affluent communities (patients with tobacco staining, for example).The graduates of this internship are prepared for jobs in major Canadian population centers, although interestingly, the four Dalhousie dental hygiene students who went to Forteau this winter said they would prefer to practice in rural areas when they graduated.The very existence of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston is a reminder that the challenge of maintaining a skilled work force is nothing new. Upon his death in 1790, Franklin left Boston an endowment to fund apprenticeships for young men under 25.\u201cI believe good apprentices are likely to make good citizens,\u201d he wrote in his will.That endowment was the seed money for what eventually became the college named in his honor. The college, in the city\u2019s South End, offers two- and four-year degrees in high-demand fields like health information technology, computer technology and automotive technology (in the planning stages: a program in driverless-car technology).Peter Haubrich, 23, is in many ways a typical Franklin student. He graduated in May 2016 with a bachelor of science in health information technology. A first-generation college student, he was raised by his grandmother in the Roxbury section of Boston. Five months after graduation, Mr. Haubrich says he was hired by UnitedHealthcare to work in its I.T. division for a starting salary of $65,000 and a $3,000 signing bonus.Mr. Haubrich said he is aware of the relationship of the college to Benjamin Franklin. \u201cI knew his dough started the school,\u201d he said. \u201cSeems to me they\u2019re definitely carrying out his mission.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their nerves are attached to jumper cables.\u201cThat meant that relative to the Mukherjees,\u201d Basu writes, \u201cthe Chopras were becoming poor.\u201d There\u2019s nothing worse than being poor.Unlike \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d which merrily hopscotched among Singapore and Hong Kong and London, Basu\u2019s novel is set primarily in a velvet-upholstered enclave of New Delhi. It was probably inevitable. In the new Gilded Age, farces about rich people behaving badly will eventually take place in every boom economy, given that every well-off nation now has its own breakaway republic of the 1 percent. It\u2019s simply India\u2019s turn.Mr. Chopra inherited his money. But the Jhas, like so many people who blunder into freakish, spontaneous wealth, have no habits or folkways to rely on, and how they handle their unexpected windfall \u2014 dramatic tension alert! \u2014 differs significantly. Mrs. Jha longs for her old friends and her old way of life, still using a bucket of water to bathe and wearing non-designer saris.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to copy everything other people in Gurgaon do,\u201d she tells her husband.But that, of course, is precisely Mr. Jha\u2019s plan. He\u2019s so preoccupied keeping up with the neighbors that he nearly loses his mind. He orders a sofa from Japan specially inlaid with Swarovski crystals. (Perhaps this will come as a surprise, but it isn\u2019t very comfortable.) He goes from fretting about his 23-year-old son Rupak\u2019s job prospects to delighting in his failures, so that he can make an ostentatious show of supporting him. (\u201cRupak has no talent,\u201d he boasts to Mr. Chopra. No Tiger Dads in this crowd.) He briefly contemplates hiring an armed security guard for his new home, because it would imply that his house contained hidden bricks of gold.And Basu could have stood to be a little more outrageous \u2014 or a little more serious. Rupak is supposed to be the soul of the novel, the one who\u2019s genuinely foundering in ways that aren\u2019t designed for laughs. He\u2019s dating two women at once (one Indian, one American), and he\u2019s flunking his masters program in business administration at Ithaca College, wishing he could study film instead. He leads a life that\u2019s conflicted, caught betwixt and between \u2014 just like his parents.He should be sympathetic. And he partly is. But he\u2019s not developed well enough to sink his hooks into us; he often seems more like a delivery system for ideas than a human. The questions Basu wants to explore using Rupak and his parents are worth looking at \u2014 how do we adapt to new mores, new cultures, new homes? Is it possible to yank people up by their roots, repot them and expect them to thrive?\u201cStop blaming everything else \u2014 stop blaming your parents, stop blaming India, stop blaming America,\u201d Rupak\u2019s American girlfriend eventually rebukes him. \u201cFigure out who you are and just be that person.\u201dPart of me wants to say the same to Basu.

Jay Leno Still Cares About Tonight\u2019s Show", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Word With\u201cReal comics don\u2019t really fit in anywhere,\u201d he said, speaking from Los Angeles. \u201cYou\u2019re not really a blue-collar guy anymore. But you\u2019re not comfortable around rich people.\u201dMr. Leno spoke further about his life after late night and challenges of being a political joke-teller in a polarized environment. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.What is it like to have once hosted a late-night show five nights a week and then stepped away from it? People always think, you have a TV show, then it ends. The next night, you go, \u201cWhere\u2019s my table at Spago?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Leno, it\u2019s been given to Mr. Fallon.\u201d \u201cWhat? That\u2019s my table!\u201d It doesn\u2019t exist that way. The real trick is to make show business money but live in the real world. And then you tend to appreciate things a little bit more.So you didn\u2019t go through a withdrawal period after it ended?What I tell people in show business is, Don\u2019t fall in love with a hooker. That\u2019s what show business is. The greatest thing about \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d is that you could be around show business without being immersed in it. When Charlie Sheen would come on and tell a story about some hooker pushing him out of his Mercedes on Mulholland Drive, it was always hilarious, but I don\u2019t want to live that life. I did the show and I went home every night like it was a school night, to work on the monologues.Do you watch any of the current late-night shows? You don\u2019t experience a Larry Sanders-like feeling of self-loathing when you watch other people\u2019s shows? Not self-loathing, but I\u2019m a huge believer in low self-esteem. I\u2019m dyslexic, so my mother always said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to work twice as hard as the other kids to get the same thing.\u201d That was a plan that actually worked for me.How is it that there are so many more late-night shows now, but they\u2019re still largely hosted by white, male performers?I was talking to a younger comedian who said to me: \u201cYou and Seinfeld were lucky. You came up in the golden age of stand-up, when everybody could get in.\u201d No, there\u2019s no golden age. Every time is just as difficult as every other time. The difference is, now you can rocket to the middle. But you can\u2019t get past the middle. You just wind up playing to your audience. As opposed to trying to make your material work for any audience, people go, \u201cI only play to this kind of audience.\u201dYou don\u2019t think that there are institutional roadblocks for women or minority comedians? I would always meet people that go, \u201cYou can\u2019t get a job as a comic unless you\u2019re in the union, and you can\u2019t get in the union unless you\u2019re a comic.\u201d I\u2019d say to them: \u201cRight, then quit. It can\u2019t be done. Just leave, O.K.?\u201d Some of those things may be true until somebody comes along that breaks the mold. \u201cRoseanne,\u201d back in the \u201980s, was a groundbreaking show. If you had put Roseanne [Barr] onstage with five other women, which one is going to be the big star? I don\u2019t know whether you would have picked Roseanne. Samantha Bee has broken out in a sea of white guys and done quite well. I see more and more female stand-ups out there.You took pains on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d to joke equally about both political parties. Would that approach be possible now?It\u2019s a different time now. It\u2019s kind of ugly. On \u201cJay Leno\u2019s Garage,\u201d we did a thing where we had Colin Powell race Joe Biden in Corvettes. The two of them trash-talked each other and made fun of each other, and people just seemed so happy to see a Republican and a Democrat being nice to each other.Last year, before the election, I was playing in Lancaster, Pa. That\u2019s pretty much Trump territory. I would do a Trump joke, and then a Hillary [Clinton] joke. I deliberately did one and then the other. I did about a dozen of them. After the show, this lady says: \u201cI\u2019m a fan, but I have a bone to pick with you: I notice you didn\u2019t do any Hillary jokes. You only made fun of Donald Trump.\u201d What she would do is, every time I would tell a Trump joke, she would turn to her friend and go, \u201cUgh, can you believe what he said?\u201d She didn\u2019t even hear the other jokes. It was a classic case of just hearing what you want to hear.Do you think it\u2019s a more perilous time for comedians who joke about politics?When you\u2019ve had the kind of career you\u2019ve had, is it harder to make yourself relatable to a middle-class American audience?If I get any criticism at all \u2014 and I certainly get a lot \u2014 it\u2019s that, \u201cOh, you\u2019re not the angry comedian you once were.\u201d Of course, when you\u2019re 25 and broke, and you\u2019ve got an economy ticket and you got bumped, you\u2019re going to be angrier than if you\u2019re in your private plane. I was in Milwaukee, playing a casino, and I finished at 12:30. I take a car to my hotel in downtown Milwaukee, and I take the service elevator up to my room. The next morning, I go outside, go about five blocks to get a bite to eat, and I now realize, I don\u2019t even know the name of the hotel I\u2019m staying in. That\u2019s a first-world problem. It just made me laugh. How stupid is that?Do you worry about maintaining your TV legacy when your show doesn\u2019t live on in reruns?Luckily, you as a performer don\u2019t live on. You die, eventually. If you\u2019re worried about your legacy? Oh, shut up. Nobody cares. I was in Vegas and they were taking down an Elvis Presley exhibit at one of the hotels. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d They said, \u201cWe\u2019re taking this down, the kids don\u2019t really know who this is anymore.\u201d If you don\u2019t know who Elvis is, I don\u2019t think my legacy is something you have to worry about.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dutch Have Solutions to Rising Seas. The World Is Watching.", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands \u2014 The wind over the canal stirred up whitecaps and rattled cafe umbrellas. Rowers strained toward a finish line and spectators hugged the shore. Henk Ovink, hawkish, wiry, head shaved, watched from a V.I.P. deck, one eye on the boats, the other, as usual, on his phone.Mr. Ovink is the country\u2019s globe-trotting salesman in chief for Dutch expertise on rising water and climate change. Like cheese in France or cars in Germany, climate change is a business in the Netherlands. Month in, month out, delegations from as far away as Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New York and New Orleans make the rounds in the port city of Rotterdam. They often end up hiring Dutch firms, which dominate the global market in high-tech engineering and water management.That\u2019s because from the first moment settlers in this small nation started pumping water to clear land for farms and houses, water has been the central, existential fact of life in the Netherlands, a daily matter of survival and national identity. No place in Europe is under greater threat than this waterlogged country on the edge of the Continent. Much of the nation sits below sea level and is gradually sinking. Now climate change brings the prospect of rising tides and fiercer storms.Area of Rotterdam below sea level Eendragtspolder rowing course\u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u201310DELFTSchiebroekse parkSCHIEDAMCAPELLE AAN DEN IJSSELKralingsepark lakeResidentialIndustrialROTTERDAMErasmus University Rotterdam90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.ErasmusMedical CenterFeyenoordStadiumRotterdam AhoyConvention CenterPernisserparkRIDDERKERKRHOON BARENDRECHT1 mileArea of Rotterdam below sea level \u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u201310DELFTEendragtspolder rowing course1 mileSchiebroekse parkSCHIEDAMCAPELLE AAN DEN IJSSELKralingsepark lakeResidentialIndustrialROTTERDAMErasmus University Rotterdam90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.ErasmusMedical CenterFeyenoordStadiumRotterdam AhoyConvention CenterPernisserparkRIDDERKERKRHOON BARENDRECHTArea of Rotterdam below sea level \u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u201310EendragtspolderDELFTResidentialIndustrialCAPELLE AAN DEN IJSSELROTTERDAM90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.RIDDERKERKBARENDRECHTRHOON 1 mileArea of Rotterdam below sea level \u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u2013101 mileROTTERDAM90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.ResidentialIndustrialArea of Rotterdam below sea level Eendragtspolder rowing course\u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u201310DELFTSchiebroekse parkCAPELLE AAN DEN IJSSELSCHIEDAMKralingsepark lakeROTTERDAMResidentialIndustrialErasmus University RotterdamErasmusMedical Center90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.FeyenoordStadiumRotterdam AhoyConvention CenterPernisserparkRIDDERKERKRHOON BARENDRECHT1 mileArea of Rotterdam below sea level \u20135 meters \u20134\u20133\u20132\u2013101 mileROTTERDAM90 percent of the city of Rotterdam lies below sea level, leaving many residential areas vulnerable to a rising ocean.ResidentialIndustrialFrom a Dutch mind-set, climate change is not a hypothetical or a drag on the economy, but an opportunity. While the Trump administration withdraws from the Paris accord, the Dutch are pioneering a singular way forward.How climate change is challenging the world\u2019s urban centers.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.It is, in essence, to let water in, where possible, not hope to subdue Mother Nature: to live with the water, rather than struggle to defeat it. The Dutch devise lakes, garages, parks and plazas that are a boon to daily life but also double as enormous reservoirs for when the seas and rivers spill over. You may wish to pretend that rising seas are a hoax perpetrated by scientists and a gullible news media. Or you can build barriers galore. But in the end, neither will provide adequate defense, the Dutch say.And what holds true for managing climate change applies to the social fabric, too. Environmental and social resilience should go hand in hand, officials here believe, improving neighborhoods, spreading equity and taming water during catastrophes. Climate adaptation, if addressed head-on and properly, ought to yield a stronger, richer state.This is the message the Dutch have been taking out into the world. Dutch consultants advising the Bangladeshi authorities about emergency shelters and evacuation routes recently helped reduce the numbers of deaths suffered in recent floods to \u201chundreds instead of thousands,\u201d according to Mr. Ovink.\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can say we are marketing our expertise, but thousands of people die every year because of rising water, and the world is failing collectively to deal with the crisis, losing money and lives.\u201d He ticks off the latest findings: 2016 was the warmest year on record; global sea levels rose to new highs.He proudly shows off the new rowing course just outside Rotterdam, where the World Rowing Championships were staged last summer. The course forms part of an area called the Eendragtspolder, a 22-acre patchwork of reclaimed fields and canals \u2014 a prime example of a site built as a public amenity that collects floodwater in emergencies. It is near the lowest point in the Netherlands, about 20 feet below sea level. With its bike paths and water sports, the Eendragtspolder has become a popular retreat. Now it also serves as a reservoir for the Rotte River Basin when the nearby Rhine overflows, which, because of climate change, it\u2019s expected to do every decade.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.The project is among dozens in a nationwide program, years in the making, called Room for the River, which overturned centuries-old strategies of seizing territory from rivers and canals to build dams and dikes. The Netherlands effectively occupies the gutter of Europe, a lowlands bounded on one end by the North Sea, into which immense rivers like the Rhine and the Meuse flow from Germany, Belgium and France. Dutch thinking changed after floods forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate during the 1990s. The floods \u201cwere a wake-up call to give back to the rivers some of the room we had taken,\u201d as Harold van Waveren, a senior government adviser, recently explained.\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep building higher levees, because we will end up living behind 10-meter walls,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to give the rivers more places to flow. Protection against climate change is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain, and the chain in our case includes not just the big gates and dams at the sea but a whole philosophy of spatial planning, crisis management, children\u2019s education, online apps and public spaces.\u201dMr. van Waveren was talking about a national GPS-guided app created so that residents always know exactly how far below sea level they are. To use public pools unrestricted, Dutch children must first earn diplomas that require swimming in their clothes and shoes. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic part of our culture, like riding a bike,\u201d Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch architect, told me.In the Netherlands, scholarly articles about changes to the Arctic ice cap make front-page headlines. Long before climate change deniers began to campaign against science in the United States, Dutch engineers were preparing for apocalyptic, once-every-10,000-years storms. \u201cFor us, climate change is beyond ideology,\u201d said Rotterdam\u2019s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb. He took me one morning around new waterfront development in a formerly poor, industrial neighborhood, to show how urban renewal dovetails with strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change.\u201cIf there is a shooting in a bar, I am asked a million questions,\u201d Mr. Aboutaleb said of his city. \u201cBut if I say everyone should own a boat because we predict a tremendous increase in the intensity of rain, nobody questions the politics. Rotterdam lies in the most vulnerable part of the Netherlands, both economically and geographically. If the water comes in, from the rivers or the sea, we can evacuate maybe 15 out of 100 people. So evacuation isn\u2019t an option. We can escape only into high buildings. We have no choice. We must learn to live with water.\u201dA Moroccan-born Muslim and a rising star in the Dutch political world who denounces religious radicals and reactionary nationalists alike, the mayor runs a traditionally tough, working-class city. Rotterdam today is anything but a paradise. It is riven by social fissures and discord over immigration. But it has begun to improve in recent years as it has become greener and more diverse. When asked about climate threats, the mayor talks about creating a less divided, more attractive, healthier city \u2014 more capable of facing the stresses climate change imposes on society.\u201cThat\u2019s just common sense,\u201d Mr. Aboutaleb said. The Eendragtspolder is one example, he pointed out, repaying Rotterdam\u2019s investment with green spaces and the rowing course, which has the added perk of aiding a prospective Dutch bid for the 2028 Olympics.Leveled by bombs during World War II, Rotterdam is not quaint and touristic like Amsterdam but industrial, down to earth, a surprisingly stylish sleeper among Europe\u2019s cultural hubs, with a legacy of radical architecture, attracting young designers and entrepreneurs. Its tradition of openness has made it a magnet for outsiders and helped it recover from years of hardship, when, during the 1970s, \u201980s and \u201990s, it became notoriously crime-ridden and filthy, a place wealthy people fled.Lately the city, accustomed to starting over, has reinvented itself as a capital of enterprise and environmental ingenuity. It has pioneered the construction of facilities like those parking garages that become emergency reservoirs, ensuring that the city can prevent sewage overflow from storms now predicted to happen every five or 10 years. It has installed plazas with fountains, gardens and basketball courts in underserved neighborhoods that can act as retention ponds. It has reimagined its harbors and stretches of its formerly industrial waterfront as incubators for new businesses, schools, housing and parks.These are all stops on the standard tour for visiting foreign delegations: proof-of-concept urban interventions, if not actually all-encompassing solutions, that address climate threats in ways that incrementally serve the economy and social needs.\u201cA smart city has to have a comprehensive, holistic vision beyond levees and gates,\u201d as Arnoud Molenaar, the city\u2019s climate chief, put it. \u201cThe challenge of climate adaptation is to include safety, sewers, housing, roads, emergency services. You need public awareness. You also need cyber-resilience, because the next challenge in climate safety is cybersafety. You can\u2019t have vulnerable systems that control your sea gates and bridges and sewers. And you need good policies, big and small.\u201cThis starts with little things, like getting people to remove the concrete pavement from their gardens so the soil underneath absorbs rainwater,\u201d Mr. Molenaar said. \u201cIt ends with the giant storm surge barrier at the North Sea.\u201dThat would be the Maeslantkering, built near the mouth of the sea, about a half-hour drive west from downtown Rotterdam \u2014 the city\u2019s first line of defense. It is the size of two tubular Eiffel Towers, toppled over.In the 20 years since it opened, the Maeslantkering hasn\u2019t actually been needed to prevent a flood, but it is tested regularly just in case. Picnickers line the shore to watch. The trial closings are a little like the Dutch version of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade.I drove with Mr. van Waveren to see it one day. It is not uncommon here to witness the astonishing sight of ships cruising by overhead. This happens in a country where the highways are frequently below sea level.The Maeslantkering is a consequence of repeated historic calamities. In 1916, the North Sea overwhelmed the Dutch coastline, inaugurating a spate of protective construction that failed to hold back the water in 1953 when an overnight storm killed more than 1,800 people. The Dutch still call it the Disaster. They redoubled national efforts, inaugurating the Delta Works project that dammed two major waterways and produced the Maeslantkering \u2014 the giant sea gate, completed in 1997, keeping open the immense waterway that services the entire port of Rotterdam.Protecting the port is paramount. Once the world\u2019s busiest, Rotterdam\u2019s port remains the most important in Europe, each year serving tens of thousands of ships from around the world, supplying steel to Germany, petrochemicals to South America and pretty much everything else to everywhere. The port is still the bedrock industry in this city of more than 600,000, according to port officials, accounting for 90,000 jobs, not to mention another 90,000 workers whose businesses depend on the port, too.The port supports five oil refineries, whose owners include Shell and the Koch brothers, along with a massive coal-fire power plant. Officials say the port accounts for 17 percent of the entire nation\u2019s carbon footprint. A central paradox \u2014 and to skeptics, the ultimate hypocrisy \u2014 of this city\u2019s environmental self-branding is that, at heart, Rotterdam\u2019s economy continues to rely on the fossil fuel industry.In any case, the safe transport of all those raw materials, not to mention the responsibility of keeping the feet of people in the city dry, now and in the future, depends on the Maeslantkering.The idea behind it, first discussed decades ago, was unprecedented \u2014 a monumental gate with two arms, resting on either side of the canal, each arm as tall and twice as heavy as the Eiffel Tower. It was a staggering work of engineering. Wim Quist, the architect, devised an object of surpassing beauty, one of modern Europe\u2019s lesser-known marvels.1,000 feet7003000Eiffel TowerOne arm of the MaeslantkeringROTTERDAMThe steel ball joints for each arm are about 30 feet in diameter and weigh 1.5 million pounds. 525 feetThe storm surge barriers are about 70 feet tall.ATLANTIC OCEAN1,000 feet7003000ROTTERDAMEiffel TowerOne arm of the MaeslantkeringThe steel ball joints for each arm are about 30 feet in diameter and weigh 1.5 million pounds. 525 feetThe storm surge barriers are about 70 feet tall.ATLANTIC OCEANThe steel ball joints for each arm are about 30 feet in diameter and weigh 1.5 million pounds.

When the gate is closed, the arms float out onto the canal, meet and lock, the tubes filling with water and sinking onto a concrete bed, making an impenetrable steel wall against the North Sea. The process takes two and a half hours. Pressure from the sea is then transferred from the wall to the largest ball joints in the world, embedded in the banks on either side of the river.Computers, using a closed electronic system to avoid cyberattack, monitor sea levels hourly and can shut the gate automatically \u2014 or open it. This is critical: Thirty pumps inside the gate are linked to one of the country\u2019s power grids. They extract water from the tubes when it is time for the Maeslantkering to be reopened.If the grid fails, there is a backup grid and, as a last resort, a generator, because even more dangerous than the gate\u2019s not closing is the gate\u2019s not reopening. In that case, water pouring down from the Rhine and Meuse rivers could not flow into the sea and would overwhelm Rotterdam even more swiftly than the North Sea could. As Mr. Aboutaleb noted, escape would be impossible.Mr. Ovink said only half-jokingly, \u201cthe last resort would be to blow it up.\u201d The Maeslantkering was clearly built with Hollywood disaster-movie scenarios in mind: There are redundancies to redundancies, and the barrier is prepared for the most extreme climate change models, with sea levels rising beyond current forecasts.Even so, Rotterdam port officials have plans underway to add another two feet to the height of the gate.Beyond the Maeslantkering, back in town, there are countless fortifications, big and small, knitted into streets and squares. One sunny afternoon, I met Wynand Dassen, manager of Rotterdam\u2019s resilience team, and Paul van Roosmalen, who oversees rooftop development for the city, at the Dakpark, a dike in a poor, largely immigrant neighborhood bordering industrial waterfront. The site of the Dakpark used to be a railway switching station, a grim nowhere place abutting a cluster of social housing blocks. This was a red-light district, notorious for drug dealers and crime.The dike does a lot more than just hold back water. It has a shopping center, which the neighborhood needed, and a park on the roof. Shops face the waterfront and help pay to keep up the park. The park slopes from the roof down to streets and housing blocks, creating a grassy hill that links park and neighborhood.When the weather is good, sunbathers sprawl on the grassy roof and toss Frisbees. Formal gardens open onto acres of well-kept lawns. The park is a kilometer long. And wonderful. Its success \u2014 not only as a barrier but also as a boon to business and the area \u2014 has persuaded officials to consult neighborhoods and set aside money for community-initiated projects. \u201cWe became invested in getting more people involved in all kinds of civic issues,\u201d Mr. Dassen told me, \u201cand water inevitably becomes an integral part of this process. We believe you get the smartest solutions when communities are engaged and help make the links between water and neighborhood development.\u201dMr. van Roosmalen agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of what you can do if you connect storm-water management with social welfare and neighborhood improvements,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we mean here in Rotterdam by \u2018resilience planning.\u2019\u201dIn a neighborhood nearby, where drug addicts used to trek all the way from France to buy cheap heroin, I came across Marleen ten Vergert, a single parent supporting a young daughter on a civil servant\u2019s modest salary. Women in hijabs lugged groceries, old men lounged on park benches and children rode skateboards over broken concrete paths, past aged housing blocks. One block of houses surrounded a water plaza created to capture floodwater. Young families were enticed by prices of a single euro to buy abandoned houses around it. Many families came and went. The water park was vandalized. But, slowly, little by little, it has come to be embraced by the neighborhood.\u201cNow, for the most part, it works,\u201d Ms. Vergert told me. \u201cPeople want the water square, so they take better care of it. There\u2019s a greenhouse nearby run by a Turkish community. The value of houses in the neighborhood has gone up.\u201dA few blocks away, a start-up in a converted industrial waterfront building is developing solar-powered sailing drones for collecting plastic trash from the sea, and, back in the middle of the city, a warehouse with a Brooklynesque mix of artisanal food stalls, a circus academy and a pinball museum has rejuvenated a formerly dingy pier. Where the old Hotel New York, a century-old landmark, used to be the tallest building along a stretch of waterfront, skyscrapers have sprung up, producing a whole new business district in Rotterdam, with a photography museum across the street from the city\u2019s signature office tower, De Rotterdam, by Mr. Koolhaas, and Ben van Berkel\u2019s harplike Erasmus Bridge.Rotterdam is clearly trying to cast itself as a model of inventive urbanism. A local businessman, Peter van Wingerden, envisions floating dairy farms along the waterfront. One in every three trucks coming into the city carries food, he said. Floating farms would reduce truck traffic and carbon emissions, supplying the city with its own milk. With the city\u2019s encouragement, he is constructing a $2.2 million prototype, for 40 cows, producing a half-million liters (about 130,000 gallons) of milk a year. \u201cThe river is no longer just for industry,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe need to find new uses, which keep us safe from climate change, and help the city grow and prosper.\u201dThat\u2019s the city\u2019s mantra. When I asked Mr. van Wingerden if it was unsettling to live in a waterfront city mostly below sea level, he said: \u201cIt seems to us less dangerous than living on the San Andreas Fault. At least when we flood, we\u2019ll have some warning before our feet get wet.\u201dTo the Dutch, what\u2019s truly incomprehensible, he added, is New York after Hurricane Sandy, where too little has been done to prepare for the next disaster. People in the Netherlands believe that the places with the most people and the most to lose economically should get the most protection.The idea that a global economic hub like Lower Manhattan flooded during Hurricane Sandy, costing the public billions of dollars, yet still has so few protections, leaves climate experts here dumbfounded.Mr. Molenaar, Rotterdam\u2019s climate chief, summed up the Dutch view: \u201cWe have been able to put climate change adaptation high on the public agenda without suffering a disaster in many years because we have shown the benefits of improving public space \u2014 the added economic value of investing in resilience.\u201cIt\u2019s in our genes,\u201d he said. \u201cWater managers were the first rulers of the land. Designing the city to deal with water was the first task of survival here and it remains our defining job. It\u2019s a process, a movement.\u201cIt is not just a bunch of dikes and dams, but a way of life.\u201dGraphics by Jugal Patel. Design by Rumsey Taylor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moving to Scuttle Obama Legacy, Donald Trump to Crack Down on Cuba", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Friday will move to halt the historic rapprochement between the United States and Cuba set in motion by former President Barack Obama, delivering a speech in Miami in which he plans to announce he is clamping down on travel and commercial ties with the island nation to force the government of Ra\u00fal Castro to change its repressive ways.Mr. Trump is expected to declare that the two-year-old Obama-era approach of engagement has amounted to a failed policy of appeasement. To that end, he plans to outline stiffer rules for American travelers visiting Cuba and a sweeping prohibition against transactions with companies controlled by the military, which runs vast segments of the hotel and tourism sector, according to White House officials.The changes are likely to affect both countries, making it more difficult and costly for Americans to travel to and do business with Cuba. The island\u2019s population potentially may pay the steeper price, particularly Cubans who derive their livelihoods from tourism and increased business opportunities stemming from the opening.The expected changes will also place a distinct chill on the relationship between the United States and Cuba that was just beginning to thaw after a half-century of isolation and estrangement and thrust the two countries back into an adversarial posture that is among the last vestiges of the Cold War.In making the shift, Mr. Trump is delivering on a politically potent promise he made to the Cuban-American exile community based in Miami, which backed him in last year\u2019s election and was deeply opposed to the d\u00e9tente. The new policy was shaped in large part by Cuban-American Republicans in Congress, including Senator Marco Rubio and Mario Diaz-Balart, both of Florida, and both of whom wanted even stiffer American sanctions on the Castro government.But many business leaders and human rights groups are profoundly opposed to the change. Even members of Mr. Trump\u2019s own administration have privately argued that the move toward normalizing relations between Washington and Havana had yielded national security, diplomatic and economic benefits for the United States that should not be sacrificed.The internal conflict is evident in the new approach, which will be enshrined in a policy directive that Mr. Trump plans to issue on Friday, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid pre-empting the president.Although Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that Mr. Obama made a \u201cbad deal\u201d with Cuba, his shift falls well short of the wholesale reversal that many hard-liners, including Mr. Diaz-Balart, were seeking.Embassies in Washington and Havana that reopened in 2015 for the first time in a half-century will remain open. The Trump administration is not moving to unwind other regulations that have carved out exceptions to the trade embargo, including those allowing direct financing of certain exports and allowing American dollars to be used in transactions with Cuba, the officials said.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s expected changes are substantial.Now, such trips, sometimes known as \u201cpeople-to-people\u201d exchanges, will only be possible as part of a licensed tour group, as was the case before last year. And the Treasury Department, which will be tasked with drafting the new rules, will be directed to strictly enforce the law regarding travel to Cuba, including with routine audits.Mr. Trump is also directing a broad prohibition against Americans doing business with companies controlled by the military, intelligence or security services in Cuba, which control large swaths of the economy, including many foreign-owned hotels, through the military\u2019s business arm known as Grupo de Administraci\u00f3n Empresarial S.A., or Gaesa. However, White House officials said there would be exceptions, including for airports and seaports, meaning that the operation of cruise ships and commercial flights would not be affected.The current policy, officials argued, enriched the Cuban military and empowered a government that has engaged in human rights abuses. Mr. Trump\u2019s directive will call for the State Department to issue a list of blacklisted companies to comply with the prohibition.The Trump administration will lay out conditions that the Cuban government would have to meet before the restrictions could be lifted, including holding free and fair elections, releasing political prisoners and allowing Cuban workers to be paid directly, one White House official said.The impending changes drew sharp criticism from architects of the Obama-era policy.Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security to Mr. Obama who helped broker the opening first announced in 2014, called the clampdown a politically motivated move that would ultimately be self-defeating. He said it would revive an adversarial dynamic between the United States and Cuba that would harm citizens of both countries while allowing the Castro government to once again cast Americans as the root of all its people\u2019s ills.\u201cFor nothing more than a partial rollback, Trump has made us the bad guy again,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said on Thursday. \u201cThey are not going as far as the real hard line, but they are going far enough to cause damage.\u201dBusiness organizations that have been pushing Congress to lift the embargo, to foster potentially lucrative commercial relationships and closer personal and cultural ties between the United States and Cuba, also voiced opposition.\u201cThe idea that after 55 years of failure, going back to isolationist policies will produce any results is insane,\u201d said James Williams, the president of Engage Cuba, a pro-engagement group.Mr. Trump plans to cast his decision on Cuba as a matter of human rights, arguing that the changes will ensure that the United States is not rewarding a government that deprives its citizens of basic rights.\u201cThis is going to have a dampening effect, but so be it,\u201d said Jorge Mas, the president of the Cuban American National Foundation, a Cuban exile group. \u201cThe Cuban government\u2019s behavior has to change, and they will now understand the cost of not changing behavior.\u201dHuman rights groups had implored the administration not to roll back the engagement policy, arguing that while the Castro government\u2019s record continued to be poor, cutting nascent ties with Cuba would only hurt its citizens.\u201cThe Cuban government was able to use the old policy as an excuse for all the problems on the island and as a pretext for repression,\u201d Daniel Wilkinson, the managing director of the Americas division at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s true the repressive system in Cuba has not changed, but the fact that two years of a different policy didn\u2019t change things isn\u2019t a reason to go back to one that was a clear failure for decades.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where the Senate Health Care Bill Fails", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSpeaking at a rally for his wife\u2019s presidential campaign last year, Bill Clinton called Obamacare \u201cthe craziest thing in the world.\u201d As he put it, \u201cThe people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\u201dMr. Clinton was right, and it\u2019s why Republicans have been pushing to repair the damage done by Obamacare for so long. Our priority should be to bring relief, and better, less expensive care, to millions of working men and women.Unfortunately, the Senate Republican alternative, unveiled last week, doesn\u2019t appear to come close to addressing their plight. Like Obamacare, it relies too heavily on government spending, and ignores the role that the private sector can and should play.As an accountant with more than 30 years\u2019 experience in manufacturing, I assure you the private sector is much more effective at solving problems. Concepts like the \u201cKISS\u201d principle (\u201ckeep it simple, stupid\u201d), pursuing continuous improvement and root-cause analysis are core ideas in private-sector problem-solving. From what I\u2019ve seen in six years in office, these concepts are foreign to government.The decades-long health care debate is an example. Layer upon layer of laws, rules and regulations have made our health care-financing system a complex mess, separating patients from direct payment for health care.As a result, patients neither know nor care what things cost. We have virtually eliminated the power of consumer-driven, free-market discipline from one-sixth of our economy.The primary goals of any health care reform should be to restrain (if not lower) costs while improving quality, access and innovation. This is exactly what consumer-driven, free-market competition does in other areas of our economy. Look no further than how laser eye surgery went from exotic to affordable during the years it was not covered by most insurance.Washington believes that the solution to every problem is more money. But throwing more money at insurers won\u2019t fix the lack of consumer-driven competition, combined with government mandates that artificially drive up the cost of care and insurance.Obamacare imposes enormous taxes and plans to spend nearly $2 trillion over the next 10 years to decrease the number of uninsured, mostly through Medicaid but also through taxpayer-subsidized exchanges. In doing so, Obamacare has largely destroyed an already struggling individual health insurance marketplace. It does this by mandating high-cost provisions as standard for every insurance policy, then forcing a small percentage of the population to shoulder the cost. These are the people Mr. Clinton was talking about.Prior to Obamacare, the individual market was already challenged by unequal tax treatment, which forced the forgotten to pay for insurance with after-tax dollars. The simple solution would have been to equalize the tax treatment, but President Obama chose to spend trillions and artificially increase premiums unaffordably. The result: Too many of those individuals who are \u201cbusting it\u201d and who responsibly carried insurance can no longer afford it, have dropped coverage, are paying a penalty and are taking a huge risk.Once again, a simple solution is obvious. Loosen up regulations and mandates, so that Americans can choose to purchase insurance that suits their needs and that they can afford.Like many other senators, I had hoped that this was where things were headed during the last several weeks as the Republican bill was discussed. We\u2019re disappointed that the discussion draft turns its back on this simple solution, and goes with something far too familiar: throwing money at the problem.The bill\u2019s defenders will say it repeals Obamacare\u2019s taxes and reduces Medicaid spending growth. That\u2019s true. But it also boosts spending on subsidies, and it leaves in place the pre-existing-condition rules that drive up the cost of insurance for everyone.Instead, we should return more flexibility to states, to give individuals the freedom and choice to buy plans they want without Obamacare\u2019s \u201creforms.\u201d And we should look to improve successful models for protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, models underway prior to Obamacare, such as those in Maine and Wisconsin.Only then can the market begin to rein in the underlying cost of health care itself and reduce the cost of taxpayer subsidies.We are $20 trillion in debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years. A truly moral and compassionate society does not impoverish future generations to bestow benefits in the here and now.Republican leaders have told us the plan unveiled last week is a draft, open to discussion and improvement. I look forward to working with Senate leadership and the president to improve the bill so it addresses the plight of the forgotten men and women by returning freedom and choice to health care.Ron Johnson is a Republican senator from Wisconsin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill to Erase Some Dodd-Frank Banking Rules Passes in House", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House approved legislation on Thursday to erase a number of core financial regulations put in place by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, as Republicans moved a step closer to delivering on their promises to eliminate rules that they claim have strangled small businesses and stagnated the economy.The vote is a significant step for a measure that still faces long odds of becoming law because of the slim majority that Republicans hold in the Senate.Even Wall Street lobbyists and lawyers were pessimistic about the chances of the bill, the Financial Choice Act.\u201cThere is zero chance that the Choice Act survives\u201d in its current form in the Senate, said Matthew Dyckman, a lawyer in the financial services practice at Goodwin.Yet the bill\u2019s passage in the House, by 233 to 186, keeps alive the Republican Party\u2019s dream of unwinding one of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature accomplishments. The vote quickly drew the ire of Democrats who argued that Republicans were giving a handout to Wall Street while putting everyday investors at risk.The bill has maintained a low profile compared with Republican plans on health care and taxes, but rolling back Dodd-Frank represents a major part of the Republican agenda. The Trump administration hopes that by unshackling businesses from burdensome regulations, renegotiating trade deals and cutting tax rates, it can help the economy grow faster and well-paying jobs will become more plentiful.\u201cUltimately the Financial Choice Act is a jobs bill,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on the House floor on Thursday. \u201cIt is why we were sent here, to look out for the people who work hard and do the right thing.\u201dThe House vote comes before a Treasury Department report due in the coming days that will detail the Trump administration\u2019s plans for easing financial regulations. And a lighter regulatory touch is already expected as a result of the administration\u2019s appointments of banking industry veterans to serve as financial regulators.The bill passed the House with only Republican support. But it is possible that bipartisan backing could emerge for parts of the legislation or for fixes to Dodd-Frank that could eventually become law.The Choice Act would exempt some financial institutions that meet capital and liquidity requirements from many of Dodd-Frank\u2019s restrictions that limit risk taking. It would also replace Dodd-Frank\u2019s method of dealing with large and failing financial institutions, known as the orderly liquidation authority \u2014 which critics say reinforces the idea that some banks are too big to fail \u2014 with a new bankruptcy code provision.In addition, the legislation would weaken the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the proposed law, the president could fire the agency\u2019s director at will and its oversight powers would be curbed.Business lobbyists and conservative think tanks have been largely supportive of the plans, which they argue will ease lending and help small companies create jobs.\u201cThe 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is among the most inappropriately named laws ever enacted in the U.S.,\u201d said Norbert Michel, a Heritage Foundation research fellow. \u201cIt neither reformed Wall Street nor protected consumers, and it imposed massive new regulations on banks far away from Wall Street.\u201dOptimism about big changes remains tempered, however.While expressing polite, if restrained, gratitude to Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who championed the dismantling of Dodd-Frank for years, banking lobbyists were realistic about actual changes the Senate Democrats would be willing to swallow.The Senate, they said, is expected to preserve the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the Volcker Rule, which restricts profitable forms of trading by investment banks. A Senate version would probably keep in place most of the rules dictating how much capital lenders have to hold in case of losses.The most significant relief that Wall Street institutions can expect from Congress is tweaking a rule in Dodd-Frank to allow them to charge higher rates on mortgages that they hold, as opposed to the loans they package and sell in securitizations.In short, the rules governing the nation\u2019s largest banks, like J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America, are not expected to change very much. Some of those banks have been cool to the Choice Act anyway, since they have invested large resources to comply with Dodd-Frank.\u201cIt\u2019s an important first step,\u201d Robert Nichols, president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association, said of the vote. \u201cWe are seeking targeted, narrow changes and adjustments to a law that is seven years old, and even the authors admit openly that there are parts of it where we missed the mark and we overshot.\u201dThe nation\u2019s community banks, on the other hand, hope to see some significant easing of regulations on their lending and capital levels.These vocal and typically conservative-leaning bankers have complained for years that Dodd-Frank has strangled their business with needless paperwork and data collection.\u201cThese rules were meant to placate some bureaucrat in an ivory tower in Washington, D.C.,\u201d said John M. Barrett, chief executive of Citrus Bank in Tampa.Among progressive groups and Democrats in Congress, the passage of the Choice Act was painted as nothing more than a gift to rich bankers. They said Republicans\u2019 support for the legislation was evidence that their populist promises on the campaign trail were empty.\u201cIt\u2019s a bill that\u2019s so harmful to vast swaths of the American public if it became law,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cIt would make it easier for predatory lenders to rip people off. It would make it easier for Wall Street to keep taking $17 billion out of retirees\u2019 pockets by repealing the fiduciary rule. It would make it easier for big Wall Street banks to take the kind of risks in pursuit of short-term gains that go directly to the pockets of the tiny handful of people at the top that led to the financial crisis.\u201dDemocratic political organizations such as American Bridge are hoping to make vulnerable House Republicans pay for their votes at the polls in the 2018 midterm elections. The group is rolling out digital advertisements in 14 congressional districts on Friday to assail lawmakers who voted to change Dodd-Frank.\u201cJust like with Trumpcare, every Republican who supports the Choice Act is acting on behalf of the wealthiest Americans at the rest of the country\u2019s expense, and the public will hold them accountable,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for American Bridge.On the floor of the House on Thursday, as Democrats in lock step expressed their opposition to the bill they have nicknamed the Wrong Choice, they argued that Republicans had forgotten the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThese are not the choices that the American people want,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, the minority leader. \u201cHouse Republicans are feeding American families to the wolves on Wall Street.\u201dMichael Corkery contributed reporting from New York, and Victoria Finkle from Washington.Advertisement"}

Chaos. Childish pique. Gauche verbal blunders. Deceptions. Unacceptable behavior toward women. A bunker paranoia at the top, with staffers below scheming to undercut one another.Even though one embodies the tech economy and the other is celebrating coal mining and curtailing globalization, Travis Kalanick and Donald Trump displayed similar traits as they rose to power, ignoring boundaries and smashing institutional structures.The 40-year-old ride-sharing king and the 71-year-old Twitter president luxuriated in their mostly white, male cocoons and always seemed to have a spoken or unspoken \u201cor else\u201d tagged onto their requests.Just as Trump rated women on a 1-to-10 scale and bragged about grabbing their private parts, Kalanick referred to his company as \u201cBoob-er\u201d because he boasted that it allowed him to attract more women. Uber had marketing in France touting \u201chot chick\u201d drivers, and Kalanick gave his \u201cUberettos\u201d tips on how to drink and have sex at a company retreat in Miami.\u201cWhen you have a value system that is in some ways a benefit to you in the early days, when you\u2019re charging really hard, it can turn into a tragic flaw,\u201d Stephen Beck, founder of the consulting firm cg42, told Time about Kalanick. \u201c\u2018Run fast, break things, and we can pick up the pieces later\u2019 is O.K. until it\u2019s not O.K.\u201dJust as Nancy Pelosi urged President Trump to get more sleep so that his synapses would function better, Arianna Huffington, the first woman to go on the board of Uber and a zealot about the subject of sleep, persuaded Kalanick to meditate.But it was too late for illumination about gender sins, and the fact that he did it in Uber\u2019s lactation room added insult to injury.At the meeting to go over the Holder report, Uber board member David Bonderman joked that putting a second woman on the board would ensure a lot more gabbing. Then he had to resign.In an email to employees, Kalanick said he will work on developing Travis 2.0.Neither Kalanick nor Trump are imploding because they considered themselves unworthy impostors. On the contrary, they seemed to be so unaware of their self-destructive tendencies that they saw no need to curb them or put more adults in the inner circle.President Trump has no intention of working on a Donald 2.0. His paranoia about the Deep State seems to be feeding the Deep State\u2019s ability to corral him. His angry and reckless tweets have time and again led to self-incrimination.It was his taunting tweet suggesting that he may have taped his conversations with James Comey that caused the former F.B.I. director to prompt the appointment of a special counsel by giving a memo to a friend to share with a reporter.After a brief flirtation with being classy, as he reacted to the grisly shootout at the congressional baseball game practice here Wednesday, Trump returned to form early Thursday morning, tweeting: \u201cThey made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice.\u201dSo much for the notion that Melania moving into the White House would restrain the president.The unmoored tweetstorm raged on, and on Friday morning, apparently referring to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Trump bleated: \u201cI am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.\u201d Not bothering to keep track of his lies, the president reverted to his earlier cover story about firing Comey because of Rosenstein\u2019s memo rather than what he subsequently admitted: that he had the Russia investigation on his mind.That tweet fired up Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. She put out a scorching statement about the specter of a new Saturday Night Massacre if Trump fires Rosenstein and Robert Mueller, snapping: \u201cIf the president thinks he can fire Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation, he\u2019s in for a rude awakening.\u201dIt seems to have just occurred to Trump that while he bizarrely shrugs off proven Russian interference in the election and sulks about Jeff Sessions recusing himself, Mueller is building a top-flight team of investigators. Turns out Mueller is the one building infrastructure: He has hired 13 lawyers and plans to bring on more. (And Trump\u2019s personal lawyer has hired a lawyer, too.)If you investigate Donald Trump with a dream team, nightmares are bound to follow. Remember how a failed Clinton real estate deal led to Monica Lewinsky?It doesn\u2019t take a Brostradamus to predict that, even for the most driven bros, there is some stuff you can\u2019t brazen out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debt Ceiling Is Again a Battleground, This Time with Republicans in Charge", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 This summer was supposed to be a heady time for Republicans, who would be repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, cutting taxes and simplifying the tax code, and reining in the reach of government.But now the party, rife with divisions, faces a familiar fight of its own making: raising the government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit.Once a distasteful but manageable task for Congress, the debt ceiling has become a battle Washington seems unable to escape.With Republicans in control of both houses of Congress and the Oval Office, some thought that the debt ceiling would be an easy lift.Instead, it has become an obstacle threatening to further stall an agenda that has already fallen well behind schedule. The Treasury Department wants the debt ceiling raised before Congress leaves for its August recess, a demand that could consume many of the 13 legislative days on the calendar next month.\u201cIt\u2019s going to complicate the ability to pass a budget, and it\u2019s going to complicate tax reform because of the internal tensions that they have to struggle with,\u201d said Ed Lorenzen, senior adviser for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group.Time is running short. Republicans must finish their health care legislation under the Senate\u2019s budget process in the coming weeks and pass a 2018 budget resolution before they can move on to the tax legislation that they have promised to approve this year. This fall, they will have to cut a deal with Democrats to fund the government. And all of that must happen against the backdrop of investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the presidential election.The accelerated timetable to raise the debt limit has laid bare a difference of opinion within the White House about how it should be raised \u2014 whether it should be lifted without policy encumbrances or if it should be tied to other policy changes.Mr. Mulvaney, who led the debt ceiling brinkmanship in his previous job as a Republican representative from South Carolina, explained last week that he would like to see concessions such as spending cuts or budget process changes tied to any bill that would raise the debt ceiling. But Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has urged Congress to raise the borrowing limit as quickly as possible, with no strings attached, to avoid roiling financial markets and putting the economy at risk.While the administration has not taken an official stance, President Trump signaled in a meeting with the Republican leadership this week that Mr. Mnuchin, not Mr. Mulvaney, was leading debt ceiling negotiations.After Mr. Mnuchin warned in May that time to raise the cap was running short, the House Freedom Caucus panned his request, saying, \u201cWe demand that any increase of the debt ceiling be paired with policy that addresses Washington\u2019s unsustainable spending by cutting where necessary, capping where able and working to balance in the near future.\u201dSteve Bell, a former Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, said the party\u2019s difficulties raising the debt limit were emblematic of its current state of dysfunction.\u201cThis is the reality of the Balkanization of the Republican Party,\u201d said Mr. Bell, now with the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cIt is almost theological, and this is not something that is going to cement the party back together.\u201dThe infighting means that Republicans will need support from across the aisle to raise the debt limit, but Democratic leaders do not appear eager to help. The party out of power in the White House has, by tradition, been reluctant to shoulder that political burden.\u201cI don\u2019t have any intention of supporting lifting the debt ceiling to enable the Republicans to give another tax break to the wealthy in our country, to further exacerbate the challenge that is created when they have their trickle-down economics,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said last week.On Wednesday, Democrats including Ms. Pelosi and Representatives Nita Lowey of New York and John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the ranking members on the Appropriations and Budget Committees, assailed Republicans for failing to get their fiscal priorities in order, particularly their inability to produce a budget or consider spending bills. They warned that the Republican Congress was \u201cdithering toward disaster.\u201dSimilar concerns have been expressed in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to pass debt ceiling legislation unless Republicans try a parliamentary tactic called budget reconciliation that requires only a simple majority.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot harder to get the debt ceiling raised if our Republican colleagues insist on raising the deficit dramatically by huge tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said Tuesday.Democrats have not decided whether to demand concessions of their own in exchange for helping to raise the debt ceiling.For veterans of the borrowing limit battles of the Obama years, small policy concessions are not worth risking economic calamity.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be an issue regardless of who is in the White House and regardless of who controls the Congress,\u201d said Alan Krueger, former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cThe responsible thing is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Radicalism Possible Today?", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAre you feeling radical? Do you think that the status quo is fundamentally broken and we have to start thinking about radical change? If so, I\u2019d like to go back a century so that we might learn how radicalism is done.The years around 1917 were a great period of radical ferment. Folks at The New Republic magazine were championing progressivism, which would transform how the economy is regulated and how democracy works. At The Masses, left-wing activists were fomenting a global socialist revolution. Outside the White House radical suffragists were protesting for the right to vote and creating modern feminism.People in those days had one thing we have in abundance: an urge to rebel against the current reality \u2014 in their case against the brutalities of industrialization, the rigidities of Victorianism, the stale formulas of academic thinking.But they also had a whole series of mechanisms they thought they could use to implement change. If you were searching for a new consciousness, there was a neighborhood to go to: Greenwich Village. If you were searching for a dissident lifestyle, there was one \u2014 Bohemianism, with its artistic rejection of commercial life.People had faith in small magazines as the best lever to change the culture and the world. People had faith in the state, in central planning as an effective tool to reorganize the economy and liberate the oppressed. Radicals had faith in the working class, to ally with the intellectuals and form a common movement against concentrated wealth.All of them had a youthful and exuberant faith that transformational change was imminently possible. Reed was the romantic adventurer \u2014 the one who left Harvard and ventured to be at the center of wherever the action might be \u2014 union strikes, the Russian Revolution. Paul was the dogged one \u2014 the diminutive activist who gave up sleep, gave up leisure, braved rancid prisons to serve the suffragist movement.But the two true geniuses were Lippmann and Bourne, who offer lessons on different styles of radicalism. With his magisterial, organized mind, Lippmann threw his lot in with social science, with rule by experts. He believed in centralizing and nationalizing, and letting the best minds weigh the evidence and run the country. He lived his creed, going from socialist journalism to the halls of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s administration.Bourne was more visionary and vulnerable. He\u2019d grown up in a stiflingly dull WASP town. It was only when he met the cosmopolitan stew of different ethnicities in New York that he got the chance to \u201cbreathe a larger air.\u201d At a time of surging immigration, and fierce debate over it, Bourne celebrated that \u201cAmerica is coming to be, not a nationality but a trans-nationality, a weaving back and forth, with the other lands, of many threads of all sizes and colors.\u201dBourne believed in decentralized change \u2014 personal, spiritual, a revolution in consciousness. The \u201cBeloved Community\u201d he imagined was a bottom-up, Whitmanesque \u201cspiritual welding,\u201d a graceful coming together of unlike ethnicities.The crucial decision point came as the United States approached entry into World War I. Lippmann supported the war, believing that it would demand more federal planning and therefore would accelerate social change. Bourne was appalled by such instrumentalist thinking, by the acceptance of war\u2019s savagery. As McCarter puts it, \u201cAs Bourne has been arguing, no choice that supports a war will realize any ideal worth the name.\u201dThe radicals split between pragmatists willing to work within the system and visionaries who raised larger possibilities from outside. Spreading their ideals, they pushed America forward. Living out their ideals, most were disillusioned. Reed lost faith in the Soviet Union. Lippmann lost faith in Wilson after Versailles. Bourne died marginalized and bitter during the flu epidemic of 1918.Bourne was the least important radical a century ago, but with his fervent embrace of a decentralized, globalist, cosmopolitan world, he is the most relevant today. He is the best rebuttal to both Trumpian populism and the multicultural separatist movements on the left, who believe in separate graduation ceremonies by race, or that the normal exchange of ideas among people represents cultural appropriation.Most of the 20th-century radicals were wrong to put their faith in a revolutionary vanguard, a small group who could see farther and know better. Bourne was right to understand that the best change is dialogical, the gradual, grinding conversation, pitting interest against interest, one group\u2019s imperfections against another\u2019s, but bound by common nationhood and humanity.Are we really going to hand revolutionary power to the state, the intellectuals, the social scientists, the working class or any other class? No. This is not 1917. But can we recommit ourselves to the low but steady process of politics, bartering and exchanging, which is incremental about means but radical about ends? That\u2019s a safer bet.Advertisement"}

Long workdays in a factory no longer appeal to those older workers, even with the promise of overtime pay.In interviews in December and again on Sunday and Monday outside Huajian\u2019s vast industrial complex in this southern Chinese factory city, numerous workers interviewed by The New York Times complained about 14-hour days. While many liked the overtime pay, they said the days were too long, especially since they often included up to three hours of unpaid breaks for lunch and dinner. The workers insisted on anonymity for fear of retaliation by management.China Labor Watch, the advocacy group investigating the factories, said it found that employees had worked longer weeks than Chinese labor law allows, even excluding breaks. Such violations are common in Chinese factories.A Huajian spokesman, Wei Xuegang, said the company knew nothing about the activists. Asked about the accusation from China Labor Watch, he said Huajian scheduled extra hours during busy times but paid workers according to the law. In a December interview, Zhang Huarong, the company\u2019s founder and chairman, said Huajian followed overtime laws.The Ivanka Trump brand declined to comment on the labor conditions or the activists. In terms of bringing jobs back to the United States, the company said, it was \u201clooking forward to being a part of the conversation.\u201dSuch tensions are fueling the drive of Huajian\u2019s founder, Mr. Zhang, to move work to Ethiopia. A former drill sergeant in the Chinese military who sometimes leads his workers on parade-ground drills, Mr. Zhang says work like making shoes will never return to the United States and is increasingly difficult in China as well.\u201cDo Americans really like to work, to do these simple and repetitive tasks?\u201d said Mr. Zhang, in the December interview. \u201cYoung Chinese also don\u2019t want to do this after they graduate from college.\u201dIn many respects, China\u2019s economy is maturing.The number of people who turn 18 each year and do not enroll in college \u2014 the group that might consider factory work \u2014 had plummeted to 10.5 million by 2015 from 18.5 million in 2000, government data shows. Because of the effects from China\u2019s former \u201cone child\u201d policy, the figure is on track to fall below seven million by 2020.Costs are rising too, as the government raises minimum wages and benefits in an effort to shift China\u2019s economy away from cheap manufacturing. Wages in Dongguan have increased ninefold since the late 1990s, Mr. Zhang said.Workers said they resented the hours, especially the unpaid breaks.One employee\u2019s printed schedule in December showed that the factory required 60 hours and 10 minutes of paid work per week. Chinese laws require that workweeks average no more than 44 hours and limit overtime to 36 hours per month.On Monday, in the middle of China\u2019s three-day Dragon Boat Festival holiday, throngs of workers filed into the factory. Asked whether he would be eating zongzi, the traditional rice dumpling served during the holiday, one worker replied that they don\u2019t get to celebrate. Another said Huajian gave each worker two small dumplings and an egg for the holiday.One worker, a middle-aged woman with the surname Du, said her children had gone home to central China. Ms. Du wished for time off to celebrate, so she could make rice dumplings for them.Mr. Zhang said that his company kept working hours within legal limits, despite workers who want more overtime pay.\u201cWe cannot let them work extra hours just because they have low pay,\u201d Mr. Zhang said in a lengthy interview in December. \u201cWe have thought about it, but we want to do business well.\u201dLi Qiang, who started China Labor Watch 17 years ago, said the group\u2019s activists had never before been detained by the police. \u201cI\u2019m very worried about their safety,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer I\u2019ve lost contact with them, the more I worry.\u201dHuajian peaked at 26,000 employees in China in 2006. Staffing is now down to between 7,000 and 8,000 thanks to automation and the shift to Ethiopia, Mr. Zhang said.Huajian produces 100,000 to 200,000 pairs of Ivanka Trump shoes each year, a small fraction of the eight million pairs of shoes it produces annually. The Dongguan factory makes the heels while a second factory completes the shoes. Marc Fisher Footwear, which licenses the Ivanka Trump brand for shoes manufactured by Huijian, has said it was looking into the allegations.Mr. Zhang has had occasional brushes with Chinese labor laws, although no more than many employers in this increasingly litigious society. In 2014, Li Jianguo, a worker, sued Huajian, saying he worked 104 hours of overtime per month and was not paid for it. Huajian acknowledged in that case that the worker had been putting in 52 hours of overtime per month, according to the text of the court verdict, and agreed to pay him for that.Mr. Zhang said that workers currently earn $525 to $580 per month, including overtime pay but not including company-paid benefits like medical insurance and housing subsidies. Workers said that pay ranged from $380 to $580 per month.The money can go a long way in a factory city like Dongguan. Workers said that a 215-square-foot apartment in the neighborhood costs $29 a month to rent. The company provides a monthly housing subsidy of $11.60.Citing labor costs and the country\u2019s foreign investment push, Huajian is building a sprawling complex of factories, office buildings and a hotel on the southern outskirts of Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa. Mr. Zhang\u2019s shoe factories there already have 5,000 employees. When finished in four years, the Addis Ababa complex will be ringed by a replica of the Great Wall of China.Some interviewed Huajian workers said they were not concerned about jobs being moved to Ethiopia, given the plentiful number of jobs in China\u2019s southern manufacturing zone. Still, many longtime workers face age discrimination if they leave, as other factories prefer workers under 35. Shoemaking is not strenuous and poses few physical dangers, making it more appealing to older workers.Rachel Abrams contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "How Much Tourism Is Too Much?", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityAround the world, the spread of urban tourism into previously uncharted residential neighborhoods, a turn of events not all neighbors have welcomed, has largely been attributed to the growth of Airbnb and its promise of a more intimate experience of hospitality than modern times have typically permitted. In reality, that blame can be distributed more widely. Trends have been moving in that direction for a long time. In New York in particular, a decline in manufacturing jobs lasting decades prompted civic leaders to regroup, turning the city into a branded product that could be marketed to tourists and real estate interests around the world, who would emerge as a driving force of the economy.As more and more tourists obliged, the field they were given to play in became broader and more diverse, by necessity, in some sense; Manhattan\u2019s central business district alone could hardly contain the masses. At the same time, the affluent classes (whose anxieties made them ever more intent on distinguishing themselves from those in the lower rungs) had rejected the \u201ctourist\u201d designation altogether \u2014 tourists go to wax museums in Times Square \u2014 and chose instead to follow the path of what the industry calls immersive travel. This could alternately take the shape of sleeping in tribal huts in Namibia, or staying in an art director\u2019s house in Boerum Hill for 10 days, reading Jonathan Lethem novels in a Hans Wegner lounge chair.As of last month, New York City had 113,000 hotel rooms; by 2019, according to NYC & Company, it is expected to have 137,000.At a moment when questions of strained infrastructure are central to conversations about urban life \u2014 and when the overburdened New York City subway system has reached a crisis point \u2014 the construction of hotels seems to proceed largely untrammeled. Like many other cities around the world, New York entered into protracted battles with Airbnb in part on the grounds that the transformation of apartments into hotel rooms threatened an already shrinking housing supply and disrupted neighborhoods. We hear a lot less about the analog: the consequences of turning over to hoteliers land that might have gone to the construction of new housing instead.Like Ian Schrager\u2019s new Lower East Side hotel, the Public, or 1 Hotel in Brooklyn Bridge Park in Dumbo, or the William Vale in Williamsburg, many hotels are now located in residential neighborhoods to satisfy the urges of those who want to feel as though they are living, however briefly, as real New Yorkers do. Have them try shopping for an affordable apartment.Email bigcity@nytimes.comEmail bigcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Role in Climate Change, and Possibly in Fighting It", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut China has said it is serious about cutting greenhouse gases. Is China living up to its word, and what more could it do if it wanted to become a global leader in fighting climate change? Here\u2019s an explanation.How did China come to be the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas polluter?China\u2019s daunting pollution in part reflects its population \u2014 1.37 billion people, more than any other country. As Chinese people have become richer, buying cars, bigger homes, refrigerators and air-conditioners, their emissions have risen, although their emission per capita remains much lower than Americans\u2019.Another cause is China\u2019s galloping industrial growth, fueled by coal. China\u2019s economic takeoff has been propelled by high-polluting factories, steel mills, cement and power plants.What did China pledge to do under the Paris accord?China has long argued that as a poorer country, it shouldn\u2019t shoulder the same strict caps on its greenhouse gas pollution that rich countries should accept. Instead, China has argued that developing countries should be allowed to let their emissions rise while their citizens grow out of poverty.In the Paris agreement, China said it would cut its carbon intensity by 60 to 65 percent by 2030, compared to its level in 2005.China also pledged that its carbon dioxide emissions would reach their maximum by around 2030, and that it would try to reach an earlier peak. It aims to achieve that partly by expanding solar, wind, nuclear and other nonfossil energy to about 20 percent of total energy use.Is China serious about cutting its greenhouse gas pollution?China\u2019s carbon dioxide pollution output has already slowed more than the government promised in the Paris agreement, and that trend seems likely to continue, many experts say. China\u2019s emissions are likely to peak years before the 2030 date that the government pledged as part of the Paris agreement.International pressure may have played a part in curbing China\u2019s emissions, but the main reasons have been domestic: an economy less dependent on heavy industry and coal, and public discontent over air pollution. That widespread anger has reinforced Chinese leaders\u2019 efforts to cut smokestack industries, and those cuts are also good for limiting greenhouse gases.\u201cThe real drivers for clean energy in China are much closer to home than Paris,\u201d said Lauri Myllyvirta, a Beijing-based analyst of Chinese energy policy for Greenpeace. \u201cThe air pollution and the need to reinvent the economy are much bigger drivers.\u201dCould China do more to cut emissions?China could have signed onto bolder emissions pledges in the Paris agreement, and many environmental advocates and scientists hope that it will offer more ambitious goals in future talks.But the Chinese government tends to make conservative commitments in international agreements, and the Paris treaty was designed so governments could offer modest initial goals that became more ambitious, said Mr. Peters, the researcher at Cicero.\u201cSince countries don\u2019t want to fail, it is natural that the emission pledges will be conservative,\u201d Mr. Peters said by email. \u201cBut, this is partly the point of the Paris agreement and the bottom-up pledges. They are designed to start weak with ambition increased over time.\u201dHow quickly and deeply China drives down greenhouse gas emissions could be politically contentious.While some Chinese officials want audacious steps to cut coal and encourage green growth, others worry that going too fast would put too many mining and industrial workers out of a job, and soak up government revenue better spent elsewhere, several experts said.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement that he wants to leave the Paris accord won\u2019t prompt the Chinese government to retreat from its pledges, but it could embolden local officials and energy companies resistant to faster cuts, said Zou Ji, a professor of environmental policy at Renmin University in Beijing.\u201cIt will have an impact on interest groups,\u201d Mr. Zou said. \u201cFor example, high-carbon industries, such as coal power, metals, steel, will say: \u2018America is doing nothing, why is the central government demanding that we take action? Why don\u2019t you loosen up on us?\u2019\u201dCould China become the global leader in fighting climate change?Mr. Trump\u2019s retreat from the climate agreement has offered China an opportunity to promote itself as a responsible defender of the international climate change pact.But China doesn\u2019t want to assume the role of single-handedly defending the Paris accord. Instead, China is likely to turn to the European Union, as well as to other developing countries such as India and South Africa, to steer the negotiations, several Chinese experts said.As well, China still holds the awkward status of being the world\u2019s biggest carbon dioxide polluter. And even while it has limited coal plant construction at home, China has expanded exports of these plants.China\u2019s claim to a leadership mantle would be stronger if it cut back overseas sales of coal plants, set stricter pollution standards for them and focused on exporting clean energy technology, said Mr. Myllyvirta from Greenpeace.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In McConnell\u2019s Own State, Fear and Confusion Over Health Care Bill", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s broken. It\u2019s broken very badly,\u201d Mr. Gorman said of former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. \u201cBut if they want to take away insurance from 22 million people \u2014 a lot of them would come from these mountains. That would be devastating to our area.\u201dAnd in few places are the political complexities of health care more glaring than in this poor state with crushing medical needs, substantially alleviated by the Affordable Care Act, but where Republican opposition to the law remains almost an article of faith. While some Senate moderates say the Republican bill is too harsh, Rand Paul, Kentucky\u2019s other Republican senator, is among Senate Republicans who say they are opposed to the current bill for a different reason: They believe it does not go far enough to reduce costs.Here in Whitesburg, a city of roughly 2,000 people at the base of Pine Mountain, Mr. Gorman\u2019s sentiment seems to be the prevailing one. In nearly two dozen interviews with health care workers and patients, at the hospital and at a nonprofit clinic run by the Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation, Kentuckians sounded both fearful and flummoxed by the health care drama on Capitol Hill.\u201cIt makes me very nervous,\u201d said Brittany Hunsaker, 29, a clinic social worker who counsels pregnant women addicted to opioids. \u201cSome of the most vulnerable people that we serve, we may not be seeing any more.\u201dSeveral clear themes emerged. Most people said they want everyone covered, and were appalled, as was Mr. Gorman, when they learned the Congressional Budget Office had estimated the Republican plan would leave 22 million more people uninsured over a 10-year period. They are happy that lawmakers are trying to fix Mr. Obama\u2019s health law \u2014 rising premiums are a worry for many \u2014 but fear that Republicans, in their haste, will make a bad situation worse.Sorting out the way forward is agonizingly complex. Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion and successes under the Affordable Care Act are largely the result of former Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat who is out of office now. Meanwhile, Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican elected in 2015, is pushing for a Medicaid waiver from the federal government that includes requirements for many beneficiaries to work or participate in job training.Dr. Van Breeding, the clinic\u2019s director of medical affairs, lamented that the Republican bill in the Senate had gotten mixed up in \u201cparty politics,\u201d while patients had been forgotten. He summed up the situation this way: \u201cSenator Paul is worried about the financial aspect of it. Senator McConnell is worried about the political aspect of it. And I\u2019m worried about patients not having access to basic health care.\u201dKathy Collins, 50, who suffers from lupus, an autoimmune disease \u2014 and who was uninsured until she got Medicaid coverage through the law\u2019s expansion \u2014 is among Dr. Breeding\u2019s patients. Sitting in her hospital bed here Tuesday morning, she said she was surprised to hear that Mr. McConnell, whom she had voted for previously, was leading the charge to roll it back.\u201cHe is?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell, then, he\u2019s no good for Kentucky.\u201dHealth care is a growing part of this region\u2019s economy, and people here are also deeply concerned that the repeal will bring job losses to a region already decimated by unemployment from the coal industry downturn.Dr. Breeding says the number of uninsured patients at the clinic dropped from 19 percent to 4 percent as a result of the health care law. He said Mountain Comprehensive was \u201cbarely getting by\u201d financially before the law was passed; business is much better now. Mountain Comprehensive has hired more people and now offers extended weekend hours and an optometry clinic \u2014 services that have been financed by revenue brought in from the health law, Dr. Breeding said.And those services mean more health care jobs.\u201cIf they do what they say they are going to do, then we may lose our jobs,\u201d said Vicki Roland, a surgical nurse. \u201cI think what we have works pretty good for the people. If they revamp it, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dDespite his constituents\u2019 concerns, Mr. McConnell has little reason to worry about a political backlash; he is widely credited with building the Republican Party in this state, and after three decades in the Senate, his seat is secure. In 2014, he clobbered his Democratic opponent, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, winning by more than 15 percentage points.\u201cHe ran on a clear platform to repeal and replace Obamacare, as did Matt Bevin, the governor, as did Rand Paul, the other senator, as did Donald Trump,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a Kentucky Republican strategist with close ties to Mr. McConnell. \u201cAnd they all have one thing in common: They have overwhelmingly won their elections in Kentucky.\u201d\u201cYou said you have a \u2018responsibility to act,\u2019\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe believe you have a duty to act responsibly. Kentuckians deserve better.\u201dThe local newspaper here in Whitesburg, The Mountain Eagle, published an editorial assailing Mr. McConnell for putting the bill together behind closed doors. \u201cWhy the secrecy, Sen. McConnell?\u201d its headline read.To spend a day with Dr. Breeding is to get a glimpse of his patients\u2019 challenges. His weekday mornings begin at 4:30 a.m., when he arrives at the hospital in Whitesburg. Dressed in his workout gear, he makes rounds, visiting patients whose ailments run the gamut: pneumonia, respiratory failure, colon cancer, lupus, black lung disease, dementia, heart attack, kidney infection and multiple myeloma, a bone cancer.By 8:30 a.m., after a break for a brisk walk through town, he arrives at the clinic, where his nurse practitioner, Heather Yates, says she sees the health care debate from both sides.Like her colleagues, Ms. Yates, 35, worries that undoing the Affordable Care Act will hurt patients. But she has had to cope with the high cost of premiums; when her husband was out of work, they qualified for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act but still paid $400 a month for an insurance policy with a deductible of as much as $1,500. Now the couple pays $1,000 a month, with a $6,000 deductible, for a plan that covers all expenses once the deductible is met.\u201cI\u2019ve got a mix of emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cI do want everybody to have insurance, but I understand what it\u2019s like to pay for it too.\u201dFollow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter: @SherylNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Likes Trump\u2019s Tweets and Why", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byDispatchMr. Trump and his die-hard followers delight in the shock value of violating social and political norms. They revel in the thumb in the eye. It\u2019s intrinsic to the president\u2019s appeal to his base, and it\u2019s increasingly clear that either deliberately or impulsively, both his conduct and his policies are aimed at that base and not beyond it.There is something about his swagger, his unabashed embodiment of a time when women were eye candy and arm candy. And there is something about the way he strikes back at women who anger him that seems to resonate for some men \u2014 and which, at least so far, has not cost him the support of the women who backed him. The uncomfortable larger question is whether this president\u2019s behavior is encouraging and unmasking resentments about women\u2019s place in society.\u201cTrump\u2019s persistent insults to high-profile women play to that part of his base that has long been incensed at a definition of political correctness that includes women, L.G.B.T.Q. people, immigrants and other groups \u2014 but leaves out working-class whites nursing the hidden injuries of class,\u201d she said. \u201cSo long as class remains unacknowledged as a key source of social disadvantage, Trump\u2019s insults will feel to some of his supporters like a delicious poke-in-the-eye of elites.\u201dSocial media offers another lens. It\u2019s a medium Mr. Trump exploits brilliantly, and one that has fostered and amplified a toxic subculture of misogyny. Today on Twitter, there was glee about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet alongside the denunciations. Some piled on with more insults about women. Others were overjoyed that Mr. Trump was upsetting \u201csnowflakes,\u201d that derisive term of art for oversensitive liberals. Still others believed that the president was justifiably striking back against attacks on him from Ms. Brzezinski and her co-host, Joe Scarborough. Some insisted there was no sexism involved, that women aren\u2019t exempt from criticism and have to learn to take it, just as men do.Ms. Matthews thinks Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction is more visceral than strategic. \u201cHe can\u2019t stand to be criticized, especially by a woman, and he can\u2019t stop himself from lashing out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no strategic audience he is winking and nodding to. However there is a segment of his base that enjoys his political incorrectness \u2014 even at this extreme \u2014 and I would say his misogyny. They are not the majority of his supporters, but they are his most fervent.\u201dYet criticism, even from Republicans, has not deterred Mr. Trump and some of his supporters in the past \u2014 witness how many denounced him over the Access Hollywood tapes. The president has paid no discernible political price for his actions. So that leaves the question very much open whether behavior once ruled unthinkable is again permissible in America today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young People Have Their Say About the Future of Hong Kong", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When crowds calling for greater democracy occupied the streets of Hong Kong three years ago, a skinny teenager led them. When voters went to the polls last year, they elected a 23-year-old legislator, the youngest in the city\u2019s history. And when calls for Hong Kong\u2019s independence from China gained momentum, young people were again at the forefront.Many of the most influential voices in Hong Kong today belong to those who have little or no memory of this former British colony\u2019s return to Chinese rule two decades ago. But this generation\u2019s identity has been shaped by the handover.By contrast, Carrie Lam, who will be sworn in Saturday as Hong Kong\u2019s new chief executive, says she wants to make sure that children will learn from an early age to say, \u201cI am Chinese.\u201dWe asked a half-dozen young people in Hong Kong how they identify themselves, what it has been like to grow up in a city newly returned to Chinese rule and what they expect from the future. These are excerpts from their answers, edited for clarity and length:Student beginning at Hong Kong Polytechnic University in SeptemberI was born after the handover. When I was growing up, society told me I was Chinese. When I was young, I was proud to be Chinese. I was excited when I saw China shoot a rocket into space.But when I grew up, I learned more and more about China and the Communist Party, and I felt ashamed to be Chinese. Especially in recent years, the Communists kind of control Hong Kong. When a foreigner asks me who I am, I will always say I\u2019m a Hong Konger but not Chinese. In my mind, I know I\u2019m Chinese, but I don\u2019t want to say I am from China. I would rather say that I\u2019m from Hong Kong.The thing I don\u2019t like is the truth \u2014 that Hong Kong is a part of China. Our city has to follow every rule set by Beijing. We have no rights to our politics. We couldn\u2019t really vote for the chief executive. The Communist Party is actually assigning the people to control Hong Kong.High school graduate pursuing a nursing careerI started to pay close attention to politics after the Umbrella Movement in 2014. Everyone in my class, which had about 30 people, had been to the protest sites at some point, and the school held a forum the next day after the protest erupted. The whole assembly hall was full.Hong Kongers should unite as a nation, and then go independent. As long as Hong Kong is under China\u2019s rule, there will not be democracy. That\u2019s one reason. But another important reason is that I want to tell the world we\u2019re not Chinese.Our differences with Chinese people are mainly cultural. You can tell very easily when you travel. Hong Kongers queue up and won\u2019t talk too loud, and they don\u2019t spit or squat everywhere. We have our language \u2014 traditional scripts and Cantonese \u2014 and shared experience and spirits.Hong Kong needs to be economically independent as well. Hong Kong\u2019s economy has tilted too much toward the mainland and has become overreliant on it. If China\u2019s economy collapses, Hong Kong would be doomed.Community officer with a pro-Beijing political partyI was 5 during the handover. But I remember there was less political struggle. The neighborhood relationships were better. There were fewer complaints about the colonial government.I am happy to see the return of Hong Kong to China. Twenty years after the handover, the development of Hong Kong is still stable. Hong Kong has retained its prosperity. China has done a satisfactory job managing political development. But still, China has to do more for the return of Hong Kong people\u2019s hearts.Hong Kong is part of China. Therefore, I would identify myself as a Hong Konger and also Chinese. Still, I would see myself first as Hong Konger because this is the place where I grew up.But this cannot violate my Chinese identity. Hong Kong is a place, and China is a country.University of Hong Kong graduate from the Chinese city of Harbin who now works in financeAfter graduation I decided to stay in Hong Kong. But now, if you asked me again, I am probably open to going back to China. I visit Beijing and Shanghai a few times every year, and I realize they have been developing pretty fast and making lots of progress. Now China in general has lot of advantages over Hong Kong.Many Chinese people are more adaptable to new technology and new ideas. Hong Kong is a bit lacking in terms of that. Of course, Hong Kong has pretty good infrastructure. It\u2019s quite developed. Now China has developed so fast, as a function of that, Hong Kong will be weakened in the future.I think some Hong Kong people are not very happy about the handover. Some Hong Kong people I know have British passports. They are very proud of it.And also, my British friends, they are very arrogant about it. They\u2019re like, \u201cHong Kong was a British colony. We decided to give it to China. We\u2019re so awesome.\u201d These conversations make me unhappy, but they\u2019re still my friends.Student at St. Stephen\u2019s College, a secondary school in Hong KongGrowing up in Hong Kong as an American-born Chinese, I\u2019ve never really identified fully and exclusively with one single culture or had a strong sense of nationalism.I think the most relevant issue to youth like me would be the tangible social divide by language, mannerisms and cultural identity within Hong Kong. There is a lot of local tension between a perceived \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cus.\u201d It has led to a lot of friction and compromise between the Chinese and the Hong Kongers. A lot of people are also unsatisfied with the increasingly corrupt political and justice scene.All said and done, I\u2019m proud to be associated with Hong Kong. I personally think that Hong Kong is also much, much more than just a city under Chinese rule. In fact, it could be argued that the handover inadvertently caused the term \u201cHong Konger\u201d to be coined, the idea that the people of Hong Kong are neither this nor that, but their very own.Freelance video producerI think Hong Kong has two problems. First is the systemic political problem in terms of who gets power and whether Hong Kong people have the independence to determine whatever we want to determine. The second is the income gap problem.Hong Kong has this bottled-up situation where people are very upset about housing in particular. The government is too scared to do anything to land developers because they\u2019re making a lot of money out of selling land.I despise politicians old or young who are just yelling, doing nothing. Thank you, we all know there\u2019s a problem. Can you think of a smart way to solve it? Hong Kong right now, I think that everyone is just so angry, and we\u2019re not moving anywhere.

{"Headline": "Serbia Gets Its First Female, and First Openly Gay, Premier", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 When President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia nominated Ana Brnabic to the powerful post of prime minister this month, the West hailed it as a landmark decision that put her on course to become the country\u2019s first female and first openly gay premier.But some deeply conservative politicians called her nomination part of a degenerate Western plot, and critics on the left and some lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Serbs dismissed her as Mr. Vucic\u2019s puppet.But on Wednesday in Belgrade, the capital, Ms. Brnabic, a relative novice on Serbia\u2019s political scene, faced down opponents in a speech at the Parliament. (On Thursday, it voted in the new government and approved her as prime minister \u2014 a mere formality given her support in the legislature \u2014 following a lengthy debate.) Striking a defiant tone, she addressed the insults head on.\u201cI expect to receive them also in the future,\u201d Ms. Brnabic, 41, said. \u201cI will respond with truths and facts that I will defend with dignity,\u201d she added, drawing modest applause from lawmakers. \u201cI have big goals as I look to the future,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s put the past together where it belongs \u2014 to the past.\u201dMs. Brnabic called on lawmakers to join her to \u201cmodernize our society\u201d by restructuring the sluggish economy, supporting young entrepreneurs to stop the country\u2019s brain drain and curbing public spending.The televised address, clocking in at one hour and 20 minutes, was perhaps the most the nation had heard her speak. Ms. Brnabic (pronounced BER-nah-beech), a businesswoman who was educated in the United States and Britain, worked in the private sector before joining Mr. Vucic\u2019s government last summer as a public administration minister.She had remained quiet during the upheaval after her nomination, absorbing criticism from lawmakers and scathing attacks on her sexuality and gender, and letting her patron, Mr. Vucic, do the talking.\u201cI\u2019m not a spokesperson for the L.G.B.T. community,\u201d Ms. Brnabic said in an interview with Vice Serbia after she joined the government. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be branded as a gay minister, just as my colleagues don\u2019t want to be primarily defined as being straight,\u201d she added. \u201cAll I want is to do my job as best as I can.\u201dIt was Mr. Vucic, in fact, who mentioned publicly for the first time that Ms. Brnabic is a lesbian. He has said he does not care about her private life and valued her hard work and professionalism. \u201cAna Brnabic is a capable woman, a worthy woman, and I believe she will work with her whole heart to solve many problems in this country,\u201d he said on Serbian state TV.Addressing accusations that she was his puppet, he said: \u201cThe woman has her own brain. She is doing her job and wants to cooperate with me and with everyone in the government.\u201dThe prime minister is more powerful than the president, according to the constitution. The president, who is also the commander in chief and controls various intelligence services, gets to nominate the premier but can\u2019t interfere with the running of the government.But with the confirmation of Ms. Brnabic\u2019s appointment, Mr. Vucic, a former ally of the Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic who has cast himself as pro-Western, now has almost unchallenged control of the country\u2019s institutions. He won a landslide victory in the April 2 election and was sworn in as president on May 31. His Serbian Progressive Party holds the majority in Parliament.Western officials may have seen Ms. Brnabic\u2019s nomination as a sign of progress in a deeply conservative, relatively poor Balkan country, but the nationalists, opposition liberals and even members of the president\u2019s governing party assailed his choice.In a patriarchal society where almost half the population considers homosexuality an illness, some said Ms. Brnabic\u2019s sexual orientation alone disqualified her from leading a government. Others cited her relative lack of experience in government and politics, claiming she was forced on Mr. Vucic by the West to boost Serbia\u2019s chances of joining the European Union.Milan Nic, an expert on the Balkans at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, said Ms. Brnabic fit perfectly into what he called \u201cthe era of Vucic.\u201d\u201cShe is capable and smart, but she will be a weak prime minister,\u201d Mr. Nic said. \u201cVucic is a strong leader who only needs someone to administer the government for him rather than lead it.\u201dCritics also point out that Mr. Vucic is Ms. Brnabic\u2019s only constituency. She does not belong to any political party, and her government is stacked with anti-Western officials who had served in his cabinet.\u201cIt\u2019s not her government \u2014 it\u2019s Vucic\u2019s government, there is no doubt about it,\u201d said Dragan Popovic, a political analyst who leads the Policy Institute, an independent think thank in Belgrade.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to play both sides, saying to the West: \u2018Look what I have to suffer for being progressive. You have to support me,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Popovic said. \u201cAt the same time, he\u2019s signaling to the Russians not to worry.\u201dAny enthusiasm among supporters for Ms. Brnabic\u2019s new role was dampened after she proposed a list of cabinet ministers. The most stunning among them was the man set to become defense minister, Aleksandar Vulin, a staunchly pro-Russian official and former labor minister.Mr. Vulin has frequently attacked officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Croatia, fueling ethnic tensions in the region. He called NATO, which bombed Serbia in 1999 to drive its army from the predominantly Albanian province of Kosovo, an \u201cevil\u201d alliance.Lawmakers, facing a June 30 deadline, approved the new cabinet by a vote of 157-55 on Thursday.For all Ms. Brnabic\u2019s achievement, there is anger and frustration among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Serbs, who face harassment and violence. She has made it clear she is not an activist. She declined last year to lend support to a draft proposal to push for the legalization of same-sex unions in Serbia, saying it was not the right time to start a debate.\u201cThe only thing I share with Ana Brnabic is that we are both lesbians,\u201d said Zoe Gudovic, 40, a social justice activist in Serbia. \u201cI give her credit for shattering the deeply rooted notion of how a woman in the highest position of government should look like, what she should wear and how she should behave in this homophobic society.\u201dBut, Ms. Gudovic added, \u201cI find it impossible to accept that she is willing to be part of the nationalist, authoritarian regime that will ruin our economy, sell our country to foreigners and abolish whatever is left of a social state.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the new prime minister of Serbia, Ana Brnabic, referred incorrectly to her political affiliation. She is backed by the Serbian Progressive Party, but she is not a member of any party.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Red Capital in Hong Kong", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn fact, for residents who have watched Beijing increasingly interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s political affairs since Britain handed it back to China in 1997, the activities of mainland companies like HNA in the territory seem like an ominous sign that the other, economic, shoe is about to drop.HNA was first a small local airline, set up in the 1990s in Hainan, one of the most corrupt provinces in China. Since then it has become a Fortune Global 500 firm that, among other things, gobbles up Hong Kong\u2019s larger residential developments. Its winning bids in government land auctions over the past half-year reached roughly double the going rate in 2014. HNA may or may not be overpaying for Hong Kong real estate, but it is driving up prices.Such mainland companies with deep pockets are challenging the local land barons, who came to dominate Hong Kong\u2019s economy as the colonial British trading houses relinquished their positions in the run-up to the handover. For many years these local tycoons have been the most important economic and political actors in Hong Kong. Now they face an existential threat.Lui Che-woo, the chairman of the Hong Kong conglomerate K. Wah Group, has said that Hong Kong developers stand little chance against investors from the mainland, many of which are backed by powerful Chinese government entities, central or local.The real estate market isn\u2019t the first domino to fall. Chinese companies have already claimed Hong Kong\u2019s stock market. Last year, more than half of all companies listed on Hong Kong\u2019s two exchanges were entities from the mainland. Their capitalization amounted to 63 percent of Hong Kong\u2019s stock market total, and their shares made up 71 percent of the average daily trade volume.That\u2019s for economics. But for the Chinese, there is nothing economic that isn\u2019t also political.James Tien Pei-chun \u2014 a former legislator, a former chairman of the pro-business Liberal Party and a tycoon in his own right \u2014 turned heads at a public forum in April when he said: \u201cChinese money buying up land in Hong Kong at sky-high prices has left many local developers with no standing room. In the future, Chinese capital will seep into many livelihood sectors in our city.\u201d\u201cWhen a country can fully control our main economic arteries, when the boss has full say,\u201d he added, \u201cthe kind of good life and democracy that we all yearn for will be much more difficult to attain.\u201dRed capital, as mainland money is sometimes called, may also serve to curb civil society or community activities in Hong Kong. One example: Since at least 2014, property insurance companies with various forms of backing from the mainland have won contracts with homeowners\u2019 associations in Hong Kong\u2019s private residential towers by aggressively undercutting the price of their policies. Some political activists have told me they suspect that these associations have come under pressure to keep pro-democracy advocates from canvassing in those building complexes.China has employed tactics of this kind in Taiwan. Starting in 2011, Chinese government agents began buying their way into fishing villages in southern Taiwan \u2014 an area that traditionally favors independence for the island \u2014 by signing forward contracts with fishermen and pre-purchasing entire catches of milkfish at prices significantly above prevailing local rates. If Beijing can do this in Taiwan, it can do this, and other things, even more easily in Hong Kong, which already formally is under its indirect control.That said, some local pushback is to be expected. The 2014 pro-democracy protests known as the Umbrella Movement may have failed to extract any democratic concessions from Beijing, but they have spawned a new generation of young people who want more autonomy for Hong Kong.There might also be a reaction from otherwise apolitical quarters. When Denise Ho Wan See, one of the city\u2019s premier pop singers, lost her contract with the company that promoted her performances \u2014 apparently because she supported the Umbrella Movement \u2014 scores of local businesses raised the money she needed to secure a venue. And that was just pushback about one person\u2019s right to freely express her political views. The influx of money from the mainland already affects all Hong Kongers, if only because it drives up property prices in a city that consistently ranks as one of the least affordable housing markets in the world.Now some of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest property tycoons may also be feeling that they have to defend their interests against red capital on their home turf. Some of them do business in or with China, but with ordinary people in Hong Kong increasingly feeling the pinch, the tycoons and their political allies may have more reason to protect core local businesses against mainland money.There already are ordinances restricting mainland Chinese from migrating to Hong Kong, and there are laws prohibiting nonpermanent residents from owning certain critical businesses, such as TV broadcasting. If such regulations have been deemed to comply with the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy that governs relations between Hong Kong and the mainland, then some limits on red capital could be acceptable too.The Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, protects the free movement of foreign capital in and out of the city. But it says nothing that would prevent regulating the use of foreign capital to buy local assets. And in that silence may lie Hong Kongers\u2019 best line of defense against the steady onslaught from the north.Yi-Zheng Lian is a commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders: How Democrats Can Stop Losing Elections", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 2016, the Democratic Party lost the presidency to possibly the least popular candidate in American history. In recent years, Democrats have also lost the Senate and House to right-wing Republicans whose extremist agenda is far removed from where most Americans are politically. Republicans now control almost two-thirds of governor\u2019s offices and have gained about 1,000 seats in state legislatures in the past nine years. In 24 states, Democrats have almost no political influence at all.If these results are not a clear manifestation of a failed political strategy, I don\u2019t know what is. For the sake of our country and the world, the Democratic Party, in a very fundamental way, must change direction. It has got to open its doors wide to working people and young people. It must become less dependent on wealthy contributors, and it must make clear to the working families of this country that, in these difficult times, it is prepared to stand up and fight for their rights. Without hesitation, it must take on the powerful corporate interests that dominate the economic and political life of the country.There are lessons to be learned from the recent campaign in Britain. The Conservatives there called the snap election with the full expectation that they would win a landslide. They didn\u2019t. Against all predictions they lost 13 seats in Parliament while Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party won 32. There is never one reason elections are won or lost, but there is widespread agreement that momentum shifted to Labour after it released a very progressive manifesto that generated much enthusiasm among young people and workers. One of the most interesting aspects of the election was the soaring turnout among voters 34 or younger.The British elections should be a lesson for the Democratic Party. We already have among the lowest voter turnout of any major country on earth. Democrats will not win if the 2018 midterm election turnout resembles the unbelievably low 36.7 percent of eligible voters who cast ballots in 2014. The Democrats must develop an agenda that speaks to the pain of tens of millions of families who are working longer hours for lower wages and to the young people who, unless we turn the economy around, will have a lower standard of living than their parents.While Democrats should appeal to moderate Republicans who are disgusted with the Trump presidency, too many in our party cling to an overly cautious, centrist ideology. The party\u2019s main thrust must be to make politics relevant to those who have given up on democracy and bring millions of new voters into the political process. It must be prepared to take on the right-wing extremist ideology of the Koch brothers and the billionaire class, and fight for an economy and a government that work for all, not just the 1 percent.Donald Trump wants to throw 23 million Americans off health insurance. Democrats must guarantee health care to all as a right, through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program.Mr. Trump wants to give enormous tax breaks to billionaires. Democrats must support a progressive tax system that demands that the very wealthy, Wall Street and large corporations begin paying their fair share of taxes.Mr. Trump wants to sell our infrastructure to Wall Street and foreign countries. Democrats must fight for a trillion-dollar public investment that creates over 13 million good-paying jobs.Mr. Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Democrats must take on the fossil fuel industry and accelerate our efforts to combat climate change by encouraging energy efficiency and the use of sustainable energy.Mr. Trump has proposed deep cuts to higher education. Democrats must make public colleges and universities tuition free, and substantially lower student debt.Mr. Trump has doubled-down on our failed approach to crime that has resulted in the United States\u2019 having more people in jail than any other country. Democrats must reform a broken criminal justice system and invest in jobs and education for our young people, not more jails and incarceration.Mr. Trump has scapegoated and threatened the 11 million undocumented people in our country. Democrats must fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.This is a pivotal moment in American history. If the Democrats are prepared to rally grass-roots America in every state and to stand up to the greed of the billionaire class, the party will stop losing elections. And it will create the kind of country the American people want and deserve.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Insurance Giant Aetna Is Leaving Hartford for New York City", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAetna, the insurance giant founded in Hartford, where it has been for the past 164 years, announced Thursday that it would move its headquarters to New York City despite intensive lobbying efforts by Connecticut officials.The move is a blow to the company\u2019s hometown, which is facing severe financial problems, and a potential boon for Aetna, which stands to receive $24 million in tax breaks from the state over the next decade, among other benefits, for its new headquarters in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.The relocation, which involves 250 current and new executive and digital jobs, bolsters New York City\u2019s vision of itself as an emerging digital powerhouse, but also continues the erosion in Connecticut of an industry that has long been an economic engine there. The number of workers employed in the insurance industry in Hartford and the surrounding area has plunged to 37,000 this year from over 60,000 in 1990, according to federal statistics.Still, while Aetna is moving its headquarters out of the state, about 5,000 employees will remain in Connecticut.Aetna is investing $89 million to transform 145,000 square feet in a building on Ninth Avenue into its new home, according to Empire State Development, New York State\u2019s economic development agency.Efforts to lure the company were highly competitive \u2014 Aetna considered numerous cities for its new home, but in the end, after protracted negotiations, New York State offered one of the most attractive deals. Besides the state tax credits, which are based on the number of new jobs Aetna creates, the New York City Economic Development Corporation will provide nearly $10 million worth of incentives through a combination of property and sales tax credits, among other benefits.\u201cNew York City is where talent and technology come together,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been stronger.\u201dHartford had agreed to match the package after news broke this year about Aetna\u2019s plan to move, according to the administration of the Connecticut governor, Dannel P. Malloy. But as the company places greater emphasis on creating digital tools for people to manage their health care, being in New York City, with its large reservoir of talent, seemed vital to the company\u2019s future, said Mark T. Bertolini, Aetna\u2019s chairman and chief executive.New York provides \u201cthe ecosystem of having people in the knowledge economy, working in a town they want to be living in, and we want to attract those folks, and we want to have them on our team,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to recruit people like that to Hartford.\u201d\u201cIt is a difficult decision,\u201d Mr. Bertolini added. \u201cWe have continued to work with the governor and mayor of Hartford to try and improve the quality of life in the Hartford area, but that is too slow in coming.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mr. Malloy quickly came to Hartford\u2019s defense. \u201cWhile Hartford may not be New York City, we are proud of the city\u2019s revitalization,\u2019\u2019 the spokeswoman, Meg Green, said. \u201cHartford provides a strong foundation for any company in the insurance sector, large or small. From a very deep bench of top insurance talent, to incredible school systems and a high quality of life for employees, Connecticut remains the insurance capital of the world for good reason.\u201d\u201cAetna\u2019s decision to call New York home is another testament to the Empire State\u2019s extraordinary economic momentum,\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cNew York has a deep, diverse talent pool and pro-growth environment that businesses need to succeed, and today more companies are choosing New York to grow and diversify their business.\u201dThat company, the Hartford Financial Services Group, which has been in Hartford for more than 200 years, isn\u2019t going anywhere, according to its chairman and chief executive, Christopher J. Swift. The company is bullish on the city, where recent real estate developments could help reverse its economic slide.\u201cWe are encouraged by the early signs of revitalization in the city and the more honest assessment and discussion of priorities in light of fiscal realities at the city and state level,\u201d Mr. Swift said. \u201cWe are committed to the city, and the state of Connecticut.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was Lenin a German Agent?", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRed CenturyBecause he returned home by way of Germany \u2014 and with the obvious cooperation of the German High Command \u2014 which was then at war against Russia and her Entente allies (France, Britain and, from April 6, the United States), allegations that Lenin was a German agent were immediately hurled by his opponents, a charge that remains controversial to this day. If it is ever proved that Lenin was acting on behalf of the German Imperial Government in 1917, the implications for our understanding of the October Revolution, and the Soviet Communist regime born of it, which lasted until 1991, would be profound. This would amount to the greatest influence operation of all time, making present-day concerns about Russian meddling in Western elections, including last year\u2019s American presidential contest, seem tame in comparison. Was it true?Had the British or French governments been weaker in World War I, they might have been undermined by other Lenins. In fact, Germany did target them, too, though German support for Irish nationalists and French pacifists never amounted to much.Russia, long troubled with labor agitation and peasant unrest, was the weak link of the Entente alliance, and it is not surprising the Germans put so much effort into undermining Czarist rule. Ecumenical in their support for Russian revolutionaries, the Germans subsidized not only Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks, but also socialist rivals such as Leon Trotsky, then a Menshevik, who published antiwar articles in Paris and then New York City.If Lenin was not the only recipient of German largess, however, he was the most important. Although what most people today understand as Communism is the Marxist program of the abolition of private property, state ownership of the means of production and a planned economy, it was not this program, endorsed by other European Marxists, that recommended Lenin to the German Imperial government.What singled Lenin out from fellow Russian socialists was his fanatical opposition to the war and his support for Ukrainian independence, a key aim of the Central Powers. While other antiwar socialists like Trotsky genuinely abhorred the carnage and strove to bring the war to a halt by supporting protests and draft resistance, Lenin argued in his 1915 pamphlet \u201cSocialism and War\u201d that revolutionaries should instead infiltrate the armies and turn them red, promoting mutinies and actively seeking the defeat of \u201c \u2018their\u2019 governments\u201d (Lenin\u2019s own quotation marks).Nor did Lenin conceal his antiwar views after returning to Russia. The \u201cApril Theses\u201d advocated toppling the provisional government that had come to power after the February Revolution. During the April Days putsch, which occurred two weeks after Lenin\u2019s return, Bolshevik activists held up antiwar placards that openly urged fraternization with the enemy (\u201cthe Germans are our brothers\u201d).After a second attempted putsch, known as the July Days, Lenin and 10 other Bolsheviks were charged with \u201ctreason and organized armed rebellion.\u201d Scores of witnesses came forward to testify about wire transfers from Stockholm, money-laundering via a German import business, the German financing of the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda (including editions aimed at front-line troops), the going rates for holding up Bolshevik placards in street protests (10 rubles) or for fighting in the Red Guards (40 rubles per day). While Lenin fled to Finland, most of his comrades were arrested. The stage was set for a spectacular show trial.It was not to be. Just as the provisional government\u2019s case was buttressed in late August 1917 with the testimony of the police agents who had raided Lenin\u2019s headquarters, its prime minister, Alexander Kerensky, granted amnesty to most of the arrested Bolsheviks (though not Lenin) in order to enlist their support against a general, Lavr Kornilov, whom Kerensky believed was plotting a right-wing military coup. In a shortsighted move, Kerensky allowed the Bolshevik military organization to rearm, thus acquiring the weapons they would use to oust him two months later.Lenin, with wanted posters for his arrest plastered all over Russia on the eve of the October Revolution, did not miss his chance. Once Lenin was in power, far from showing caution in relations with his alleged German paymasters, one of his first acts was to send a cable to German military headquarters on the eastern front, offering an unconditional cease-fire. When the harsh terms of the resulting treaty of Brest-Litovsk were announced in Petrograd\u2019s Tauride Palace in 1918 \u2014 terms that included detaching Ukraine and the Baltic States from Russia \u2014 Lenin was greeted with shouts of \u201cDown with the traitor!\u201d and \u201cJudas!\u201d and \u201cGerman spy!\u201dSo was Lenin a German agent?In his own mind, Lenin could and did justify his actions as tactical maneuvers serving the higher cause of Communism, not the sordid war aims of the German Imperial Government. Fair enough. But it is hard to imagine this defense holding up at trial, if the jury were composed of ordinary Russians while the war was still going on. The evidence assembled by Kerensky\u2019s justice department, much of which has only recently been rediscovered in the Russian archives, was damning. No matter Lenin\u2019s real intentions, it is undeniable that he received German logistical and financial support in 1917, and that his actions, from antiwar agitation in the Russian armies to his request for an unconditional cease-fire, served the interests of Russia\u2019s wartime enemy in Berlin. They also brought about disastrous consequences for Russia herself, from territorial dismemberment in 1918 to decades of agony under the suffocating Bolshevik dictatorship.The Russian Revolution inaugurated a new era in foreign influence operations. Lenin himself helped to found the Communist International, which for nearly a quarter of a century was dedicated to trying to topple capitalist governments around the world. The Nazis played a similar game in Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938, only to abandon the pretense of influence-peddling for brute force when, along with the Soviet Red Army from the east, they invaded Poland from the west in 1939. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States turned Revolutionierungspolitik into an art form, striving to undermine one another\u2019s allies and satellite states by all manner of subterfuge and subversion.Today, it appears that a new round of the Cold War has emerged, though with a different ideological flavor, as the Kremlin promotes populist nationalism in Europe and the United States, even as Western leaders and democracy activists mobilize opposition against Russia and Putin-friendly regimes, such as Viktor Orban\u2019s in Hungary \u2014 which then crack down on such activists as \u201cforeign agents.\u201d Revolutionierungspolitik has gone global.Before panic sets in, it is well to be reminded of the difference in degree, and kind, of today\u2019s foreign influence-peddling compared with past episodes. Disinformation spread by state media, online bots and Twitter trolls is a serious nuisance, taking advantage of the openness of Western societies to undermine confidence in democratic institutions; cyberattacks and hacking are more serious still. For their part, Mr. Putin and his defenders denounce outside political interference in places like Ukraine, claiming that Russian moves there are mere reactions to Western meddling.Yet none of these influence operations are comparable, in scale or geopolitical impact, to Germany\u2019s playing of the Lenin card, or indeed to what the United States and Soviet Union did during the Cold War. Unlike Russia in 1917, the great power governments of today, whether in Washington, Paris, Berlin or Moscow, are too strongly entrenched to fall prey to a Lenin. Or so we must hope.Sean McMeekin, a professor of history at Bard College, is the author of \u201cThe Russian Revolution: A New History.\u201dThis is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}

But rarely has a new president appeared so determined not just to steer the country in a different direction but to actively dismantle what was established before his arrival. Whether out of personal animus, political calculation, philosophical disagreement or a conviction that the last president damaged the country, Mr. Trump has made clear that if it has Mr. Obama\u2019s name on it, he would just as soon erase it from the national hard drive.\u201cI\u2019ve reflected back and simply cannot find another instance in recent American history where a new administration was so wholly committed to reversing the accomplishments of its predecessor,\u201d Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center, said. While other presidents focus on what they will build, \u201cthis one is different, far more comfortable still in swinging the wrecking ball than in developing models for what is to follow.\u201dShirley Anne Warshaw, director of the Fielding Center for Presidential Leadership Study at Gettysburg College, said Mr. Trump is not unusual in making a clean break from his predecessor. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t doing anything that Obama didn\u2019t do,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is simply reversing policies that were largely put in place by a president of a different party.\u201dThe difference, she said, is that other presidents have proactive ideas about what to erect in place of their predecessor\u2019s programs. \u201cI have not seen any constructive bills in this vein that Trump has put forth,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as I can tell, he has no independent legislative agenda other than tearing down. Perhaps tax reform.\u201dAdvisers insist Mr. Trump is not driven by a desire to unravel the Obama presidency. But like the Manhattan real estate developer he is, they said, he believes he must in some cases demolish the old to make way for the new.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t dismantled everything, and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s looking to do,\u201d said Hope Hicks, the White House director of strategic communications. \u201cThat may be a side effect of what he\u2019s building for his own legacy. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s coming into the office every day saying, \u2018How can we undo Obama\u2019s legacy, and how can he go back?\u2019 \u201dCritics say Mr. Obama brought this on himself. His biggest legislative achievements were passed almost exclusively with Democratic votes, meaning there was no bipartisan consensus that would outlast his presidency. And when Republicans captured Congress, he turned to a strategy he called the pen and the phone, signing executive orders that could be easily erased by the next president.\u201cI\u2019ve heard it joked about that the Obama library is being revised to focus less on his legislative achievements as each week of the Trump administration goes by,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. \u201cIt\u2019s like living by the sword and dying by the sword. When your presidency is based on a pen and a phone, all of that can be undone, and I think we\u2019re seeing that happening rather systematically.\u201d\u201cObama\u2019s legacy would be under much greater threat by a more competent president than Donald Trump,\u201d said Josh Earnest, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s White House press secretary. \u201cHis inexperience and lack of discipline are an impediment to his success in implementing policies that would reverse what Obama instituted.\u201dOther Obama veterans said much of what Mr. Trump has done was either less dramatic than it appeared or reversible. He did not actually break relations with Cuba, for instance. It will take years to actually withdraw from the Paris accord, and the next president could rejoin. The real impact, they argued, was to America\u2019s international reputation.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of posturing and, in fact, not a huge amount of change, and to the extent there has been change, it\u2019s been of the self-defeating variety,\u201d said Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser. \u201cWhat\u2019s been happening is not that the administration is undoing President Obama\u2019s legacy, it\u2019s undoing American leadership on the international stage.\u201dFor decades, presidents moving into the Oval Office have made a point on their first day or two of signing orders overturning policies of the last tenant, what Mr. Riley called \u201cpartisan kabuki\u201d to signal that \u201ca new president is in town.\u201dEven so, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Obama invested much effort in deconstructing programs left behind. Mr. Bush kept Mr. Clinton\u2019s health care program for lower-income children, his revamped welfare system and his AmeriCorps service organization. Mr. Obama undid much of Mr. Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind education program, but kept his Medicare prescription medicine program, his AIDS-fighting program and most of his counterterrorism apparatus.Mr. Obama understood that his legacy might be jeopardized by Mr. Trump. During last year\u2019s campaign, he warned supporters that \u201call the progress we\u2019ve made over these last eight years goes out the window\u201d if Mr. Trump won. Only after the election did he assert the opposite. \u201cMaybe 15 percent of that gets rolled back, 20 percent,\u201d he told The New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of stuff that sticks.\u201dIndeed, when it comes time to tally the record for the history books, Mr. Trump can hardly reverse some of Mr. Obama\u2019s most important achievements, like pulling the economy back from the abyss of a deep recession, rescuing the auto industry and authorizing the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Nor can Mr. Trump take away what will surely be the first line in Mr. Obama\u2019s obituary, his barrier-shattering election as the first African-American president.Conversely, Mr. Obama owns his failures regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. History\u2019s judgment of his handling of the civil war in Syria or the messy aftermath of the intervention in Libya or the economic inequality he left behind will not depend on his successor. If anything, America\u2019s decision to replace Mr. Obama with someone as radically different as Mr. Trump may be taken as evidence of Mr. Obama\u2019s inability to build sustained public support for his agenda or to mitigate the polarization of the country.But legacies are funny things. Presidents are sometimes defined because their successors are so different. Mr. Obama today is more popular than he was during most of his presidency, likely a result of the contrast with Mr. Trump, who is the most unpopular president this early in his tenure in the history of polling. By this argument, even if Mr. Trump does disassemble the Obama legacy, it may redound to his predecessor\u2019s historical benefit.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine future historians condemning Barack Obama for breaking with his country\u2019s past ostracism of Cuba or joining the civilized world in combating climate change or pursuing a more humane and accessible approach to health care,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIndeed, we build memorials to presidents who prod us toward fulfilling the egalitarian vision of Jefferson\u2019s declaration.\u201dBut that may not be all that comforting to Mr. Obama. Presidents prefer memorials to their lasting accomplishments, not their most fleeting.Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times and author of \u201cObama: The Call of History.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Ireland\u2019s Border: \u2018That Sad Old Game\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "OpinionThanks to \u201cBrexit,\u201d Borderlanders will have to adapt, yet again, to what distant powers decide for them.Supported byBELFAST, Northern Ireland \u2014 When Britain voted last June to leave the European Union, Northern Ireland voted to remain by a clear majority. Along the border with the Republic of Ireland, that majority was even larger, about 64 percent. The referendum was a hard knock for the Borderlanders \u2014 a blunt reminder that they are peripheral not only to the geography of Britain but also to the debate about its future. The damage that leaving the European Union could do to their lives and livelihoods was hardly considered in wider Britain.On June 8 there will be another vote, this time to choose the next British government. There are pro-European Union parties that would try to reverse the decision to leave, but those parties do not have large enough bases to be serious contenders. And, even lumped together, Northern Ireland\u2019s political parties only fill a small minority of the seats in Westminster. So on June 8 we\u2019ll choose which government will lead Britain out of the European Union.Marica Mullan, left, 22, and Shanice Mullan, 24, from County Derry, Northern Ireland. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way you know now that you\u2019re even crossing over is you get a text message on your phone or you see the lines in the road change color,\u201d Marica said.I was raised in the Republic of Ireland, close to the border with Northern Ireland. My father would sometimes drive north for supplies, and he liked to bring me along. \u201cFor the company,\u201d he would say to my mother. On the way home I got to play smuggler: a radio, a toaster, a little contraband alcohol under my seat. We were always carrying something that, strictly speaking, we shouldn\u2019t have, just to save a couple of pounds.The Troubles were raging, and military installations guarded the line. Leaving Northern Ireland, we would be filtered through a military checkpoint: towers protected with steel plating and camouflage nets. We would wait between blast walls as our car\u2019s registration was radioed in. Some memoirs describe routine humiliation at these checkpoints: Families delayed by the soldiers for no good reason, just to show who was in charge. This was never my experience, perhaps because my border-crossing days were later, the 1980s and early \u201990s. The best comparison I can make is with airport security; efficient but with a certain tension.My father, I think, experienced the process as a challenge to his sense of identity. There he was, half an hour from home, having to explain himself to an Englishman with a gun. When we were allowed back into the south, the first thing we would see was a customs hut, a tin shack with a uniformed official sitting inside the door. There were customs controls on the border to stop people bringing in too many cheaper products from the north. It was he, not the soldiers, who represented risk. He had the right to search the car, charge tax on imports or even confiscate our haul.Regular border-crossers developed a canniness for dealing with customs officials. My father knew how to chat to them, deploying a friendly smile that said he wasn\u2019t worth bothering with. \u201cJust getting some groceries for the family,\u201d he would say. I realize now this was part of the reason he wanted me along \u2014 I completed the picture of a harmless family man just trying to get by. We were always allowed to continue, without trouble, but it was rather a sad game, with small prizes; I recall a cassette player and a new pair of curtains rolled up tightly and squeezed under the seat.Of course now it\u2019s quite different. The European Union\u2019s creation of the single market, in 1993, meant the free movement of goods and people, removing the need for customs. Then, beginning in 1998, the military installations were dismantled as part of the new peace process. But the sense of the border as a set of rules or a prohibition, rather than a place, remained in my memory.Over the last few years I have returned to the border and explored it, finally treating it as place. I followed the borderline from end to end, mostly on foot, occasionally by canoe. It is almost invisible now, although always delineated by something: a river, a hedgerow or stonewall. The surrounding area is mostly farms, open heath and fir plantations. British and Irish cows moo at each other over low fences. The last military installations were removed more than 15 years ago, but I had the coordinates of where they\u2019d stood. Arriving at these sites and examining the road surface, I would feel like an archaeologist of the recent past.Usually the only indication that a steel tower had once been in a certain spot was that the road widened slightly, and then narrowed. Borderlanders sometimes park cars they\u2019re selling in these lay-bys, with a sign propped up in the windshield giving the price, in euros or British pounds, and two cellphone numbers, one northern and one southern.The borderland is a practical place. It carries some scars, but people are mostly just busy trying to draw advantages from what is usually a disadvantage: living on the periphery. New tourism initiatives encourage hikers to visit the border\u2019s hill country, and I walked many stretches of unexpected beauty. Bridges have been built and roads reopened. There is still some smuggling, but it\u2019s limited to diesel fuel and conducted by criminal gangs, not people like my father. Today\u2019s open frontier means some Borderlanders live in the north but work in the south, or live in the south but send their children north to school. Life on the border still has complexities, but the canniness of my father and others has been replaced by something more unambiguous and legal, something more like the wisdom that comes from living with your feet in two cultures.The next manifestation of Ireland\u2019s border will be as the only land frontier between Britain and the European Union, designed by people who may never have visited it. And the Borderlanders, yet again, will have to adapt to what distant powers decide for them.There is obviously a great deal of frustration and anxiety along the border. It seems likely that some sort of customs process will return. Some suggest that military checkpoints may reappear. I don\u2019t accept this apocalyptic prediction; it would take a particularly deep spiral of disaster to return us to that. Those who think that it will have, to use a Northern Irish phrase, \u201clost the run of themselves.\u201d But the future border need not be militarized to do real damage to the borderland economy and society.When Britain leaves the European single market, price differences will probably yawn wide again. Smuggler gangs are already positioned to exploit them \u2014 diesel fuel smuggling has kept them in practice. The border could once again be a site of interrogation, a prohibition rather than a place. Customs checks would also mean the ever-so-slight but ever-so-real criminalization of the general public; lots of people will nip across the border to save themselves 15 percent on curtains, and who would really blame them? They\u2019re just getting by.For my part, I hope we don\u2019t return to that sad old game where you are always betting on the weariness of customs officials or your ability to charm, with a smile and a wink.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is There an Emerging Democratic Agenda?", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhile Donald Trump and his Congressional majority continue to push a harsh, hard-right ideology, so far they\u2019ve been a legislative failure. And for good reason: For years, all they did was oppose Barack Obama and the Democrats, without bothering to develop an actual governing agenda of their own. Democrats must not make the same mistake. Playing defense is necessary, but it is not sufficient.In fact, under the surface tension, a robust, highly progressive agenda has been coming together in recent months, one with the potential to unite both the Hillary and Bernie wings of the party, to go beyond both Clintonomics and Obamanomics.These ideas come from the left wing of the party, but I\u2019ve noticed more and more centrist Democrats, along with establishment donors, who increasingly recognize the need, in both substantive economic and electoral terms, to get outside the old boxes and go bold.One of the boldest ideas coming down the pike is a universal child allowance: a monthly stipend for all families with children. International data show that child poverty in America remains at 20 percent \u2014 twice the rate in Germany and seven times the rate in Denmark.Those countries, and most other advanced economies, provide regular payments to families with children based on the recognition that investing in children is an essential public good. Yet here in the United States, though we have a patchwork of programs, the lowest-income children often get no income support, while children in wealthy families benefit from generous tax deductions.Next, even as we close in on full employment, there are parts of America where job growth and labor force participation are well below the national average. Historically, public policy tries to help such left-behind areas through place-based tax credits, but their track record is dismal. If we want to help places with too little labor demand, we must implement direct job creation policies, meaning either jobs created by the government or publicly subsidized private employment.A higher minimum wage is yet another idea drawing broad liberal support.Though Democrats have written bills for most of these ideas, no one expects them to go anywhere in this Congress. What\u2019s important is that such ideas, once the domain of the party\u2019s left wing, now face a diminished resistance from centrists, who once viewed them as too expensive and too interventionist. The bold minimum wage increase has 152 supporters in the House and 31 in the Senate.Progressives will be playing defense for many years to come. But let\u2019s also make sure we\u2019re ready to roll with a true progressive agenda when our time comes.Advertisement"}

America\u2019s might and majesty were cornerstones of international relations, cooperation and diplomacy. We were a beacon and balance to the world. America has been imperfect \u2014 sometimes disastrously so \u2014 but it always seemed to me bent toward the belief that America and the world could be made more perfect.Well, that time has come to a close. America is exiting the world stage. Donald Trump is drawing the curtains.\u201cPresident Trump upended America\u2019s traditional, bipartisan trade policy on Monday as he formally abandoned the ambitious, 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership brokered by his predecessor and declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades.\u201dTrump has had, and continues to have, an unhealthy and inexplicable admiration for the world\u2019s strongmen, dictators and authoritarian regimes \u2014 Russia and Vladimir Putin stand out among the rest \u2014 while simultaneously chiding and chastising America\u2019s traditional allies and those countries\u2019 leaders.Last month in Europe, Trump was as boorish and belligerent as it was possible to be, lashing out at our NATO allies about their defense spending just after having been gracious and magnanimous to leaders in the Middle East.But even beyond whether or not it was popular, staying in was right. More than 190 countries \u2014 most of the countries on the planet \u2014 are signatories to the agreement. We have one planet. It is in trouble. The world must band together to save it. How does it look for the world\u2019s last remaining superpower to simply walk away?This is not putting America first, this is putting America on a path of regression and isolationism. This is putting our future and the future of the planet in peril. This is dumb, hazardous and shortsighted.\u201cI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America\u2019s interests.\u201d\u201cClinton won almost 60 percent of the vote in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. The percentage was even higher in many precincts within the city of Pittsburgh itself. (Allegheny County includes a range of suburbs in addition to the city.)\u201dThen, for me, the icing on the cake was Trump\u2019s absolute lack of grace and tact in his response to the London terror attacks over the weekend. His first response was not to express his horror and extend America\u2019s condolences and offer American assistance. No, that would have required that he possess a shred of empathy and common decency.Instead, his first instinct was to use the attacks as political fodder to advance his own failed domestic agenda to impose a \u201ctravel ban.\u201dShortly after the attacks, while people were still trying to get their minds around what exactly had happened in London, Trump tweeted:\u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201dTrump is pulling America back and pulling America down. We are now witnessing the incredible shrinking America, and it\u2019s a sad sight to behold.Advertisement"}

What gives?The amazing thing about this latest story is that Trump never took the time to figure Comey out \u2014 the person with perhaps the most capacity in all Washington to do him harm. Once again we see that this alleged dealmaker isn\u2019t even as crafty as your average entry level secretary.Trump could have fired him on Day 1, and Democrats would have been in no position to cry foul because that\u2019s what Hillary Clinton might well have done, too. Or he could have kept Comey in place \u2014 and in check \u2014 by keeping him where he was, with his somewhat tarnished reputation, and putting up with him much as Bill Clinton put up with Janet Reno.But of course Donald couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone. He had to twitch, he had to tweet \u2014 and then he had to offer to testify under oath.Here\u2019s someplace where I think we can part company: Congress is back. The Republicans would allegedly like to accomplish something. If Mitch McConnell asked for your advice, what would you tell him?U.S. corporations park an estimated $2.5 trillion abroad to avoid U.S. corporate tax rates. Cut the rate; repatriate the capital to the U.S. of A. Abolish the alternative minimum tax that nearly everyone agrees has long since outlived its intended purpose of catching a handful of wealthy tax avoiders. Bring down the top rates and simplify the code. You know, the same formula that got us out of the malaise of the \u201970s even as interest rates went up.I know you\u2019ll agree on all the above!I don\u2019t see any reason to lower the top income rates. If you want to stimulate the economy, give a cut to the people on the lower end. They\u2019ll actually go out and spend the difference.But here\u2019s what happens when Republicans talk about tax cuts. They try to come to some agreement on tax reform and fail. Then they announce they\u2019ll balance the cuts with reductions in spending, which are almost always directed at the people least able to cope. And even those usually fail, at which point all you have left is a down-and-dirty tax cut for the rich plus a larger deficit.Given the crowd we\u2019ve got now, any tax bill will be the worst case scenario. Best case scenario is that they do nothing but the minimum housekeeping measures necessary to keep the government open.Sorry. Please continue.Or are politics today a new Western Front, 1917, each of us in our respective ideological trenches, no allowance anymore even for a Christmas truce?This is mostly the Republicans\u2019 fault. Every recent attempt at bipartisan cooperation \u2014 remember immigration reform? \u2014 was shot down by the far right. And if Obamacare is a mess it\u2019s in large part because the Republicans pulled out of the administration\u2019s efforts to get a bipartisan bill out of the Senate.There\u2019s actually a Platonic dialogue that gets into some of this stuff, but I think that would take us a little far afield!I have faith that the next generation will be used to Twitter-based political discourse and ready for a less crazed dialogue. Meanwhile, I plan to blame everything on the Republicans.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201cPeople all across New Jersey are demanding change, and I am here to change things,\u201d Mr. Murphy told a crowd to loud cheers on Tuesday night at his election night party at a hotel in Newark. \u201cFour more years of Chris Christie-style politics won\u2019t make New Jersey the state where we draw the line against Donald Trump. But we will.\u201dFor Mr. Murphy, who served as ambassador to Germany under President Barack Obama, the primary victory caps a yearslong effort to lay the groundwork for a run in which he invested more than $16 million of his own funds and vastly outspent his rivals. It elevates his unique brand of progressive policies and fiscal reform in a state facing a potential crisis over unfunded pensions and underfunded schools, combined with the highest property taxes in the country. It also vaults him into the national dialogue as an early Democratic response to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.For Ms. Guadagno, the general election will be a gauge of how a moderate Republican who has not quite embraced the language or policies emanating from Washington can navigate the shifting political waters and chart a conservative course that is still somewhat separate from the White House\u2019s.In her victory speech, Ms. Guadagno repeated her conservative pledge to shrink government but also tried to show a more moderate side by calling for environmental protections and for equal rights for minorities and for people \u201cno matter their sexual orientation.\u201d She spoke of the need to move \u201cforward\u201d and \u201cwith hope.\u201d\u201cWe will make New Jersey better for everyone together,\u201d she said inside a catering hall in West Long Branch.As she previewed the coming race, she sought to establish a sharp contrast, portraying herself as the candidate of \u201cMain Street\u201d and labeling Mr. Murphy as the candidate of \u201cWall Street.\u201d\u201cIf we elect Phil Murphy governor of the State of New Jersey, the only person who will be able to live in the State of New Jersey will be Phil Murphy,\u201d she said as the crowd broke into shouts of \u201cMoneybags!\u201dWithin the state, the general election will offer New Jersey voters a stark choice. Mr. Murphy, who proclaims himself \u201cproudly progressive,\u201d has indicated that he is willing to defy the Trump administration\u2019s positions on climate and immigration, as well as raise taxes on some wealthier residents and introduce a public bank, funded by taxpayers, to assist an economic recovery in the state.Ms. Guadagno campaigned largely on a vow to conduct a full review of state spending, pledging to cut waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling state government and reinvest the savings into issues like bolstering infrastructure, offsetting high property taxes and addressing shortfalls in school funding.On Tuesday, she laid out a bold promise to back up her economic platform.\u201cI promise to you, if we do not in our first term lower property taxes in the State of New Jersey, I will not stand for re-election,\u201d she said.Mr. Murphy drew some comparisons to an unpopular New Jersey governor who worked at Goldman Sachs, Jon S. Corzine, but his deep pockets allowed him to dominate the primary election, with a seemingly never-ending barrage of digital ads and a robust television campaign that set him apart from a cast of rivals not well known to many voters.Both Jim Johnson and John Wisniewski offered more progressive platforms than Mr. Murphy, and they increasingly tried to portray his aggressive spending as \u201cbuying the nomination.\u201d But Mr. Murphy, who enjoyed the backing of every county Democratic chairman and chairwoman and all the powerful unions in the state, often overpowered their message.In his remarks, Mr. Murphy checked off the progressive promises that have been the bedrock of his campaign as he vowed to chart a distinctly new course for the state. He spoke about the importance of providing adequate funding for public education, protecting young undocumented immigrants, raising the minimum wage and legalizing marijuana.\u201cWe are going to prove that you can be both pro-growth and progressive at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat fairness isn\u2019t just a nice idea but a critical tool for making our economy work for everyone.\u201dMs. Guadagno had to overcome the negative connotations of being the No. 2 state official to Mr. Christie, who is leaving office with some of the lowest approval ratings in recent history. Her main opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, sought to brand her early and often as a continuation of the current administration, repeatedly referring to the \u201cGuadagno-Christie administration\u201d in ads and campaign literature.As political exhaustion over last year\u2019s polarizing election mixed with apathy in New Jersey, voters rarely appeared enthused by any candidate during the primary campaign, often ignoring coverage and seemingly tuning out what many anticipated would be a contested race. Turnout remained low, and the two early front-runners were able to maintain their poll positions, an indication that the political power of the county leaders who endorsed them remains strong.Mr. Murphy hit that note repeatedly on Tuesday night.\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d he told his supporters. \u201cWhat Donald Trump does in Washington matters right here in New Jersey.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting from West Long Branch, N.J.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modi\u2019s Push for a Hindu Revival Imperils India\u2019s Meat Industry", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Mr. Chaturvedi has spent the past two months watching the local economy collapse. And now he is beginning to worry.Of the 10 slaughterhouses and meat-processing factories operating in March on the stretch of road he patrols in Meerut, seven have shut down, putting much of the local population \u2014 10,000 people, by his estimate \u2014 out of work. Migrant workers have packed up. Factory owners are defaulting on bank loans.What alarms him most, he said, is the government\u2019s recent announcement of stringent new regulations effectively banning the sale of cattle \u2014 a category that includes buffaloes as well as cows \u2014 for slaughter. The rules threaten to all but cut off the supply of animal products for the lucrative leather and buffalo meat industries, which together account for about $10 billion in annual exports. In April, exports of buffalo meat were down by 11.4 percent over the previous year, bringing an abrupt halt to years of double-digit growth, according to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority.Three years into Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s term, the two agendas that were woven together in his 2014 campaign \u2014 economic development and Hindu cultural revival \u2014 are becoming more difficult to reconcile, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which was India\u2019s top meat-producing state. Mr. Chaturvedi has concluded that the government does not intend to clean up the meat industry but to eliminate it.\u201cThese policies are headed toward a disastrous situation,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of using state machinery to shut down the industry in a roundabout way, why not shut it down openly?\u201dFar-right Hindu groups have long opposed the slaughter of cows, which are considered sacred in Hinduism. Only recently have they expanded their opposition to include the vibrant buffalo trade, claiming that cows are smuggled into the slaughterhouses to be killed.New regulations on cattle slaughter, issued last month by the central government, would go significantly further, requiring any person selling livestock to produce a written guarantee that the animals will not be slaughtered. The new regulations were almost immediately challenged in state courts, with petitions arguing that measures on animal cruelty are subjects of state law, not federal law.If they survive, the regulations would sharply diminish the supply of animals for the leather and buffalo meat industries, which were surprised by the announcement. The changes would also strip small farmers of the opportunity to sell livestock when they are too old to work or give milk, a safety net in hard times.Mr. Jagannathan argued that the regulations would damage the governing party in the critical regions of India\u2019s south and the northeast, where beef is commonly eaten, and he warned Mr. Modi against \u201callowing rogue elements to circumscribe its political future by repositioning the party as a violent champion of Hindutva,\u201d a movement that seeks to establish Hinduism as India\u2019s intrinsic culture.For Mr. Chaturvedi, the veterinary inspector, the crackdown initially seemed promising.He had hoped that a large, efficient government slaughterhouse would replace the constellation of small, unsanitary facilities. But after helping to shut down seven meat-processing plants \u2014 in one case, because the smell emanating from inside \u201cseemed to indicate that there were cow parts there\u201d \u2014 he realized that no new permits were being issued.\u201cIf the authorities do not find any other loophole, they get the city development authority to say that so-and-so factory did not get its building plan passed, so let\u2019s shut it,\u201d he said. Twenty-six slaughterhouses have been shut down for violations since March, said Rahul Bhatnagar, the chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh. Forty-one remain open. No new licenses have been issued. \u201cThere is something called the law of the land,\u201d Mr. Bhatnagar said. \u201cIt has to be implemented, then, whatever effect it may have.\u201dThe economic blow has rippled through Muslim villages surrounding the meat factories. Villagers said they had sharply cut back their expenses \u2014 cutting out meat, eating only one meal a day and forgoing the usual celebration of Ramadan, which began late last month.Many said they were terrified of being singled out by Hindu vigilante groups, who patrol villages hoping to spot and punish anyone found illegally slaughtering cows.Membership in the far-right vigilante organization founded by Mr. Adityanath, the Hindu Yuva Vahini, has expanded rapidly in the western part of the state, with the organization adding 2,000 new members in the past two months, said Anoop Rastogi, who leads its Meerut chapter.\u201cWe are totally committing our time to building the Hindu base,\u201d Mr. Rastogi said.Altaf, a Muslim who uses only one name, said that four of his brothers who lost their factory jobs had tried to make some money by selling a buffalo. They were going to sell it to a dairy farm, he said, but then the buffalo broke its leg, and they slaughtered it for meat. A Hindu neighbor called the police, who said it was cow\u2019s meat.The men in the family have gone into hiding, he said, and they leave the family home locked from the outside, to avoid frequent visits by the police.\u201cThere is an atmosphere of fear in the village,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst the jobs were taken away, and then the brothers, too.\u201dMurtaza, 40, who also uses only one name, said that his family used to earn money by selling buffalo but that after he was stopped by a cow-protection gang several weeks ago, he had been too frightened to try it anymore. His son, who is 20, lost his factory job in the licensing crackdown.The family is celebrating Ramadan by drinking milk, because they are unable to afford mangoes, fruit juice or meat, as in previous years.\u201cWe are scared of this Hindu government,\u201d said his wife, Rehana Khatoun. \u201cThe meat business is predominantly run by Muslims. What does this step mean? That they want to drive us out. To render us jobless, or drive us out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Offering Populism, Minus the Free Candy", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPopularity ContestThe thing about populism is it usually involves doing things that are popular.This is something that European nationalists and Latin American strongmen have long known. When they come to power, they aim to deliver concrete benefits to their supporters, even at the cost of their nations\u2019 long-term fiscal health.President Trump has delivered on some of the things he promised supporters on the campaign trail: He has appointed a conservative Supreme Court justice; begun more aggressive enforcement of immigration laws; and directed his appointees to slash regulations on fossil fuel and other industries. But in terms of spending, Mr. Trump has embraced the austere preferences of congressional Republicans, even when that approach has contradicted his campaign promises.To see the tension, consider an alternate history of the Trump administration: one in which the president embraced the lessons of right-wing populists from abroad.It\u2019s Jan. 21, and Mr. Trump is newly sworn in. Shrugging off the snark from liberals on Twitter about the size of his inauguration crowds, he directs his staff to go to work on the Make America Great Again Act of 2017.They dust off the policy white paper that the campaign staff issued months earlier, and spend their time on Capitol Hill trying to cobble together a coalition to pass a bill aimed at helping the people who put Mr. Trump in the White House.The bill has lots of money to fight the opioid epidemic and to invest in communities left behind by the modern economy. There is money to prop up troubled health insurance markets, so that Mr. Trump can say he has replaced Obamacare with something better. There are a trillion dollars for public infrastructure \u2014 not some complex tax credit that favors revenue-generating projects in affluent areas, but the brute force of government dollars to build roads and bridges in every corner of the nation.Each project, of course, will have a big sign crediting the Make America Great Again Act with a big photo of Mr. Trump flashing a thumbs up.To help keep conservatives and business interests on board with all that spending, the bill loosens environmental laws and bank regulations, among other policy goodies that make C.E.O.s\u2019 hearts flutter. But it wouldn\u2019t achieve a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate unless packaged with those aforementioned goodies that appeal to Democrats. Maybe it could increase the minimum wage, but also include a tax credit for companies that hire American workers to offset the cost to businesses.The government would pay for it all with higher deficits. Free candy for everyone! The cost \u2014 in the form of higher interest rates and perhaps inflation \u2014 would come later. It\u2019s the kind of bill that anti-spending conservatives would complain about, and die-hard anti-Trump liberals would resist. Cobbling together a coalition to pass it may not be easy, but a savvy deal maker could plausibly attract enough bipartisan support to make it law \u2014 and in the process maybe build trust for further deal making down the road.My MAGA Act is hypothetical, but in the weeks after the election, the idea that Mr. Trump would emulate European and Latin American populists \u2014 who are often staunch defenders of social welfare programs and enthusiasts of showy public works projects \u2014 seemed plausible.Right-wing parties in Europe often exhibit antagonism to immigration, but position themselves as defenders of public spending domestically. The National Front in France, for example, which recently lost the presidential election, was calling for lowering the retirement age and increasing welfare benefits to go along with its message opposing immigration and the European Union.Based on the early policy moves of the Trump administration, spending too much on goodies for his working-class supporters isn\u2019t something Americans need to fear. He has chosen a very different path \u2014 even when following through would be more consistent with his campaign promises.During the campaign, Mr. Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. As president, his budget would cut the Social Security disability insurance program and Medicaid.Despite the president\u2019s talk of a bold $1 trillion infrastructure plan, there is not yet an actual legislative proposal, and the approach the administration has described relies heavily on tax credits to encourage private investment. That tends to limit the scope of any projects to those that can generate revenue to pay off investors.On taxes there is also no legislative proposal yet, and the bullet points the administration has released imply much bigger advantages for corporations and the highest earners than for middle-class Americans.On top of it all, Mr. Trump has set a political tone that makes it harder to change course and find bipartisan support for something like the MAGA Act later. Instead of putting Democrats in a jam by proposing something broadly popular, the president has made it easy for them to be united in opposition.Essentially, for all of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric, he has outsourced his domestic policy agenda to the austere, spending-averse congressional Republicans.It\u2019s hard to know how much of this reflects the president\u2019s actual policy preferences versus the ideology of the people he has surrounded himself with, and how much of it is simply the path of least resistance. Letting House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, set the domestic policy agenda is easier than doing it yourself.But given the choices the Trump administration has made, the president\u2019s sub-40-percent public approval ratings are understandable. It may be a tautology to say that doing popular things will make a politician more popular, but it\u2019s one the president may just want to remember.Advertisement"}

And several of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims either relied on dubious data or distorted research reports.Mr. Trump\u2019s argument started with a faulty premise \u2014 that emissions reductions under the Paris agreement are compulsory \u2014 even though at one point he acknowledged they were voluntary.\u201cThe United States,\u201d he said, \u201cwill cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.\u201dIn announcing his decision to exit the Paris accord, President Trump scorned the Green Climate Fund. Does the United States contribute an outsize share?The president referred to a published study to claim that the climate pact would result in \u201cas much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025,\u201d of which 440,000 would be in manufacturing. By 2040, he said, the losses would balloon to 6.5 million industrial jobs, or $3 trillion in lost economic output, or about $7,000 in reduced income for the average household.Economists argue that the projected job losses in the study assume the American economy will not use innovation to adapt to the new regulations. Apple, Mars, and Unilever are among companies that have said complying with the Paris agreement would open markets and generate jobs.A raft of studies \u2014 from environmental organizations, Citibank, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \u2014 argue that a failure to mitigate the effects of climate change could cost the economy trillions of dollars.\u201cChina and Europe have become world leaders on the path toward green development already,\u201d said Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, \u201cand will strengthen their position if the U.S. slips back at the national level.\u201dTo dramatize the unfairness of the agreement, Mr. Trump asserted that it allows China, the world\u2019s largest polluter, \u201cto increase these emissions by a staggering number of years \u2014 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years.\u201dUnder China\u2019s pledge, emissions would indeed continue to climb until 2030, and then begin declining. But as its consumption of coal slows, China is on pace to beat that target.Its government has pledged to generate 20 percent of its energy from nonfossil fuel sources by 2030, a formidable goal that will require the Chinese to install at least 800 gigawatts worth of solar, wind and nuclear energy capacity \u2014 a process that is already underway.\u201cThe agreement doesn\u2019t eliminate coal jobs,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.\u201dBecause the Paris accord is nonbinding, it has no direct effect on coal consumption in the United States. The coal industry is in long-term decline because of cheaper alternatives, such as natural gas and renewable energies, along with stricter pollution standards imposed by the Obama administration. Mr. Trump has moved to lift many of those restrictions, and he would be free to do so, even under the Paris agreement.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?\u201cTiny, tiny amount,\u201d he said, holding his thumb and index finger together to drive home the point.But that assertion does not accurately reflect the M.I.T. research.Mr. Trump saved particular vitriol for the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program under which richer countries transfer funds to poorer ones to help them mitigate the effects of climate change.\u201cNice name,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we\u2019re already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven\u2019t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.\u201dThe United States has pledged $3 billion to the fund, which is the most of any country in aggregate terms. But it is far from the only contributor, and on a per-capita basis, it is not the highest. Sweden has contributed $581 million, which works out to a little less than $60 per person, six times the amount the United States is pledging per capita.Even operating outside the Paris accord, Mr. Trump insisted that the United States would be an environmental exemplar. \u201cWe\u2019ll be the cleanest,\u201d he promised. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the cleanest air. We\u2019re going to have the cleanest water.\u201dMoreover, even after recent reductions, America\u2019s carbon emissions per capita remain significantly higher than those of China or India \u2014 countries that Mr. Trump branded as the world\u2019s big polluters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Unfazed as Federal Reserve Nears Plan to Shed Bonds", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve, which holds more bonds than any other investor, is planning how to shed some of them starting this year. And no one is too worried about it.The Fed is expected to announce in the near future a plan to gradually reduce its $4.5 trillion portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, the final step necessary to conclude the stimulus campaign it conducted after the financial crisis.The unveiling could come Wednesday, after a two-day meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, when the Fed is expected to announce it will raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point, to a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent.It also helps that the Fed has indicated that it plans to move very slowly. Analysts expect that the Fed might initially reduce its holdings by $10 billion a month \u2014 which would put it on pace to complete the normalization process in about 30 years.Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, offered the \u201ctentative conclusion\u201d in an April speech that \u201cwe appear less likely to face major market disturbances now than we did in the case of the taper tantrum,\u201d the name often given to the sell-off in mid-2013.The Fed, which held less than $900 billion in assets a decade ago, staged a series of bond-buying campaigns in the aftermath of the financial crisis, often described as quantitative easing. The Fed wanted to further reduce longer-term interest rates, but it had already lowered its benchmark interest rate to near zero.Buying bonds reduced the supply available to investors, increasing competition so investors had to accept lower interest rates. The Fed, and some outside economists, argued that the purchases modestly reduced borrowing costs on mortgages and commercial loans, contributing to the gradual revival of economic activity.Fed officials now say they expect to start reducing those holdings this year. The retreat is expected to reinforce the effects of the ongoing increases in its benchmark rate: higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, some outflow of money from the stock market into bonds, and some strengthening of the dollar.Among outside economists, there is a range of views about the effects of the reduction. Some who doubted the benefits of the program expect the retreat to be similarly inconsequential. Others think the Fed\u2019s analysis is in the ballpark. Still others worry that the Fed could roil financial markets.The Fed does not plan to reduce its balance sheet to the precrisis level. The most basic reason is that demand for dollars has increased, and the Fed supplies that demand by purchasing securities. Currency in circulation has nearly doubled over the last decade, from $774 billion in May 2007 to $1.5 trillion last month. At the current rate of growth, the Fed projects currency in circulation would reach $2.8 trillion by 2027.The Fed also acquires securities to provide reserves to the banking system. Before the crisis, the Fed\u2019s control of interest rates depended on keeping those reserves at a minimum level in normal times \u2014 on average, about $15 billion. But those balances soared in the aftermath of the crisis as the Fed pumped money into the financial system. Banks now hold about $2.2 trillion in reserves.In his recent speech, Mr. Powell contrasted the Fed\u2019s current approach, which he said \u201cis simple to operate and has provided good control over the federal funds rate,\u201d with the old system, which he described as complex and unwieldy.He said the Fed had not decided whether to keep the new system. But his comments and those of other influential Fed officials have fostered an expectation that the Fed will maintain it. If the Fed does so, the level of reserves will remain above its precrisis level, and that means the Fed\u2019s balance sheet will be larger, too.John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said he still expected that in five years, the balance sheet would be \u201cmuch smaller than today.\u201dBut others think the reduction could end up being quite small.The mechanics of the Fed\u2019s retreat are more certain. The Fed plans to reduce its holdings without selling securities. That is possible because some of the securities mature each month.Analysts estimate about $280 billion in securities will mature during the remainder of 2017, and another $650 billion will mature during 2018.By gradually reducing the amount it reinvests each month, the Fed can gradually reduce its investments while avoiding potentially disruptive sales.Some analysts expect the Fed to wait until December; some say September. There is also a range of predictions about the pace of the retreat.The Fed said in May, in an account of its most recent policy meeting, that it expected to publish a schedule for the entire process. It will reduce purchases by the same amount for three months, and then increase that cap each quarter.The plan is orderly on paper, but it assumes the continuation of what is already an unusually lengthy economic expansion. If the economy weakens, the Fed could pause.It might even see the need to once again expand its balance sheet.An earlier version of this article misstated the Federal Reserve\u2019s projection of the amount of currency in circulation by 2027. At the current rate of growth, the Fed projects the currency in circulation will reach $2.8 trillion, not billion.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Save Libya From Itself? Protect Its Oil From Its Politics", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTRIPOLI, Libya \u2014 For years now, opportunists of all stripes, local and international, have tried to profit from Libya\u2019s seemingly endless instability by disrupting its oil production.I am the N.O.C.\u2019s chairman, and these allegations are false. But they shine a bright light on Libya\u2019s current tragedy. Since the revolution of 2011, the country\u2019s oil and gas resources have been held hostage to both its fractious politics and power struggles in the Middle East.State institutions have been devastated since 2011. Two camps claim to constitute the country\u2019s legitimate leadership. One, based in Tripoli, is backed by Western governments, Turkey and Qatar; the other, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Russia.Representatives of both camps reached an agreement in December 2015, acknowledging the House of Representatives, in Tobruk, as the country\u2019s official legislature; giving a strong consultative role to the previous parliament, the Tripoli-based General National Council; and creating an interim Government of National Accord to mediate between the two. But the deal has failed to bring much stability.Under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya was a classic petrostate, and it remains that today. Absolute dependence on oil and gas, which account for 95 percent of export revenues, has helped turn political infighting into a winner-take-all contest.The N.O.C. has also had to contend with assaults on its independence as a decision-making body. This spring the United Nations-backed Presidency Council, which oversees the Government of National Accord, issued a decree transferring to itself the N.O.C.\u2019s most important functions, such as the right to negotiate concession agreements with foreign companies or set the sale price of Libya\u2019s oil. The move was blocked by an appeals court in Benghazi, but we cannot discount the possibility of similar attempts in the future.The camp based in the east \u2014 a loose affiliation of federalists, the last elected parliament and the Libyan National Army \u2014 controls almost all the oil ports. Yet it cannot legally export oil because resolutions of the United Nations Security Council reserve that right to the Government of National Accord, based in Tripoli.Caught between those rivals, we at the N.O.C. intend to remain neutral until there is a single legitimate government we can submit to. In the meantime, the integrity of the N.O.C. \u2014 arguably the only institution today that can still function across the entire country \u2014 must be protected. The organization must not be split up. Its monopoly on oil and gas exports must not be broken.The mandate of Operation Sophia, the European Union\u2019s anti-smuggling mission, was recently extended for another year. Currently focused on the smuggling of people and arms in Libyan waters, the mission should be expanded to also cover oil smuggling and liaise with the N.O.C. to interdict rogue tankers.The N.O.C.\u2019s board, which comprises technocrats appointed by recognized governments soon after the 2011 revolution, should be insulated from arbitrary changes. Its investment and maintenance budgets must be guaranteed. It should be granted the power to negotiate new foreign investments so that it can reach its revenue goals and help stimulate the domestic economy.The N.O.C. expects that very soon oil production will reach one million barrels per day for the first time since 2013. With this milestone, we have the opportunity to build up our financial reserves and restart the economy, including by using oil-sector investment to help develop local industry.Ring-fencing Libya\u2019s oil sector from local and international rivalries would have an enormous impact on the country\u2019s prospects, both economic and political. It would de-escalate the current internal conflict. It would unlock the potential of oil as a driver of national regeneration. It would, in short, allow the country\u2019s resources to be put to work for their rightful beneficiaries: the people of Libya.Mustafa Sanalla is the chairman of the Libyan National Oil Corporation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Hunting in \u2026 Sweden", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate17 PhotosAN ATTIC APARTMENT NEAR THE CENTER OF STOCKHOLMOnce an attic used for storage, this two-bedroom, two-bathroom, roughly 2,500-square-foot space was converted into an apartment around 1970 and last renovated in 2013. It is on the seventh and eighth floors of a 1915 building with seven units on a quiet street in Ostermalm, a fashionable neighborhood just east of Stockholm\u2019s city center.The apartment has crisp white walls, oak floors, high ceilings and a terrace overlooking nearby rooftops. The front door opens onto a hallway that leads to a family room with a balcony and a staircase up to the main living area. The large upstairs living room has built-in bookshelves and large sliding doors opening onto a terrace. Up several steps to the left of the living room is a television room; on the right is an office with a skylight. Both the office and the family room downstairs could be used as bedrooms, said Jan Lundqvist, a broker with Residence, the Swedish real estate firm and Christie\u2019s affiliate that has the listing.Past the living room are the kitchen and dining area. A small hall leads to two bedrooms. One, the master suite, has a generous walk-in closet and an adjoining laundry room. As is typical in Sweden\u2019s older homes, Mr. Lundqvist said, the bedrooms share a bathroom. (A second bathroom is on the same floor near the entrance, by the stair landing.)MARKET OVERVIEWPrices are now about 50 percent higher than they were in 2008, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a bubble,\u201d he said of the market. \u201cBut it\u2019s very richly priced.\u201dRecently, however, the price increases have been slowing, Mr. Manner said. In 2015, prices rose 15 percent over the previous year; in 2016, that number fell to 10 percent. Home prices are now 7 percent higher than they were at this time last year, he said.He attributed this to several factors: Banks have become stricter about mortgage applicants\u2019 debt-to-income ratios; the government recently changed its mortgage amortization rules to require faster repayment schedules on new loans; fixed mortgage rates have risen slightly; and the novelty of the low rates has worn off.A continuing challenge, he added, is that there aren\u2019t enough new homes being built to meet demand, and the ones that are built don\u2019t suit the refugee population\u2019s need for small, affordable units.The most desirable areas in the city, agents said, are Djurgarden, a parklike area with well-appointed villas, and Ostermalm, where this apartment is. Lars Fogelklou, the chief executive and a founder of Residence, said that in Djurgarden, high-end apartments can sell for between 20 million Swedish krona ($2,312,640) and 100 million Swedish krona ($11,563,200). Agents said prices in Ostermalm range from between 3 million Swedish krona ($346,896) and 10 million ($1,156,320) at the lower end, and up to around 70 million Swedish krona ($8,094,240) or 80 million ($9,250,550) at the higher end, with a few properties reaching 100 million Swedish krona ($11,563,200).WHO BUYS IN STOCKHOLMMost of Stockholm\u2019s luxury home buyers are Swedish, some of them Swedes returning from abroad, agents said.Ms. Hallberg estimated that about 20 percent of her clients are from Switzerland, Germany, the United States, Britain and France. Over the past year, Mr. Fogelklou said, a few of his clients (about 5 percent) have been from China, Germany and the United States; a much larger share (about 40 percent) were expats returning to Sweden.BUYING BASICSClosing costs paid by buyers are minimal, he said. Buyers of houses pay a stamp duty of 1.5 percent of the transaction value and a land registration fee of 825 Swedish krona (if a company is the buyer of record, the stamp duty is higher). Apartment buyers pay neither of those fees; instead, they sometimes pay an administrative fee of about 1,000 Swedish krona to the building\u2019s association.Residential transactions are typically handled by a single real estate agent hired by the seller, he said. The commission paid by the seller is between 1.5 and 4 percent of the sales price, agents said, and transactions are typically done in Swedish krona.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSwedish; Swedish krona (1 Swedish krona = $.12)TAXES AND FEESA monthly fee of around $860, paid to the building association, includes building maintenance, a government fee and property tax, heating, water, sewage, limited cable, television and use of the garage, Mr. Lundqvist said. Rebecka Troeng, who is with the Swedish Tax Agency, estimated that the portion of the fee devoted to the property tax adds up to approximately 4,000 Swedish krona per year, or $463.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ketumile Masire, Who Shaped and Led a Vibrant Botswana, Dies at 91", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKetumile Masire, who as president of Botswana for nearly two decades helped transform his arid and destitute country into the envy of other African nations, died on June 22 in Gaborone, the capital city. He was 91.His death, at a hospital where he had been taken for surgery on June 16, was announced in a statement by his family.Mr. Masire (pronounced ma-SEE-ray) was an architect of Botswana\u2019s government after the southern African country gained independence from Britain in 1966, working alongside Seretse Khama, the country\u2019s first president. Mr. Masire succeeded Mr. Khama, who died of cancer in 1980, and he was elected in 1984, 1989 and 1994, serving until 1998.At the time of its independence, Botswana was listed by the United Nations as one of the world\u2019s least developed nations, with little running water or electricity, few paved roads and no public high schools. Beef was virtually the only export.The geographical challenges were great, too; in the landlocked country, largely made up of desert sand, farming was virtually impossible.\u201cWhen we asked for independence, people thought we were either very brave or very foolish,\u201d Mr. Masire was often quoted as saying.They got to work. Mr. Masire and Mr. Khama formed the Botswana Democratic Party, and Mr. Masire became the first minister of finance and the first vice president.About a year after Botswana became independent, the De Beers company made a mining discovery on the eastern edge of the Kalahari Desert that gave the country the glittering hope it needed: diamonds.But Mr. Masire and Mr. Khama saw to it that De Beers did not simply plunder Botswana\u2019s resources, as many big companies had historically done in Africa. Instead, De Beers entered into a 50-50 joint venture with the government.Today, diamonds are as synonymous with Botswana as cigars are with Cuba, accounting for more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s exports.Mr. Masire and Mr. Khama leveraged the newfound wealth to add schools, improve health care, build infrastructure and modernize farming. The development helped Botswana maintain stability through droughts and a slump in diamond prices in the 1980s. Tourism began to flourish, especially wildlife tourism.\u201cIt\u2019s a simple country, but he was not ashamed of that,\u201d she said.Botswana achieved the highest annual economic growth rate in the world and reached middle-income status among nations globally. As surrounding countries struggled with violence and corruption, Botswana became a model, often referred to as \u201cthe African exception.\u201dBut not everything was rosy. One delicate challenge for Mr. Masire was opposing apartheid in neighboring South Africa even while depending on the country economically. When South African guerrillas from the African National Congress set up a base in his country, he looked the other way. But in 1985, after South African forces raided Gaborone, destroying buildings and killing civilians, Mr. Masire was forced to eject the A.N.C.Another challenge in the 1980s was the rapid spread of the virus that causes AIDS. Though the government provided free treatment, Botswana continues to have one of the highest rates of H.I.V. in the world.Inequality between the rich and the poor also remained vast, despite Mr. Masire\u2019s efforts to close the gap by providing access to education, giving Botswana one of the highest literacy rates in Africa.Abdi Samatar, author of \u201cAn African Miracle,\u201d (1999) a book about the development of Botswana, said in a phone interview that Mr. Masire had been unusual among leaders for his humility and his recognition of his country\u2019s shortcomings.\u201cHe was a man who carried a big brain but who spoke softly and walked softly,\u201d Mr. Samatar said. \u201cHe was a different kind of politician than I have seen anywhere else in the world.\u201dQuett Ketumile Joni Masire was born in Kanye, Botswana, on July 23, 1925, to Joni Masire, a farmer, and the former Gabaione Kgopo. He spent his childhood as a herd boy but excelled in academics, winning a scholarship to the Tiger Kloof secondary school in South Africa.In 1946, after both his parents had died, he earned a teaching certificate and worked at the Kanye Junior Secondary School to support his younger siblings. When he saved enough money, he bought a tractor and taught himself dry farming.In 1958, he married Gladys Olebile Molefi, who died in 2013. They had six children, who survive him, as do 10 grandchildren and four siblings. Mr. Masire was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991.Mr. Masire was working as a journalist for the Naledi ya Batswana and African Echo newspapers when he first met Mr. Khama at a community meeting. The two had a symbiotic relationship: Mr. Khama had the vision for a democratic post-colonial Botswana, and Mr. Masire had the enthusiasm and community ties to rally support.Long after he stepped down as Botswana\u2019s president in 1998 \u2014 there were no term limits at the time, but Mr. Masire helped establish them \u2014 Mr. Masire was often asked how the rest of Africa could be more like Botswana. He would answer, softly, with thoughtful pauses, that the keys to success were government transparency, a resistance to corruption and a willingness to follow the rule of law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rejecting Popular Paris Accord, Trump Bets on His Base", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBut in Mr. Trump\u2019s calculation, withdrawing from the accord will be a political winner.The decision highlighted Mr. Trump\u2019s broader political gamble as he seeks to build a presidency that can succeed in midterm elections next year and, ultimately, in 2020 when he is up for re-election. It is a strategy predicated not on attracting new supporters, but on cultivating the narrower conservative base that delivered him to the White House.Not everyone in the White House agrees with this approach. But when it came to the Paris accord, Mr. Trump accepted the argument advanced by Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, that he must stick to his nationalist and populist roots or jeopardize his political future. Mr. Trump is not going to win over Democrats and most independents, Mr. Bannon maintained, so the imperative is to retain the voters who pulled the lever for him last year.This is a daring and risky strategy for a president whose job approval rating remains stuck around 40 percent in many polls. Most presidents seek to widen their support while in office, reaching out to the center \u2014 if not to the other party. Mr. Trump, however, is the first president in the history of polling to govern without the support of a majority of the public from the start of his tenure. In effect, Mr. Trump is doubling down on presiding as a minority president, betting that when the time comes, his fervent supporters will matter more, especially clustered in key Midwest states.\u201cThere is no question it helps Trump with his base,\u201d said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. \u201cTrump voters believe that the world is out to get us and that we would be the only country to live up to the accords. Therefore, America would lose and the rest of the world would laugh at us.\u201cObviously, it makes Clinton voters hate him even more, but from a political calculation standpoint, the White House does not and should not care,\u201d Mr. Bolger said.\u201cOf all the things he might do to solidify his base, withdrawing from the Paris agreement is pretty far down the list in importance, and for a president at 40 percent approval, it is hard to argue that solidifying his die-hards is his most critical need right now,\u201d said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster who has advised Hillary Clinton as well as environmental groups.Mr. Garin said the danger for Mr. Trump is that he might turn off the college-educated voters who turned to him in the late stages of last year\u2019s election. \u201cThese college-educated Trump voters do not want the United States to be isolated in the world,\u201d he said.Douglas E. Schoen, another longtime political strategist and Fox News contributor, said pulling out of the Paris accord would not produce jobs for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201cNot good for his base to be further alienated from Europeans, to appear separate, different and out of sync with the world,\u201d Mr. Schoen said.But Democrats have long pointed to surveys showing lopsided support for environmental action by government \u2014 only to discover that it does not necessarily win elections for them. Americans may favor rules intended to curb the emissions blamed for climate change and encourage the use of renewable fuels. But on Election Day, such issues are often not the determining factor in their decisions.\u201cThe first thing the American electorate is looking for is a focus on economic issues,\u201d said David Winston, a Republican pollster. \u201cThey want it discussed. They want a sense that it\u2019s a priority.\u201dMatt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, said Americans generally want to do what they consider the right thing, and therefore tell surveyors that the United States should combat climate change. But he said it was a meaningless question.\u201cThe follow-up is key,\u201d he said. \u201cKnowing the solution proposed is to price carbon higher or tax it, are you willing to pay more for your utilities and to fill your tank, or are you willing to shed U.S. jobs?\u201d\u201cIt becomes a political loser.\u201dSupporters of the Paris accord argue that the supposed political costs are exaggerated and the benefits are overlooked in the interest of scaring voters. They can point to some polls showing support even among Trump voters for some of the specific policies that have been promoted to curb climate change.By this reasoning, Mr. Trump can afford to lose voters in liberal California or on the East Coast and still eke out another Electoral College victory by focusing intently on what he sees as the needs of battleground states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that put him over the top last year even without the popular vote. What he cannot afford is to lose those who still stand by him.At least that is the bet. And it is a choice he will continue to face on other issues in the weeks and months to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can China Take the Lead on Climate Change? That Could Be Difficult", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the weeks before an autumn summit meeting in Beijing between the presidents of the United States and China ticked down, John F. Kerry, then the American secretary of state, tried to seal a deal on climate change.He invited China\u2019s senior envoy, Yang Jiechi, to a lunch at Legal Sea Foods overlooking the harbor in Boston, Mr. Kerry\u2019s hometown. Mr. Kerry noted that the harbor had once been badly polluted but that government efforts and regulations had rejuvenated it.With Washington now ceding global leadership on climate change and at least temporarily halting its partnership with Beijing, China may find it hard to fill the vacuum. Some of China\u2019s biggest strides in recent years came through joint efforts with the United States and their mostly friendly superpower rivalry on renewable energy.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.But the importance of Washington in laying the foundation for the Paris accord was evident, for example, in the negotiations between the United States and India, the third-largest emitter of greenhouses gases. Only after a series of meetings between Mr. Obama and Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, did India announce more ambitious climate commitments.\u201cReaching an agreement in Paris depended on the United States, China and a small group of key countries pushing each other to be ambitious in their targets and holding each other accountable,\u201d said Jonathan Finer, former chief of staff and director of policy planning at the State Department. \u201cThis same dynamic should have resulted in an ongoing effort to ratchet up the fight against climate change, which everyone knows is necessary to actually address it. The United States pulling out takes a lot of that pressure off.\u201dBut on Friday, Mr. Li and European leaders in Brussels failed, because of a trade policy dispute, to endorse a joint statement on climate change. The two sides made public affirmations in Berlin on Thursday and in Brussels on Friday to work with each other.Earlier, it was the United States, and not China, that pushed India to make commitments ahead of the Paris summit meeting, even if it was China that helped set an example for large developing nations in the announcement in 2014 by Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi. In 2015, Mr. Kerry took the unusual step of attending a trade fair in Mr. Modi\u2019s home state of Gujarat, India, in order to prod Mr. Modi on climate change policy and pave the way for a visit by Mr. Obama, who aimed to make the Paris agreement a top priority of discussion with Mr. Modi.\u201cThe talk of climate change actions is very important because energy reforms will inevitably hurt some vested interests,\u201d said Lin Boqiang, an energy scholar at Xiamen University who has advised PetroChina, the big Chinese oil producer. \u201cSuch talk has created favorable conditions for energy reforms, without which many things would have been impossible.\u201cFor instance, solar and wind subsidies were possible because the climate change agenda has forced policy makers to turn to a low-carbon economic model,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that China has a lot of coal and it\u2019s very cheap, so without climate change promises we wouldn\u2019t be talking about the low-carbon economy now, and industries such as that of electric cars would have faced more hurdles.\u201dMr. Lin added: \u201cChina is now No. 1 in the world in installed capacity of wind and solar power. This would not be possible without all the talk about climate change and a low-carbon economy.\u201d2016 is the hottest year on the historical record and the third consecutive record-breaking year, scientists say.Mr. Lin and other experts say such conflicts can be resolved in favor of clean energy if big countries, including the United States, keep up the global push on climate change. The retreat of the United States strengthens the positions of those who support wider use of fossil fuels, a stand that President Trump and a top adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, also take.Addressing climate change has also played a role in a wider economic debate in China. It has helped officials wanting to make the case that China needs to move from its carbon-intensive economic growth model based on the development of infrastructure to a more consumer-driven model, which would produce lower emissions. Here, too, the United States withdrawal weakens the positions of those officials and bolsters opponents of this more radical economic transformation.Alex L. Wang, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies Chinese environmental regulation, said that while Chinese leaders remained committed to the Paris agreement, \u201cthe headwinds on implementation of climate goals remain strong.\u201d\u201cCoal still accounts for 62 percent of China\u2019s energy consumption,\u201d Professor Wang said. \u201cMillions of jobs are still tied to coal, steel and other carbon-intensive industries. Powerful vested interests will continue to push for a slowdown in Chinese climate action. There will be a temptation to shift carbon-intensive activities to western China and abroad. Efforts to improve data quality and transparency are ongoing, but require political resolve and resources. The U.S. exit from the Paris agreement only helps those interests within China opposed to climate action.\u201d\u201cThe dynamic between the U.S. and China in recent years created a healthy competition on clean energy and climate change,\u201d he added. \u201cThat dynamic has already faltered as Trump has pulled back on climate action. A full exit from the Paris agreement will be a final nail in the coffin.\u201dHow proactive on climate change will China be? The Paris accord was written so that countries would push one another to make more ambitious commitments in the coming years, with the biggest emitters in the lead.\u201cI would hope that China would play a constructive leadership role and recognize that their partner the United States will be back at the table one of these days,\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the former United States special envoy for climate change in the Obama administration. \u201cAnd one of these days might be just a few years from now.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

{"Headline": "Sugar Talks May Hint at Trump Approach to U.S.-Mexico Trade", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The sugar barons of Florida, Alfonso and Jos\u00e9 Fanjul, have been equal-opportunity political donors for decades, showering largess on the campaigns of Democrats and Republicans alike to ensure that lawmakers will protect the American sugar industry.The brothers most likely had more on their mind than a sumptuous ball. Led by the Fanjuls, large American sugar producers and refiners were eager for the new administration to tackle some business left unfinished by the Obama administration: an agreement to control imports of Mexican sugar.\u201cIn Mexico everybody is looking at the sugar agreement because it\u2019s a thermometer of how things are going to be managed,\u201d said Juan Cortina Gallardo, the president of Mexico\u2019s sugar chamber, which represents refiners. \u201cIt\u2019s a politically sensitive and charged issue.\u201dThe sugar industry has been at the center of the most contentious trade issues between Mexico and the United States since Nafta was first negotiated in the early 1990s.Whatever the American sugar industry wrests from the negotiations will have effects that spread far beyond the cane fields of Florida and southeastern Mexico. The strands of the sugar story suggest just how intricate the weave of international trade can be.It is up to Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross to find a compromise that Mexican negotiators will accept; otherwise, he risks a trade war.And Mr. Ross must also balance the power of the sugar lobby \u2014 including his Palm Beach neighbors, the Fanjuls \u2014 against United States food manufacturers who argue that any deal that raises the cost of sugar will drive away jobs.But in his transition from billionaire investor to public servant, Mr. Ross has so far been listening to all sides, say people with a stake in the sugar negotiations.The Obama administration \u201ckicked the can down the road in order not to make a decision\u201d on sugar imports, said Paul Farmer, the president of CSC Sugar in New Canaan, Conn., who buys Mexican sugar to produce liquid sugar that competes with large refineries.Now, Mr. Farmer said, he has found \u201ca complete change in attitude to listening and wanting to understand\u201d what is at stake in the negotiations.Mr. Cortina agreed. \u201cWhat I have seen in the current administration is that Secretary Ross and the chief of staff have dedicated a lot of time to understanding the underlying issues,\u201d he said.When Nafta went into effect in 1994, the industry won special treatment that limited Mexican sugar imports for 14 years.\u201cThese guys have been punching above their weight politically,\u201d Mr. Cortina said, referring to sugar industry executives in the United States.In 2008, Mexico became the only country in the world with unrestricted access to the American sugar market. But when Mexican exports soared in 2013 after a bumper crop, American producers struck back, filing claims of unfair trading practices. The Commerce Department agreed, and prepared to assess punitive duties on Mexican sugar.\u201cOur industry is suffering tremendously,\u201d said Phillip Hayes, a spokesman for the American Sugar Alliance, which represents sugar farmers and refiners, including Florida Crystals.\u201cA refinery needs raw sugar in order to operate,\u201d he said. \u201cMexico has been sending in far too much refined sugar and starving the refineries of raw sugar.\u201dMarianne L. Mart\u00ednez, a spokeswoman for Florida Crystals, said the company was only asking the Commerce Department to enforce its earlier rulings against Mexico. \u201cWe are asking the U.S. government to hold Mexico accountable and require Mexican companies to follow U.S. law,\u201d she said in an emailed statement.For its part, Mexico\u2019s Economy Ministry has said that large American refineries are using the negotiations to lock in their own supply of Mexican raw sugar and eliminate all competition from Mexican refined sugar.\u201cEliminating access for Mexican refined sugar to the United States market is unacceptable,\u201d the ministry warned in a statement last month.Mexican officials face their own political pressure to come up with a strong agreement.\u201cIf you cave on sugar if you\u2019re Mexico, then what does that say about what you\u2019re going to do in Nafta negotiations?\u201d said Andrew I. Rudman, a former United States trade official, who is a managing director at ManattJones Global Strategies, a trade and investment consulting firm.Ildefonso Guajardo, the country\u2019s economy minister, said at a luncheon on Thursday with Mexican agribusiness owners that the sugar dispute was virtually the only issue he had been discussing with Mr. Ross. The \u201cfew but very powerful\u201d American sugar refiners had become angry, Mr. Guajardo said at the Mexico City event, because the 2014 agreements had not succeeded in steering enough raw cane sugar to their refineries.Mexican sugar cane is grown by 190,000 small farmers scattered across some of Mexico\u2019s poorest regions, and at harvest time, the labor-intensive work employs 450,000, making the industry a potent political force.Hanging over the negotiations is the threat that Mexico could retaliate against American exports of high-fructose corn syrup, which is a sugar substitute.\u201cIf we are to be cut off from the U.S. market, we are going to do our damnedest to cut off fructose coming into the Mexican market,\u201d Mr. Cortina said.The cane growers\u2019 union in Mexico on Friday placed an ad in one of Mexico\u2019s leading newspapers, accusing the United States of dumping fructose and warning the Mexican government against bowing to \u201cinterests and dictates\u201d of American producers.A claim of dumping fructose is already in the making.\u201cWhen the refineries accuse Mexico of dumping, then the logical thing is to accuse the fructose industry,\u201d said Enrique Boj\u00f3rquez, the founder of Sucroliq, a Mexican producer of liquid sugar.The Mexican government has blocked such complaints in the past, Mr. Boj\u00f3rquez said, because it was trying to preserve the accord with the United States. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t agree with is that we don\u2019t defend ourselves when American companies are doing damage in Mexico,\u201d he said.The prospect of a trade war is not an idle threat to producers of corn syrup, who have sold more than $3 billion of the sweetener to Mexico over the past five years. Mexico shut off corn syrup in the 1990s in an earlier dispute.\u201cIf it is an exchange of retaliatory blows, they are quite capable,\u201d said John Bode, president of the Corn Refiners Association.Other American industries are also watching the negotiations.Companies that produce candy and baked goods have already begun to move production offshore, where sugar is cheaper, and then send products back to the United States, said Bill O\u2019Connor, an agricultural expert at the Sweetener Users Association. \u201cWe are exporting our manufacturing because they can bring it in at no or low duty.\u201dTen senators wrote to Mr. Ross this past week warning that \u201cwell-paying American jobs would be jeopardized by any further restrictions on sugar imports, which only advance the narrow interest of domestic growers and large sugar companies.\u201d\u201cThere is no doubt about it that there is political pressure,\u201d said Mr. Farmer, the liquid sugar producer who goes up against the large sugar refiners. \u201cMy competitors have spent a lot of money in Washington over a long period of time.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article reversed the identifications of the Fanjul brothers.

{"Headline": "The False Premise Behind G.O.P. Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWith the Senate effort to upend Obamacare suspended for the Fourth of July holiday, there\u2019s a chance to step back and examine the assumptions behind Republicans\u2019 longstanding objections to the social safety net \u2014 as well as the flaws in those assumptions.From Ronald Reagan\u2019s invocation of a \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d to Mitt Romney\u2019s derision of \u201ctakers,\u201d to the House and Senate bills to cut taxes for the rich by taking health insurance away from tens of millions of people, the premise of incessant Republican tax cutting is that the system robs the rich to lavish benefits on the poor.But here is an essential and overlooked truth: As a share of the economy, federal spending on low-income people, other than for their health care, has been falling steadily since it peaked in 2011, after the Great Recession, and while it\u2019s still slightly above the long-term average, it is declining, according to a recent series of reports by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Spending has risen for Medicaid, which the Senate and House health care bills would slash. But the increase is not the result of generosity or waste. Much of it is from rising nursing home admissions as the population ages. Medicaid insures most nursing home residents \u2014 after they have exhausted their savings.Medical inflation, which usually rises faster than the general inflation rate, also pushes up Medicaid costs. But Medicaid is not driving that inflation. In fact, compared with privately insured care, Medicaid\u2019s costs have risen more slowly over the past decade and its costs per beneficiary are lower, partly because it has no profit margin.By using Medicaid to cover millions of previously uninsured people, Obamacare chose the most economical and efficient part of the health care system to achieve a historic reduction in the number of uninsured. And by using tax increases on the well-to-do to pay for expanded coverage, the expansion did not add to budget deficits.In the next decade, higher spending on low-income health programs is expected to be offset by lower spending on other low-income programs. So total federal spending on people struggling to get by is projected to hold steady.That is not lavish. And it is not an excuse for tax cuts that deprive tens of millions of people of health insurance.Advertisement"}

Pittsburgh, they point out, is the wrong metaphor anyway: The former steel hub has spent the last 30 years trying to remake its economy in precisely the mold that climate advocates envision.Once among the most polluted cities in the country, Pittsburgh today is increasingly rebuilding around greener medical complexes, research universities and tech offices. In place of steel mills, the city now has its own Google outpost and test track for autonomous cars. The U.S. Steel Tower, the tallest building in town, now bears the name of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The local renewable energy industry employs 13,000 people, according to the city.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto said Thursday, is an example of how environmentalism can also mean economic development. It was a very different message from the one the president delivered hours earlier at the White House, where he warned that the international climate pact would cost the American economy too much.\u201cTo some, Pittsburgh is still the 1975 Pittsburgh, a steel mill town based on heavy industry, still struggling through the post-Depression,\u201d said Mr. Peduto, a Democrat, when asked why he thought the president had singled out his city (particularly in light of its reliably liberal politics). \u201cI also think it\u2019s the first city they thought of that started with a \u2018P\u2019.\u201dEnding the day at Cappy\u2019s Cafe, a tavern he frequents in the city\u2019s Shadyside neighborhood, Mr. Peduto said he was angry enough when he heard about the president\u2019s plans to withdraw from the climate agreement. When he heard that the president had mentioned Pittsburgh, he said, he was \u201clivid.\u201dBy citing the city, Mr. Trump seemed to be reaching for a stereotype of a coarse industry town where workers would cheer the return of coal (and where they might also scoff at the comparison to Paris). But many are no longer waiting for old industry to return. And Pittsburgh has joined with international cities, Paris included, to commit to reducing its own emissions.If anything, the city today stands to be affected more by Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to repeal the Affordable Care Act than by his promises to revive the steel and coal industries.\u201cThe economy looks more like Boston than it does Gary, Ind.,\u201d said George Fechter, who was chief executive of the McGowan Center for Artificial Organ Development at the University of Pittsburgh. He called the president\u2019s comments \u201cabsolutely outrageous,\u201d adding \u201che doesn\u2019t represent the people of Pittsburgh.\u201dPittsburgh\u2019s transformation from a steel town to a center of \u201ceds and meds\u201d has been visible even on the city\u2019s streets.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I watched soot come off the buildings \u2014 the buildings turned from black to beige while I lived there,\u201d said Richard Florida, an urban economist who has championed the emerging knowledge economy in cities like Pittsburgh. He taught at Carnegie Mellon and lived in the city from the late 1980s through the early 2000s. \u201cIt\u2019s not the typical down-in-the-dumps Rust Belt town. It\u2019s still in the midst of a transformation, but it looks like it has turned a corner.\u201dPerhaps no place has come to represent Pittsburgh\u2019s shift from heavy industry to high tech more starkly than the East Liberty neighborhood, which has seen almost unrelenting redevelopment. The neighborhood now has a Whole Foods; Pittsburgh Google moved its office here from Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s campus in 2010; and the Ace Hotel opened in an old Y.M.C.A. building in 2015.Shashank Laxminarayan Suresh, 28, a native of India who works in the data science department at the health care provider Highmark, said he had found Pittsburgh friendly and welcoming. He lives in the city\u2019s Squirrel Hill neighborhood.\u201cThere is so much opportunity in the technology fields here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to help you here, and I have never had anyone who was unkind to me because I am an immigrant.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s a very happening place!\u201dHadley Pratt, 26, works at BoXZY, a 3D printing company housed in a former Westinghouse building, once a mainstay of Pittsburgh\u2019s heavy industry. While meeting a friend for a drink at the Ace Hotel, she said Trump\u2019s picture of Pittsburgh was incomplete.\u201cTo me it was a big slap in the face,\u201d she said. \u201cPittsburgh is still industrial, but there\u2019s a lot of innovation here. None of it was done through Trump-type policies.\u201d If she were to give Trump a tour of the \u201creal\u201d Pittsburgh, Pratt said she\u2019d take him to \u201cindustrial areas revitalized through progressive organizations; we have that all over Pittsburgh.\u201dState Representative Dan B. Frankel, a Democrat who represents part of the city, used Facebook to post an old photograph of a smog-laden daytime Pittsburgh.\u201cTrump apparently wants to take Pittsburgh back to this,\u201d Mr. Frankel wrote. \u201cWe won\u2019t go back.\u201dThe city\u2019s concerns about pollution become a powerful political force around the time of the 1940 photograph that Mr. Frankel posted. In the 1940s, Mayor David L. Lawrence used an inaugural address to declare that he was \u201cconvinced that our people want clean air.\u201d An air quality ordinance was approved in 1949.But even with Pittsburgh widely viewed as a place on the rise today, residents still find themselves trying to distance and disentangle their city\u2019s reputation from its past.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since the steel industry collapsed,\u201d said Sam Williamson, a labor organizer who is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. \u201cPittsburghers have for a very long time \u2014 probably because of our early 20th-century history, which sticks in people\u2019s minds \u2014 taken very seriously the challenges of maintaining a strong economy while not destroying our environment at the same time. Those two things are not irreconcilable.\u201dMr. Williamson allowed that Mr. Trump\u2019s comment could have been \u201ca case of careless alliteration,\u201d but he also questioned the president\u2019s approach to environmental and economic policy.Michael Huber, a driver for Uber in the city, voted for Mr. Trump. If he had the president in his car, he said, he\u2019d drive him through the Fort Pitt Tunnel to catch the view of the city, and show him around Oakland where the universities are.\u201cDiversity in Pittsburgh is enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a coal town.

I really took to economics and what it meant for addressing issues like inequality and poverty in the U.S. and overseas. I declared my major in economics and went on to get a Ph.D. at Stanford University.What is your policy experience?I spent a year as a Brookings economic policy fellow at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and 20 years at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. I was also a consultant to organizations that include the Rockefeller Foundation and the U.S. Department of State.What is your research process?It depends on the study or report we\u2019re doing. Some may involve a literature review, some involve analyzing large data sets, like the U.S. census, and sometimes we create our own data through interviews, surveys or other ways of getting information from the field.How has the field changed since you started?Economics has become more quantitative. It gives us new tools for evaluating the effectiveness of programs, as an example, but it doesn\u2019t always allow us to determine motive or understand why something occurs.What would you tell young people wanting to enter the field?To get quantitative and writing skills. Whether you end up doing a lot of quantitative work yourself or not, you need to understand what the tools can and cannot do, and be able to interpret the findings for the layperson and the policy maker who wants to know the bottom line or why they should trust one study over another. I\u2019d tell them policy work can be discouraging at times. Don\u2019t give up your idealism, and try to find the best way to promote your ideas.Vocations asks people about their jobs.

{"Headline": "The Decline of the Baronial C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Corporate giants once had all-powerful chiefs with domains to match. But activist investors and technological change are remaking the executive suite.Supported byFAIRFIELD, Conn. \u2014 They bestrode the business world, or at least the suburban corporate campus, like a colossus.Sitting behind burnished wooden desks, in glass-walled corner offices like the one Jeffrey R. Immelt occupied at General Electric\u2019s former headquarters here, a select group of American chief executives were once more akin to statesmen than businessmen.G.E. moved out of this sprawling Skidmore, Owings & Merrill-designed emblem of 1970s corporate modernism in favor of smaller, humbler digs in downtown Boston last year. And last week, Mr. Immelt unexpectedly announced plans to retire after 16 years in the top job, amid a sagging stock price and pressure from activist investors.General Electric is just the latest storied name in corporate America to show its leader the door. Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, had been in the job for less than three years when he was fired in late May. Two weeks earlier, Mario Longhi of U.S. Steel abruptly stepped down.With these departures, the American era of the baronial chief executive, sitting atop an industrial dominion with all the attendant privileges, is drawing to a close.It is one consequence of a transformed economic landscape in which many of the mega-corporations that defined 20th-century commercial life are confronting a host of new business and technological challenges. These changes \u2014 in corporate leadership, on boards and across Wall Street \u2014 are recasting the very idea of industry in America.\u201cThe C.E.O. with a big office, a tenure of 10 or 20 years, in a suit and tie, is becoming a thing of the past,\u201d said Vijay Govindarajan, who served as G.E.\u2019s chief innovation consultant in 2008 and 2009 and now teaches at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business.Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit from G.E. is particularly telling, given the company\u2019s reputation as a training ground for the future chief executives of other companies. He tried to change G.E., yet couldn\u2019t react quickly enough to the forces affecting companies like his.These include the rising power of activist investors, who buy up stakes in companies and then demand changes. Activists are now hunting much bigger game, demanding double-digit annual earnings growth in a stagnant economy. Or else.That deal also shows how the digital age has upended the competitive landscape, pitting companies in vastly different industries against one another.\u201cWho ever thought Ford would be competing with Google?\u201d said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who has studied corporate leadership for decades. \u201cBut they are, and Mark Fields wasn\u2019t moving fast enough.\u201dBoards, too, have changed, evolving from country-club-like collections of the same familiar faces into a much more diverse and demanding constituency.To be sure, the money is better than ever. And pockets of unbridled ambition and occasional excess remain, especially in Silicon Valley, where Apple\u2019s new $5 billion spaceshiplike headquarters opened in April.But for most of the Fortune 500, the unquestioned power and perks, the imperviousness to criticism from the likes of shareholders, and the outsize public profile that once automatically came with the corner office have gone the way of the typewriter and the Dictaphone.\u201cThese people were bigger than life, and I saw it up close,\u201d said Kevin Sharer, a former chief executive of Amgen who worked as a top aide to Mr. Immelt\u2019s legendary predecessor at G.E., Jack Welch. \u201cThey were a combination of chief executive, statesman and rock star. They were unassailable.\u201dA Naval Academy graduate, then an officer, before joining G.E. in 1984, Mr. Sharer said the only place that evoked a feeling of power comparable to the long hallways and corner offices of Fairfield in its prime was aboard the fast attack nuclear submarines where he once served as chief engineer.\u201cWe had the confidence, the swagger, and we felt like we had unlimited industrial potential,\u201d he said. \u201cCould we buy RCA or NBC? Of course we could. I\u2019m not complaining, but this is absolutely not the case today.\u201dAs Amgen\u2019s chief executive in the spring of 2009, Mr. Sharer visited the White House repeatedly to meet with Obama administration officials as they designed what would become the Affordable Care Act. He also played a key role in getting fellow pharmaceutical industry chiefs to support the legislation.Now retired and teaching at Harvard Business School, Mr. Sharer said he would never do that today, as wading into bitterly partisan public debates offers little upside for corporate leaders, and risks damage to their company\u2019s reputation.As a result, while companies in many ways have more economic and political power than ever, \u201cchief executives now shy away from weighing in on the policy level or broader societal issues,\u201d Mr. Sharer said. \u201cThey\u2019re more focused on running their companies.\u201dThere are exceptions. Besides Mr. Immelt\u2019s outspokenness on the climate issue, last year Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck called out \u201cbad actors\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry for exorbitant price increases. Timothy D. Cook of Apple challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed immigration restrictions in January.Still, Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit leaves a void at the intersection of business and public policy, along with the retirement this year of Douglas R. Oberhelman, the Caterpillar chief who led both the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers.\u201cIf you start fooling around in Washington with the Business Roundtable or writing op-eds, activist investors will ask what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Useem said.\u201cI don\u2019t see him stepping into that role,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep his head down and focus on the numbers.\u201dAt Exxon Mobil, it\u2019s referred to as the God Pod. On the 11th floor of Procter & Gamble\u2019s headquarters in Cincinnati, there was Mahogany Row. And while the official name of the executive wing at G.E.\u2019s Fairfield headquarters was E3, inside the company it was known as Carpet Land.And no wonder. From the Persian rugs that lined the hallways to the plush wool floor covering in Mr. Immelt\u2019s office and private conference room, the carpets created the hushed atmosphere of a monastery or library.\u201cIt was so quiet, you could feel the energy drain out of you,\u201d said Ann Klee, the G.E. executive who oversaw the move to Boston and the development of its new headquarters there.What these executive aeries all shared was an Olympus-like sense of remoteness, authority and defined hierarchy.At G.E., even in Carpet Land, office size grew in lock step with rank, and the biggest corner space was reserved for the chief executive. Not only did Mr. Immelt have his own bathroom, but his two administrative assistants had a private bathroom and a pantry.The abundant perks \u2014 in G.E.\u2019s case, two helicopter pads, a shoeshine station and an executive dining room linked to the kitchen below by dumbwaiters \u2014 fed the sense of exalted status. At the same time, faster economic growth and rising earnings camouflaged the cost of these indulgences.With G.E.\u2019s profits and shares soaring in the 1980s, Mr. Welch oversaw the construction of a private 28-room hotel known as the Guest House to serve visiting executives and others, with no expense spared on the parquet floors, wood-burning fireplaces and a Steinway piano, which was left behind when the company moved out.\u201cNothing was off-the-shelf,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Brien, a 19-year G.E. veteran who helped supervise the Fairfield facility. \u201cWith Jack Welch, everything was custom and the operation was five star, spot on.\u201dAlmost 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001 and Mr. Immelt took over, G.E. shares have never regained their 2000 peak. So while Mr. Immelt successfully steered the company through a near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis, refocused it on its industrial roots and shed its ancillary businesses, it became a natural target for activist investors.One of those was Nelson Peltz, a onetime corporate raider who relied on Michael R. Milken\u2019s junk bonds for financing back when Mr. Welch was building his Guest House. Mr. Peltz has come a long way since then, having scored big wins forcing laggards like Heinz and Wendy\u2019s to improve their performance, and he acquired a $2 billion stake in G.E. in 2015.G.E.\u2019s chief communications officer, Deirdre Latour, denied that activist pressure was a factor in Mr. Immelt\u2019s decision to retire. \u201cSixteen years is a long time,\u201d she said.But at 61, Mr. Immelt is four years younger than Mr. Welch when he stepped down, and joins a long list of otherwise respected executives whose stately succession plans were seemingly interrupted by impatient investors.\u201cC.E.O. tenure is down from the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, and the G.E. situation is a reflection of that,\u201d said Jason D. Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201cWithout this outside pressure, it\u2019s likely Jeff Immelt would have served out his term and retired at 64 or 65.\u201dNow other chief executives are feeling the same pressure, including Mary T. Barra of General Motors. \u201cShe\u2019s being pulled in different directions,\u201d Mr. Schloetzer said, noting that G.M.\u2019s shares have barely budged in the last two years, even as the broader stock market has soared.If Ms. Barra can\u2019t turn things around in 12 to 18 months, Mr. Schloetzer said, she could share a fate similar to that of Mr. Fields at Ford.Indeed, Mr. Fields\u2019s defenestration was more shocking in many ways than Mr. Immelt\u2019s slow-motion fade, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management.\u201cHe\u2019s the poster child for what\u2019s happened to the C.E.O. job,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cUntil last month, people thought dynastic family capital like the Ford family was the solution to rampant short-termism. I\u2019m sorry Ford forgot that recipe.\u201dHow did activist investors acquire such outsize power over publicly traded companies?\u201cWith fewer public companies out there, any one of them is more likely to become a target of interest for one hedge fund or another,\u201d Mr. Slaughter said.At the same time, activists are getting more, well, active. More than 300 American companies were targeted by these investors in 2015, up from just over 100 in 2010, according to Mr. Useem of Wharton. They\u2019re also becoming more successful at winning board seats, as fewer companies stagger their board elections over three-year cycles.What\u2019s more, chief executives have less internal latitude. In 2001, more than half of new C.E.O.s also assumed the position of chairman when they took over. By 2016, only 10 percent occupied both roles, according to an analysis by Strategy&, the strategy and consulting arm of PwC.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the C.E.O. running the board too,\u201d said Gary L. Neilson, a principal with Strategy&. \u201cNow the C.E.O. has a boss.\u201dBoards themselves have changed, Mr. Sonnenfeld added. A few decades ago, a Pittsburgh-based giant like U.S. Steel would draw board members from a local pool of business and community leaders.\u201cThere was a downside in terms of cronyism, mutual back-scratching and a hesitance to criticize,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positive was that they were anchored in their communities and they invested in them. Now, for C.E.O.s, all the constituencies have changed.\u201dSo while boards are still willing to dole out huge golden parachutes to C.E.O.\u2019s, even if they fail, they\u2019ve become much more generous with money than they are with additional time.The glaring exception to the trends outlined by Mr. Sonnenfeld is in the technology sector. But in many ways, these firms are the exception that proves the rule, because they play by different rules.Facebook also has a multi-class stock structure that effectively guarantees that the founder Mark Zuckerberg will retain control even as he sells shares. And on this point, the company offers no apologies.The staggering profitability of the tech giants provides their leaders with more than a little of the swagger the industrial executives once possessed.In 1990, the revenues of Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers totaled $250 billion while they employed 1.2 million people, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.Silicon Valley\u2019s top three companies in 2014 had almost the same revenues before adjusting for inflation \u2014 $247 billion \u2014 but with 137,000 employees, they required a work force just one-tenth the size.That kind of efficiency adds up to huge profits, soaring stock prices and few complaints from investors. Or as Brooks C. Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown, put it, \u201cIf your stock is doing well, your job is safe.\u201dIf the old quarters for G.E.\u2019s top brass were akin to a pedestal, the new ones are more like a fishbowl. At G.E.\u2019s interim headquarters in Boston, and in the permanent one set to open next year, the offices for top leaders have glass walls that enable them to see out and, in turn, let employees see in.They are also much smaller. In Fairfield, a handful of senior G.E. leaders and their assistants occupied 44,000 square feet in the executive wing. Now the same group shares a total of just 7,800 square feet, less space than in the big mansions many C.E.O.s inhabit in places like Greenwich, Conn., or the Bay Area.\u201cIt has a much more collaborative feel, and the glass replicates the transparency of working together,\u201d said Ms. Klee, the G.E. executive. \u201cThe Fairfield campus was beautiful, but it lacked the spark you feel here. It\u2019s a different time, and we like the power and energy and creativity that comes from mixing people together.\u201dG.E.\u2019s 66-acre Fairfield campus was purchased for $31.5 million last fall by Sacred Heart University, according to Michael J. Kinney, the school\u2019s senior vice president for finance and administration.\u201cThere\u2019s not as big a need for corporate headquarters like this any more,\u201d said Mr. Kinney, who as a Kraft executive once worked in a similarly spectacular setting in the Taj Mahal-like General Foods building in Rye Brook, N.Y. \u201cThose were the days.\u201dMr. Kinney has big plans to convert the old offices into classrooms, a business incubator space and a computer engineering center, among other things. Students will be trained in hospitality at the former Guest House.As a result, the university has kept the campus in pristine condition since the last G.E. executives left. \u201cThe only things missing are the Persian rugs and the artwork,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who now serves as Sacred Heart\u2019s director of facilities.\u201cIt\u2019s such a different vibe with the kids all here,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who added that he\u2019s still getting used to people strolling around the manicured grounds rather than quietly shuttling between hushed offices.Walking around the pub in the Guest House Mr. Welch built, Mr. O\u2019Brien confessed to a little nostalgia for G.E.\u2019s glory days in Fairfield. \u201cCan\u2019t you see just see Jack running the world from here in \u201987 or \u201988?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Global Investors See Fresh Worries in an Old Problem: China", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 While investors have been preoccupied with President Trump and chaos in Washington, nerve-rattling elections in Europe and the uncertainty created by Federal Reserve policy and Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, a once-familiar \u2014 and possibly bigger \u2014 risk to global markets has been bubbling in the background.China.Two years after China first set off investor alarm bells worldwide with a stock market crash, a slumping currency and concerns over rising debt, many investors have put those concerns out of mind. Shares of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong and other places outside the mainland have surged to their highest levels since the crash, beating markets in other developing countries, as investors embrace China\u2019s thriving technology and consumer scenes.Even in China, where the long-downtrodden domestic stock market still suffers from investor skepticism and government meddling, local shares enjoyed a run-up for much of this year before falling back recently.\u201cThe vast majority of consensus opinion is that China is fine,\u201d said Kevin Smith, the founder and chief executive of Crescat Capital, an asset management firm based in Denver that is betting against Chinese investments. Referring broadly to China\u2019s debt and other financials, he added: \u201cPeople are really not looking at the potential bubble. The bubble just keeps getting bigger.\u201dChina\u2019s fate has major sway over global markets, given its longtime role as a growth driver \u2014 and investors may soon have a bigger stake in the ups and downs of Chinese stocks.MSCI, an investment advisory firm that compiles stock indexes that are widely tracked by mutual funds and pension funds around the world, is considering adding domestic Chinese stocks to a key benchmark. The company is scheduled to unveil its decision on Tuesday.Investors have already received some encouragement to jump in. In March, Goldman Sachs recommended investors increase their holdings of Chinese stocks, citing improved economic growth, stable policies and other positives.But some investors have started to worry again. In a survey released by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, fund managers in May named China the biggest potential source for an unpleasant surprise for global markets for the first time since January 2016. The investor services firm Moody\u2019s also downgraded China\u2019s sovereign credit rating last month, its first such move in 28 years.Debt is a central theme to these rising concerns. To shore up its economy, China resorted to pumping up credit, adding to an already mountainous pile of debt. According to the Bank for International Settlements, that debt reached 257 percent of its gross domestic product at the end of 2016, slightly above the same measure in the United States, and significantly higher than the 184 percent for emerging economies over all.But what worries economists most is the pace at which it has mounted. At the end of 2007, China\u2019s debt stood at only 152 percent of G.D.P.The research company Capital Economics, in a June report, warned that debt in China \u201chas risen far faster than in almost any other major economy on record,\u201d and that its continued buildup was the \u201cbiggest risk facing emerging Asia.\u201dOver the last several months, the government has tried to reverse this trend, helping slow credit growth. But that, too, has rattled financial markets in China. The fear is that tighter credit could both slow growth and make it more difficult for highly indebted firms to pay back those loans. In a sign of strain, the interest rates charged by banks when lending to one another have been rising.Policy makers in China appear more worried, too. In late May, the government indicated it would tighten its grip on the renminbi, stepping back from a longstanding commitment to allow market forces a greater role in its valuation.Mr. Smith of Crescat said he believed global investors remained too complacent about the China threat. Calling China \u201cthe largest macro bubble in our lifetime,\u201d he said the situation had \u201calready gone beyond what global financial watchdogs claim are levels where other countries historically have gotten into trouble.\u201dMr. Smith has arranged his portfolio with these fears in mind. He said he was shorting China equity funds. (When investors short, they are making financial bets that the price of something is going to fall.) And though such positions have subtracted from his returns so far this year, he has doubled down.Just since May, he has shorted individual Chinese companies listed in New York, including the e-commerce companies Alibaba Group and JD.com and the search engine specialist Baidu, which he argues are more exposed to China\u2019s shaky financial sector than many investors realize.Investors may steer clear of China until the uncertainty about its heavy debt \u2014 and the government\u2019s will and ability to handle it \u2014 clears up.\u201cThe biggest crisis tends to happen when people are not looking, when the government is not trying to tackle the risk,\u201d said Jian Shi Cortesi, who oversees the Asian equities portfolio at the asset-manager GAM, based in Zurich. \u201cSo far they are managing it quite well. But the market is always scared if they cannot manage it. \u201dNot all China watchers are quite so nervous. Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist in Hong Kong at AXA Investment Managers, which has more than $800 billion under management, said investors should see the current effort to bring down leverage as a positive for the economy\u2019s future health.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m not all that concerned,\u201d Mr. Yao said. Policy makers, he added, \u201care managing the situation quite carefully.\u201dThere is also some confidence among China analysts that politics will keep the country\u2019s currency and stock markets on track in the coming months. This year, a major Communist Party conference will take place. To avoid any undue surprises, policy makers are likely to do whatever they can to prevent drastic shifts in asset values before the meeting.It is unclear whether MSCI, the stock-index compiler, will broaden global access for Chinese stocks. It has rejected adding China\u2019s domestic shares for three consecutive years, citing regulations that hamper an investor\u2019s ability to sell shares and take funds out of the country. The Chinese authorities have introduced some measures to address these issues.Mr. Yao of AXA said he believed that Chinese regulators had opened up enough access to domestic markets to win over MSCI. But even he does not see that translating into an immediate rush into Chinese stocks, given China\u2019s problems.\u201cLong term, we are fairly cautious as well,\u201d Mr. Yao said. \u201cPeople already know there is no easy out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "India, Once a Coal Goliath, Is Fast Turning Green", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIndia\u2019s plans were cited by American critics of the Paris climate accord as proof of the futility of advanced nations trying to limit their carbon output. But now, even as President Trump pulls the United States out of the pact, India has undergone an astonishing turnaround, driven in great part by a steep fall in the cost of solar power.Experts now say that India not only has no need of any new coal-fired plants for at least a decade, given that existing plants are running below 60 percent of capacity, but that after that it could rely on renewable sources for all its additional power needs.The sharp reversal, welcome news to world leaders trying to avert the potentially deadly effects of global warming, is a reflection both of the changing economics of renewable energy and a growing environmental consciousness in a country with some of the worst air pollution in the world.What India does matters, because it is the world\u2019s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China and the United States. And its energy needs are staggering \u2014 nearly one-quarter of its population has no electricity and many others get it only intermittently.With India\u2019s power needs expected to grow substantially as its economy continues to expand, its energy use will heavily influence the world\u2019s chances of containing the greenhouse gases that scientists believe are driving global warming.Much attention at the time of the signing of the Paris agreement was focused on the role President Barack Obama played in pushing India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, to sign. In doing so, Mr. Modi committed India to achieving 40 percent of its electricity capacity from nonfossil-fuel sources by 2030.Less understood was Mr. Modi\u2019s longstanding personal commitment to taking India in a greener direction. That has been strengthened in recent years by growing evidence that a greener path makes political and economic sense as well, says Harsh Pant, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based research organization.\u201cModi\u2019s constituency is the middle class, and the middle class in Indian cities is choking on pollution,\u201d Mr. Pant said. \u201cModi knows climate change is good politics. Climate change makes sense to Modi because he believes it as it is good economics and politics.\u201dEqually important is the startling drop in the price of renewable energy sources. Many energy experts say renewables are poised to become a less expensive alternative to coal within the next decade.It based that prediction on the remarkable drop in the cost of solar power. In approving proposals for new solar power plants, the Indian government seeks bids from prospective builders who compete to pledge the lowest price at which they anticipate selling power.Five years ago, the lowest bid came in at 7 rupees, or 11 cents, per kilowatt-hour. In early May, the lowest bidder came in at less than half of that price, or 2.44 rupees per kilowatt-hour, a little under 4 cents, experts here say.The latest bid makes solar power less expensive than coal, which sells for about 3 rupees per kilowatt-hour.The cost of lithium ion batteries, the gold standard in solar power storage, has fallen significantly, Mr. Turner said, largely because of economies of scale. Where the price was about $1,000 per kilowatt-hour more than five years ago, it is now $273 and dropping, Mr. Mathur said.The price needs to fall to $100 per kilowatt-hour for renewable energy to be comparable in price to coal, Mr. Mathur says. Mr. Turner thinks that will happen far sooner than the year 2030, which his group had been predicting.\u201cTo be blunt, the success of this has been bigger than I certainly realized,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cThere were people who were optimists, and it\u2019s the optimists who have won out.\u201dNew Delhi had long argued that it was hypocritical of Western nations that have burned fossil fuels for centuries to ask Indians to sacrifice their growth to cope with the effects. But the Modi administration has set ambitious targets for a greener Indian future.The government pledged in 2015, when the country\u2019s electricity capacity from renewables was 36 gigawatts, to increase it to 175 gigawatts by 2022.\u201cThat\u2019s rather ambitious,\u201d Rahul Tongia, a fellow at Brookings India, said. \u201cThe targets are there. The vision is there. The question is: \u2018Is it going to happen? How?\u2019\u201dMr. Mathur says that even if India falls short of those ambitious goals, just coming close will have a huge impact on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the world and pollution within the country.\u201cEven a year and a half ago, I didn\u2019t expect we would go out on a limb and say electric vehicles are a public policy goal for us. It is truly exciting,\u201d he said in an interview.Besides reducing the choking pollution in India\u2019s cities, moving to electric vehicles also makes sense because the country has excess generation capacity in the underused coal-fired plants and is too heavily reliant on petroleum imports, which present a geopolitical risk.\u201cThere has for a very long time been a push to reduce the growth in imports,\u201d Mr. Mathur said. \u201cThis is one of those perfect policy opportunities, with short-term and long-term benefits.\u201dNavroz Dubash, a fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, cautions that even though India is likely to meet its additional energy needs in the future from renewable sources, that does not mean India is about to stop burning coal tomorrow.\u201cIt is important not to draw from this that India\u2019s tryst with coal is necessarily done,\u201d Mr. Dubash said, \u201cjust that there are signs it will end sooner and at a lower level than expected.\u201dThis is hopeful news for the world, said Mr. Tongia, because the only way for the world not to grow too warm is for \u201cdeveloping countries, especially India, to do more, to come in lower than budget, to do their unfair share.\u201dAnd, Mr. Tongia said, \u201cthe good news\u201d is that India has decided that it is in its interest to do its \u201cunfair share.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when India\u2019s government lowered its target for coal production. It was in May, not June.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

To all scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States, I want to say that they will find in France a second home.\u201d\u201cI can assure you,\u201d Mr. Macron added, \u201cFrance will not give up the fight.\u201d He capped off his English remarks with a twist on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan: \u201cMake our planet great again.\u201dChina made it a point to say it would stay in the accord, while Mr. Macron and the leaders of Germany and Italy issued a joint statement expressing \u201cregret\u201d and rejecting Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that he would renegotiate the deal.\u201cWe therefore reaffirm our strongest commitment to swiftly implement the Paris Agreement, including its climate finance goals, and we encourage all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Trump, in a Rose Garden address, said he wanted better terms for the United States. \u201cWe are getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that\u2019s fair. And if we can, that\u2019s great.\u201dBut Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations official who led the negotiations, said his remarks underscored a lack of understanding of how international agreements work. Under the accord, the United States cannot even submit its intention to withdraw until November 2019, after which the process would take a year.\u201cYou cannot renegotiate individually,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a multilateral agreement. No one country can unilaterally change the conditions.\u201dOther reactions were more blunt. The prime minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, called the American decision \u201ca brutal act.\u201dMary Robinson, former president of Ireland, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision had turned the United States into \u201ca rogue state.\u201d Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for climate, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision had \u201cgalvanized us\u201d and promised that \u201cthis vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership.\u201dIn his address on Thursday, Mr. Trump also took aim at the Green Climate Fund, designed to help poor nations deal with the havoc of climate change, calling it a scheme to redistribute wealth. Ms. Figueres described the fund as a \u201cpolitical message\u201d of help from rich countries to poor countries that have done little to wreck the atmosphere. Countries decide how much they want to give, and former President Barack Obama, pledged last year to contribute $3 billion.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?The secretary general of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called Mr. Trump\u2019s move \u201ca major disappointment\u201d and while he said nothing specifically about a renegotiation, suggested that countries and businesses all over the world had already made advances based on the agreement.\u201cThe transformation envisaged in the Paris Agreement is already underway,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe Secretary-General remains confident that cities, states and businesses within the United States \u2014 along with other countries \u2014 will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low-carbon, resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity.\u201dVictoria Tauli-Corpuz, the United Nations special envoy for indigenous people, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision would punish those who were least to blame and the most vulnerable.\u201cWe are already seeing climate change destroy lives, livelihoods and entire communities,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWhile indigenous peoples are often the first to feel these effects because of where we live, the entire planet will suffer as a result of history\u2019s largest emitter retreating on climate change.\u201dBefore the announcement, United Nations envoys from rich and poor countries alike said they were sticking to the agreement, with or without the United States. New diplomatic alliances were forming, with Europe, India and China pledging to uphold their end of the deal.Premier Li Keqiang of China, in Berlin for meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Thursday that his country remained committed to the fight against climate change and to participating in international efforts for a greener world.China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, stands to gain international credit for standing by the Paris Agreement, but it would not be able to fill the void on its own if the United States abandoned the treaty.She pointed to future cooperation between Brussels and Beijing, making clear the similar intention in Europe to move ahead with potential partners to fill any vacuum created by Washington\u2019s absence.Ms. Merkel and India\u2019s leader, Narendra Modi, pledged their support for the climate accord during meetings in Berlin on Wednesday.After his meetings in Berlin, Mr. Li will head to Brussels for a summit meeting with European Union leaders. They are expected to announce a number of measures deepening joint cooperation on climate protection.The United States has emitted more planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other country. Now it is walking back a promise to lower emissions.\u201cThe international community may expect China to play a leading role,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my view, China doesn\u2019t have the capacity to single-handedly play the role of global hero. Instead, we\u2019ll need to work closely with the European Union and the Basic countries,\u201d he said, referring to a negotiating bloc that includes Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\u201cCollective leadership will be more important,\u201d he said.The one exception to the chorus of criticism on Thursday came from Poland, whose economy is heavily dependent on coal and whose conservative government has been a vocal critic of European climate policies.Grzegorz Tobiszowski, Poland\u2019s deputy minister of energy, commended President Trump\u2019s for his decision as he was signing an agreement on developing a new hard coal-fired power unit in Jaworzno, a city in southern Poland and one of the most polluted regions in Europe.Yet even some of Washington\u2019s most reliable allies warned that the United States would find itself isolated on the international stage.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain expressed her disappointment in a telephone call to Mr. Trump, according to a statement from her office. In the call, Ms. May reaffirmed her government\u2019s commitment to the agreement, according to the spokesman.At United Nations headquarters in New York, Several Western diplomats said they could not fathom why the White House would join the tiny clique of nations \u2014 like Syria and Nicaragua \u2014 that had not signed the accord. The last time the United States\u2019 standing had fallen so low was during its invasion of Iraq, several said.\u201cHumanity is at a fork in the road,\u201d said Kai Sauer, the ambassador from Finland. \u201cOne hundred and ninety countries going on one path, and the United States, Syria, Nicaragua going on another? It seems a bit strange. This definitely also changes how we are looking at the United States.\u201dAlready, the United States is likely to miss the climate-related pledges that it made just last year because of policies set in motion by the Trump administration. So who can make up the difference? Perhaps the biggest surprise comes from India, which just a couple of years ago insisted that it needed to burn much more coal in order to lift its people out of poverty.Since then, India has sharply slowed the expansion of its coal-fired plants, and although coal use will most certainly rise, according to experts, the Indian government has said that in another 10 years, it may not need to build any more coal plants at all.Navroz K. Dubash, a climate change expert with the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, said planned coal projects were struggling to obtain financing in India because of uncertainty over the regulatory environment, and most were unlikely to get off the ground.Solar and wind power prices have fallen sharply, making them far more competitive sources of energy for a poor country. And India has said it aimed to sell only electric cars by 2030.After the White House announcement, Lavanya Rajamani, a professor at the center and colleague of Mr. Dubash, called Mr. Trump\u2019s claims baffling: \u201cStating that the Paris Agreement hamstrings the U.S. while allowing India and China to increase their emissions is baffling,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe Agreement allows every country to choose its pledge tailored to its national circumstances.\u201dAn article on Friday about reaction to President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord attributed a quotation incorrectly. It was Lavanya Rajamani, a professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi \u2014 not her colleague Navroz K. Dubash \u2014 who said, \u201cStating that the Paris Agreement hamstrings the U.S. while allowing India and China to increase their emissions is baffling. The Agreement allows every country to choose its pledge tailored to its national circumstances.\u201d The article also referred incorrectly to comments by President Emmanuel Macron of France. In criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, Mr. Macron spoke in French before switching to English, not the other way around.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to plumes seen rising from a German power plant. They were plumes of water vapor, not smoke.An earlier version of this article misstated the date of the Kyoto Protocol. It was signed in 1997, not 1992.Somini Sengupta reported from the United Nations, Melissa Eddy from Berlin and Chris Buckley from Beijing.

Although, I was not fully aware of what this meant at age 7, there are no words to describe the feelings that flooded over me when my family landed at Miami International Airport, when I realized that we were here to stay. The process of being accepted as a refugee into the United States is a nightmare. It took us 10 months of exhausting interviews, paperwork and medical tests. After fleeing Baghdad, and spending a year as illegal refugees in Jordan, that moment meant everything. It breaks my heart that in 2017, there are some trying to steal this moment from countless individuals whose promise of a new life will be broken \u2014 families no different from mine, who deserve a second chance but who won\u2019t get one. President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration is not merely illegal and unconstitutional, but also heartless and discriminatory.Under the newest draft of President Trump\u2019s executive order that is meant to \u201cprotect the nation from foreign terrorist entry,\u201d citizens from the affected countries \u2014 Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya \u2014 will be subjected to a 90-day ban on travel to the United States. It should be noted that while Mr. Trump\u2019s ban covers these countries, which have produced exactly zero people linked to terrorist attacks that have killed Americans since 1975 to 2015, the ban does not cover countries like Turkey, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, with which the Trump family has business interests and whose citizens have been linked to terrorist attacks that have killed Americans. In addition to that, terrorism by Muslims as opposed to American Christian lone gunmen accounts for just one third of 1 percent of all murders in the United States.But let\u2019s take a step back from the politics of it all. Children may die, families will be separated. These are the world\u2019s most vulnerable that we are turning our backs on. What about the tired, poor and huddled masses yearning to breathe free? A few weeks ago when returning to the United States from Dubai, my family was selected for a \u201crandom security check.\u201d This one was more thorough than ever. I had to hold back tears as everyone in line passed while they were dissecting my bag like I was some sort of criminal. My crime? The American passport that I carry says that I was born in Iraq. My father asked the man why the security check was taking so much longer than usual. The man replied simply with \u201cAmerica first,\u201d but how do you put America first when you are destroying the very values it was founded upon?Works CitedBoard, The Editorial. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban Is Cowardly and Dangerous.\u201d The New York Times.

Independent Digital News and Media, 01 Mar. 2017. Web. 03 Apr. 2017._________There are over four million people living in the five permanently inhabited island territories of the United States. The residents of these territories \u2014 Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and Puerto Rico \u2014 are Americans who follow the Constitution, serve in the U.S. military and vote in presidential primaries. However, unless citizens establish an official residency in a U.S. state (and vote by absentee ballot or travel to their state to vote), they cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections or receive any substantial representation at a national level. It is time for the U.S. to stop infantilizing its territories and to grant them voting and other rights equal to the mainland states.The Supreme Court decision that denied equal rights to the territories was made over 100 years ago. Not only was the verdict intended to be temporary, but it was also made by the same justice who approved the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson. The ruling denies territories rights outlined in constitutional amendments because the territories are \u201cinhabited by alien races\u201d unable to understand \u201cAnglo-Saxon principles.\u201d This blatantly discriminatory decision is still used today against U.S. territory citizens fighting for equal rights.Inequality for the territories is also prevalent in Congress and bureaucracy. All U.S. territories elect representation into the House of Representatives; however, their Congressmen have no voting power on legislation. Guam and American Samoa specifically receive unfair treatment from the government despite their overwhelming large military enrollment. One-eighth of Guam\u2019s population is enrolled in the U.S. military and American Samoa has \u201cthe highest rate of military enlistment in the U.S.,\u201d yet citizens in both territories do not vote for their commander-in-chief, have adequate representation in Congress, or receive equal veteran benefits to mainland citizens.It is even more difficult to acquire the right to vote in American Samoa because American Samoans, unlike other territory residents, are not born U.S. citizens. They are instead called \u201cnationals\u201d to accommodate their \u201ccultural distinctiveness.\u201d In order to vote, American Samoans must move to a U.S. state and become naturalized as if they were immigrating from another country. This process costs \u201calmost $700\u201d and includes tests in English, U.S. history and civics. The naturalization process is comparable to poll taxes and literacy tests \u2014 forms of voting discrimination outlawed by the 24th Amendment \u2014 and further highlights unjustifiable bias of the U.S. government against its territories, simply because of cultural differences.It is time for the U.S. to acknowledge its disrespectful and isolating treatment of its territories and give their neglected citizens the rights they deserve.Works CitedMurriel, Maria. \u201cMillions of Americans Can\u2019t Vote for President Because of Where They Live.\u201d PRI\u2019s The World, 1 November 2016.Ponsa, Christina Duffy. \u201cAre American Samoans American?\u201d The New York Times, 8 June 2016.Savage, David G. \u201cSupreme Court Rejects Citizenship for American Samoans.\u201d Los Angeles Times, 13 June 2016.\u201cU.S. Territories: Last Week Tonight With John Oliver (HBO).\u201d YouTube, uploaded by LastWeekTonight, 8 March 2015._________Climate change is a threat to every young person on our planet. It is vital that schools teach about the climate-caused tragedies that are occurring globally and how to combat climate injustice. Fortunately, some school districts are taking steps to ensure that this is done. In 2016 the Portland, Ore., school board unanimously passed a resolution supporting the teaching of climate justice.In the New York Times article, \u201cSetbacks Aside, Climate Change is Finding its Way into the World\u2019s Classroom,\u201d Alexander Leicht of Unesco states \u201c[to slow climate change] we need an overall change of mind and a change of action that relates to everything that we think and do.\u201d Education can provide this essential change in perspective that will ultimately help the generations to come.However, actions like Portland\u2019s are still relatively rare. There are too many cases of state legislatures, school districts and teachers actively denying the fact that climate change is real, or bowing to pressure from community members and corporations who value short-term profits over long-term climate stability.Even when teachers and school districts want to teach the facts about climate change, many classroom resources discount the science behind climate change. Holt McDougal\u2019s textbook, \u201cModern World History,\u201d published in 2010, includes misleading statements questioning the legitimacy of the climate crisis such as, \u201cnot all scientists agree with the theory of the greenhouse effect.\u201d This statement falsely leads students to believe that there is not a wide scientific consensus about climate change.Fossil fuel industry funding of curriculums also poses a huge obstacle to eliminating misinformation about climate change. Energy corporations are paying for materials to be developed that promote fossil fuel usage and production. In the Washington Post article, \u201cEnergy Industry Shapes Lessons in Public Schools,\u201d Kevin Sieff writes, \u201cThe industry aims to teach students about its contributions to local economies and counter criticism from environmental groups.\u201d These resources are often biased and factually incorrect.Actions like Portland\u2019s demonstrate that schools can address climate change in the classroom. It is essential that cities around the nation follow their lead because we, as the future generation, deserve to know what we are facing and what we can do to fix this crisis that we did not create.As Portland student Gaby Lemieux says, \u201cClimate education is not a niche or a specialization, it is the minimum requirement for my generation to be successful in our changing world.\u201dWorks CitedGardiner, Beth. \u201cSetbacks Aside, Climate Change Is Finding Its Way Into the World\u2019s Classrooms.\u201d The New York Times. The New York Times, 20 Apr. 2014. Web. 03 Apr. 2017.Moore, Shasta Kearns. \u201cPortland School Board Bans Climate Change-Denying Materials.\u201d Portland Tribune. N.p., 19 May 2016.

Web. 03 Apr. 2017._________At the opening of the Whitney Museum Biennial last month, a small protest began to gather in front of a painting by white, American-born artist Dana Schutz that depicted the open-casket funeral of 14-year-old Emmett Till. Within days, dozens of demonstrators showed up to block the painting from view, and over 25 black artists signed an open letter to the Whitney\u2019s curators demanding that the painting be destroyed due to its cultural appropriation of black suffering for \u201cprofit and fun.\u201dCultural appropriation is the adoption of elements of one culture by members of another culture. What makes the protests at the Whitney Museum so frustratingly sad isn\u2019t just the call for a museum to destroy a piece of artwork. Instead it is the objection that a white artist has no right to paint a subject like a lynching victim that entirely misses the point. What these critics \u2014 the same people who would protest against the routine stop and frisking of innocent black people, the vulgar accusations made by President Trump caricaturing Mexican immigrants, and the harassment of Muslim-American families \u2014 fail to realize is that \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d can actually be used to heighten empathy and stop these injustices.The truth is that people, even the most sympathetic ones, tend to view victims from disparate racial groups as separate from themselves. Again and again, politicians, reporters and television broadcasters reflect this trend. \u201cNo one wants any child to be kidnapped,\u201d writes journalist Conor Friedersdorf, \u201cbut the little blond girl leads the local news; her black analog might not make the newscast... [Dana Schutz] was trying to bridge the gulf between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them.\u2019\u201dSlavery and white supremacy are very real parts of American history, and white people ought to confront them no less than black people. To label such efforts as \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d lends credibility to the sort of racial rigidity that fuels racism in the first place. So while Dana Schutz is white and Emmett Till is black, the emphasis on racial essentialism here feels ludicrously, infuriatingly off topic. Sometimes a woman rendering painful moments in black history has nothing to do with whether she herself is white or black, but rather with the exposure of human pain. Combating racism must not only rely on racial equity in legislation, but also must allow for the full participation of every ethnic group, nationality and race.Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting itself is abstract and haunting \u2014 the ambiguous brush strokes across Till\u2019s face form a profoundly disquieting image. But this is to be expected of any painting that reopens the wounds of American racism. Call it whatever you will, but what Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting does is powerful and evokes emotion in the viewer. Sorrow. Anger. Loss. Some might even say empathy.Works CitedFriedersdorf, Conor. \u201cWhat Does \u2018Cultural Appropriation\u2019 Actually Mean?\u201d The Atlantic. 3 Apr. 2017.Fury, Alexander. \u201cMarc Jacobs and the Appropriateness of Appropriation.\u201d The New York Times. 21 Sept. 2016.Sehgal, Parul. \u201cIs Cultural Appropriation Always Wrong?\u201d The New York Times. 29 Sept. 2015.Shamsie, Kamila. \u201cThe Storytellers of Empire.\u201d Guernica Magazine. 1 Feb. 2012.Tomkins, Calvin. \u201cWhy Dana Schutz Painted Emmett Till.\u201d The New Yorker. 10 Apr. 2017._________Christine Lagarde. Charles Murray. Condoleezza Rice. What do the director of the IMF, the conservative political scientist, and the 66th secretary of state have in common? All three have been prevented from speaking on college campuses due to student protests.Campaigns by college students to block speakers from campus events have markedly increased in recent years. According to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, there have been 338 attempts by college students to prevent public figures from speaking at campus events since 2000. The annual number of \u201cdisinvitation events\u201d has increased since 2011, with 2016 reaching a record high of 42 campaigns.The protests themselves are not the problem. Throughout history, protests have been the catalyst for political progress, from Gandhi\u2019s salt march to the American Civil Rights movement. Instead, it is the motivation behind these college protests that provides a disservice to the students of today. Often, the reason for campaigns against speakers is the disparity between the politics or actions of the proposed speaker and the views of the student protesters. Many students hold that the beliefs of proposed speakers are so damaging that they should not be given a platform.The solution to a difference of opinion is not a violent refusal to listen. Discourse is necessary.By listening to and engaging with political opponents, students can strengthen their understanding of political issues and both sides can evolve their views.In an increasingly polarized political climate, an understanding of opposing viewpoints is crucial to developing and strengthening one\u2019s own ideology. By listening to speakers with different political views, students are afforded the unique opportunity to learn about contrary beliefs and their underlying reasoning. In turn, this understanding allows students to refine their positions and, therefore, to more effectively advocate for them.Vigorous and open debate also allows both sides the opportunity to engage in ideological development. One purpose of college is the ability to grow and change before venturing into the real world. Listening to a speaker with whom you already wholeheartedly agree is a merely a visit to the echo chamber. Exposure to new viewpoints may actually change the beliefs of students. Conversely, students who confront the speaker with informed questions and arguments may challenge the position of the speaker or sway other undecided listeners.Thus, for the benefit of students and the future of political discourse, the practice of blocking speakers on college campuses must stop. College students should continue to protest, but should also listen and demand respectful dialogue with speakers, no matter their politics. If we fail to listen, if we turn our backs on the opposition instead of arguing and engaging, then we have already lost.Works Cited\u201cDisinvitation Attempts.\u201d Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.Fitzsimmons, Emma G. \u201cCondoleezza Rice Backs Out of Rutgers Speech After Student Protests.\u201d The New York Times, 3 May 2014.P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, Richard. \u201cAfter Protests, I.M.F.

The hero quickly realized what made the nine-headed beast so deadly. After decapitating one head, two more took its place. However, if he cauterized the wounds, the heads would not spawn, allowing Hercules to defeat this relentless foe. The moral is brute force may not be the sole solution. Three thousand years later, we do not fight sea monsters and impervious lions, but we need Hercules\u2019s lesson more than ever. For the past 16 years our nation has been at a never-ending war with a similarly regenerating enemy: international terrorism.Former President Obama criticized his predecessor\u2019s strategy for creating more terrorists than it killed, but his own pivot from conventional warfare to drone strikes was not the ideal solution either.President Trump appears to be embracing Obama\u2019s myopic tactics. On January 21 and 22, the United States conducted drone strikes in the Yemeni province of Bayda that claimed the lives of 75 people. Though such drone strikes successfully kill insurgents, new radicals always seem to spring up in their place. Could this new technology be moving us toward perpetual war rather than peace?Retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, once responsible for the Joint Special Operations Command, says yes. During a Reuters interview, he argues that drones strengthen the \u201cperception of American arrogance that says, \u2018Well we can fly where we want, we can shoot where we want, because we can.\u2019\u201d Although these strikes eliminate enemies, General McChrystal stresses that radical groups use perceived American imperiousness to bolster their numbers faster than we kill them.Proponents claim this technological advantage enables us to remotely kill key targets like the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour. However, these weapons\u2019 short term gains cause more havoc than sustained peace. Just days after terminating Mullah Mansour, an \u201ceven more ruthless and radical leader\u201d filled his position.The attack that killed Mullah Mansour also incinerated an innocent taxi driver name Mohammad Azam. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism states this humble cabdriver joined \u201cbetween 256 and 633 civilians\u201d who perished in United States\u2019 drone strikes between January 2009 and December 2015. Our feigned progress leads us to ignore the innocent people who have been trampled and shallowly regarded as collateral damage. Our acceptance of these unintended deaths generate resentment, hatred and destabilization, creating a prime environment for spawning new radicals.The modern Hydra is more complex than its ancient Greek counterpart. However, its heads will continue to sprout even though our weapon is a Hellfire missile rather than Hercules\u2019s club. We must discover how to seal the wounds rather than just inflict them, or our problems will grow exponentially.Works CitedAlexander, David. \u201cRetired General Cautions against Overuse of \u201chated\u201d Drones.\u201d Reuters.

This time it was a group of first graders from a sandy hook. Standing in the kitchen with my backpack by my feet, I could not escape the visions of carnage.In school, we practice Code Red. We pile furniture against classroom doors and sit silently, holding our breath until reminded that it is just a drill. Wariness follows me home from school, its tentacles twisting my head.When I pick up my phone, there are notifications reading, \u201cAt least 50 dead after nightclub shooting in Orlando, officials report\u201d next to Snapchat notifications. I can list Adam Lanza, Dylann Roof, Omar Mateen, Robert Dear and Chris Harper Mercer, just as quickly as I can list the names of my best friendsI notice that when the bullets hit the kids, our civilized side flares. But we build the excuses back up, brick by brick, into cities and laws and Second Amendments. I am mad because 16-year-olds are supposed to be angry with their parents and society and not having a date to the prom, but instead I have to be angry with lawmakers and the N.R.A. and an entire country that lets holsters and bazookas pull its puppet strings. I can fire off facts faster than an AR-15 rifle: last year, there were 358 shootings in the U.S. in which four or more people were injured or killed. 306 Americans are shot every day. 48 of those are children or teenagers.It does not have to be this way. Take Australia. After a shooting in 1996 left 35 civilians dead, extensive gun control legislature was passed. These new laws included required licenses, safety training courses and an assault weapons ban. In the twenty years since the legislature was passed, there have been no mass shootings in Australia.

In the Kingdom of the Little People theme park just outside Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, that\u2019s the norm. The park creates a safe space for little people in China, but still sources such as the L.P.A., Little People of America, believe the park is mocking dwarfism and isolating the handicapped community. The Kingdom of the Little People theme park should be kept running, because it gives little people a stable job and a safe space to be themselves.Little people in China have an extremely hard time finding work, but at the Kingdom of the Little People they have many job opportunities. According to the South China Morning Press, \u201cdwarves earn average pay packets of 1,500 yuan, equivalent to that of local college graduates.\u201d Though most dwarfs in China live in poverty, often times forced to beg on the streets, the dwarves at the park are paid well and many say that it changed their lives forever.Another big pull for dwarfs is to be finally in an environment where they aren\u2019t the odd one out and they have a safe space to be with others like them. One of the performers at the park, Wu Zhihong, 20 said, \u201cBefore, when we were at home, we didn\u2019t know anyone our size. When we hang out together with normal-size people, we cannot really do the same things. So I really felt lonely sometimes.\u201d Many of the workers felt isolated in their hometowns where most often they were the only person of short stature they knew. At the park they have a place to meet others they can relate to and reportedly many dwarfs find their first loves at the park.Some say the park is a human zoo and a place to gawk, but this is not the case. Most of the performers have nowhere else where they can have a stable life with friends similar to them. The performers all say that they wouldn\u2019t be the same if they hadn\u2019t worked at the Kingdom of the Little People.The park creates a safe space for little people in China to meet friends and get paid a comfortable salary. Without the park little people in China would live as lesser members of society subject to extreme ridicule. Ethics groups that oppose the park need to be shown the effect it has had on performers and how drastically different their lives would be without it. The park must remain open for the sake of the little people all over China.Works CitedNews, Red Door. \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World: The Kingdom of the Little People.\u201d South China Morning Post.

I should be glad that it keeps \u201cAlexa\u201d clean and protected, but I cannot overlook the amount of waste created. I recycled the cardboard, but the plastic? My neighborhood recycling plant only accepts plastic bottles. It does not have the facilities to break down the multilayered packaging economically. Instead, it went to the landfill, adding to the 14.4 million tons of plastic produced each year in America.Granted, we have made progress over the years. Since 2005, United States companies have already avoided creating 1.5 billion pounds of packaging waste. Even so, reducing the amount of packaging is not enough. We must eliminate it entirely in order to see any large progress.Zero waste stores have opened all across Europe in order to combat this issue. At Original Unverpackt, in Berlin, Germany, all of their products are out in the open, unobstructed by layers of plastic, paper or metal. Precycling removes trash before it is even created. Shoppers come in with sacks and totes buying local products while making conscious purchases.Few places generate as much waste as grocery stores. We consistently see produce individually wrapped in plastic. But why is this necessary? For thousands of years, people bought goods fresh and in bulk \u2014 free of any sort of packaging. Bulk items are still around now, but their sections are dwarfed by aisles and aisles of unnecessary packaging. These small areas do not dominate stores and therefore have very little influence on our buying habits.In America, a land full of supermarkets and large companies, it is more difficult to have zero waste and bulk markets because we want security and convenience. We pay for instant gratification rather than quality when we buy packaged food. If we want to reinvent grocery shopping, both the manufacturers and the consumers must take part.Many large corporations such as Nestl\u00e9 and WalMart have taken steps toward becoming more environmentally friendly, but lesser-known brands have made the most progress. They have responded to the demands of consumers, eliminating excessive packaging and sourcing from local and organic farms. We need to continue this movement toward zero waste by encouraging consumers to change their way of life and look toward the future of healthy, sustainable living, rather than being content with harming our planet. Bring your own bags. Buy food in bulk. Shop zero-waste. Small changes are all it takes to make a difference that extends far beyond our own homes.Works CitedBall, Aimee Lee. \u201cThe Anti-Packaging Movement.\u201d New York Times, 29 Nov. 2016.

In fact, The New York Times reports that it has nearly the same capacity as Madison Square Garden. Now, McKinney Independent School District, adjacent to Allen I.S.D., is building a rival stadium for nearly $70 million. That\u2019s the equivalent of providing school lunch to all of the 24,500 students in McKinney every day for six years.This is a remarkable misappropriation of money in a state that chronically underfunds education. As of last year, not only did Texas rank 43rd in the nation for education, it ranked 49th in per pupil spending. Nationally, the U.S. spent an average of $11,667 per student whereas Texas fell behind at $7,957 per student. But it\u2019s not only Texas whose obsession with sports is ripping at the seams of our educational system and, consequently, our democracy.A democracy forming without the proper education is doomed to crumble. Education is the key in arming the electorate with the information necessary to consider candidates, yet superfluous spending toward athletics is hindering the way our society is learning and voting. Paving the path toward a strong democracy, not a sharply divided one, begins and ends with education. Shifting the focus from athletics to academics, from the playing field to the classroom, is the way to uphold our trembling nation. As Richard D. Kahlenberg and Clifford Janey explain, \u201cThe Founders saw education as the safeguard of America\u2019s system of self-governance. Educating common people was the answer to the oligarchs who said the average citizen could not be trusted to choose leaders wisely.\u201d But with more than two-thirds of Americans unable to name all three branches of government, I can\u2019t help but ponder: Is this the America that our founders had hoped for?Defunding sports is absurd. It is just as vital to have an active society as it is to have an educated one. But athletics cannot be the top priority when the U.S. is ranked so low in education. The Pew Research Center reports that the U.S. is currently 38th out of 71 developed and developing countries in math, and 24th in science. We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but our school funds are going down the wrong drain. Author Marguerite Roza \u201cfound that one high school was spending $328 a student for math instruction and more than four times that much for cheerleading \u2014 $1,348 a cheerleader.\u201dSpend tax money wisely; invest more in education; prioritize academics over athletics. And, who knows? Maybe if we spent $60 million on libraries instead of sports stadiums, students would understand that their society values education. And they would vote accordingly.Works CitedAnderson, Lindsey. \u201cTexas Falls to 43 in National Education Ranking.\u201d El Paso Times. 11 Jan. 2016.DeSilver, Drew. \u201cU.S. Students\u2019 Academic Achievement Still Lags That of Their Peers in Many Other Countries.\u201d Pew Research Center. 15 Feb. 2017.Gerber, Marisa. \u201cAfter Texas High School Builds $60-million Stadium, Rival District Plans One for Nearly $70 Million.\u201d Los Angeles Times. 17 Sept. 2016.\u201cMcKinney ISD Meal Prices for the 2016-17 School Year.\u201d McKinney ISD.

However, it also reaffirmed the power and relevancy that the written word still has in this day and age. A study conducted at Stanford University just after the November 2016 elections found that over 7,800 students in middle school, high school and college in 12 states \u201cwere unable to assess the credibility\u201d of information that they encountered on the internet. Now, more than ever, it is critical that we teach students in all schools \u2014 public and private, K-12 and college \u2014 how to think critically and analyze the news that they come across.Though terms such as \u201cfake news\u201d have risen to prominence in the past year, the art of deception reaches back to the advent of modern media. Photography especially has long been used to make political statements, \u201cprove\u201d questionable supernatural sightings, and justify cultural appropriation. Today, complex 19th-century equipment and studios have been replaced with Photoshop and a computer. The outcome, however, is still the same: an altered form of truth, or proof of a nonexistent event. Photoshopped images cover the internet, often side-by-side with real ones. How are students with an untrained eye supposed to spot the difference between reality and fiction?Then there are the articles themselves. Fake news articles are mainly spread through various social media platforms, frequented by teenagers and adults alike. When people see fake news articles \u2014 which often have eye-catching or alarming headlines \u2014 how are they to judge the validity of these articles without knowing what to look for? Fact-checking sites like Snopes certainly help, but they do not cover every article or statement on the internet. Some claims can only be proven false through critical thinking and by consulting reputable references.There are many different ways to tackle the rise of fake news, but the most important is teaching people how to think critically about what they encounter on the news and how to recognize whether it is fact or fiction. This can only be accomplished by incorporating news literacy into existing school curriculums \u2014 such as government, civics or history classes \u2014 rather than having a separate elective or seminar. By the time students reach college, they\u2019re already \u201ctoo immersed in their own worldviews\u201d to be able to look at news objectively. News literacy classes must be introduced to schools, and it needs to be done as soon as possible. Everyone is affected by fake news, and it is now our civic duty to educate ourselves and others about it.Works CitedBarron, James. \u201cIn an Era of Fake News, Teaching Students to Parse Fact From Fiction.\u201d The New York Times. 20 Mar. 2017.Chen, Angus. \u201cLong Before There Was \u2018Fake News\u2019, There Were \u2018Fake Photos\u2019.\u201d Goats and Soda.

We all run back to class, forming a line and departing from our adventures in the land of recess. I\u2019m last in line. Every. Day.The system of alphabetical order in schools must be changed, as a silent bias toward the names starting with letters near the end of the alphabet is causing detrimental effects to our children\u2019s psychology due to the subconscious implications of inferiority.As someone with the last name \u201cZhang,\u201d I still remember the rush of excitement I felt when my teacher read the roll sheet from the bottom to the top \u2014 only on special occasions, of course. I remember the condolences the teacher would give, telling me \u201clast but not least!\u201d But I still felt least. This display of alphabetical inequality not only continually provides an unfair disadvantage and feeling of inferiority to the same group of people; it also affects our decisions made later in life.In the New York Times article \u201cHow Inequality Hollows Out the Soul\u201d by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, it discusses how social inequality allows us to \u201cnot only [see] what we knew intuitively \u2014 that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive \u2014 but that it also damages the individual psyche.\u201d If inequality in wealth damages people, why wouldn\u2019t inequality in school cause damage as well?In a recent four-series scientific study in the Journal of Consumer Research conducted by Kurt A. Carlson, assistant professor at Georgetown, and Jacqueline M. Conard, assistant professor at Belmont University, the professors found that those who had last names later in the alphabet reacted quicker to special sale opportunities when offered deals simultaneously.\u201cWe find that the later in the alphabet the first letter of one\u2019s childhood surname is, the faster the person acquires items as an adult. We dub this the last name effect ... it stems from childhood ordering structures that put children with different names in different positions in lines ... since those late in the alphabet are typically at the end of lines, they compensate by responding quickly to acquisition opportunities,\u201d Professor Carlson says.Alphabetical order is fine for files in cabinets or books in a library or for naming hurricanes. It is not appropriate for organizing people. \u201cThere may be no great alternatives to alphabetical order,\u201d says Professor Carlson. \u201cBut flip it around every now and then. That\u2019s a reasonable way to balance things out.\u201dWorks CitedGregory, Sean. \u201cHow Your Name May Cost You at the Mall.\u201d Time, 28 Jan. 2011.Wilkinson, Richard and Kate Pickett. \u201cHow Inequality Hollows Out the Soul.\u201d The New York Times, 2 Feb. 2014._________Since President Richard Nixon first waged a \u201cwar on drugs\u201d in 1971, the United States has resorted to prohibition, believing that aggressive drug bans will reduce and prevent drug-related crime, addiction, incarceration, death and disease. Yet, the opposite has occurred.According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 46.3 percent of inmates are currently imprisoned on drug offenses. The National Institute on Drug Abuse approximates that more than 50,000 individuals died from drug overdoses in 2015 alone, and states that diseases like hepatitis and H.I.V. continue to rage, spreading through unhygienic methods like unsterilized needles.Considering these failed results, the federal government should look to an alternative approach to combating drug use.That alternative is the decriminalization and legalization of all illicit drugs. This may seem like a disastrous choice; however, in Portugal, it\u2019s worked.In 2001, Portugal\u2019s government decriminalized and legalized all drugs, no matter their severity, in response to a growing heroin problem. Instead of a criminal offense, those caught with less than a 10-day supply of hard drugs are taken before a special court of legal experts, psychologists and social workers. In place of jail time, a small fine or community service, as well as treatment, is provided.Today, Portugal has one of the lowest drug-usage rates in all of Europe. The British Journal of Criminology found a significant reduction in the imprisonment of alleged drug dealers, from 14,000 in 2000 to 5,000 in 2010, and in the imprisonment of addicts, which fell from 41 percent in 1999 to 21 percent in 2008. The Washington Post reported that \u201cthere are three drug overdose deaths for every 1,000,000 citizens\u201d in Portugal; as a comparison, \u201c44.6 per million\u201d die in the United Kingdom. Drug-related diseases, like H.I.V., have decreased, \u201cwhile the dramatic rise in use feared by some has failed to materialize,\u201d as stated by the Transform Drug Policy Institute.By focusing on treatment rather than punishment, Portugal has given its citizens the opportunity to rehabilitate and contribute as functioning members of society. Consequently, the demand for drugs falls as the number of users declines.In the U.S., certain states are moving toward reformation instead of incarceration. The New York Times reported Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s efforts to combat the wild opioid epidemic in New York City: \u201c$38 million a year\u201d will go to programs like \u201cexpanded methadone and buprenorphine treatment for addicts\u201d and \u201ca focus at city hospitals on dealing with addiction and overdoses.\u201dThat is what the U.S. needs. The current system is a complete failure; the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d concept is ridiculously ineffective. It\u2019s time to look for an alternative model; Portugal has proved that its model works.Works Cited\u201cA Brief History of the Drug War.\u201d Drug Policy Alliance.\u201cDrug Decriminalization in Portugal: Setting the Record Straight.\u201d Transform: Getting Drugs Under Control. 11 June. 2014.Goodman, J.

Members of minority groups struggle to find accurate representation in films, clinging tightly to even the smallest examples of representation. This lack of diversity is particularly damaging to young children, whose perception of the world is warped to fit a narrative where only a certain type of person gets to have a happily ever after.In 2015, only 22 out of 126 released films featured a character that was part of the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community. Some people argue that because there are more cis-heterosexuals in real life, there should be more cis-heterosexuals in films. By this logic, the number of cis-heterosexual characters in individual films should exceed L.G.B.T.Q. characters. The lack of L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters in over 100 films creates entire universes where L.G.B.T.Q.+ people are seemingly nonexistent, a statistic that does not mirror reality in the slightest.Children especially need to see L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters, and yet their demographic is the one that is most denied access to films with accurate representation. Unfortunately, many people consider same-sex relationships to be too mature for children. Because of this, impressionable young people are prevented from watching films that could help them to better understand themselves and to accept the people around them.This also prevents L.G.B.T.Q.+ people and relationships from becoming normalized. If children are not exposed to the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community until later on in life, they will learn to treat it as something new and different as adults. By showing them films with diverse casts of characters, children will recognize that L.G.B.T.Q.+ people are a part of everyday life and that they \u201chave a right to ... their happily ever after, too.\u201d Normalizing L.G.B.T.Q.+ identities will also normalize their inclusion in films and other media outlets, because the people making those films will be so used to a world of L.G.B.T.Q.+ people that to not include them would be unthinkable.Film companies argue that parents would not allow their children to see films with L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters in them, making diversity and inclusivity bad for business. Though there are certainly people who would boycott films on this basis, there are also many parents who would be thrilled to see their children introduced to that kind of diversity at such a young age. Many L.G.B.T.Q.+ adults would watch the films as well, because they want to experience the representation they were denied as a child.Representation in any type of media is important, but L.G.B.T.Q.+ visibility in children\u2019s films is of particular significance. It represents another step on the long road to equality and a shift in the mind-set of an entire generation.Works Cited\u201cOverview of Findings.\u201d GLAAD. 02 May 2016.________The angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Igneous rock melts into magma. And I\u2019m sure by now many high schoolers know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of a cell. Having knowledge in a variety of subjects gives students information that could be useful in their futures depending on what they do with their lives. But what about classes that teach skills that will be useful to everyone, regardless of their life paths? Being a high school student myself, I do not believe I currently know enough about how to manage money. If more personal finance classes were available in schools, students would be more prepared for their futures.Financial education is not a requirement in every U.S. state, and students are missing out on useful information because of this. Only 17 states \u201crequire high school students to take a course in personal finance \u2026 the same number as in 2014.\u201d The United States is also behind other countries in regard to financial education. A 2012 international survey reported, \u201cmore than 1 in 6 students in the United States failed to reach the baseline level of proficiency in financial literacy.\u201d This same large study showed that American students are just behind Latvia and just ahead of Russia in financial knowledge, at the center of the countries assessed. Using money is something people do in their everyday lives, so being in the dark about financial skills leaves room for instability.When high school students take finance classes, they are more responsible with their finances. It has been shown that \u201chigh school students who are required to take personal finance courses have better average credit scores and lower debt delinquency rates as young adults.\u201d In the New York Times article, \u201cMaking Your Family Better at Personal Finance,\u201d Paul Brown says after his daughter took a personal finance course, she was \u201cfar better with money than her equally smart brothers.\u201d A parent\u2019s advice alone is often not enough to foster sensible financial habits in young people \u2014 being in a classroom allows students to process information and make meaningful connections to their own lives.While my school district requires I take a personal finance class in high school, many schools throughout the world do not. Young students everywhere should have ways to learn about how to survive and succeed in their lives, and learning about the economy is one way to do that. Yes, learning about the cycle of how rocks melt into magma can be interesting, but learning how to create and manage a budget, use and manage a credit card, and pay off a mortgage can make a lasting positive influence on one\u2019s life.Works CitedAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Socialism\u2019s Future May Be Its Past", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRed CenturyOne hundred years after Lenin\u2019s sealed train arrived at Finland Station and set into motion the events that led to Stalin\u2019s gulags, the idea that we should return to this history for inspiration might sound absurd. But there was good reason that the Bolsheviks once called themselves \u201csocial democrats.\u201d They were part of a broad movement of growing parties that aimed to fight for greater political democracy and, using the wealth and the new working class created by capitalism, extend democratic rights into the social and economic spheres, which no capitalist would permit.The early Communist movement never rejected this broad premise. It was born out of a sense of betrayal by the more moderate left-wing parties of the Second International, the alliance of socialist and labor parties from 20 countries that formed in Paris in 1889. Across Europe, party after party did the unthinkable, abandoned their pledges to working-class solidarity for all nations, and backed their respective governments in World War I. Those that remained loyal to the old ideas called themselves Communists to distance themselves from the socialists who had abetted a slaughter that claimed 16 million lives. (Amid the carnage, the Second International itself fell apart in 1916.)Of course, the Communists\u2019 noble gambit to stop the war and blaze a humane path to modernity in backward Russia ended up seemingly affirming the Burkean notion that any attempt to upturn an unjust order would end up only creating another.Most socialists have been chastened by the lessons of 20th-century Communism. Today, many who would have cheered on the October Revolution have less confidence about the prospects for radically transforming the world in a single generation. They put an emphasis instead on political pluralism, dissent and diversity.The right still denounces socialism as an economic system that will lead to misery and privation, but with less emphasis on the political authoritarianism that often went hand in hand with socialism in power. This may be because elites today do not have democratic rights at the forefront of their minds \u2014 perhaps because they know that the societies they run are hard to justify on those terms.Capitalism is an economic system: a way of organizing production for the market through private ownership and the profit motive. To the extent that it has permitted democracy, it has been with extreme reluctance. That\u2019s why early workers\u2019 movements like Britain\u2019s Chartists in the early 19th century organized, first and foremost, for democratic rights. Capitalist and socialist leaders alike believed that the struggle for universal suffrage would encourage workers to use their votes in the political sphere to demand an economic order that put them in control.It didn\u2019t quite work out that way. Across the West, workers came to accept a sort of class compromise. Private enterprise would be tamed, not overcome, and a greater share of a growing pie would go to providing universal benefits through generous welfare states. Political rights would be enshrined, too, as capitalism evolved and adapted such that a democratic civil society and an authoritarian economic system made an unlikely, but seemingly successful, pairing.In 2017, that arrangement is long dead. With working-class movements dormant, capital has run amok, charting a destructive course without even the promise of sustained growth. The anger that led to the election of Donald Trump in the United States and the Brexit vote in Britain is palpable. People feel as if they\u2019re on a runaway train to an unknown destination and, for good reason, want back to familiar miseries.Amid this turmoil, some fear a return to Finland Station via the avuncular shrugs of avowedly socialist leaders like Mr. Sanders and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in France. But the threat to democracy today is coming from the right, not the left. Politics seems to present two ways forward, both decidedly non-Stalinist forms of authoritarian collectivism.\u201cSingapore Station\u201d is the unacknowledged destination of the neoliberal center\u2019s train. It\u2019s a place where people in all their creeds and colors are respected \u2014 so long as they know their place. After all, people are crass and irrational, incapable of governing. Leave running Singapore Station to the experts.This is a workable vision for elites who look at the rise of an erratic right-wing populism with justified fear. Many of them argue the need for austerity measures to maintain a fragile global economy, and worry that voters won\u2019t take their short-term pain to spare themselves long-term dysfunction. The same goes for the looming threat of climate change: The science is undisputed among scientists, but is still up for debate in the public sphere.The Singapore model is not the worst of all possible end points. It\u2019s one where experts are allowed to be experts, capitalists are allowed to accumulate, and ordinary workers are allowed a semblance of stability. But it leaves no room for the train\u2019s passengers to yell \u201cStop!\u201d and pick a destination of their own choosing.\u201cBudapest Station,\u201d named after the powerful right-wing parties that dominate Hungary today, is the final stop for the populist right. Budapest allows us to at least feel like we\u2019re back in charge. We get there by decoupling some of the cars hurtling us forward and slowly reversing. We\u2019re all in this together, unless you\u2019re an outsider who doesn\u2019t have a ticket, and then tough luck.The \u201cTrump train\u201d is headed this way. President Trump can\u2019t offer tangible gains for ordinary people by challenging elites, but he can offer a surface-level valorization of \u201cthe worker\u201d and stoke anger at the alleged causes of national decline \u2014 migrants, bad trade deals, cosmopolitan globalists. The press, academia and any other noncompliant parts of civil society are under attack. Meanwhile, other than having to adjust to more protectionism and restrictive immigration policies, it\u2019s business as usual for most corporations.But there is a third alternative: back to \u201cFinland Station,\u201d with all the lessons of the past. This time, people get to vote. Well, debate and deliberate and then vote \u2014 and have faith that people can organize together to chart new destinations for humanity.Stripped down to its essence, and returned to its roots, socialism is an ideology of radical democracy. In an era when liberties are under attack, it seeks to empower civil society to allow participation in the decisions that affect our lives. A huge state bureaucracy, of course, can be just as alienating and undemocratic as corporate boardrooms, so we need to think hard about the new forms that social ownership could take.Some broad outlines should already be clear: Worker-owned cooperatives, still competing in a regulated market; government services coordinated with the aid of citizen planning; and the provision of the basics necessary to live a good life (education, housing and health care) guaranteed as social rights. In other words, a world where people have the freedom to reach their potentials, whatever the circumstances of their birth.We can get to this Finland Station only with the support of a majority; that\u2019s one reason that socialists are such energetic advocates of democracy and pluralism. But we can\u2019t ignore socialism\u2019s loss of innocence over the past century. We may reject the version of Lenin and the Bolsheviks as crazed demons and choose to see them as well-intentioned people trying to build a better world out of a crisis, but we must work out how to avoid their failures.That project entails a return to social democracy. Not the social democracy of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, but that of the early days of the Second International. This social democracy would involve a commitment to a free civil society, especially for oppositional voices; the need for institutional checks and balances on power; and a vision of a transition to socialism that does not require a \u201cyear zero\u201d break with the present.Our 21st-century Finland Station won\u2019t be a paradise. You might feel heartbreak and misery there. But it will be a place that allows so many now crushed by inequity to participate in the creation of a new world.This is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Says Financial Watchdog Agency Should Be Defanged", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration called for the neutering of many of the central provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as it offered its most detailed plans to date for the unraveling of the financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cProperly structuring regulation of the U.S. financial system is critical to achieve the administration\u2019s goal of sustained economic growth and to create opportunities for all Americans to benefit from a stronger economy,\u201d said Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.The recommendations were written with an eye toward easing regulations imposed on community banks and all but the largest credit unions after the financial crisis.President Trump asked for the report in February, giving the Treasury Department the authority to restructure major provisions of the Dodd-Frank law, which was passed in 2010. His order directed Mr. Mnuchin to take steps to ensure that the law aligns with the administration\u2019s goals.While the Trump administration cannot roll back the law on its own, the law does give the president broad authority to determine how its rules are executed. Mr. Mnuchin said at a congressional hearing on Monday that the administration could implement many of the changes in the report on its own.If passed, it would exempt some financial institutions that meet capital and liquidity requirements from many of Dodd-Frank\u2019s restrictions on risk-taking. It would also replace Dodd-Frank\u2019s method of dealing with large and failing financial institutions, known as the orderly liquidation authority \u2014 which critics say reinforces the idea that some banks are too big to fail \u2014 with a new bankruptcy code provision.The Senate is working on its own legislation on financial regulations, but analysts think that passage of a bill is unlikely because Republicans do not have enough votes without help from Democrats, who supported Dodd-Frank.The Trump deregulation plan sets up a clash between Mr. Trump and one of his most vocal Democratic critics: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was her brainchild. Among other approaches to scaling back its power, the Treasury report called for its funding structure to be changed so it is beholden to the annual appropriations process.\u201cThe C.F.P.B. was created to pursue an important mission, but its unaccountable structure and unduly broad regulatory powers have led to predictable regulatory abuses and excesses,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe C.F.P.B.\u2019s approach to rule making and enforcement has hindered consumer access to credit, limited innovation and imposed unduly high compliance burdens, particularly on small institutions.\u201dThe report did not take up many other important financial-regulation issues, but several more reports from the Treasury are due this year. The report did not address reform of the government-controlled mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been in a government conservatorship for nearly nine years.But the report did focus a good deal on the effect of postcrisis regulations on the mortgage market, saying that some of the rules had added costs to the business of servicing mortgages. The report said \u201cincreased oversight and regulation has led to an increase in compliance costs,\u201d which limits the ability of mortgage firms to spend more money \u201con developing more effective mortgage servicing platforms and technology.\u201dThe Treasury recommended a slowdown in new regulations for mortgage servicers.Many of the regulations imposed on mortgage servicers came about because of foreclosure abuses during the financial crisis that led big banks to pay tens of billions in fines and restitution.However, the report recommended a number of regulatory changes to spur greater mortgage origination. In particular, the report said, there needs to be \u201ccareful study of regulations and the extent to which they may be holding back the supply of mortgage credit.\u201dOne recommendation was to revise the definition of what constitutes a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d which can be guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to encourage more expansive lending. The report said a loan should be able to meet the criteria \u201ceven if one particular criterion is deemed to fall outside the bounds of the existing framework.\u201dThe financial industry cheered the Treasury report as a step in the right direction.\u201cToday\u2019s report is an important step towards modernizing America\u2019s financial regulatory system so both economic growth and consumer protection are advanced,\u201d said Tim Pawlenty, chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable.Some of the changes, such as revising the Volcker rule, would largely be a moot point, as banks sold off their proprietary trading desks years ago. While Republicans have generally been in favor of rolling back Dodd-Frank, the plan would open the door to loosening capital requirements they tend to support.Progressive groups condemned the recommendations as proposals that would put the economy at risk and allow the same practices that led to the recession.\u201cThe financial crisis had devastating costs for families and communities, and everyday abuses in financial markets cost people tens of billions of dollars a year,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cFinancial reform has made the system safer, and the C.F.P.B. is returning billions of dollars to consumers facing industry tricks and traps.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders.\u201dBut Mr. Trump has been a vocal critic of financial regulations and has argued that loosening them, along with cutting taxes and renegotiating trade deals, would unleash faster economic growth.In January, Mr. Trump called the financial regulations that President Barack Obama ushered in after the 2008 crisis a \u201cdisaster\u201d and promised to \u201cdo a big number on Dodd-Frank.\u201dMatthew Goldstein contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Another Wells Fargo Scandal?", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prospect of your bank adjusting your mortgage and lowering those monthly payments probably seems quite attractive, especially if you\u2019re in bankruptcy.It looks a little different when the bank also extends the terms of your loan by decades and you have to pay back much more money.Any change to a payment plan for a person in bankruptcy is subject to approval by bankruptcy courts and the parties involved, but the lawsuits contend that Wells Fargo did not seek such approval.The lender says it did notify the borrowers and the courts.But according to court documents, Wells Fargo has been putting through unrequested changes to such loans since 2015.During this period, the bank was also under attack for its practice of opening unwanted accounts for customers to meet sales quotas.Wells Fargo has already been admonished by bankruptcy judges in North Carolina and Pennsylvania for unsolicited loan changes: One judge called the practice \u201cbeyond the pale of due process.\u201dWhy would the bank do it?It stood to profit and it would have received as much as $1,600 from government programs for every loan it adjusted, a class-action lawsuit asserts.Now the bank is at risk of court sanctions and federal scrutiny.\u201cOur decision reflects the progress the economy has made and is expected to make,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, told reporters on Wednesday.The central bank also gave details of its plans to start reducing its portfolio of more than $4 trillion bonds.But Ms. Yellen may not be there to oversee the entire plan. The Trump administration is beginning to consider whether she should be replaced when her term ends in February. (The president had repeatedly criticized the Fed chairwoman during his election campaign.)Having concluded that the economy is growing as fast as it can, the Fed is now aiming to raise rates to a point where it neither encourages nor discourages economic activity.It has stayed below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target, and has actually fallen in the past few months.But the employment situation is at least giving the central bank the opportunity to raise rates to keep the economy from overheating. Unemployment is at 4.3 percent and the economy is still producing more new jobs than new workers.\u201cWe continue to feel that with a strong labor market and a labor market that\u2019s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.\u201cHe then went on to share that this is because I\u2019m tall and strong, like a man, and don\u2019t confuse things like a regular woman. I was flabbergasted.\u201d\u2014 Paula Minnikin, responding to The New York Times invitation for women to share their experiences of being interrupted by men.

{"Headline": "Why Migrants Keep Risking All on the \u2018Deadliest Route\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTONGO, Senegal \u2014 Amadou Anne, the oldest son, tried first.\u201cIf you have a way to get there, maybe you should try it,\u201d his father told him.The journey required crossing thousands of miles of ruthless desert and sea to reach Europe. Months passed with no news. And then the phone call.Friends in France spotted a list of drowned migrants. Mr. Anne\u2019s name was on it.\u201cI was standing right there, and I cried,\u201d his mother, Salmata Boullo Diallo, said near the family compound in a vast expanse of fallow peanut fields in this remote part of Senegal.The loss did not end there. Mr. Anne\u2019s younger brother Gibbe also tried to reach Italy. He, too, died at sea.Their fates, sealed in journeys nearly two years ago, matched those of so many in this region, where young men often fall into three unforgiving categories: the ones who have made it to Europe, the ones who were blocked or deported along the way and the ones who died trying.\u201cIf they would have made it, it really would have changed things for us,\u201d Ms. Diallo said.Late last month, 44 migrants, including children, died in the Sahara after their vehicle broke down and they ran out of water. More recently, a dinghy carrying 130 people capsized after rival smugglers stole the engine. Only four people aboard were rescued.\u201cHuman smugglers will go to any extent to exploit desperate refugees and migrants,\u201d said Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency. \u201cThese shocking deaths are part of the bigger picture of exploitation.\u201dThe stream of migrants from this region \u2014 from Nigeria, Guinea, Gambia, Ivory Coast and Mali \u2014 is growing. In 2016, the number of Senegalese making the journey nearly doubled from the year before.Yet almost 47 percent of the Senegalese population lives in poverty, according to the World Bank. In rural areas, almost two-thirds of residents are considered poor.The Anne brothers\u2019 sparsely populated region is among the poorest in Senegal. At least 110 people from here have died along the migrant route since 2015, local officials said. This area lost 17 of its men in a single episode, a shipwreck in April 2015 that killed more than 800 people.\u201cWe have no machinery to cultivate the land, no rain and now no young people,\u201d said Alassane Diallo, mayor of the nearby village of Koussan.In this sandy landscape, with its blistering heat and fat baobab trees, the chief means of survival is farming. The kind of life it provides is on full display in the small compounds of one-room mud homes: a mini-flock of two or three sheep, a piece of foam to soften a bed of sticks, a few changes of clothing, plastic flip-flops.But some of the compounds strung along the bumpy dirt roads here serve as siren calls to Europe: concrete homes instead of mud, an automobile parked outside, a satellite television dish poking from the ground, an iPhone.All of it comes from money sent home from Europe \u2014 from the migrants who made it. They are local heroes, the envy of everyone.\u201cA young Senegalese is always covered with shame and guilt when he sees his own mother trying to make ends meet without being able to support and relieve his parents,\u201d said Ousmane Sene, director of the West African Research Center in Dakar.Some parents and spouses push their sons to make the trip. Village life is so isolated that often they are unaware of the dangers of the voyage. The pressure to try can be so intense that some men who fail never return home. Ashamed, they would rather have their families think they are dead.Moussa Kebbe, who lives in the area, tried making the journey in 2014. He sold his home to finance the trip, which included 16 days in the desert with so little water that he was forced to drink his own urine. Four people in his vehicle died from thirst, he said.Once Mr. Kebbe arrived in Libya, he worked in construction and cleaned toilets to try to earn enough money to pay for the boat to Italy. Libyan immigration officials threw him in jail for three months before he was deported.He came back home empty-handed, worse off than when he started. Mr. Kebbe explained to his wife what had happened. She cried and pleaded with him to try again.\u201cIt\u2019s a suicide mission,\u201d said Ousmane Thiam, who also failed to reach Europe.In the Anne family\u2019s tiny compound, the side-by-side huts of Amadou and his brother Gibbe are still empty, a broken bicycle resting against the mud wall in one.No one realized the journey would be so dangerous, said the men\u2019s mother, Ms. Diallo.\u201cWe\u2019d only heard success stories,\u201d she said, shaking her head.Before he left, Amadou, 36, told his brother to wait. But Gibbe, 28, working in Dakar as a brick maker, thought he could earn more in Europe. Anxious to follow his brother, he took off on his own, even before he heard of Amadou\u2019s fate.\u201cWe had no idea where he was,\u201d Ms. Diallo said.Gibbe\u2019s name showed up on a list of dead migrants a few weeks after his brother\u2019s did.The Anne family relied on other sons to help financially. One of them had been living in Gabon, where he had found work. A few months ago, he came to the village. He suddenly fell ill and died, of natural causes, the family said.Another son, Adama Anne, had planned to leave for Europe or somewhere else promising, his family said.But he, too, had been ill. A few weeks ago, while The New York Times was interviewing the family in the village, Adama began coughing violently. His father tried to help him walk back to his hut, but the man collapsed in his father\u2019s arms and went cold.\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d his father howled. \u201cHe\u2019s finally gone.\u201dNow, it is up to Arouna Anne, the last male in the family, to make a better life for his parents and the children his dead brothers left behind.He is just 14 years old.Arouna knew he couldn\u2019t support his family living in their tiny village. He left for a town a few hours to the east.He arrived on a Wednesday, market day, carrying only a change of clothes and the equivalent of $33. When darkness fell, he spotted children reading Arabic outside a big house. He went inside and asked for help from the teacher. Arouna now lives there with three other boys, sleeping on a mattress made of rice stalks.He thinks about his brothers often \u2014 about Amadou, the strict one, always trying to discipline him, and Gibbe, the jokester, always playing pranks.Once, Arouna accompanied Gibbe to the fields. He turned his back and Gibbe disappeared, hiding in a tree. He made baboon noises and pounced on Arouna, who was terrified and ran away.\u201cEveryone laughed when we told them what happened,\u201d Arouna said, giggling so hard he could barely continue talking.Arouna hasn\u2019t seen his parents for six months. He sends a bit of money to them from time to time. It\u2019s not enough.\u201cI am the only remaining son now,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to support the family.\u201dArouna knows well the dangers of the trip to Europe. One of his friends from home also tried the trip not long ago and died in Libya.Eventually, Arouna says, he will go to Gabon or Congo, to work in the mines.\u201cIt\u2019s not risky there like Libya,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

That means putting aside parochial politics and embracing the global challenge of fighting climate change. In doing so, we can create a cleaner, healthier, more prosperous world for Parisians, Pittsburghers and everyone else on the planet.As the sun sets each evening on the Allegheny River, Pittsburgh\u2019s Rachel Carson Bridge lights up with 27,000 multi-colored bulbs. This nightly display downtown in the City of Bridges is powered entirely by 16 wind turbines attached to the arches of the bridge. It\u2019s just one example of how a city once famous for its steel mills has emerged as a trailblazer in environmental innovation.The experience of Pittsburgh in the three decades since the collapse of the steel industry reveals how a commitment to science, research and green technology can transform our cities. As late as the 1940s, the air hung heavy with pollution from steel mills. Streetlights were needed 24 hours a day to see through the smog. Today, 13,000 Pittsburghers are employed in the renewable energy industry. The city\u2019s Phipps Conservatory is recognized as one of the world\u2019s greenest buildings, generating all of its own energy and treating and reusing all water captured on site. Investments in smart infrastructure, bike sharing programs, new mass transit options and building efficiency means Pittsburgh is on track to meet our goal of slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2023. While the majority of electricity in the state of Pennsylvania is still generated from fossil fuels, Pittsburgh will be 100 percent powered by renewable energy by 2035.We Pittsburghers are proud of our industrial history, but we are preparing for a prosperous future. That means addressing our air quality, which remains among the worst in the nation. That means ensuring that the shift to sustainable infrastructure tackles inequality between communities. And that means taking climate change seriously.In Paris \u2014 another city famous for its bridges \u2014 we are inspired by the resolve of Pittsburgh to deliver on the ambition of the Paris Agreement by building an ever more sustainable and thriving city. In the City of Lights, we\u2019re taking big steps to boost our economy, encourage social mobility and improve the health of our citizens.

{"Headline": "How to Host a Relaxed Dinner Party Like an Italian", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntertaining WithAt the root of Western philosophy, there is a dinner party. Whether fictional or real, the Ancient Athenian supper that Plato recounts in his \u201cSymposium\u201d has all the familiar outlines of our own modern gatherings: drunkenness, attempts at moderation, cures for hiccups, a \u201cno shoes\u201d policy, surprise drop-in guests, flirtations \u2014 not to mention some gentle ribbing, one-upmanship and a long, heated discussion of love. Brunello Cucinelli, founder of his namesake luxury fashion brand, appreciates the example set out by Socrates and others around that long-ago table. \u201cA dinner party contains the flavor of life,\u201d says the lifelong host, who gathers together hundreds of friends, clients, journalists and fashion cognoscenti at every edition of Pitti Uomo in Florence for his own dinner party, which has become one of the most anticipated events of the week. A humble farmer\u2019s son and onetime engineering student who dropped out of university, Cucinelli became a self-taught philosopher before he began selling cashmere sweaters, and eventually launched his company with a distinctively humanistic formulation of what a capitalist enterprise could achieve \u2014 for which he is being awarded Germany\u2019s prestigious Global Economy Prize for \u201cHonorable Merchant\u201d this Sunday. His finely crafted goods \u2014 the epitome of understated Italian ease \u2014 are almost all made by workers who are paid above average and enjoy a theater, an amphitheater, a library and a cafeteria serving locally grown food (all built by Cucinelli) in Solomeo, the antiquated Umbrian village that is his wife\u2019s hometown. In Florence on Tuesday, at the grandly medieval Villa Palmieri (where Boccaccio begins and ends \u201cThe Decameron\u201d) tables were being set and buffets piled with platters for this season\u2019s gala as Cucinelli sat down to share some tips about entertaining \u2014 and his favorite recipe \u2014 with T.\u201cI don\u2019t have a chef. I have a cook,\u201d says Cucinelli, who eschews experimentation in favor of the purity of tradition. \u201cI want to sustain the Italian culture of real food.\u201d He maintains that simplicity and authenticity are equally important in every culture\u2019s cuisine, but swears allegiance to the Italian notion that dishes should contain \u201ctwo, maximum three flavors, so you can taste the ingredients, which must \u2014 it goes without saying \u2014 be of the highest quality.\u201d Cucinelli gives a joyful whistle when recalling black truffles and fresh-pressed olive oil in November, or fried pale artichokes in March. Beyond his commitment to eating locally grown ingredients and enjoying them at their peak, he possesses an almost religious devotion to the rite of the in-season delicacy.There is no \u201ceverything plate\u201d at a Cucinelli affair. \u201cThe flavors of different courses should never mix \u2014 it\u2019s a rule of the Italian kitchen,\u201d he says. His childhood lunches were always spread across four plates \u2014 leaving his mother to hand-wash 20 dishes at every family meal, but refining, he says, his sense of taste. At Villa Palmieri, the buffet itself was rigorously separated by course and flavor to keep even the perfumes from mingling.\u201cWhen we were just a family of farmers, we didn\u2019t have lights in the house and so what was life about for us? It was meals,\u201d Cucinelli says. Never try to Snapchat a Cucinelli dinner. No devices are allowed at the table, and everyone dines together, whether it\u2019s at his grand Florence affair or during the daily lunch in his company cafeteria.\u201cI was born by candlelight,\u201d he says. \u201cA meal deserves that kind of softness.\u201d At the Florence dinner, pillar candles illuminated centerpieces of thyme, rosemary, oregano and lavender plants, and votive flames lined the winding garden paths with flashing, honey-toned light.No paper, no plastic, no throwaway item will ever grace Cucinelli\u2019s tables, which he covers in tablecloths of the finest fabrics, and sets with glass, silver and china. Everything tastes better, he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have TV growing up. I had the stars,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you lift your eyes to the skies, life will look different to you.\u201d The contemplative evenings left him with a vast appreciation for quiet, so as a gift to his guests, Cucinelli eschewed music for his Pitti Uomo dinner party, preferring to help them focus their attention on the overgrown cedars, cypresses and palm trees of the villa\u2019s garden, and the bright three-quarter moon above. \u201cBut there\u2019s always a little wind at night,\u201d he adds, \u201cSo a cashmere pullover is a nice luxury too.\u201dCucinelli howls with delight at the thought of this dish his wife Federica makes for him. What renders it superlative is a perfect pasta texture and abundant sauce. \u201cThe pasta should be swimming in the tomatoes,\u201d he says.\u2022 6 ounces of rigatoni pasta\u2022 \u00bd pound fresh cherry tomatoes or 7 ounces canned cherry tomatoes, preferably Mutti brand\u2022 6-7 fresh basil leaves\u2022 Extra virgin olive oil, as needed\u2022 Salt and pepper, according to taste\u2022 Freshly grated Parmesan cheese1.

{"Headline": "Video Review: A Family-Friendly Ferrari, for the Family of Means", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenFew of us have the disposable income that allows a choice between a useful crossover and a Ferrari. But for the fortunate few, Ferrari, the automaker from Maranello, Italy, provides a family-friendly choice. The GTC4Lusso seats four fairly comfortably, though its high performance may scare the Pampers off the twins.This is not the first shooting brake from Ferrari. The departing FF had a profile similar to the GTC4, but the new model is far more fetching. Both have all-wheel drive (a rear-drive version of the GTC4 with a turbocharged V8 is scheduled for 2018). Lusso\u2019s all-wheel-drive system is unique in that the front wheels are connected to a two-speed transmission while the back gets a seven-speed. Once the rear unit slips into fifth gear, the front transmission disengages, turning this Ferrari into a rear-drive car.The engine, which doubles as a piece of modern sculpture, is a 6.3-liter V12. Think about it: The cylinder count is equal to three Honda CR-Vs. There are 680 horsepower and 514 pound-feet of torque to summon. Nearing the red line of 8,250 r.p.m.s, a wicked snarl barks from the four exhaust pipes. Drive modes cover everything from dropping off the babysitter to slicing up the autobahn. This can be a relaxing car to drive (as relaxed as one can be driving a $377,000 car). The adaptive suspension can be softened for commuting. In comfort mode, it\u2019s, well, comfortable, though at a couple of inches longer than a Toyota Highlander, it is not petite.Stuffed with sound insulation and clad with laminated glass, the GTC4Lusso is moderately quiet until the throttle is dropped. Then, the wonderful cutting exhaust note floods the cabin like the world\u2019s most precise and expensive chain saw. There\u2019s no need to spring for the $6,243 premium audio system with a live performance like that.This being a Ferrari, the V12 propels this 4,230-pound machine in the expected rapid fashion. Its 0-to-60 mile per hour time of 3.3 seconds is easy to replicate with launch control. Ferrari claims the top speed is 208 miles an hour. (I didn\u2019t verify that, if you\u2019re wondering.)Carbon ceramic brakes will bring it to a rest in an amusement-park-ride manner. Those brakes are fade free, even after multiple panic stops. A warning, though: Demonstrating this with the clan onboard will lead to carsickness. Guaranteed.Driving hard will surely return fuel economy lower than the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s rating of 12 miles per gallon in the city and 17 on the highway on the required premium gas. I\u2019ll be passing the hat to cover my expenses there.GTC4Lusso\u2019s controls are quite different from those of most other cars. The Formula One-style steering wheel houses the engine start button along with switches for the suspension, windshield wipers, drive modes and turn signals. There are no control stalks. Behind the D-shaped wheel are enormous shifter paddles. Owners will be happy to spend hours learning the Lusso\u2019s operation in the luxurious space. The visual heft of drilled aluminum pedals, the silkiness of the air vents and seemingly 10 cows\u2019 worth of perfect leather must be experienced firsthand.The user interface, with its rich LCD display, is of solid design and layout. Want Apple CarPlay? It\u2019s available \u2014 for an additional $4,219.

{"Headline": "Lenin\u2019s Return From Exile Put Russia on the Fast Track to Revolution", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Catherine Merridale is well-known for her books on Soviet history, particularly for \u201cRed Fortress,\u201d her account of the Kremlin, and \u201cNight of Stone,\u201d on how Russians coped with violent death in the 20th century. Her latest book, \u201cLenin on the Train,\u201d has a tighter focus than these and vividly reminds us how the fateful events of 1917 depended on a seemingly small episode: Vladimir Lenin\u2019s return to Russia from political exile in Switzerland.With all the inevitable attention on the Bolshevik takeover in October 1917, when Lenin and Leon Trotsky seized power from the ill-fated provisional government, the extraordinary events of February and March should not be forgotten. It was then that unexpected riots over lack of food and fuel by thousands of people in the imperial capital of Petrograd and the ensuing mutiny by garrison troops compelled Czar Nicholas II to abdicate, ending 300 years of Romanov rule and handing political authority to a group of high-minded liberal figures. \u201cRussia became the freest country in the world,\u201d Merridale writes, \u201cas the new government granted an amnesty for political prisoners, abolished the death penalty and dissolved what was left of the detested secret police.\u201d (It also abolished the infamous Pale of Settlement, which had required the czar\u2019s Jewish subjects to live within a defined area of the country; they were now made equal before the law.)The provisional government inherited power from a discredited autocracy that had resisted any sensible move to establish a constitutional monarchy. Leaders like Alexander Kerensky, Paul Miliukov and Georgy Lvov tried in vain to establish a stable government and withstand the appeal of extreme forces. But the Romanov collapse was so sudden and so thorough that it left no credible institutions capable of governing effectively, let alone in the midst of widespread social turmoil, an imploding economy and the devastations of World War I.To explain the significance of Lenin\u2019s return a month after the czar\u2019s abdication, Merridale reconstructs a familiar story: how the war sapped confidence in the monarchy; how the provisional government had to share power with the radical Soviet of Workers\u2019 Deputies; and how Lenin, learning about the autocracy\u2019s collapse from his place of exile in Zurich, was so bent on returning that he accepted the assistance of Germany to travel more than 2,000 miles over eight days in a sealed railway car through Germany, Sweden and Finland before finally reaching Petrograd in April. (The exact date varies depending on what calendar you cite; unlike most other countries in the world, Russia in 1917 still used the Julian calendar.) Lenin\u2019s sojourn in Zurich remains the stuff of popular imagination; both Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (in a book called, simply, \u201cLenin in Zurich\u201d) and Tom Stoppard (in his play \u201cTravesties\u201d) depicted Lenin in Zurich plotting revolution.Merridale\u2019s account benefits from her thorough research, particularly concerning the circumstances surrounding Lenin\u2019s return; the train\u2019s route, which has confused earlier historians; and the intentions of the Germans, whose armies faced Russian forces on the Eastern front. Lenin had always opposed the war, giving Kaiser Wilhelm II\u2019s regime hope that his return would have the effect of \u201cdisabling the Russian colossus\u201d by undermining the provisional government\u2019s resolve to remain loyal to its British and French allies and not seek a separate peace. But Lenin understood he was compromising his credibility by cooperating with the hated German enemy. Lenin, moreover, had accepted the kaiser\u2019s money \u2014 \u201cGerman gold\u201d \u2014 to help finance Bolshevik propaganda and amplify his strident appeals against the provisional government and anyone, Bolshevik or otherwise, who thought of cooperating with it. If his enemies were to confirm his reliance on the kaiser\u2019s assistance, he would face arrest for treason and the collapse of the Bolsheviks\u2019 aim to seize power. But Lenin, unable to travel by boat because of Britain\u2019s refusal to help leftist exiles like him, believed he had no alternative except to work with Berlin. (After Trotsky set off by boat from New York at the end of March, British officials arrested him in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and held him for a month with German prisoners of war. Trotsky gained his release only after vehement protests in Russia; he reached Petrograd a month after Lenin.)The cover of \u201cLenin on the Train\u201d portends the trouble to follow. In a notorious Soviet-era painting, Lenin is shown descending from the train to greet an exuberant crowd of admirers at Petrograd\u2019s Finland Station. Behind him looms the image of a smiling Stalin, as if that future tyrant had been aboard as well \u2014 \u201ca visual fairy tale,\u201d in Merridale\u2019s words, to reinforce Stalin\u2019s claim that he had always been Lenin\u2019s principal lieutenant. In fact, Stalin had faced internal exile in Siberia before reaching Petrograd in March. Lenin was greeted by hundreds of followers, among them prominent Bolsheviks like Lev Kamenev and Fedor Raskolnikov, while others, most notably Grigory Zinoviev and Grigory Sokolnikov, accompanied him on the train. Stalin later had them killed.But it was Lenin himself who made it clear that the Bolsheviks would reject democratic values. He \u201chad not traveled back to join a coalition,\u201d Merridale writes, but to undermine the provisional government and establish a dictatorship in the name of the proletariat. It was Lenin who instituted severe censorship, established one-party rule and resorted to terror against his political enemies. Stalin took these measures to further extremes for his own sinister purposes. Merridale is right to recall Winston Churchill\u2019s famous observation about Lenin\u2019s return. The Germans, Churchill wrote, \u201cturned upon Russia the most grisly of all weapons. They transported Lenin in a sealed truck like a plague bacillus from Switzerland to Russia.\u201dJoshua Rubenstein\u2019s most recent book is \u201cThe Last Days of Stalin.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Imposes New Sanctions on Russia Over Ukraine Incursion", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration ratcheted up pressure on Russia on Tuesday, unveiling sanctions on more than three dozen additional individuals and organizations that have participated in the country\u2019s incursion in Ukraine.The Treasury Department made the announcement on the same day that President Trump hosted his Ukrainian counterpart, Petro O. Poroshenko, at the White House to discuss a peaceful resolution to the conflict with Russia. The sanctions also came as Mr. Trump continues to face questions about whether his campaign colluded with Russia to help him defeat Hillary Clinton.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there should be no sanctions relief for Russia until it meets its obligations under the Minsk agreements \u2014 the 2015 cease-fire deal between Russia and Ukraine.\u201cThese designations will maintain pressure on Russia to work toward a diplomatic solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThis administration is committed to a diplomatic process that guarantees Ukrainian sovereignty.\u201dMr. Putin was asked last week on his nationwide live call-in show whether Russia could weather sanctions indefinitely. He said the West had been trying to contain Russia for hundreds of years with such measures, with Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea the latest excuse.In some ways, he said, sanctions have made the country stronger as it has grown more self-reliant, but they have also harmed the Russian economy and Western countries that interact with it. \u201cAll of these restrictions do not produce anything good, and we should work toward a global economy that functions without these restrictions,\u201d Mr. Putin said.Asked about the latest sanctions at a news conference on Tuesday, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said that they were once again adopted \u201cout of the clear blue sky\u201d and that he regretted the \u201cRussophobic obsession\u201d of the United States.The 38 individuals and entities newly designated by the Treasury Department were largely involved in efforts to try to knit Crimea and the breakaway Donbass region in eastern Ukraine more closely to Russia. A few were cheerleaders for the efforts.Given that few of the individuals and entities have any known interactions outside Russia or areas of Ukraine under Russian influence, it is unclear that the sanctions will have an immediate effect on their work.Various shell companies and banks used to extend Russian influence in the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk were designated, as were officials who had suggested measures like using the Russian ruble in the region or issuing local passports that Russia would recognize.In Crimea, the company insuring a $3 billion project to build a bridge linking the peninsula to the mainland was targeted, as well as a tourism project in the coastal city of Alushta.Among the most intriguing sanctions were those involving a motorcycle gang, Mr. Putin\u2019s chef and a shadowy company that supplies contract soldiers to Russian military efforts overseas.Aleksandr Zaldostanov, an ardent Putin supporter who is the leader of the nationalistic Night Wolves motorcycle club and is known as the Surgeon, was previously the subject of sanctions. This time, two administrators and two organizations with ties to the Night Wolves, including the group\u2019s Bike Center in Moscow, faced sanctions.The new sanctions were also directed against Dmitry Utkin, the founder of PMC Wagner, a private military contractor that the Treasury Department said had recruited soldiers to join separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine.One Russian politician, Vladimir Dzhabarov, suggested that Moscow would weigh some manner of retaliation right away.\u201cWe have to react calmly and, perhaps, to take a political decision on countermeasures,\u201d Mr. Dzhabarov, the first deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian Parliament, was quoted as saying by the Tass news agency.As a candidate, Mr. Trump suggested that his presidency would herald a new era of improved relations between the United States and Russia, but the various investigations into possible collusion by his campaign have dampened those hopes. Instead, members of Congress have become increasingly resentful of Russian efforts to interfere in American politics.Hal Eren, a former Treasury official who worked in the department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control in the 1990s, said the Trump administration\u2019s move on Tuesday was probably related to concerns about Congress trying to tie its hands.\u201cI think it was prompted by this contemplated legislation and meant as a way for the administration to say, \u2018Look, we are doing something about this, and there is no need for this law,\u2019\u201d Mr. Eren said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to say that Trump is tough on Russia.\u201dAlan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Rising Minimum Wage Affects Jobs in Seattle", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past week, two studies have purported to demonstrate the effects of the first stages of that increase \u2014 but with starkly diverging results.The Berkeley study focused on the restaurant industry because of the high proportion of restaurant workers who are paid the minimum wage. It found that for every 10 percent that the minimum wage rose, wages in the industry rose nearly 1 percent, and that there was no discernible effect on employment.The University of Washington authors held one significant advantage over other economists studying the issue: detailed data on hours and earnings for workers affected by the increase.This data allowed the researchers to measure the effects of the minimum wage on workers in all industries rather than relying on restaurants as a stand-in, a common technique. It also allowed them to measure a change in hours worked, a potentially more complete indication of the effect of a minimum-wage increase than the employee head count that many studies use.The University of Washington researchers found that the minimum-wage increase resulted in higher wages, but also a significant reduction in the working hours of low-wage earners. This was especially true of the more recent minimum-wage increase, from as high as $11 an hour to up to $13 an hour in 2016. In that case, wages rose about 3 percent, but the number of hours worked by those in low-wage jobs dropped about 9 percent \u2014 a sizable amount that led to a net loss of earnings on average.But experts on the minimum wage questioned the methods of the University of Washington researchers.Most seriously, skeptics argue that the researchers confused the effects of a minimum-wage increase with the effects of a hot labor market. During a boom, which Seattle has experienced in recent years, employers bid up wages, effectively replacing low-wage jobs with higher-paying ones.Under such a scenario, one would expect to see a decline in the overall number of hours worked in low-wage jobs. In their place would be a significant increase in hours worked at somewhat higher-paying jobs.\u201cThe key challenge this study faces is how to separate the normal shift that\u2019s happening in a booming labor market \u2014 where low-wage jobs disappear and are replaced by higher-wage jobs \u2014 from an actual increase in the minimum wage,\u201d said Ben Zipperer, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. \u201cThis study exhibits signs that it\u2019s not able to do it.\u201dThe most reliable way to distinguish between the two scenarios, both of which are consistent with the data in the University of Washington study, is to compare Seattle with a similar city that did not raise its minimum wage. If the comparison city, known as a control, did not experience a loss in hours worked similar to Seattle\u2019s, this would suggest that the minimum-wage increase was to blame for the reduction of hours in Seattle.If the comparison city did experience a loss in hours similar to Seattle\u2019s, then the booming labor market could be the culprit in both places.The University of Washington study essentially constructed such a control by splicing together other areas of Washington State, an analytical tool known as a synthetic control. In doing so, the researchers found that the decline in hours in Seattle was unique. The control did not exhibit a similar pattern of lower hours.But Mr. Zipperer was skeptical that the control is valid. He argued that there is, in effect, only one Seattle in the state of Washington \u2014 only one large city with a booming labor market. As a result, the control may not be much of a control at all: It does not illustrate what would happen absent a minimum-wage increase in a booming city like Seattle. It illustrates what would happen absent a minimum-wage increase in a city that is not booming.This, in turn, invites the original question: Is Seattle\u2019s boom driving the loss of low-paying work, or is its minimum-wage increase to blame?Micah Simler, whose window-washing business in Seattle has three employees and 15 contractors, said he had already been paying much more than $15 an hour because of the local economy, not the wage law.\u201cSeattle is in a boom time right now, and I\u2019m competing with construction companies\u201d and many other businesses for employees, he said.The $15-an-hour minimum wage went into effect for large businesses that do not provide health insurance on Jan. 1 of this year, and it will gradually go into effect for other businesses in future years.Others in the business community believe the minimum wage increases may be having a negative effect on employment. \u201cWe think the U.W. study needs to be taken seriously by the city because the data echoes the anecdotes we\u2019ve been hearing,\u201d said Jillian Henze, a spokeswoman for the Seattle Restaurant Alliance.Mark C. Long, one of the authors of the University of Washington study, said he felt reasonably confident in his team\u2019s results because the largest loss of hours occurred in 2016, just after the minimum-wage increase to $13 an hour went into effect.\u201cYou see the biggest difference in the effect when the minimum wage increased from $11 to $13,\u201d he said. \u201cThe timing suggests it\u2019s the minimum wage\u201d as opposed to a booming economy.The study hinges \u201con the quality of the control group,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the areas we\u2019re picking to put weight on don\u2019t match what would have happened to Seattle in the absence of the minimum wage, our results would be potentially biased.\u201dAngela Stowell, an owner and the chief executive of Ethan Stowell Restaurants, which has about 300 employees in 14 restaurants around the city, said it was too early to judge the effect of the minimum-wage law because it was still being phased in. But she said the chain had not reduced hiring because of the higher employee costs, though it has increased some menu prices and instituted a 20 percent service fee.\u201cOf the 20 restaurateurs I am close friends with in Seattle,\u201d she said, \u201cnone have told me they are hiring fewer staff due to the increased minimum wage.\u201dJulie Weed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Largest Staff Ever, New York City Reimagines How It Works", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter serving a tour in the sticky rice and fruit fields of northeast Thailand for the Peace Corps, Leanne Spaulding landed a job at a Virginia-based trade association, working her way to a master\u2019s degree from Duke University in environmental management.Now Ms. Spaulding is in New York, where she was recently hired by the city\u2019s Sanitation Department.The hiring has allowed the de Blasio administration to restaff agencies that were cut back by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg after the economic downturn of 2008. But Mr. de Blasio has gone far further, expanding the work force beyond its pre-recession peak, a costly investment that is not without risk: the city could be vulnerable to an economic downturn.Carol Kellermann, the president of the nonprofit Citizens Budget Commission, a fiscal watchdog group, questioned Mr. de Blasio\u2019s decision to rapidly grow the city\u2019s head count during flush times, saying that it made it more likely that new rounds of painful layoffs could be necessary in the city\u2019s future.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep adding people every year,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could manage what you have and use the staff that you have to run programs. Find a way to do the things you want to do with the existing work force.\u201dPolice officers have been given unstructured time to engage with neighborhood residents and hear complaints, eschewing the blare of the radio for conversations.Sanitation workers are now flanked by civilian outreach teams in blue dress shirts with expertise in project management and mulch, helping New Yorkers make sense of its new composting plan.And the Department of Investigation has added inspectors general for the police as well as the city\u2019s hospitals, growing faster than every other area of city government. Its full-time staff of 352 is up almost 70 percent from where it was three years ago.\u201cAdditional police officers. Additional traffic enforcement agents. Additional pre-K teachers. Additional correction officers,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at a recent news conference. \u201cAll that makes sense.\u201dMr. de Blasio has been sensitive to the long-term implications of the city\u2019s growing work force, from pensions to benefits: The average pension cost per employee of the city government is about $29,500 a year out of a total average compensation of $140,000, according to an analysis by the Citizens Budget Commission of the current fiscal year\u2019s personnel spending and actual city head count.The mayor\u2019s latest budget set aside $1.2 billion in reserves and adding hundreds of millions to a retiree health benefit trust fund. Mr. de Blasio has said that, if and when hard times return, he would not oppose cutting back.The Bloomberg administration laid off thousands of workers after the recessions of 2002 and 2008, refilling those positions when the economy turned around. That created dramatic swings that \u201care not conducive to stable, consistent delivery of city services,\u201d Ms. Kellermann, of the Citizens Budget Commission, said.The trouble is that the mayor has few levers to pull on his own should good times end. Under Mayor Bloomberg, the city raised property tax rates in response to the recession. (A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio said he had no plans to raise property taxes, but did not rule out ever doing so.)For the moment, more employees mean more and new tasks. But how that plays out day to day is not always readily apparent.On a recent Thursday morning, a call came in requesting assistance for a pedestrian hit by a car in the Bronx. Fritz Joseph, 45, a Bronx paramedic since 1997, and his partner, Capt. Jason Saffon of the Fire Department\u2019s Emergency Medical Service, were the first to arrive \u2014 not in an ambulance, but in a so-called fly car, a specially outfitted truck that rushes to serious emergencies but does not transport patients.The fly car \u2014 one of 10 in use in the Bronx, the first borough to try the approach \u2014 is meant to reach patients on the street more quickly than an ambulance, and to stay on the street when the emergency has passed. It\u2019s a system that has been used in other American cities as well as in Europe.\u201cWe definitely do more jobs,\u201d Mr. Joseph said. \u201cAlmost one an hour.\u201dAt the scene of the pedestrian accident, Mr. Joseph and Captain Saffon arrived just before the ambulance. A woman had been struck at slow speed in the parking lot of a Stop-and-Shop supermarket, and they helped her up. It seemed that she would not need further help, but after learning she was diabetic and testing her blood sugar, they decided to ride with her in the ambulance to the emergency room, to begin an IV.At the Sanitation Department, staff members have been hired to work at its new transfer stations, to beef up its data-driven approach to snow removal and garbage routes, to upgrade its garages to include bathrooms for women, and to promote its composting initiative.On a recent Friday morning in brownstone Brooklyn, some of the Sanitation Department\u2019s nonuniformed workers handed out small brown bags filled with dirt from the city\u2019s landfill that look like \u2014 and have been mistaken for \u2014 artisanal coffee beans. The bags showcase the end product of the composting process, and the dirt can be used in flowerpots and gardens.The Sanitation Department has grown its civilian ranks by 14 percent since 2014 \u2014 to 2,150 workers, in addition to the 7,600 uniformed sanitation employees \u2014 by recruiting people like Ms. Spaulding, the composting expert.\u201cThe unit that oversees this, it was three people,\u201d Ms. Spaulding said, wearing a shirt with the agency\u2019s logo and the words Recycling and Sustainability embroidered below. \u201cIt\u2019s really exploded. I hope we grow more. There\u2019s a need for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Trump Country, Renewable Energy Is Thriving", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo years ago, Kansas repealed a law requiring that 20 percent of the state\u2019s electric power come from renewable sources by 2020, seemingly a step backward on energy in a deeply conservative state.Yet by the time the law was scrapped, it had become largely irrelevant. Kansas blew past that 20 percent target in 2014, and last year generated more than 30 percent of its power from wind. The state may be the first in the country to hit 50 percent wind generation in a year or two, unless Iowa gets there first.Some of the fastest progress on clean energy is occurring in states led by Republican governors and legislators, and states carried by Donald J. Trump in the presidential election.The five states that get the largest percentage of their power from wind turbines \u2014 Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, Oklahoma and North Dakota \u2014 all voted for Mr. Trump. So did Texas, which produces the most wind power in absolute terms. In fact, 69 percent of the wind power produced in the country comes from states that Mr. Trump carried in November.Renewable energy that produces no carbon dioxide emissions is not solely a coastal, blue-state phenomenon. From Georgia to the Dakotas, business and political leaders are embracing clean energy sources even as the Trump administration pushes for more exploitation of oil, gas and coal.The clean energy push allows their utilities to lock in low power prices for decades, creates manufacturing jobs, puts steady money in the hands of farmers who host wind turbines and lures big employers who want renewable power.Mr. Brownback got what he wanted: Since he spoke, wind power production in Kansas has nearly tripled, and the state is now an exporter of clean electricity.Whatever the motives, the push in the red states does help to lower emissions, which means their goals tacitly align with those of blue states worried about climate change.So a question is coming into focus: In an era when Washington no longer cares about emissions, could federalism \u2014 encouraging each state to pursue its own clean energy goals, for its own reasons \u2014 be the way forward for those trying to tackle the climate crisis?In modern America, advocacy of states\u2019 rights is often seen as a conservative stance, an aspect of the right\u2019s general hostility to a large national government. But Michael Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University, pointed out that causes like giving women the right to vote and, more recently, allowing same-sex marriage had often succeeded at the state level first.\u201cIn the American system, the states have enormous powers, which sometimes are used for progressive causes,\u201d Dr. Kazin said.More than a decade ago, frustrated by federal inaction, climate change activists and clean energy enthusiasts joined forces to push state governments to adopt binding targets for renewable energy. Climate change was a less divisive issue then, and a majority of the states \u2014 including many of the windy Great Plains states \u2014 did so, often setting targets to be met by 2020 or 2025.Analysts have found that most states are on track to meet their targets, usually well ahead of schedule. In recent years, the conservative advocacy organizations founded by the industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch have tried to get the targets repealed, but they have largely failed.Nationally, solar power has made serious headway in a few states, like California, but wind energy is the bigger success story. Turbines now supply almost 6 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity, and studies suggest they could eventually supply a third or more.A looming threat to the growth of renewables is that the Trump administration may push for an early end to federal subsidies that improve the economics. But those are already scheduled to be phased out in coming years, and a proposal to scrap them early would probably encounter fierce resistance from members of both parties in Congress. They see the subsidies as an investment to drive renewable energy costs down by expanding the market and capturing economies of scale. The wind and solar industries are also creating jobs.In reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s election and his abandonment of the Obama administration\u2019s climate goals, Democratic states like New York and California are redoubling their efforts. Both states have resolved to get 50 percent of their power from renewable energy, and California is debating whether to set a target of 100 percent by 2045.Perhaps the big question now is whether the blue states, motivated by the urgency of climate change, can offer the red states anything that might induce them to move even faster on renewable energy.One possibility is cash. California and other Western states are discussing linking their electricity markets more closely, which would allow more renewable energy generated in the red states to flow to California consumers \u2014 and move California money into the pockets of red-state landowners.Another possibility is that red and blue states could join forces to get power lines built faster. Studies suggest that Kansas alone could, in theory, supply a majority of the nation\u2019s electricity using wind turbines, if enough power lines are available to move it to market.As renewable energy costs keep falling, the chances for such cooperation between blue and red states will increase. So even as the Trump administration seems to sit out the climate emergency, experts who spend time talking to governors see a way forward.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Is Set for a Big Gamble With China\u2019s Carbon Trading Market", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut this is a high-visibility, high-stakes gamble for Mr. Xi. He seems eager to take the initiative from the United States on trade, multilateral cooperation and climate change. His record on the environment and market reforms, though, is mixed, and China\u2019s carbon trading plan is not a sure bet to succeed.Making the trade run smoothly could take years and test Mr. Xi\u2019s vows to let markets expand and to curtail polluting industries. Major setbacks in the nascent market could embarrass China and undermine global support for using cap-and-trade measures to reduce the greenhouse gases that are causing warming.Mr. Trump\u2019s renunciation of the Paris agreement could also drag on China\u2019s expansion of emissions trading by making powerful companies and industry associations more reluctant to accept pollution cuts, Mr. Wang said.\u201cIt\u2019s a really complicated task,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s precisely why China must work on this in a steady way and mustn\u2019t fail. If China\u2019s carbon market fails, that will be a big blow not just to China but also to global carbon markets.\u201dThe idea behind cap and trade is that companies that cut pollution are rewarded, while laggards pay a higher price. The government sets a ceiling on the amount of pollution allowed and divides that into emissions permits issued or sold to businesses. Participating factories, power plants and other enterprises can use their permits to discharge pollution; cut pollution and sell or save leftover permits; or buy more permits, often at punishing prices, if they use up their allotment.Governments can over time lower the allowed emissions, making permits scarcer and magnifying price pressures on companies to cut pollution.If China gets past these problems, it will create the world\u2019s biggest emissions market, overshadowing the European Union\u2019s, and that could deepen China\u2019s influence over developing new energy technology, Chinese policy advisers said.For now, Chinese officials are planning a relatively modest start and have retreated from their initially high ambitions.\u201cIt\u2019s still going to be a massive challenge to make it work,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who thinks that the Chinese scheme will be effective in making big cuts in emissions from the start is going to be disappointed.\u201dA basic challenge will be persuading thousands of Chinese companies to put their trust and capital in a limited market for carbon dioxide, which most have discharged without weighing the environmental cost.Some observers said that even with this trial run, China\u2019s lax statistics and enforcement of rules could hobble the national market. But others said the trade itself would amplify pressure for reliable numbers.After the national market officially opens, it will be more a test exercise until around 2020, while officials and companies work out how to allocate permits and regulate the market. Companies are likely to receive generous initial allocations of permits, meaning that they will have to buy or bid for only a fraction of the allowances they need to emit. Market purchases will expand only gradually.\u201cThe realities of the political process are that a carbon tax is unlikely in the short term,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cPolitically, this is more difficult than launching the carbon market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amateur Soccer in New York, Built on Immigrant Pride", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the New York Pancyprian Freedoms play their Greek American counterparts on the soccer field below him, Philip Christopher is telling a story. It\u2019s one of Christopher\u2019s favorites as the Freedoms\u2019 founding president, from the days when his team represented the cream of American soccer.In 1984, the Pancyprian Freedoms had won the right to represent the United States in the Concacaf Champions Cup, a regional club tournament. It was quite an honor for a small New York team, and after they were drawn to face the Honduran club C.D.S. Vida, the traveling party boarded a plane for Tegucigalpa.\u201cThe American ambassador to Honduras came to the airport to receive the American team, and all my boys were speaking Greek,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cHe was saying, \u2018What are all these kids speaking?\u2019 I had to explain to him that we were the American team, but we weren\u2019t exactly All-American boys.\u201dThe line of Pancyprian officials seated beside Christopher in the bare-bones \u201cexecutive\u201d box at St John\u2019s University Belson Stadium shrug along in low-key agreement. They have surely heard this story before and are well aware that there were 43,000 fans at the game in Honduras, and about 14,000 more for the return leg at Hofstra.It is safe to say the attendance at Friday\u2019s game \u2014 the final match of the New York Cosmopolitan League\u2019s regular season \u2014 will top out at rather less than 14,000. In fact, an unscientific head count suggests the players outnumber the spectators.This is life in the Cosmopolitan League, one of the top amateur soccer leagues in the country and, in its various incarnations, also one of the oldest. Founded in 1923 by five teams of Germanic immigrants as the German-American league, the league has operated continually since, reaching a high-water mark in the 1950s and 1960s as global events and economies pushed players to the New York market.The league has seen the ebbs and flows of American soccer as it has evolved through everything from foreign wars to industrial fortunes to globalization. Within the sport itself, the Cosmopolitan League has also witnessed the rise and fall and return of the North American Soccer League, the creation of Major League Soccer and the media phenomenon the European game has become in the digital era.And through it all, it has represented a kind of core sample of both New York immigration and some enduring elements of American soccer.\u201cIn the 1950s people were moving to New York, playing in the German-American League and earning $500 a game,\u201d said Bill Marth, the league\u2019s general secretary. \u201cEven in the top division in England at the time, people were making virtually nothing, so players actually came to New York and were making more money playing in this league.\u201dMoney spoke so loudly only in those days, when teams still largely hewed to ethnic lines and affiliations. In the 1950s, the league was dominated by teams like Hungaria SC \u2014 a squad built around players fleeing the response to the Hungarian uprising of 1956. Several top Hungarian internationals played for the team, in a decade when Hungary\u2019s so-called Magnificent Magyars set the standard for the global game and reached the World Cup final in 1954.The Pancyprian Freedoms, too, emerged out of political trauma. Christopher pinpointed the founding of the team to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on July 20, 1974. He was an expat playing recreational soccer in New York when the invasion occurred, and with a group of friends decided to form a team that they said would not only compete locally, but also would \u201cproject the image of Cyprus.\u201d The organization quickly transcended soccer.\u201cWe built the Pancyprian Community Center in Astoria, and from there the club expanded into many more areas than just football,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cWe were called the Eleutheria Pancyprians \u2014 Eleutheria means freedom. We have a cultural division, a women\u2019s division. We have players that are involved with the community, that are involved with our youth teams.\u201dThe club also sponsors students headed to college, he added. Rather than paying them money as players, \u201cwe give them scholarships,\u201d he said.But credibility on the field has always been a key part of the club\u2019s identity. The Freedoms quickly established a friendly but heated rivalry with the more established Greek American Athletic Association, and another against the Brooklyn Italians.\u201cOur rivalry was crazy,\u201d Christopher said of games against the Greeks and Italians. \u201cI mean you feared for your life to go to Brooklyn. We had to separate the fans. The Greeks on one side, the Italians on the other. I mean, it was an ethnic sport \u2014\u2014\u201dThe thought remained unfinished. Soccer in the United States has long struggled with exactly that perception \u2014 that it is an immigrant sport whose appeal was niche, if not downright suspicious. Marth remembers the period when the league\u2019s profile became a source of crisis as much as strength.For a time, the growing show business profile of the N.A.S.L. led the Cosmopolitan League to abandon its immigrant roots, Christopher said, and to order its teams to Americanize their names. Greek American became the New York Astros. The Brooklyn Italians became the Brooklyn Dodgers.Christopher said he would willingly put any Pancyprian Freedoms team from that era up against any M.L.S. side of today \u2014 that was the time, after all, when the league was cradling players like Claudio Reyna, a future national team captain. But these days the closest the league comes to M.L.S., other than an occasional Open Cup run, is by absorbing some of the professional players who have fallen through the M.L.S. or M.L.S. reserve team ranks.The rest of the Cosmpolitan League is a melting pot of players: immigrants new and old, but also players who have grown up playing together on club-sponsored youth teams, as is often the case with Pancyprian Freedoms. By the time players reach adulthood, however, careers in telecoms, engineering and construction have taken priority over soccer training.Traces of the league\u2019s heyday remain, however. Ethnic team names and immigrant-driven teams once again dominate the Cosmopolitan League. At St. John\u2019s a few weeks ago, Greek American arrived looking for a result that would allow the team to join the third-place Pancyprian Freedoms in the playoffs. Irish clubs inspired by a more recent wave of Irish immigration \u2014 Lansdowne Bhoys and Shamrock SC \u2014 had already claimed their places.In the executive suite, Christopher and his board watched the teams play to a 1-1 draw that gave the Greek Americans what they need to reach the postseason and maintained the Freedoms\u2019 honor. Soon, Christopher and his entourage made their way to the parking lot, exchanging amicable pleasantries with their Greek American counterparts and anticipating the playoffs. There is pride at stake. But soccer remains firmly in perspective.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Solving the Korea Crisis by Teaching a Horse to Sing", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Some stories have to be experienced to fully grasp \u2014 the Korea crisis is one of them. I arrived in Seoul on the evening of May 28. As I was dressing for breakfast the next morning, I was jarred by a news alert ringing on my phone: North Korea had just fired a short-range ballistic missile that had landed in the sea off its east coast.I was immediately reminded of my favorite quote from when I lived in Beirut during the Lebanese civil war, where people also became inured to the constant threat of violence. It was from a Beirut hostess who asked her dinner guests, \u201cWould you like to eat now or wait for the cease-fire?\u201dA few hours after the missile test, two U.S. B-1B Lancer strategic bombers out of Guam flew right up to the North\u2019s border on what North Korea called \u201ca nuclear bomb dropping drill.\u201d No matter. The South Korean stock market didn\u2019t flinch.In fact, one of the most popular housing markets for young Koreans today is Musan, located just south of the DMZ, the demilitarized zone separating the South from the North. It\u2019s an easy commute to Seoul, and young people have gamed out that if the North launched rockets or artillery shells, they would likely go over their heads because they are so close to the border! Human beings! God love \u2019em. Their ability to adapt never ceases to amaze me.I interviewed a group of South Korean college students at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, and here\u2019s what some said: \u201cThe fear has been diluted \u2014 as time goes by you just get used to it.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t really believe that North Korea can harm us or launch war, because we think we are stronger than them economically and militarily.\u201d \u201cWe heard the G.D.P. gap between us and North Korea is 20 times, and we don\u2019t want to pay more taxes to fix them up.\u201d \u201cWhen I went to the U.S. I freaked out [over] why people there care more about North Korea than me.\u201dThat would spill refugees and fissile material into China and South Korea, presenting both with a huge cleanup bill and China with a possible united Korea with a nuclear weapon next door.Or, as Rob Litwak, the Wilson Center Korea arms control expert, described it: Seoul\u2019s fear that Donald Trump could draw it into a catastrophic conflict on the Korean Peninsula \u201cbrings to mind Charles de Gaulle\u2019s admonition during the Cuban missile crisis that being a U.S. ally ran the risk of \u2018annihilation without representation.\u2019\u201dAnd that\u2019s why the U.S. has dispatched to South Korea Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile batteries. But the new South Korean president is delaying their full deployment, fearing it will provoke the North or alienate China \u2014 which doesn\u2019t like a U.S. antimissile system near its border that can also cover its airspace; China has imposed a partial economic boycott on Seoul to make that clear.Chaibong Hahm, president of the Asan Institute, explained, \u201cWhen North Korea started to develop weapons of mass destruction that threatened us, the U.S. tried to assure us and Japan that \u2018we will protect you.\u2019\u201d Hahm said: \u201cAnd the big question then was: \u2018Is the U.S. deterrence real? Will it really protect us?\u2019\u201dBut when North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un also started threatening the U.S. by building a long-range nuclear missile, the story shifted for America. \u201cIt was not about reassuring us anymore but its own people,\u201d added Hahm, \u201cwhich means that Washington does not have to consult us. It can do what it needs to do.\u201d And Trump\u2019s America-first rhetoric only amplifies the worry here that he will. Some people \u201care more scared of [Trump] than Kim Jong-un,\u201d concluded Hahm. \u201cKim Jong-un they understand.\u201dNorth Korea gets 95 percent of its oil from China. Beijing could shut down the North\u2019s economy overnight by shutting off that oil. But it hasn\u2019t. It has suspended purchases of North Korean coal, hurting Pyongyang financially, but not enough to stop missile testing. For now, it appears that China will do just enough to keep Trump at bay \u2014 by keeping North Korea from putting the last screws on a nuclear missile that can hit the U.S. \u2014 but never enough to collapse the regime or definitively end its nuclear program.What about diplomacy? For now, North Korea shows no willingness to trade its nuclear arsenal for guarantees that the U.S. will not pursue regime change, and Trump is not going to give such guarantees without total denuclearization.In sum, China and South Korea don\u2019t dare starve the North for fear it could collapse. They don\u2019t dare shoot it for fear it could shoot back. They and the Americans don\u2019t dare negotiate with Kim for fear that they will end up blessing his nukes \u2014 and because they don\u2019t trust him to keep any deal. And they don\u2019t dare ignore him, because he keeps getting stronger.Indeed, the whole situation reminds me of the medieval fable of the criminal hauled before the king to plead for his life and successfully does so by promising that if the king spared his life for a year he could teach the king\u2019s favorite horse to sing.When the criminal got back to his cell, his cellmate scoffed at him: You could never teach the king\u2019s horse to sing if you had a lifetime. And the man said: \u201cNo matter. I have a year now that I didn\u2019t have before. And a lot of things can happen in a year. The king might die. The horse might die. I might die. And, who knows? Maybe the horse will sing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Central Bank Meeting Focuses on \u2018Forward Guidance\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Forward guidance might sound like something to mount on the dashboard of a car. But in the world of monetary policy it is a crucial concept, one that was the focus of the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting on Thursday.In its latest policy-setting discussion, the bank moved ever so cautiously toward the day when it will ease off on the stimulus it has been providing to the eurozone economy.Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, sought to address the intense interest among investors and economists in how quickly the central bank will reduce its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a form of money printing known as quantitative easing.But at a news conference afterward, Mr. Draghi expressed more confidence in the eurozone economy. A strong economy is a precondition for any move by the central bank to cut back its bond buying.To prevent market turmoil, Mr. Draghi wants to give investors ample warning of what is coming. But he also wants to leave room to maneuver if economic conditions change.Navigating that communications minefield is what forward guidance is about.Here are some of the important points from the news conference:The European Central Bank has promised to continue buying bonds at least through the end of the year \u201cor beyond, if necessary.\u201dIt is the beyond part that analysts are trying to figure out.Mr. Draghi disappointed those who had predicted he would indicate how long quantitative easing will last beyond December, and how quickly the volume of the purchases will be reduced or tapered. Mr. Draghi refused even to say when the central bank will announce its intentions. \u201cIt was not discussed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.C.B. will be in the market a long time.\u201dMany analysts had expected a stronger statement. The euro fell against the dollar as investors recalibrated their expectations of when the European Central Bank will allow market interest rates to rise.In the meantime, unemployment has continued to fall, while growth has been better than expected. Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics office, on Thursday revised upward its estimate of eurozone growth in the first three months of the year to 0.6 percent from 0.5 percent.But stronger growth will not prompt a change in monetary policy unless it is accompanied by higher inflation, which is still nowhere in sight.The European Central Bank has said it will not touch its benchmark interest rates until it has ended the bond buying program and, in any case, will keep rates low for \u201can extended period of time.\u201dStill, analysts have already begun speculating about when the first rate increases might occur.There was some excitement before the news conference when the central bank, in a routine statement announcing that benchmark interest rates remained unchanged, dropped a phrase emphasizing that it could reduce rates further if needed.The prices of trillions of dollars in bonds and other securities can hang on such minor adjustments in central bank wording.But Mr. Draghi blunted the impact of the change when he said during the news conference that, of course, the central bank can reduce rates at any time and is prepared to do so if needed.He said that the change in phraseology reflected the central bank\u2019s confidence that there is no longer any danger of deflation, a dangerous drop in consumer prices that would require aggressive action to combat.Inflation, the central bank\u2019s most important economic indicator, continues to fluctuate at levels below the official target (which is below but close to 2 percent).As he has in the past, Mr. Draghi dismissed spikes in consumer prices as a result of transient factors, such as the price of oil.In addition, on Thursday the central bank\u2019s in-house economists lowered their forecasts for inflation through 2019, saying in effect that prices are not going anywhere and will remain well below the 2 percent target.The central bank\u2019s main job is to control inflation. As long as price growth remains subdued, it will feel obligated to keep priming the economy.\u201cUnderlying inflation is basically staying what it is today,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Advertisement"}

Victor, a longtime scholar of climate politics at the University of California, San Diego. Many argue that this obligates the United States to take ambitious action to slow global warming.But on Thursday, President Trump announced the United States would withdraw from a 195-nation agreement on climate change reached in Paris in 2015.The decision to walk away from the accord is a momentous setback, in practical and political terms, for the effort to address climate change.An American exit could prompt other countries to withdraw from the pact or rethink their emissions pledges, making it much harder to achieve the agreement\u2019s already difficult goal of limiting global warming to a manageable level.It means the United States \u2014 the country with the largest, most dynamic economy \u2014 is giving up a leadership role when it comes to finding solutions for climate change.\u201cIt is immoral,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, who grew up herding livestock in Kenya and now works in London as a leader on climate issues for Christian Aid, a relief and development group. \u201cThe countries that have done the least to cause the problem are suffering first and worst.\u201d30 billion metric tons25Between 1850-2014Rest of world20IndiaChina15RussiaOther developed10European UnionDeveloped economies5Other countriesUnited States185019002000195030 billion metric tons25Between 1850-2014Rest of world20IndiaChina15RussiaOther developed10European Union 5Developed economiesOther countriesUnited States185019002000195030 billion metric tonsBetween 1850-201425IndiaRest of world20China15RussiaOther developed10European Union Developed economies5Other countriesUnited States1850190019502000Between 1850-201430 billion metric tons20Rest of worldChinaRussia10European Union United States18502014Developed economiesOther countriesBetween 1850-201430 billion metric tons20 Rest of worldChinaRussia10E.U.United States18502014Developed economiesOther countries30 billion metric tons25Between 1850-2014Rest of world20IndiaChina15RussiaOther developed10 European Union 5Developed economiesOther countriesUnited States1850190019502000Some backers of the agreement argued that the large American role in causing climate change creates an outsize responsibility to help fight it, including an obligation to send billions of dollars abroad to help people in poorer countries.The Obama administration pledged $3 billion to an international fund meant to aid the hardest-hit countries. Only $1 billion of that had been transferred to the fund by the time President Trump took office on Jan. 20. On Thursday, he pledged to walk away from the balance of the commitment, though Congress may have the last word.Mr. Trump argued that meeting the terms of the Paris accord would strangle the American economy and lead to major job losses. Many in the manufacturing and fossil fuel industries lobbied for the United States to leave the pact, but corporate opinion has been deeply split. Leaving the Paris deal was a central Trump campaign pledge.While the United States is historically responsible for more emissions than any other country, it is no longer the world\u2019s largest single emitter of greenhouse gases. China surpassed the United States a decade ago, and its emissions today are about double the American figure. Some of China\u2019s emissions are from the production of goods for the United States and other rich countries.But the United States has been burning coal, oil and natural gas far longer, and today the country, with just over 4 percent of the world\u2019s population, is responsible for almost a third of the excess carbon dioxide that is heating the planet. China is responsible for less than a sixth. The 28 countries of the European Union, taken as a group, come in just behind the United States in historical emissions.China has four times as many people as the United States, so the Chinese still burn far less fossil fuel on average than Americans \u2014 less than half as much, in fact. The typical American also burns roughly twice as much as the average person in Europe or in Japan, and 10 times as much as the average person in India.Per person carbon emissions in 2014United States15.1Canada11.9Russia9.6Japan8.9Germany7.5China6.5Britain4.7France3.8Mexico2.6Brazil1.7IndiaUnited States15.1Canada11.9Russia9.6Japan8.9Germany7.5China6.5Britain4.7France3.8Mexico2.6Brazil1.7IndiaThe Trump administration made clear months ago that it would abandon the emissions targets set by President Barack Obama, walk away from pledges of money to help poor countries battle global warming, and seek to cut research budgets aimed at finding solutions to climate change.Experts say the climate crisis has become so acute that every country has to pitch in to help solve it, with no room for emissions in developing countries to reach the high levels that have been typical of rich countries.One of the political breakthroughs that led to the Paris agreement was that nearly all the nations of the world came to grips with that reality and agreed to do what they could to help solve the problem. The agreement recognized that the poorest countries could not afford to do much on their own, which is why they were promised extensive financial and technical help.Energy experts say that poorer countries may be able to develop their economies without depending entirely on fossil fuels, with new technologies like renewable power and electric cars plunging in cost and opening the possibility of a widespread cleanup of the world\u2019s energy system.\u201cNobody really wants barrels of oil or tons of coal,\u201d said John D. Sterman, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a founder of a think tank called Climate Interactive. \u201cThey need a warm, dry, safe place to live, and access to healthy food, and lighting when it\u2019s dark.\u201dIf it turns out that those goods can really be provided with clean energy, that may be the economic opportunity of the 21st century \u2014 and increasingly, countries like China and India seem to see things that way. Recent analyses by Climate Action Tracker, an alliance of European think tanks, suggest that both countries are on track to beat the targets they set in the Paris agreement, even as the United States backs away.The answer: Americans would have used up their quota in 1944, the year the Allied armies stormed the beaches of Normandy.Total CO2 emissions are from fossil fuels and cement production and do not include land use and forestry-related emissions. In the worldwide carbon emissions graphic (middle), Russia data includes the U.S.S.R. through 1991, but only the Russian Federation afterward.Advertisement"}

To counter the criticism that erupted, the government later pointed to other countries that had adopted similar measures in recent times, including Iraq, North Korea and Venezuela.Nearly eight months later, a lot of data is now available to help us assess what demonetization has actually wrought. Here it is, in a word: Demonetization failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policy\u2019s impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected.On the other hand, there may be greater long-term side effects than expected.The outcome was curious: Widespread suffering in the midst of plenty. Incomes crashed and distress mounted among farmers, a group in India already affected by high suicide rates because of mass indebtedness.And the downturn has hit more than the farming sector.Instead, India\u2019s growth in the first quarter of 2017 was 6.1 percent, down from 7.9 percent in the fiscal year 2015-16.The growth in industrial output in April was a paltry 3.1 percent, down from 6.5 percent the previous April. In the first quarter of 2017, the construction sector actually shrank, by 3.7 percent, over the previous quarter.All this augurs poorly for the months to come: As the agriculture sector slows down in response to low crop prices and the credit shortage begins to bite, overall growth will likely fall further. The state-engineered shock of demonetization will continue to course through the economy.Demonetization did boost the use of digital money, which is more efficient than paper money. But the government didn\u2019t need to put 86 percent of the currency out of circulation to achieve that. Demonetization was too coarse an approach, and it accomplished too little while causing too much collateral damage.India\u2019s economy has enormous strengths \u2014 such as high rates of savings and investment \u2014 and this crisis will pass. But just as sailors heading to sea disregard the winds and waves at their peril, economic policy makers cannot ignore the laws of economics, and intervene in the market with a blunt and heavy hand, without risking shipwreck.Kaushik Basu, the C. Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the Indian government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-16.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Cutting Access to Health Care, There\u2019s a Price to Pay", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneSenators, the United States is a sick country.From adolescence to adulthood to old age, the chances of dying an early death are higher in the United States than in any of the other 16 countries. A 15-year-old American girl has a 1 in 25 chance of dying before she turns 50, twice the risk found in the comparison group.And early death is hardly surprising, since Americans lead a pretty sickly life. Teenagers and young adults report higher rates of obesity, chronic illness, sexually transmitted infections, mental illness and injuries than in peer countries, according to the report. Americans in their 50s have higher rates of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, hypertension and obesity.And the American deficit has been getting worse. \u201cEach year, other high-income countries are improving their health at a much faster rate than the United States, and the United States currently ranks lowest on a variety of health measures,\u201d the report by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council noted.I bring this up, senators, because you are considering a bill that would drive a stake through the Affordable Care Act. As you mull the legislation over your holiday recess, think about the consequences of cutting access to care for millions of mostly poorer, sicker and older Americans.Of course, the dismal health situation is not all the fault of the health care system \u2014 which, until the passage of the Affordable Care Act, was the only one in the developed world that routinely barred access or limited care for millions of people of modest means.That is because violence accounts for a large share of Americans\u2019 excessive mortality, and accidents take a disproportionate toll. Nor is the health care system entirely to blame for the nation\u2019s elevated obesity rate \u2014 a leading cause of problems like diabetes.Still, senators, you are not off the hook. Limited access to health care may not entirely account for the poor health and the early deaths of so many of your fellow Americans. But it accounts for a good chunk.It said that expansions in three states of Medicaid, the federal health insurance for the poor whose rolls Republicans are prepared to trim by 15 million over a decade, were found to reduce mortality by 6 percent over five years, mostly by increasing low-income Americans\u2019 access to treatment for things like H.I.V., heart disease, cancer and infections.I understand, senators, that this sort of analysis may not sway all of you. I\u2019m aware of the view on the rightmost end of the political spectrum that ensuring people\u2019s well-being, which I assume includes their health, is a matter of personal responsibility and not the government\u2019s job.Yet there is a solid economic argument for protecting your fellow citizens\u2019 access to health care that does not rely on arguments from empathy, charity or the like. A sickly, poorly insured population can be expensive.The study, which focused on the disadvantages of African-Americans, Latinos and Asians, added up the costs of inequalities in health and premature death between 2003 and 2006 and came up with a price tag of $1.24 trillion.The good news, senators, is that solving these inequities needn\u2019t be particularly expensive. The analysis relayed in The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that each additional life saved by expanding Medicaid costs $327,000 to $867,000. That is much cheaper than other public interventions, such as workplace safety and environmental regulations, which achieve a similar reduction in mortality for each $7.6 million spent on compliance.Advertisement"}

The airy space has 15-foot ceilings and is surrounded by windows, with glass doors at one end that open onto a large terrace.The industrial-style kitchen is all stainless steel, from the cabinets to the appliances. While most of the living space has parquet floors, the kitchen has floors of polished concrete that extend toward the terrace, defining the dining area.Both bedrooms are on the main floor, each with its own bath. The master suite\u2019s spacious bath has black slate floors, double sinks, a soaking tub and a sauna with a private balcony; there is also a dressing room. A concrete staircase that appears to float above the floor in the main living area leads to an upper-level office with skylights and a storage room.The owners are art collectors, and the unit has spotlights and other lighting designed to emphasize their collection, Ms. Kurz said. It also has automated shades and a wood-burning fireplace. A parking space in the garage is included.That population growth, combined with the country\u2019s booming economy and the city\u2019s limited supply of housing relative to the demand, is driving up Frankfurt\u2019s real estate prices, although they are still lower than those in other major German cities. Between 2009 and 2016, prices of existing apartments in Frankfurt rose by 40 percent, the report noted, compared with increases of more than 60 percent in Munich and more than 90 percent in Berlin.But in 2016, single-family home prices in Frankfurt rose by nearly 12 percent and apartment prices by about 10 percent, an increase the report attributed in part to anticipated relocations from Britain, following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.Recent price increases, he said, mean that a four-bedroom single-family home with a small garden \u2014 and \u201cif you\u2019re lucky, a nanny room\u201d \u2014 now goes for about 2.4 million euros (or $2.7 million), up from around 1.6 million euros (or $1.8 million) a few years ago. During the same period, the price per square meter for apartments has risen from roughly 5,000 euros (or $5,595) to 8,000 euros (or $8,953), he added, and newer buildings can command as much as 12,000 euros (or $13,430) a square meter. Among the neighborhoods with the highest home prices are the Westend, the East End (site of the new European Central Bank) and the Diplomatic Quarter.While the financial crisis slowed the real estate market from 2009 through 2011, by 2012 foreign buyers were beginning to take notice of Frankfurt\u2019s competitive prices, Mr. Peters said: \u201cIt was considered a safe haven, and property prices were cheap compared to other major markets.\u201dMost foreign buyers in Frankfurt are from Europe, China or Middle Eastern countries, Mr. Schmitt said. They are drawn by the strong economy, he added, as well as Frankfurt Airport, a major international hub and the country\u2019s busiest airport, which makes the city easily accessible.There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Germany, apart from the requirement to have a German bank account. As Mr. Schmitt put it, \u201cYou cannot fly in with a suitcase full of money.\u201dMortgages are available to foreigners, but usually not for more than half of the purchase price, he said, and interest rates have been extremely low in recent years, at just above 1 percent.Transactions must be done by a notary; the fee is about 1.5 percent. Some buyers hire a lawyer as an added precaution, but it is not necessary, he said. In Frankfurt, however, it is customary for the buyer to pay the entire 6 percent commission owed to the real estate agent, Ms. Kurz said, rather than splitting it with the seller.German; euro ($1 = 0.89 euros)Transfer taxes on real estate transactions vary from state to state. The rate in Frankfurt is 6 percent, at the high end of the range, Mr. Schmitt said.The annual property tax on this apartment is around 700 euros, or $783, Ms. Kurz said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Comedy, the Voice of a Polite Nation, Rises in the Trump Era", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterTORONTO \u2014 Canadians have a lot to process these days. Immigration is changing society. The Trump presidency is altering Canada\u2019s place in the world and filling its airwaves with the neighbor\u2019s issues.Canadians are turning, as they long have in times of uncertainty, to comedy.\u201cCanadians really do identify themselves a great deal through comedy,\u201d said Cory Gibson, the field producer of \u201cThis Hour Has 22 Minutes,\u201d a long-running Canadian satirical news show.\u201cIt\u2019s one of our national pastimes,\u201d Mr. Gibson added. \u201cPolitical comedy and hockey.\u201dAll societies deal with major issues through humor. But that is especially true of Canada, which exports comedians the way France exports wine: Samantha Bee, Seth Rogen, Jim Carrey and many early stars on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d whose impresario, Lorne Michaels, is Canadian as well.In Canada, humor has become a way of pushing back against America\u2019s cultural and political dominance, like a class clown subtly undermining the teacher. Its changing comedy offers a lens into how the nation is changing, too.President Trump\u2019s election has been a boon to Canadian comedians, and not just for the quirks and the missteps that have made him a focus of American comedy. Here, Trump jokes often come with the punch line that his election proves Canada\u2019s superiority.\u201cIt gave Canadians a great excuse to do our favorite fallback, which is, \u2018Well, it\u2019s better than America,\u2019\u201d said Susan Kent, a cast member on \u201c22 Minutes.\u201d\u201cMrs. Trump, this is the third time this week,\u201d the officer tells her. After next catching Hillary Clinton, he tells the camera, \u201cI feel bad sending them back there.\u201d\u201cThe Beaverton,\u201d a satirical news show, had its first episode on Nov. 10.Luke Gordon Field, a producer, said pleasing Canadian audiences with jokes about the United States could feel too easy \u2014 sometimes for uncomfortable reasons.\u201cIn Canada, we will always default to superiority.\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our go-to move. But it\u2019s an interesting form of superiority, where it\u2019s coupled with a desire for recognition from Americans. The only thing audiences love more than a comic who mocks the United States is one who finds success there.\u201dMuch as American comedy often wrestles with issues of race, Canada\u2019s focuses on a different question of coexistence: life next to the larger, louder United States.Ann Pornel, a cast member at Second City Toronto, a sketch and improvisational comedy theater, offered the metaphor of something \u201cthat everybody can smell and nobody likes it, but we\u2019re all too polite to say, \u2018What is that?\u2019\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the Canadian identity: We\u2019re the ones in a room full of farts who don\u2019t say anything,\u201d Ms. Pornel continued. \u201cI\u2019m O.K. with that. Because we\u2019re the ones who smelt it, not the ones who dealt it.\u201dThe current main stage show, \u201cEverything Is Great Again,\u201d repeatedly lampoons Mr. Trump and his supporters but never mentions him by name.Meant as a jab, it underscores the omnipresence of American politics and culture that so rankles Canadians. Even when mocked and supposedly ignored, the United States is the center of attention.In the opening joke, a family welcomes refugees whose \u201ccountry has been torn apart.\u201d They are revealed to be from Michigan. Subsequent skits turn on an Ohio autoworker whose politics are challenged by schoolchildren and a man who frets that \u201cCanada\u2019s going to end up like the States.\u201dThe show\u2019s full-cast song name-checks Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.Try to imagine an American audience laughing at a passing reference to, say, Canada\u2019s finance minister. (It\u2019s Bill Morneau, by the way, and he manages the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.) That Canadians go for this is a sign of just how overwhelmed they are by all things American \u2014 a source of endless irritation, alleviated by taking the culprits down a peg.Several comedians said that they tried to push Canadians to see problems in their own country, but that American portrayals of Canada as a paradise made this more difficult.\u201cOur identity is smug complacency,\u201d Brandon Hackett, another cast member, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the Ontario license plate slogan: \u2018Smugly Complacent.\u2019\u201dThe pinnacle of this resistance came with the 2001 TV special \u201cTalking to Americans,\u201d in which the comedian Rick Mercer asked Americans ever more ridiculous questions about Canada to expose their ignorance.A Columbia professor eagerly signs a petition to discourage Canadians from putting their elders on ice floes. Mike Huckabee, then the governor of Arkansas, congratulates Canada on its national igloo.Asked whether \u201cAmerica should be bombing Saskatchewan,\u201d New Yorkers respond, \u201cAbsolutely\u201d and \u201cIf that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to have to do, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to have to do.\u201dThe show attracted 2.7 million viewers, a record. Mr. Mercer, in an interview, attributed its success to something subtler than a love of teasing the national older brother.\u201cI think Canadians have always been a little envious of the Americans, that they have \u2018Mom, the flag and apple pie,\u2019\u201d he said. But whenever Canadians try to define themselves, he added, they \u201cimmediately start talking about how we\u2019re different from the United States.\u201dThat is part of why Mr. Mercer now focuses his humor on Canada.He is sometimes called Canada\u2019s Jon Stewart for his sharp-edged political commentary. Another comparison might be Garrison Keillor, the road-touring radio host and purveyor of Americana.\u201cThe question of what it means to be Canadian, what the Canadian identity is, has confused Canadians for about 150 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe population is so spread out. The maple leaf doesn\u2019t even grow all over Canada.\u201dSome comedians, rather than breaking free of their nation\u2019s junior status, embrace it.She highlighted a series of skits from the early-1990s sketch comedy show \u201cThe Kids in the Hall,\u201d in which Scott Thompson plays Buddy Cole, a gay Canadian actor who delivers wry monologues, often about his identity.\u201cAmericans know as much about Canada as straight people do about gays,\u201d the character said in one of the skits. \u201cWhen I\u2019m overseas and people mistake me for an American, I\u2019m as outraged as when they mistake me for straight.\u201dBut Buddy is undeterred: \u201cOn my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, my agent replaced the word \u2018gay\u2019 with \u2018blond\u2019 and \u2018Canadian\u2019 with \u2018outdoorsy.\u2019 So I replaced \u2018outdoorsy\u2019 with \u2018blousy,\u2019 which makes me a blousy blond.\u201dSuch portrayals of Canadianness, Ms. Deveau wrote, were \u201cboth critical and optimistic, a paradox that works its way through much of Canadian popular culture.\u201dMany comic portrayals of Canadian identity revel in some form of second-class status. Main characters are typically lovable outsiders, often rural and working-class.The TV mockumentary \u201cTrailer Park Boys,\u201d for instance, follows the down-on-their-luck residents of a Nova Scotia trailer park. Since the show\u2019s 2001 premiere, its troublemaking characters have become something like national mascots. And \u201cLetterkenny,\u201d a new show based in small-town Ontario, is drawing critical praise.Mr. Gibson of \u201c22 Minutes\u201d called this \u201cCanadiana,\u201d a form of heartland-cherishing, proudly weird humor that has had a resurgence in recent years.As Canada becomes an increasingly urban and immigrant nation, that identity is being explored through a new strain of Canadiana outsider comedy. \u201cKim\u2019s Convenience,\u201d based on a play of the same name by the South Korean-born Ins Choi, follows immigrant families in Toronto\u2019s diverse suburbs.\u201cWhat I love about the last few years of working in Canadian comedy is that there\u2019s more interest in our country, and not defining ourselves by what Americans think about us,\u201d said Mr. Field, producer of \u201cThe Beaverton.\u201d As a nation, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a little more self-confidence in what we do.\u201dAsked when Canadians found their pride, Ms. Kent joked, \u201cWhen Trudeau made it into Vogue.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the job title of Cory Gibson on the satirical news show \u201cThis Hour Has 22 Minutes.\u201d He is the field producer, not the show runner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Raise a Feminist Son", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe raise our girls to fight stereotypes and pursue their dreams, but we don\u2019t do the same for our boys.We\u2019re now more likely to tell our daughters they can be anything they want to be \u2014 an astronaut and a mother, a tomboy and a girlie girl. But we don\u2019t do the same for our sons. Even as we\u2019ve given girls more choices for the roles they play, boys\u2019 worlds are still confined, social scientists say. They\u2019re discouraged from having interests that are considered feminine. They\u2019re told to be tough at all costs, or else to tamp down their so-called boy energy. I asked neuroscientists, economists, psychologists and others to answer that question, based on the latest research and data we have about gender. I defined feminist simply, as someone who believes in the full equality of men and women. Their advice applied broadly: to anyone who wants to raise children who are kind, confident and free to pursue their dreams. \u201cOur daughters are allowed to be human beings, and our sons are taught to be robotic,\u201d he said. \u201cTeach him that he has a full range of emotions, to stop and say, \u2018I\u2019m not angry; I\u2019m scared, or my feelings are hurt, or I need help.\u2019\u201d For children to reach their full potential, they need to follow their interests, traditional or not. So let them. The idea is not to assume that all children want to do the same things, but to make sure they\u2019re not limited. When possible, resist gender roles in housework and child care among parents. Actions speak louder than words, said Dan Clawson, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst: \u201cIf the mother cooks the food and cleans the house and the father mows the lawn and is often gone from home, lessons are learned.\u201d Boys who have friendships with girls are also less likely to think of women as sexual conquests, Mr. Porter said.Speak up when they\u2019re inappropriate, too. \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d is not an excuse for bad behavior. Expect more of them. \u201cBe vigilant in redirecting conduct which is demeaning, intolerant, disrespectful, offensive,\u201d Mr. King said. Don\u2019t say \u2014 and don\u2019t let your son say \u2014 that someone throws or runs like a girl, or use \u201csissy\u201d or any of its more offensive synonyms. Same for sexist jokes. \u201cThat should start at 3, when they really pick up stereotypes and notice them,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t help them label them as stereotypes, they assume this is the way it is.\u201dRaising a son this way isn\u2019t just about telling boys what not to do, or about erasing gender differences altogether. For instance, all male mammals engage in rough-and-tumble play, Ms. Eliot said. So roughhouse, crack jokes, watch sports, climb trees, build campfires. Teach boys to show strength \u2014 the strength to acknowledge their emotions. Teach them to provide for their families \u2014 by caring for them. Show them how to be tough \u2014 tough enough to stand up to intolerance. Give them confidence \u2014 to pursue whatever they\u2019re passionate about. Art Direction by Antonio de LucaAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea Says Otto Warmbier Was Released on \u2018Humanitarian Grounds\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea said on Thursday that it had freed the American college student Otto F. Warmbier on \u201chumanitarian grounds\u201d but did not reveal any details of his medical condition or the diplomatic negotiations that led to his release.Doctors were evaluating Mr. Warmbier at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he was admitted shortly after the plane carrying him landed in Cincinnati.A one-sentence dispatch on Thursday by the North\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency was the country\u2019s first official comment on Mr. Warmbier since his release.In Oslo last month, Joseph Y. Yun, the State Department\u2019s point person on North Korea, met with Choe Son-hui of the North Korean Foreign Ministry, who handled relations with Washington, to push for the release of all four American citizens then being held in the North.Then last week, North Korean diplomats at the United Nations told Mr. Yun that Mr. Warmbier had been in a coma for more than a year. The North later agreed to let Mr. Yun fly to Pyongyang to medically evacuate Mr. Warmbier.The North told American officials that Mr. Warmbier contracted botulism and slipped into a coma after taking a sleeping pill. Doctors in Cincinnati have yet to comment on North Korea\u2019s claim.The North\u2019s terse announcement on Thursday served to highlight many other unanswered questions about Mr. Warmbier, such as why North Korea kept his medical condition from United States officials for so long and why it decided to release him.President Trump has defined his approach on North Korea as \u201cmaximum pressure and engagement.\u201d He has repeatedly called on China, the North\u2019s only major trading partner, to curtail economic ties with its neighbor to help rein in its nuclear pursuits. But Mr. Trump has also called North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, a \u201cpretty smart cookie\u201d and said he would be \u201chonored\u201d to meet him under right circumstances.If the North intended Mr. Warmbier\u2019s release as a diplomatic overture toward Washington, whether it leads to broader talks would depend on Mr. Warmbier\u2019s condition, analysts said.\u201cOtto is not in great shape right now,\u201d his father, Fred Warmbier, told Fox News on Wednesday. \u201cOtto has been terrorized and brutalized for 18 months by a pariah regime in North Korea.\u201dOn Thursday, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump on June 29 and 30 in Washington to discuss a joint approach to the North, said that his government was willing to start unconditional talks with the North if it ceased further missile or nuclear tests.In a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the 2000 summit meeting between the two Koreas, Mr. Moon urged the North to help promote peace on the divided Korean Peninsula by giving up its nuclear weapons program. He said South Korea would help North Korea rebuild its economy if it chose to denuclearize.All of Mr. Moon\u2019s predecessors in recent decades had made similar proposals, but Mr. Kim has only redoubled his efforts to build missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the United States and its allies. Since taking office last month, Mr. Moon has vowed to play a more assertive role in resolving the North\u2019s nuclear crisis through talks, saying that he was willing to meet with Mr. Kim if the circumstances were right.There was no immediate response from the North to Mr. Moon\u2019s speech on Thursday.Mr. Warmbier was convicted on \u201canti-state\u201d charges for trying to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel after arriving in Pyongyang on a tourist visa in January last year.They include Kim Dong-chul, who was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 hard labor on charges of spying and other offenses last year. North Korea has also detained Kim Hak-song and Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-duk, both Korean-American Christians, on unspecified charges in recent weeks.At least six South Korean citizens, most of them Christian missionaries, have also been detained in North Korea on spying and other charges in recent years, officials in the South said.The United States does not have diplomatic ties with North Korea. The Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang handles consular affairs for the Americans held there on Washington\u2019s behalf. Reached by email, the Swedish ambassador, Torkel Stiernl\u00f6f, declined to comment on the conditions of the three Americans still in North Korean custody.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is North Carolina the Future of American Politics?", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "FeatureThe state is narrowly split between Democratic and Republican Parties that agree on virtually nothing. Are its scorched-earth politics what the rest of us have to look forward to?Supported byReaction to the bill was swift and brutal. The National Basketball Association pulled its All-Star game from Charlotte, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association canceled its championship events in the state, where the church of college basketball rivals the Southern Baptist Convention. PayPal and Deutsche Bank, among other corporations, scuttled multimillion-dollar plans to expand their North Carolina operations. An analysis estimated that the bathroom bill, as H.B. 2 came to be known, would cost North Carolina $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years.The mood at what was supposed to be the Air Horn Orchestra\u2019s final official performance, the Wednesday before November\u2019s election, was joyous, and not just because the group believed it had set a Guinness world record that evening for the most people (347) to simultaneously blow air horns. Cooper was ahead of McCrory in the polls, and when he was later declared the winner by 10,000 votes \u2014 providing national Democrats one of their only bright spots in 2016 \u2014 some of the Air Horn Orchestra\u2019s members reunited for an impromptu victory march through downtown Raleigh. \u201cWe thought our jobs were done,\u201d says Grayson Haver Currin, who founded the group with his wife, Tina. They threw away their instruments or sold them on Craigslist, none of them expecting that they would need them again less than five months later, to antagonize the very man they had just helped install in the governor\u2019s mansion.Cooper, after all, owed his election to H.B. 2. The law, his campaign\u2019s chief strategist, Morgan Jackson, told me, \u201ccrystallized every argument against McCrory that we had.\u201d As soon as Cooper was elected, he made getting rid of H.B. 2 his top priority. But negotiations with the Republican leaders of the General Assembly proved frustrating. \u201cIt seems that the goal posts keep moving,\u201d Cooper complained to me in March. Later that month, he finally reached a deal: In exchange for the General Assembly\u2019s repealing the law, which would bring back business and basketball, the governor would sign legislation that prohibited North Carolina cities from passing local ordinances relating to public accommodations or employment practices until 2020. (It was Charlotte\u2019s passage of a nondiscrimination ordinance in early 2016 that prompted the General Assembly to pass H.B. 2 in the first place.) \u201cI had a choice between some progress,\u201d Cooper later told me, \u201cor no progress.\u201dUnfortunately for Cooper, many of his allies disagreed with his choice. More than a third of the Democrats in the General Assembly voted against his compromise. It passed anyway, and on the day in late March that Cooper signed it into law, the Haver Currins sprang into action. They printed T-shirts that read \u201cCAN YOU HEAR US NOW, ROY?\u201d and a friend hit every Walmart superstore within 30 miles of Raleigh to buy up their air-horn inventories. That evening the Air Horn Orchestra reassembled at the governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cWith all the other performances there was a real sense of hope,\u201d recalls Tina Haver Currin, \u201cbut this time there was just despair.\u201d Or, as one orchestra member\u2019s sign plaintively put it, \u201cWTF ROY?\u201dWelcome to North Carolina circa 2017, where all the passions and pathologies of American politics writ large are played out writ small \u2014 and with even more intensity. Ever since 2010, when Republicans seized control of the General Assembly for the first time in a century, and especially since 2012, when they took the governor\u2019s mansion, the state\u2019s politics have been haywire. \u201cThere\u2019s been a bigger and quicker shift to the right here than in any other state in the country,\u201d says Rob Christensen, a longtime political writer for The News and Observer newspaper in Raleigh.In just a few years, North Carolina Republicans have not just run quickly through the conservative policy checklist; they\u2019ve tried to permanently skew the balance of power in the state in their favor, passing some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country and drawing some of the most egregiously gerrymandered congressional and state legislative districts in modern American politics (though their moves have repeatedly failed to pass muster with the courts). Cooper\u2019s victory, and the blowback to H.B. 2 that preceded it, seemed to suggest a chastening of the party \u2014 until Republicans contested the election results with a series of baseless allegations of voter fraud and legal challenges that left the state in limbo for four weeks before McCrory finally conceded.Then, before Cooper was even sworn in, the General Assembly \u2014 in which Republicans had retained their decisive majority in November \u2014 tried to strip him of many of his executive powers. Cooper, in turn, sued the Republican leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives to gain back those powers. What began as a grudge match now looks more like a free-for-all \u2014 and nobody\u2019s partisans, as the Air Horn Orchestra informed Cooper in March, are in the mood for compromise. \u201cIt\u2019s more polarized and more acrimonious than I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Carter Wrenn, a veteran North Carolina Republican political consultant, told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen some pretty acrimonious politics,\u201d he hastened to add. \u201cI worked for Jesse Helms.\u201dIn the last seven years, however, North Carolina has fallen four spots in the Social Science Research Council\u2019s Measure of America report ranking states on health, income and education \u2014 a decline that coincides with the state\u2019s turn toward Republican hegemony. In one sense, North Carolina\u2019s current politics and policies are of a piece with the rightward lurch of state governments across the United States in the past decade, as Republicans have consolidated power in two-thirds of the country\u2019s statehouses and inculcated a climate of partisan impunity. In Texas, Republican legislators recently approved sweeping new abortion restrictions that seem to resurrect some of the very same laws the United States Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional last year; in Kansas, an experiment in extreme supply-side economics has left the state with a $300 million budget shortfall. In North Carolina, the General Assembly has similarly green-lit the largest tax cuts in state history, blocked Medicaid expansion, slashed state unemployment benefits, relaxed gun laws and created new school-voucher programs.But then there are the things that send Raleigh political reporters scrambling for the \u201cFUBAR meter,\u201d a rulerlike piece of wood that hangs in the North Carolina legislative building\u2019s press room to quantify the political craziness of the day. For instance, Republicans\u2019 passage in 2013 of a voter-ID law that also eliminated same-day voter registration, severely curtailed early voting and ended out-of-precinct voting \u2014 restrictions, a federal court later ruled, that \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d Or last year\u2019s H.B. 2, which Republicans passed with such haste in an \u201cemergency\u201d special session that Democratic lawmakers walked out of the Senate in protest. Or the surprise special session Republicans called last December, with only two hours notice, to curb the newly elected Democratic governor\u2019s executive powers. That one rated a 9.46 on the FUBAR meter, which now rarely dips below 7.What really distinguishes North Carolina is that, unlike deep red Kansas or Texas, it is a quintessentially purple state. Its voters are almost evenly split between Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliateds. (This fall, unaffiliateds are actually expected to surpass Republicans as the state\u2019s second-biggest voting group.) The schisms within its electorate, like the national divisions they broadly resemble, fall between its cities and its rural areas, between a reverence for its past and a plan for its future. \u201cThat\u2019s what contributes to the meanness and paralysis of North Carolina politics,\u201d says Mac McCorkle, a former Democratic political consultant who\u2019s now a public-policy professor at Duke. \u201cIf it was clear it was an overwhelmingly Republican state, Republicans would be more relaxed. You might even see more progressive policies happen, like they do sometimes in more clear-cut red states like South Carolina or Tennessee. But we\u2019re so closely pitted, everything\u2019s a battle.\u201dThat battle, in recent years, has been a lopsided one. After Democrats\u2019 high-water mark in 2008 \u2014 when Barack Obama won the state and his coattails carried Democrats into the governor\u2019s office and a United States Senate seat \u2014 Republicans have steadily consolidated power. In 2011, they took advantage of the redistricting process to draw maps that turned their new state-legislative majorities into supermajorities and transformed the state\u2019s United States House delegation from one that had seven Democrats and six Republicans into one that had nine Republicans and four Democrats. In 2012, McCrory captured the governor\u2019s mansion, while Mitt Romney narrowly beat Obama in the state; in 2014, Republicans took back that Senate seat and picked up another seat in the House.Cooper\u2019s narrow victory last year might have boosted Democratic morale, but it didn\u2019t fundamentally alter the balance of power. Even the governor confesses to feeling beleaguered. \u201cFor decades, you could go across the country, and you\u2019d start talking to somebody and say you\u2019re from North Carolina, they\u2019d immediately talk about our universities or our Research Triangle Park,\u201d Cooper told me one morning this spring as we rode in the back seat of an S.U.V. ferrying him between photo ops. \u201cAnd now today it\u2019s often, \u2018What in the world is going on in North Carolina?\u2019 Because they don\u2019t understand why these things are happening in a state that they have known traditionally as a forward-thinking Southern state, a beacon in the South.\u201dCooper is a preternaturally cautious politician. When he was first elected to the State Legislature in 1986, as a 29-year-old county-seat lawyer, he was immediately hailed as a comer \u2014 a future governor or senator \u201cstraight from central casting,\u201d as the North Carolina representative David Price recalls. But his subsequent climb up the political ladder has been painstakingly slow. \u201cThe joke about Roy,\u201d says Gary Pearce, a veteran North Carolina Democratic strategist who first promoted Cooper as gubernatorial material some 30 years ago, \u201cis that he\u2019s been a rising star in four different decades.\u201d It is Cooper\u2019s misfortune to have finally arrived at his apparent destiny \u2014 his once-youthful face now wizened, his Lego-like helmet of hair streaked with gray \u2014 in a political climate that does not have much use for the sort of cautious, consensus-seeking governor he has spent his life preparing to be. Speaking to me in his office in the State Capitol later that day, he lamented this state of affairs. \u201cThey got hold of the maps in 2010,\u201d Cooper said, \u201cand it results in a polarized legislature where it\u2019s very difficult to get people elected to these offices who are truly interested in trying to achieve consensus.\u201dHise and the nearly three dozen other new Republican legislators who were swept into office seven years ago fundamentally changed the character of the General Assembly. For more than a century, Republicans weren\u2019t just in the minority in Raleigh; they were also, by and large, moderate. But the 2010 elections, in addition to giving Republicans control of both chambers, also tipped the G.O.P. caucus\u2019s balance of power away from the genteel old guard and toward a more aggressive, more ideological cadre of politicians. Suddenly, Republicans like Phil Berger \u2014 a stridently conservative lawyer from the struggling mill town of Eden, who became Senate president \u2014 were in charge. And with their newfound power, these Republicans immediately went to work trying \u201cto recover from 100 years of disaster,\u201d as one G.O.P. legislator put it at the time, and remaking the state in their image.As Hise sees things, the fight over the bathroom bill, like so many of the state\u2019s political battles, is really a proxy war in a larger, more existential struggle between the two North Carolinas. The state\u2019s metropolitan areas continue to prosper, with an influx of white-collar workers drawn to their thriving finance and technology sectors. But in North Carolina\u2019s rural communities, the tobacco, textile and manufacturing industries have collapsed, with little taking their place. The economic impact from the loss of sporting events and corporate expansions resulting from H.B. 2 wasn\u2019t felt in Hise\u2019s district. For him and his rural Republican colleagues, the bathroom bill was about something else. \u201cFaith is a much stronger component to the people in my district than I see here or in Charlotte or in the other urban areas,\u201d Hise said when we spoke in Raleigh. \u201cAnd when they see things that are forcing the state to move away from the deeply held religious beliefs that they have, they\u2019re not willing to accept that.\u201dWhen Hise moved back to his hometown, Spruce Pine, for family reasons in 2004, after spending several years in Maryland and Georgia working for the census and teaching at a university, he had to take a job packing furniture for two years before he was finally hired as an administrator at the local community college. Today he sees that practically every young person in his district with any education and ambition leaves to work in Charlotte or Raleigh or out of state \u2014 and unlike him, they don\u2019t come back. It rankles him when state officials celebrate the arrival of new tech firms or financial-services companies in those metro areas. \u201cIt\u2019s fish in a barrel,\u201d he complained. \u201cThe likelihood of those coming here is high without a lot of government involvement. But where it\u2019s really going to take work-force development and recruiting and economic incentives is to tag those industries that can come into this state and serve in one of the rural areas.\u201dThe ill will generated by this urban-rural imbalance is intense, and it finds many expressions. During a recent budget debate in the state Senate, for instance, Hise and his Republican colleagues grew so frustrated with Democratic delay tactics that at 3 a.m. they passed an amendment stripping $1 million in education funding from the districts of some of the Democratic senators who stood in their way. \u201cCompared to the overall budget,\u201d Hise assured me, \u201cit\u2019s a very small movement of money.\u201dOne reason Republican legislators can so unapologetically punish their Democratic colleagues is that, with G.O.P. supermajorities, the Democrats are essentially superfluous. But it may also be because Republican legislators don\u2019t have more pressing matters to worry about these days. Six years after taking control of the General Assembly, there simply aren\u2019t many big-ticket items left on their agenda. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the pent-up demand of a lot of members of the majority party who worked on legislation for a lot of years and could never get it to move,\u201d Hise told me. \u201cI think most of that legislation is done.\u201dBarber is a giant man with sleepy eyes and a permanent hunch \u2014 a result of a debilitating arthritic spinal condition. He is sufficiently infirm that he\u2019s uncomfortable sitting or standing, so most of the time he can be found propped up on a stool or leaning on a cane. But when Barber speaks in his rolling baritone, not just at the pulpit or on the Capitol steps but even in casual conversation, his back seems to straighten and his eyes come alive. \u201cOne of the great gifts of Pentecost was not that they spoke but that they heard,\u201d Barber said to his advisers, asking them to tell him what he should talk about the next day. \u201cI think about that other text in Isaiah that says, \u2018Oh Lord, open my ears every morning that I might hear and that I might have the tongue of the learned.\u2019\u2009\u201dFor many years Barber, who is 53, was a familiar but fringe figure in North Carolina politics, a frequent protester with little following or impact. \u201cHe was the resident wackadoodle,\u201d says Jonathan Felts, a North Carolina Republican political operative. \u201cEveryone knew who he was, and no one listened to him.\u201d Then on the last Monday of April in 2013, shortly after Republican lawmakers introduced an avalanche of conservative legislation that Barber deemed unusually \u201cextremist,\u201d he staged one of his protests in Raleigh. \u201cThis was the Easter season,\u201d Barber recalls, \u201cand we decided if they were going to crucify the poor, crucify the sick, crucify minorities, crucify public education, then every political crucifixion deserves a witness. So we had a service of self-purification.\u201dAfter an hour of prayer and protest inside the General Assembly building, Barber and seven fellow clergy members and nine activists \u2014 one of whom was in a wheelchair \u2014 were handcuffed and led away by the police. When Barber returned the next Monday to the General Assembly, he was joined by 100 protesters. The Monday after that it was 200. Within a few months, there were thousands. After a year of protests, more than 900 people had been arrested for civil disobedience. \u201cIt was almost as if folks were glad to have been shown a way,\u201d Barber says. \u201cIt became a gathering place for resistance.\u201d The Moral Monday movement, as it came to be known, was born.It\u2019s difficult to overstate the impact that the Moral Monday movement has had on North Carolina. In a narrow sense, it revived the state\u2019s Democratic Party. Although Barber emphasized that he was spearheading a moral rather than a partisan movement, the party was such a mess that he became its de facto leader. \u201cBarber really stepped in to fill the void of progressive leadership for Democrats here when they\u2019d been put out completely in the wilderness,\u201d says Tom Jensen, the director of the North Carolina-based Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling. McCrory won by 12 points in 2012, but thanks in no small part to Barber, he had a negative public-approval rating by the end of the summer of 2013, and his numbers stayed underwater until he lost to Cooper. \u201cYou could paint a piece of cardboard beige and watch it dry and that would be more interesting to Democratic-base voters than Roy Cooper,\u201d says the G.O.P. consultant Felts. \u201cBarber and the Moral Monday crowd gave them a reason to be excited, to be active and to vote.\u201dBarber\u2019s influence transcended electoral politics, reaching business leaders as well. Unlike in other Southern states, North Carolina\u2019s business leaders were generally a moderating influence, until the 2010 Republican takeover. \u201cA lot of people in the North Carolina business community over the last few years have spent a lot of time lobbying the legislature on corporate tax, unemployment and workers\u2019 compensation,\u201d Cooper complained to me, \u201cand we\u2019ve gotten away from the business community truly using political capital to have the legislature invest in education.\u201d Even H.B. 2 was initially greeted with conspicuous silence by North Carolina\u2019s Chamber of Commerce \u2014 most likely because, in addition to preventing city and county governments from enacting nondiscrimination ordinances, the legislation also prohibited municipalities from setting minimum-wage standards for private employers and limited how people could sue for discrimination in state court.But Barber and his movement changed the political norms in North Carolina, to the point that business leaders started to feel sheepish about their rumspringa of deregulation and tax cuts and began distancing themselves from G.O.P. policies. The H.B. 2 debacle, in particular, brought the business community and North Carolina Democrats more into alignment, so much so that Cooper outraised McCrory by almost $8 million during the 2016 campaign. Some Republicans now accuse Cooper of underhandedly fighting to keep the H.B. 2 issue alive during the campaign by privately encouraging Democrats in the General Assembly to thwart any attempts to fix the law. \u201cThere were efforts by the then-attorney general and his campaign to sabotage any potential compromises throughout the process,\u201d McCrory told me, \u201cbecause it was working to their political advantage in both fund-raising and surveys.\u201d (Cooper\u2019s office denies this.)In the meantime, Cooper, hamstrung as he is by the General Assembly, has managed to maneuver his way to a handful of quiet victories. In April, he successfully thwarted a Republican attempt to shrink the state\u2019s Court of Appeals, and thus tip its partisan balance in the G.O.P.\u2019s favor. And the United States Supreme Court decided in May, on a technicality engineered by Cooper, to refuse to hear an appeal of a lower-court ruling that struck down North Carolina\u2019s restrictive voting law. He\u2019s spearheading the Democrats\u2019 efforts to win enough legislative seats in the 2018 election to end the G.O.P.\u2019s supermajorities so that, as he puts it, his vetoes won\u2019t be automatically overridden and he will have \u201cleverage to negotiate.\u201d But Cooper knows that eventually he\u2019s going to need bigger accomplishments to satisfy the grass-roots crusaders who helped put him in office. His H.B. 2 compromise has made that task even more urgent. \u201cCooper did the right thing as governor,\u201d Paul Shumaker, a veteran North Carolina Republican strategist, says. \u201cHe did not do the right thing as a politician.\u201dThe bet that North Carolina Democrats are making \u2014 one that national Democrats will undoubtedly be paying attention to before the 2020 presidential race \u2014 is that, rather than fight Republican extremism with the Democratic equivalent, the surest way to nudge North Carolina from purple to blue is to make a low-key politician like Cooper, a consensus-seeker even where there\u2019s no consensus to be had, their party\u2019s standard-bearer.But it\u2019s hard to see how he could persuade his antagonists on either the right or the left to stand down, convinced as they both are that they represent their hotly contested state\u2019s future. \u201cI think North Carolina is a red state,\u201d Hise told me, \u201cand I think we\u2019re on trend to have an even more conservative party.\u201d Barber and the movement he has built, meanwhile, won\u2019t be satisfied if the same old Democratic Party simply takes the G.O.P.\u2019s place. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Well, movements need to learn how to compromise,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cThe problem with compromise, if you look at the three-fifths compromise and a whole lot of compromises down through history, is that compromise has been bad.\u201d Cooper longs to return North Carolina to its status as \u201ca beacon in the South.\u201d But, for now, his \u2014 and his state\u2019s \u2014 most pressing challenge may be simply finding a way to make it less of a cautionary tale.Jason Zengerle is a contributing writer for the magazine and the political correspondent for GQ.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cellphone Roaming Charges End in Europe. Many Respond With a Yawn.", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a decade of debate, Europe will finally abolish cellphone roaming charges this week, allowing people from Britain to Bulgaria to call, send text messages and surf the web without incurring eye-watering charges when traveling across the 28-nation bloc.Albena Krastanova, though, will not be among them.Ms. Krastanova, 37, prefers to vacation in her native Bulgaria when she is not selling newspapers in Sofia, the country\u2019s capital. Ms. Krastanova says she is too busy \u2014 and many of her compatriots too poor \u2014 to travel elsewhere in Europe.\u201cPaying the bills and providing for my 4-year-old daughter is our main priority. There is little left to splurge on trips abroad,\u201d Ms. Krastanova said as she cross-stitched an elaborate pattern and sat in her newspaper kiosk, a cup of coffee and a pack of cigarettes resting next to her embroidery. \u201cI don\u2019t use roaming.\u201dEurope\u2019s decade-long struggle to end cellphone roaming charges began before the original iPhone was released. But it involved often bitter lobbying between the region\u2019s cellular operators and consumer groups over how much people should pay to use their phones internationally. The changes will affect only people with European cellphone contracts, meaning Americans and others traveling in the region will still face costly charges.Critics point to data showing that a minority of Europeans regularly travel beyond their national borders to charge that the changes may offer limited benefit to most Europeans\u2019 daily online activities.\u201cThere\u2019s just a small percentage of consumers who will benefit from the scrapping of roaming charges,\u201d said Luca Schiavoni, a telecom regulation analyst at Ovum, a technology research group, in London. \u201cIt\u2019s for the few, not the many.\u201dDefenders of Europe\u2019s digital policies reject such criticism, saying that removing cellphone roaming charges took time because it represented the bedrock for the rest of the region\u2019s digital plans. It is hard to watch Netflix or shop on Amazon while traveling, they say, if you cannot first connect to the internet.For Viviane Reding, a former European commissioner who shepherded the roaming overhaul through Brussels\u2019s complex legislative process, the reduction in people\u2019s cellphone bills is a marked improvement. Even if Europeans travel abroad only a couple of times a year, they now can avoid extortionately high prices for even the briefest of calls or internet browsing.And while the roaming rules took longer than many had first expected, Europe\u2019s other digital proposals, she said, were still on track.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest change Europe has ever made digitally,\u201d said Ms. Reding, now a member of the European Parliament. \u201cThe new rules will apply to every company operating in the whole European market.\u201dMatt Chapam is one European who is eager for roaming to end.A British software engineer who moved to Amsterdam last year, Mr. Chapman, 28, had routinely paid hefty charges when traveling back to Britain to see his family.When the new rules come into force, his Dutch cellphone contract of 25 euros, or $28, a month will give him almost unlimited internet browsing and phone calls wherever he is in Europe. That compares to almost weekly top-ups of \u20ac20 that Mr. Chapman previously made when using his cellphone abroad.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to never have to worry about that again,\u201d he said.Yet, like most changes to European digital policy, the scrapping of roaming charges is by no means the end of the debate. Consumer groups and European officials are already voicing concerns that people may still see costly fees on their cellphone bills.While there will be strict caps on how much telecom operators can charge when individuals are outside their home countries, cellphone carriers can increase other fees, including phone calls and text messages to other European countries when people are not traveling, to recoup potential lost income.Lise Fuhr, director general of ETNO, a telecom industry group, said companies were offering competitive prices across Europe. But, she added, operators needed investment-friendly policies \u2014 not further regulation \u2014 if Europe wanted to build much-needed high-speed broadband networks and other digital infrastructure.European officials, though, have warned companies against price increases on services not linked to the end of cellphone roaming, saying that regulators may step in if they see potential unfair practices.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a Europe without digital borders,\u201d said Roberto Viola, director general of the European Commission\u2019s digital policy unit.That message will be music to the ears of Ondine Ripka, a French national living in Belgium who recently signed up for a new cellphone contract with Orange, a European carrier.While her overall monthly bill has fallen more than 50 percent, to \u20ac40, compared with what she paid to her previous operator, Ms. Ripka said certain charges, including sending text messages from Belgium to other European countries, were now significantly more expensive.In response, Orange said it was fully compliant with European rules, but that it had made changes to some of its products to better represent how consumers used its services.Boryana Dzhambazova contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secrecy Surrounding Senate Health Bill Raises Alarms in Both Parties", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As they draft legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senate Republican leaders are aiming to transform large sections of the American health care system without a single hearing on their bill and without a formal, open drafting session.That has created an air of distrust and concern \u2014 on and off Capitol Hill, with Democrats but also with Republicans.\u201cI\u2019ve said from Day 1, and I\u2019ll say it again,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cThe process is better if you do it in public, and that people get buy-in along the way and understand what\u2019s going on. Obviously, that\u2019s not the route that is being taken.\u201dThe secrecy surrounding the Senate measure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is remarkable \u2014 at least for a health care measure this consequential.In 1993, President Bill Clinton empowered the first lady, Hillary Clinton, to assemble health care legislation in private, with input from a group of more than 500 experts. That approach won scathing reviews from Republican lawmakers and others shut out of the deliberations. But it took place at the White House, not in Congress. Once the Clintons\u2019 health plan reached Capitol Hill, it died in the public spotlight.Republican leaders this week defended their actions.\u201cLook, we\u2019ve been dealing with this issue for seven years,\u201d said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing.\u201dMr. McConnell said there had been \u201cgazillions of hearings on this subject\u201d over the years \u2014 a less-than-precise tabulation that offered little comfort to Democrats who want hearings held now, in this particular year, on the contents of this particular bill.Now Democrats say they would love to read the Republicans\u2019 repeal bill, but cannot do so because Republicans have not exposed their handiwork to public inspection.\u201cThey\u2019re ashamed of the bill,\u201d the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said. \u201cIf they liked the bill, they\u2019d have brass bands marching down the middle of small-town America saying what a great bill it is. But they know it isn\u2019t.\u201dThe Senate\u2019s decisions could have huge implications: Health care represents about one-sixth of the American economy, and about 20 million people have gained insurance under the 2010 health law, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement.In theory, the bill-writing process is open to any of the 52 Republican senators, but few seem to have a clear, coherent picture of what will be in the legislation.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, offered a hint of the same frustration felt by Democrats seeking more information about the bill.\u201cI come from a manufacturing background,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019ve solved a lot of problems. It starts with information. Seems like around here, the last step is getting information, which doesn\u2019t seem to be necessarily the most effective process.\u201dAt a Senate hearing on Thursday, Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, said that he also had not seen the Senate bill.The Senate bill is likely to phase out the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion more slowly than the House version. It is also expected to include larger tax credits to help older Americans buy health insurance.The legislation will be considered in the Senate under an expedited procedure that precludes a Democratic filibuster and allows passage by a simple majority. But, Republicans say, Democrats will still be able to offer numerous amendments once the bill is on the Senate floor.Senate Republican leaders evidently think their back-room approach gives them the best chance to devise a health care bill that can squeak through the Senate, given their narrow majority and the policy differences in their conference.However Republicans feel about their coming bill \u2014 and they are far more comfortable criticizing the Affordable Care Act than talking up the virtues of their still-incomplete replacement \u2014 the process playing out in the Senate is quite different from the way Democrats went about passing the Affordable Care Act.The Senate health committee approved its version in July 2009 after considering hundreds of amendments over 13 days. The Senate Finance Committee cleared its version in October 2009, after more than a year of hearings, round-table discussions and other spadework. A group of Democrats and Republicans from the Finance Committee had met for months behind closed doors, trying \u2014 but ultimately failing \u2014 to draft bipartisan legislation.The full Senate passed the Affordable Care Act on Dec. 24, 2009, on the 25th consecutive day of floor debate.While much of the Affordable Care Act was written in the open, some important provisions were hashed out in private, just before the Senate vote, by Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was then the majority leader.Republicans complained bitterly at the time, and Democrats threw those complaints back at them this week.\u201cThis massive piece of legislation that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy is being written behind closed doors, without input from anyone, in an effort to jam it past not only the Senate but the American people,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in December 2009, using words that could be spoken by any Democrat today.The repeal efforts this year have moved much faster, though not as quickly as Mr. Trump or Republican leaders might have hoped.Asked this week about the Senate bill, Mr. Paul replied, \u201cHave you seen it?\u201dMr. Paul said he had no plans to bring out the copy machine again, but he suggested that the Senate\u2019s current course left something to be desired. \u201cMy preference would be a more open process in committees,\u201d he said, \u201cwith hearings and people on both sides.\u201dIn February, the Senate health committee held a hearing on stabilizing the individual insurance market. But since the House passed its repeal bill and the focus shifted to the other side of the Capitol, Senate Republicans have done their work out of public view.Since then, Republican senators have shared bits and pieces of the ideas being mulled in their private lunches and meetings.Asked his level of comfort with the process, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, cut off a reporter before he could finish his sentence. \u201cNone,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a divided caucus,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cI listen avidly at lunch as we go over the same arguments over and over and over again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Upstate Lifeblood, Ruled and Disputed From Afar", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANCOCK, N.Y. \u2014 The cold water that flows out of the reservoirs just north of here does more than chill the muck-sopped waders of fly fishermen. Once strictly reserved for the taps of New York City and neighboring states, the cold flow gives life to a biomass of insects and trout that has turned the region into one of the premier fly-fishing locales in the country.But early last Thursday, the swift current in the western branch of the Delaware River was in danger of nearly slowing to a trickle, as the five parties that depend on the water from the reservoirs \u2014 Delaware, New Jersey, New York State, New York City and Pennsylvania \u2014 were unable to reach a consensus on how to manage the resource by a self-imposed deadline that day.New York City, which oversees the management of the reservoirs roughly three hours northwest of the city, announced contingency plans later that day, saying it would allow more water to flow into the Delaware basin while negotiations continued with New Jersey, which was the only party to refuse to renew the agreement, claiming that it was not getting its fair share of water.Here in the upper Delaware basin, far removed from the political dealings that threatened the region\u2019s fragile ecosystem and its economy, residents felt familiar pangs of vulnerability. They have watched their once-thriving factories and industries slowly shutter one by one, eventually leaving fishing and tourism as just about the only ways to earn a living.Now, as their livelihoods increasingly rely on the ecological health of these waters, they watched once again as the decisions governing the river\u2019s health and its future were made by stakeholders elsewhere.\u201cThe lack of local input, I mean, it\u2019s a huge concern because you\u2019re essentially at the whim of a bunch of politicians who may or not know even where we are,\u201d said Jeff White, 44, who manages the Delaware River Club, a bait shop and lodge for fly fishing on the river. \u201cSo it\u2019s tough and you do wonder sometimes, there is enough water to satisfy everyone, but their concerns don\u2019t necessarily lie with ours.\u201dThe battle centered on a bitter disagreement between New York City, which draws about half of its drinking water from the three reservoirs, and New Jersey, which depends on the Delaware River for drinking water and reserves that can be tapped during a drought.While confrontations over water are common in the arid and drought-prone parts of the West, political brinkmanship and the threats of climate change have energized the issue even in traditionally wet areas like the Northeast. Though melting snowpack from the Catskills and reliable rainfall often provide more than enough water for the region, the competing priorities of a thirsty metropolis and the needs of four states raise the stakes considerably.\u201cFor the folks who have said that water may become more valuable than oil, that\u2019s a forecast that is coming true,\u201d said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.After a November drought in which New Jersey\u2019s water reserves dipped to low levels, the state resisted renewing the complicated agreement that governs water distribution from the reservoirs, known as the Flexible Flow Management Plan, claiming that its allotment had decreased over the years.\u201cRight now, we\u2019re the ones who have been shortchanged on water supply,\u201d said Bob Martin, the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones with the dog in the fight because New York City won\u2019t give us our fair share of water.\u201d The state says it can now take 65 million gallons a day during drought conditions and is seeking an increase to 85 million gallons.The water agreement is a result of decades of negotiations that began with a 1954 Supreme Court ruling laying out parameters for how to divide the water. At its simplest explanation, New York City owns and runs the reservoirs and disperses water based on agreements.By failing to reach a consensus last week, the regulations governing water releases would have reverted to a 1983 agreement, which among other things would have greatly reduced releases from the base of the dams and drastically reduced water levels in estuaries and the Delaware River. New York City, however, offered a last-minute temporary lifeline to the region.The city has been concerned about adopting a new permanent plan while being responsible for maintaining what is known as the salt line, a line of demarcation where incoming saltwater from the Delaware Bay meets the river\u2019s freshwater. It is held in place by timely releases of freshwater from the reservoirs, providing enough of a flow to keep incoming saltwater from intruding up the Delaware River.City officials worry that rising sea levels might put the city\u2019s drinking water at risk, because more reservoir water might be needed to maintain the salt line.Along the upper Delaware, a concern for many people is the risk of flooding to properties close to the water.\u201cYou could warn, warn and beg and plead, and they will not pay attention until it blows up,\u201d said Chuck Schroeder, the president of Drowning on the Delaware, a flood awareness group. He owns a house on the banks of the east branch of the river that has been ravaged by floodwaters.Among the chain of towns pocketed around the Catskills that have populations rarely topping four figures, many are wholly dependent on visitors and owners of second homes who flock to the area starting in April to fish for trout, an industry that generates hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity.\u201cIt\u2019s a world-class fishery,\u201d said Bruce Miller, a 68-year-old fishing guide from Olive, N.Y., who has been working on the upper Delaware for more than 40 years. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of frustrating to know that there\u2019s plenty of water for everybody and they\u2019re not making any kind of agreement for all parties. It\u2019s a shame.\u201dBesides fishing, recreational tourism \u2014 canoeing, tubing, rafting and camping \u2014 is just as reliant on the high water marks preserved by the constant dam releases.\u201cThe manufacturing economy stinks,\u201d said Bill Gross, 49, who owns a canoe rental company in Hancock. \u201cThe only thing we really have is tourism. Without that, you know, what else do you have? It\u2019s their drinking water, and I understand that. All we ask is for enough water to make a living.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian Runoff Elections Boost Center-Right Parties", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Center-right parties scored victories Sunday evening in runoff elections in more than 100 Italian towns and cities, a result that emboldened right-wing parties, raised the prospect of shifting coalitions and took the political temperature of Italy ahead of national elections expected within the next year.According to official results, candidates representing the center-right won many of the major contests, including in the northern port city of Genoa, a stronghold of the center-left for half a century.\u201cAlways more positive news, from many cities! Go, go, go!\u201d Matteo Salvini, the leader of the right-wing and anti-immigrant Northern League, who campaigned vigorously for the winning mayoral candidate in Genoa, wrote on Twitter late Sunday night.In the complicated calculus of Italian politics, the local elections may have adjusted variables just enough to change national outcomes. Mr. Salvini is now expected to argue that he is someone to be courted, either by the center-right \u2014 once again led by a reanimated former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi \u2014 or by the leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, Beppe Grillo.Italian voters had a lot to think about. A slumping economy, frustration with the European Union and a seemingly incessant tide of migrants from North Africa converged on voters on Election Day, which took place as the center-left government worked to avoid another banking crisis.Some analysts argued that local concerns more than national issues determined the results, while others doubted that the center-right would be as united in national elections as it was in local ones.Still, some members acknowledged the lackluster result.\u201cThere is a problem,\u201d Gea Schir\u00f2, a member of Parliament with the governing Democratic Party, acknowledged on Italian television.But she added that the most important takeaway was that the Five Star Movement, which she characterized as a threat to centrist parties and Italian democracy, had a poor showing.Indeed, the rise of the Five Star Movement has awoken some of Italy\u2019s long dormant power brokers, like Mr. Berlusconi. Now softening his image and appealing to older voters by frequently appearing in the company of lambs and fluffy dogs, Mr. Berlusconi campaigned in the weeks before the vote.Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, the head of the Democratic Party, mostly laid low before the vote. In the hours after, Mr. Renzi, a former mayor of Florence, noted on his Facebook page some victories for the center-left and bitingly predicted \u201capocalyptic\u201d and overreaching commentary in the coming days, \u201cbecause mayoral elections are something different from political elections.\u201d His opponents within the party wasted no time after the vote urging a reassessment of the Democrats\u2019 message and course.Months ago, the Five Star Movement had hoped to send a message with a show of strength in local elections. Genoa is the home of Mr. Grillo, the party\u2019s leader. But it suffered a serious setback on June 11, leaving the governing center-left and the center-right parties jostling for an edge.Immigration emerged as a theme in several elections, especially in Italy\u2019s border towns.Ignazio La Russa, a leader of the right-wing Fratelli d\u2019Italia, spoke elatedly on Italian television as the numbers rolled in. \u201cIt\u2019s clamorous!\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: With New Ioniq, Hyundai Goes After Prius", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenIt is the most efficient gasoline-powered car you can buy in America. There\u2019s generous room for four, five if need be. It\u2019s quiet, comfortable and comes with a lifetime battery warranty. And it is not the Toyota Prius.It\u2019s the Hyundai Ioniq (rhymes with iconic) Hybrid.The King is dead. Long live the King.Yes, Hyundai has out-Priused the Prius with the Ioniq. Specifically, the Ioniq Hybrid Blue model (available in many other colors) averages 58 miles per gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, two more than the Prius Eco. But Ioniq isn\u2019t just a hybrid: There\u2019s an all-electric model currently (no pun intended) exclusive to California and a plug-in hybrid version due later this year.I have driven the Electric and the base, at $23,035, Hybrid Blue. I\u2019ll cut to the chase: These are exceptionally well-done vehicles that deserve to be on any fuel miser\u2019s test-drive list. Buyers seem to be shunning ultraefficient cars for sport utility vehicles, but that\u2019s another story.Ioniq is a hatchback with an aerodynamic silhouette dictated by Mother Nature. I see hints of a Saab 900 without the droopy back end. Inside and out, Ioniq avoids the riotous lines of the Prius. I parked next to one and asked a dozen people to vote on looks. Ioniq won unanimously. The interior is straightforward, with the gauge cluster in front of the steering wheel. Right where God intended it to be.I\u2019ll focus mainly on the Hybrid model since it\u2019s the volume seller. The working bits include a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with 104 horsepower and 109 pound-feet of torque, paired with a 32-kilowatt electric motor that provides 43 horsepower and 125 pound-feet. In total, the front wheels have 139 horsepower to work with. The Hybrid\u2019s transmission is a 6-speed dual clutch (most hybrids use a continuously variable unit). The lithium-ion polymer battery lives under the back seat.Taking about nine seconds to reach 60 miles an hour, Ioniq beats Prius by a second. The Hyundai is also quieter and feels more engaged in corners, though the low-rolling-resistance tires lack the bite needed for a truly fun dynamic. Ioniq has the same glass panel on the back of the trunk lid as Prius, but Toyota wins in the visibility department.The Ioniq Hybrid does the normal hybrid things. The engine shuts down at stoplights. Coasting and braking rejuvenate the battery. But because Ioniq has a conventional geared transmission, it feels as if you\u2019re driving a normal gas-only car. No \u201crubber bandy\u201d continuously variable transmission dynamic here.I was often in the less-efficient \u201csport\u201d mode and got 55 miles per gallon. For comparison, I saw 52 m.p.g. in the Prius.The entry-level Blue lacks shiny trim that spiffs up the exterior. The interior looks clean but spartan. Nearly all base cars do. Spend an extra $1,750 for the SEL edition and you get spruced-up style as well as blind-spot warning and heated seats. It also drops average fuel economy by three miles per gallon. Go ahead. Splurge. You\u2019re worth it.The back seat is spacious for two. If three adults can\u2019t endure short trips, they\u2019re either large or fussy. Hyundai claims the trunk is biggest in class. The liftgate and folding split seats allow Ioniq to gobble bicycles whole.The Electric model has no gears, just a fixed single-speed transmission like most electric cars. The electric motor produces 118 horsepower with 215 pound-feet of soul-satisfying torque. Steering wheel paddles adjust the amount of power regeneration to the battery. In its highest setting, there\u2019s so much drag from the generator, the Ioniq Electric can often be driven without touching the brake pedal. Simply lift off the throttle and it slows down in a hurry.The Electric starts at $30,335 before tax credits, and Hyundai states that it travels 124 miles on a charge. Yes, Chevrolet\u2019s Bolt EV goes nearly twice the distance but costs roughly $7,000 more. Batteries are expensive, and Ioniq\u2019s lithium-ion polymer pack that\u2019s tucked beneath the back seat and trunk floor is smaller than the Bolt\u2019s. On 220 current, it fully charges in about 4 hours and 25 minutes. Ioniq\u2019s standard Level 3 charging ability provides an 80 percent charge as quickly as 23 minutes. That feature is an extra $750 on the Bolt. Hyundai doesn\u2019t recommend 110-volt charging.The Electric is quick off the line, hushed inside, and would be, uh, a gas to drive if not for its efficiency-minded tires. My short time with it kept me from verifying the 124-mile range. But in mid-50-degree temperatures, it appears that Hyundai is conservative with its number. Only you know if you need more than that kind of daily range. According to the E.P.A. the Electric is the most efficient car you can buy in the United States. Period.The coming Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid gets an estimated 27-mile all-electric range before it defaults to standard hybrid mode. That\u2019s 189 miles a week if plugged in nightly, or 756 miles monthly and over 9,000 miles annually. In a practical sense, that eliminates most trips to the gas station.While Ioniq earns a spot in the automotive efficiency hall of fame, Prius remains the marketing champ. Prius is to hybrids as Kleenex is to tissue, and Hyundai would need clever marketing to vanquish Toyota\u2019s deep advantage there. But it can be done. Hydrox, after all, was the original sandwich cookie and Oreo the upstart knockoff. Hyundai has solid products with the three Ioniq models. Any of them should make efficiency geeks happy, and keep competitors on their toes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ghana Court Rejects Resettlement of Guant\u00e1namo Bay Detainees", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byACCRA, Ghana \u2014 The Supreme Court of Ghana ruled Thursday that the government\u2019s decision to allow two former Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees to live in the country was unconstitutional.On Thursday, the Supreme Court justices ruled that Ghana\u2019s government, then led by President John Dramani Mahama, erred in approving the detainees\u2019 transfer, saying that the agreement with the United States was an international one that required approval by members of Parliament. Two Ghanaian citizens had brought the case before the court, accusing the government of illegally allowing the men to enter Ghana.Chief Justice Sophia Akuffo said that unless the government submitted the agreement to Parliament for approval within three months, the two men would be returned to the United States.Mr. Mahama, who was president at the time the deal was struck, had said that the two men did not present a security threat and that the United States had directly requested that Ghana accept them for resettlement. The deal drew criticism from religious and civic groups, who cited worries about security.In recent years, Ghana has been praised as a model democracy in Africa. It has held peaceful elections and has not been plagued by the insurgencies and terrorist attacks that have unsettled other countries in the region.The current president, Nana Akufo-Addo, has not indicated how his government will respond to the court\u2019s decision.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paying a Price for 8 Days of Flying in America", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the sixth day of my weeklong odyssey across America by air, I found myself wedged into a middle seat in the far reaches of a flight from Des Moines to Phoenix, wearing the sweatpants I had slept in. Angry at the in-flight movie system and feeling hungry, I turned to my carry-on lunch: a container of yogurt.The yogurt had spent the flight in the seat pocket, building up internal pressure. As I removed the top, it exploded, spraying blobs onto me, the seat, the floor and a nearby man whose mood was not enhanced by the arrival of a wet vanilla-flavored substance in his hair. I never did have lunch that day.As flights go, it was not a personal success. But anyone who travels knows that wretchedness on a plane is only a matter of degree and never confined to a single passenger. The unfriendliness of the skies seems to grow only more baroquely awful with each new incident immortalized on a cellphone.How did air travel, which once seemed so glamorous and exciting, turn into a sadomasochistic pas de deux between the industry and the passenger?To understand the forces defining air travel in America today, I spent eight days crisscrossing the country in economy class. Four airlines. Twelve flights (half of them delayed). Twelve cities. Twelve cups of tomato juice. Three trips through whole-body scanners. One alarming use of the words \u201cgroin area.\u201d Eight testy conversations with authority figures. One lost bag. Two broken entertainment systems. And a reporter who went a week without washing her hair.The trip had its share of surreal moments \u2014 interrogated by a security agent at one point, I forgot what city I was flying to \u2014 and I felt increasingly removed from myself, dehumanized and disaffected. Through a grim twist of fate, every flight seemed to leave from a gate in a distant corner of the terminal. Sitting again and again at the back of the plane, I wondered, am I getting enough oxygen?To help their profits, airlines fit more passengers into smaller spaces, charge more for once-basic services like legroom, inveigle customers into joining frequent-flier programs, and lavish ever more perks on higher-revenue passengers at the front of the plane.The result is a widening caste system that can turn an airplane into a microcosm of \u201cThe Hunger Games.\u201d The elite bask in an airborne version of Panem, enjoying over-the-top frivolities distant from the tedium of normal life, while the masses scrap over scant resources, dreaming of revolution.\u2022 American Airlines Flight 85, New York to San Francisco, 7:55 p.m.I can\u2019t sleep on crowded late-night planes, so I pick a flight that leaves at a reasonable hour and duly present myself at Kennedy International Airport at 6 p.m. Right away, the passengers are funneled into two groups, one that will have a good experience and one that will not.To the left is the regular check-in area, a scrum of anxiety where the regular travelers jostle and fret into ragged lines staffed by overburdened agents.To the right is the priority area, a calm oasis of privilege where smaller numbers of high-status travelers are promptly ushered to check-in desks by smiling airline employees eager to help.This pattern will continue throughout the trip, and it all makes perfect economic sense. Airlines make far more money from premium-class passengers than from economy passengers, and their focus is on making these customers as happy as possible.The mood changes as you go further along in a plane. It\u2019s like starting at a penthouse on Fifth Avenue and traversing the city until you reach your own house, a tent shared by 20 people on the banks of the Gowanus Canal. I have a middle seat, which will prove to be a recurring theme.A thin curtain separates us from first class, but it feels impenetrable. A passenger attempts to use the first-class bathrooms but is ordered to the back of the plane. As the flight attendants dole out our sole free snack on this flight of six and a half hours \u2014 a lone Lotus Biscoff (\u201cEurope\u2019s Favorite Cookie With Coffee\u201d) \u2014 the aroma of something delicious that may or may not be lasagna wafts in from the front.The flight lands two and a half hours late, at 2:04 a.m. By 3 a.m., I am in bed at the airport hotel. My alarm is set for five hours later \u2014 to catch the next flight.\u2022 Delta Flight 1106, San Francisco to Salt Lake City, 10:34 a.m.\u2022 Delta Flight 2926, Salt Lake City to Denver, 3:20 p.m.Half of America is furious at the other half, unable to agree on even previously uncontroversial topics like the weather. But if there\u2019s one subject that unites the country, it is a loathing of what the airlines euphemistically call the boarding process.I\u2019m already grumpy because of fatigue and the fact that this flight, too, is unaccountably late. Besides, I fail to discard my water bottle at security, a rookie mistake that results in a walk of shame to the garbage bin reserved for people who do not understand what \u201cno beverages\u201d means.At the gate, the mood is restive. The plane has not arrived.A group of passengers \u2014 these people are known derisively as \u201cgate lice\u201d to frequent fliers \u2014 is surging toward the door anyway, jockeying for position in imaginary lines. This makes the others nervous, so they head over there, too.\u201cIt gives me a sense of comfort to stand near the gate,\u201d says Kristin Olson, who has left the lounge to stake out a prime position at the boarding area. \u201cIt can be chaotic and uncertain. I\u2019m like, any time it\u2019s set to board, I want to be here.\u201dAirlines have experimented with everything, including back-to-front boarding, window-seats-before-aisle-seats boarding, and what some people call \u201cchaos boarding,\u201d where passengers basically rush the gate en masse. Reasonable people can disagree on which is most efficient, but one thing seems clear: The current system \u2014 organized according to elaborate status-based hierarchies \u2014 is a highly irritating way to board a plane.\u201cOn some flights, you have so many elite travelers that by the time they all board, there\u2019s no one left,\u201d Seth Kaplan, managing partner of the online publication Airline Weekly, said in an interview.Each airline has its own way of calculating status, calibrating down to the most picayune distinction, just the way English people will tell you in all seriousness that they grew up upper lower-middle class, say, or lower upper-middle class.It\u2019s always startling to see how starkly this little slice of class warfare plays out. After boarding passengers who need extra help, Delta divides the remaining people into five \u201cboarding zones\u201d comprising 24 separate categories. If that seems like a lot, it is. The zones are cunningly arranged so that Zone 1 is actually the third group to board.Zone 3 is for passengers with the cheapest tickets. They are forbidden to get on the plane until everyone else \u2014 the Sky Team Elite Plus members, the Priority Boarding Trip Extra customers, and so on \u2014 has already boarded.There\u2019s something soul-destroying about actively caring whether you\u2019ve achieved, say, Crossover Rewards SPG Platinum status. On the other hand, it\u2019s uniquely dispiriting to be a member of Zone 3.Our boarding passes might as well say \u201cLoser\u201d on them.By the time we board, there\u2019s no space left in the overhead bins, and we have to relinquish our suitcases at the gate. Some people try to argue, but resistance is futile. We bond by exchanging anti-airline pleasantries.\u201cI\u2019m going to give them my bag,\u201d one woman says, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want to be dragged off the airplane.\u201d\u2022 United Flight 2049, Denver to Houston, 3:10 p.m.Having successfully completed the latest task in the growing category of \u201cThings Airline Employees Used to Do\u201d \u2014 printing out and affixing my own bag-routing tag \u2014 I proceed to security.Security, of course, is one of the main features of the modern airport, its operation bolstered by more than 44,000 security officers employed by the Transportation Security Administration. The agency screens some two million passengers a day. In 2016, its officers caught passengers attempting to sneak a total of 3,391 firearms onto airplanes.I\u2019m not that dumb, but that doesn\u2019t mean I zip through security without incident. In fact, even if you qualify for expedited boarding or have T.S.A. PreCheck status, awarded to people who pay a fee and pass a background check, you cannot escape the possibility of the full-body scanner.\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d an agent says to me, pointing me toward the device in question, also known as an advanced imaging technology machine. \u201cYou\u2019ve been randomly selected.\u201d (An agency spokesman said that for security reasons, he could not reveal how frequently this happens.)Feet splayed to match the floor diagram, hands in the air as if you\u2019ve been pulled over by the cops, you feel like both criminal and victim. I position my arms in the manner of Macaulay Culkin on the \u201cHome Alone\u201d poster, which is not correct. \u201cHands away from your head!\u201d the official barks.An alarm sounds. There appears to be an area of concern on my body.\u201cLet me tell you what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d a second agent says. She pulls on a pair of latex gloves that look like the ones doctors use for internal exams. \u201cI\u2019m going to need to check your groin area.\u201dO.K., I say.\u201cLift your blouse so I can get underneath your waistband,\u201d she continues.It\u2019s actually a sweater, but whatever. I am exposing half my stomach and back to my fellow passengers. I feel the way I would if the police strip-searched me in the newsroom, in front of my editors. The agent rummages around in there. \u201cWiden your stance, please,\u201d she says, checking the insides of my legs up to the top, over my pants.It\u2019s never fun to hear an authority figure use the words \u201cwiden\u201d and \u201cstance\u201d in this context.It is perpetually dinnertime at the airport, but I do not want the food. I do not want the pizza, hamburgers, tacos, bagels, buffalo chicken wings, Tex-Mex, Japanese, Chinese, Indian or Italian. I do not want the doughnuts, Cronuts, cupcakes, cookies or salads garnished with croutons that taste like soap. I do not want a Shake Shack shake.And no, I don\u2019t want green eggs and ham either.Airport food is big business. The need to arrive far in advance of a flight presents food vendors with an array of captive potential customers. Bored people eat more, as do people worried they will be stuck in an enclosed space without a meal.\u201cFood is getting much better in the airport, and airports are getting much better at making food available,\u201d Mr. Leff said. There are apps with which you can order food from terminal vendors while still on the plane, and iPads you can use to get food delivered to you while waiting at a gate.I haven\u2019t run into any of those, and I\u2019m just not feeling the joy of food. On the flights, those of us sitting in the back tend to avoid buying from the snack cart, making do with the tiny free packets like Savory Snack Mix, blobs of crackerlike material coated with unpleasant flavoring.Even the scant items are improvements. After dispensing with free snacks following the 2008 financial crisis, the main carriers have recently reinstated them. Providing even something like nuts for every passenger can cost an airline $10 million to $20 million a year, said Henry Harteveldt, an industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group.On one flight, the lady sitting on the aisle and I were tackling our Savory Snacks when our seatmate, Bela Nabulsi of Houston, magically received a free Tapas Snack box, containing crackers, dips and what appear to be chocolate-covered dehydrated blueberries. He offered us some blueberries. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d we said, wondering why he got the Tapas Snacks and we did not.\u201cI\u2019m a 1K member\u201d \u2014 whatever that is \u2014 \u201cand so I get a free snack pack,\u201d he explained.The distressing scent of dill pickles and processed chicken wafted through the air. Finally she finished and stuffed the wrapper back into the Chick-fil-A bag, after which the lady on the aisle produced her own lunch: the exact same sandwich.She said she had had the same thing the day before and liked it so much that she had it again.\u2022 Southwest 314, Jacksonville to Atlanta, 11:05 a.m.\u2022 Southwest 757, Atlanta to Chicago, 12:50 p.m.\u2022 Delta 6209, Chicago to Minneapolis, 5:27 p.m.\u2022 Delta 3788, Minneapolis to Des Moines, 10:05 p.m.The tall indignant man is telling his long, dull story to the desk clerk here at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport. I\u2019ve arrived late, on a plane where half the passengers seem to have missed their connections.The narrative involves a delayed flight; the purchase of a ticket on an alternative flight; the realization that the new flight is leaving in the morning instead of the evening; the certainty that his booking error is not his fault; and the purchase of a completely new ticket on the original flight.The dramatic climax of the man\u2019s tale is that he has plummeted on the upgrade list, to No. 6 from No. 2, and wants his old spot back.The clerk, who is trying to appease the crowd by providing regular updates on the unexplained nonappearance of the plane, says she can\u2019t deal with the subject of upgrades at the moment.The man has Platinum status, he explains. He is so angry that he does not want to give me his name.What\u2019s so great about Platinum status, I ask.\u201cIt\u2019s second to the top!\u201d he says. \u201cOnly Diamond is above it.\u201dI\u2019m not suffused with sympathy, but there is a larger issue here. What\u2019s the use of grubbing and scratching your way up an airline loyalty ladder if it exposes you to this sort of status-based distress?Many passengers harbor suspicions that something strange has happened to air miles programs.\u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve been upgraded,\u201d a passenger named Lynn Glynn tells me in Atlanta. \u201cI keep using Delta \u2014 I\u2019ve used it a couple of times internationally \u2014 but I never seem to get enough points.\u201dMs. Glynn is right: Something is wrong.Because airlines have lowered the prices in premium cabins in order to sell more of the seats, fewer such seats are available for upgrades.As recently as 2010, Delta sold just 14 percent of its short-haul first-class seats, according to Mr. Leff, the industry blogger. By mid-2015, that had increased to 57 percent, with the ultimate goal being 70 percent.At the same time, it\u2019s become harder to improve your frequent-flier status. Miles alone used to suffice. Now you have to spend a certain amount of money, too, or you\u2019ll get bumped down a tier.\u2022 American Flight 1886, Des Moines to Phoenix, 2:40 p.m.I wake up in the clothes I was wearing yesterday, since my flight landed after 11 p.m. and my bag got left behind in Minneapolis. It was 40 degrees in Des Moines, and I was too cold to undress before bed.My morning is spent tracing the errant luggage \u2014 it\u2019s now meant to be delivered to the hotel \u2014 and visiting a local eye doctor because I seem to have contracted some sort of eye infection. The doctor says that my eyes have become irritated from too much flying and tells me not to use Visine.I return to the airport to hunt down my luggage, which never arrived at the hotel. The lost-luggage desk has the deserted feel of a warehouse on a weekend. I am not sure what to do, so I call the Delta customer-service number on my cellphone.I reach a person. I am put on hold. After a while, she says she\u2019s spoken to another person at the airport who has promised to ask a third person to come and help. This sounds dubious, and I keep her on the phone by whining for a bit about things she cannot help me with.Someone does eventually arrive, and I\u2019m reunited with my bag. I\u2019ve been surprised at how efficiently the airlines have handled this suitcase, which is small and black and looks like every other suitcase.\u2022 United Airlines Flight 5435, Phoenix to Los Angeles, 10:50 a.m.I\u2019m down to my outfit of last resort, the one my children made me promise never to wear in public: an adult onesie I bought more than two years ago at the Sochi Olympics.It\u2019s appropriate that I\u2019m dressed like a giant toddler, because I\u2019m whiny, fractious and irrational. I\u2019m tired and tearful. This food tastes awful. I do not want anyone to be the boss of me.Here are some things I\u2019ve done recently: challenged a T.S.A. agent who ordered me to remove a Kleenex from my pocket, sat in the wrong seat on a flight and claimed it was the other person\u2019s fault, told a lost-bag agent that I was about to miss my next flight when it was not true, sat on the floor at a departure gate in order to charge my phone, and, at a low moment, jostled my seatmate\u2019s arm right off our shared armrest while pretending I was doing something else.Today I am inexplicably drawn into a passive-aggressive contretemps with a smirking man in cargo shorts who accuses me of failing to remove my items speedily enough from the security conveyor belt, and who calls me \u201clady.\u201d I actually hiss, \u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d as he walks off.I\u2019ve been asking flight attendants along the way what it is like to deal with customers who behave like children.The problem, one told me earlier, is that people are already in a terrible mood when they get on the plane. (She did not want her name used because she isn\u2019t supposed to speak to reporters.) \u201cYou\u2019re crammed in like sardines, your independence is taken away from you, you\u2019re paying for things that used to be free,\u201d she said.I\u2019m on my way home. I\u2019m in Seat 6B. My seat is capable of sliding out into a full-length bed. I have a duvet, side table and lamp. I have a ceramic dish of almonds and cashews. If I want special unguents, there are some in my free amenities bag.Having experienced the normal troubles of air travel, I\u2019m enjoying its abnormal delights. I\u2019m in business class on a cross-country flight. I never want to leave this seat.Who wouldn\u2019t enjoy this cocoon of privilege? I have checked in via a special entrance at Los Angeles International Airport leading to an anteroom whose desk is decorated with an orchid. I have enjoyed cucumber-infused water and a slide show of dramatic landscapes in a lounge.I have breezed through a dedicated security line. I have waited in a second Delta lounge near the gate, under a Pop Art poster of a distressed cartoon woman saying: \u201cDarling, you know I only travel first class!\u201dThat\u2019s how all of us feel. (We\u2019re technically in business class, but there is no first class on this flight.) Relief, entitlement, schadenfreude and a mortal fear of having to fly economy again \u2014 these are the prevalent emotions. Maybe it\u2019s better not to be here at all, because going back there will be so awful.I\u2019ve been hearing this a lot. \u201cI feel so sorry for them,\u201d Albert Zahalka, a passenger I met earlier in the week, said. When he was younger, he, too, had to fly economy. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to travel anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to sit back there, it\u2019s soul-destroying.\u201dThe economy passengers do seem unfortunate, huffing and heaving their wheelie bags and water bottles and bags of cheeseburgers down the aisle. How nice it is to be on this side of the curtain.Airline executives have come to realize that they can do almost what they like in economy class, offering basic service \u2014 a seat, basically \u2014 at cut-rate prices and then charging for add-ons like legroom, checked bags and the right to choose a seat. The real competition comes in long-haul premium cabins, as the airlines rush to outperk each other to attract more lucrative customers.On long-haul flights, business-class passengers generate at least five times as much profit as economy passengers, Mr. Harteveldt, the industry analyst, said. First-class passengers are worth perhaps 10 times as much as economy passengers.That\u2019s why I have a flatbed seat.The video screen is pleasingly large, so I can finish watching \u201cHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\u201d in comfort. I have room for all my stuff. No one is slamming a seat onto my knees, kicking me in the back or shoving me from the side. After lunch, I\u2019m too full for my custom hot-fudge sundae, so the flight attendant offers to bring it later.I wander into the galley, where the flight attendants are taking a break. It\u2019s definitely easier to work in business class, they say. I tell them what a great time I\u2019ve had in this exclusive area.Really, I say.Yes, a flight attendant says. You have to pay a lot more. But if you pay enough, you can get whatever you want.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California\u2019s \u2018Green Rush\u2019 Takes Hmong Back to Their Opium-Growing Roots", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAYFORK, Calif. \u2014 The red and purple opium poppies that his family grew on a mountainside half a world away were filled with an intoxicating, sticky sap that his mother traded for silver coins to feed her children and pay for their escape.Adam Lee smiles at the memory of a childhood in war-torn Laos and voyage to America, where he spent decades adapting to life in big cities.Now 47 years old, Mr. Lee has returned to the mountains \u2014 the Trinity Alps of Northern California \u2014 and to a career farming a different mind-altering crop for his livelihood: marijuana.\u201cWe\u2019ve got big dreams,\u201d Mr. Lee said from a hilltop overlooking his marijuana farm.Mr. Lee is part of a diaspora of about 1,000 ethnic Hmong families who have come to this remote and relatively poor corner of California to grow marijuana.California is home to the largest population of Hmong in the United States, with nearly 100,000, and most initially settled in the Central Valley. Over the last decade, many have moved north, and others from around the country are migrating to this part of California to take advantage of the growing marijuana trade.They are a small slice of what has become a huge industry across the state. In Trinity County, they are reinvigorating a struggling, rural area that was losing population.The legalization of recreational marijuana in November set off a so-called green rush in California, which has been a center for cannabis-growing for decades. Like the gold miners who scoured the same Northern California hills 150 years ago, marijuana entrepreneurs have come hoping to gain great fortunes.Many in the state see marijuana farming as a commercial opportunity, but for the Hmong, many of whom struggled to assimilate in California in the early years, it is also a chance to return to their farming roots and rural lifestyle.For some of the older Hmong, who worked as janitors and factory workers when they arrived in America, the bucolic surroundings help soothe the lingering trauma of war and allow them to be among kin and long-lost friends.\u201cIt\u2019s the independence of living free \u2014 you can live off the land,\u201d said You Ping Vang, an ethnic Hmong who was born in the United States and is the founder of Lonestar Trade, a company that sells the marijuana grown here. \u201cThis is the life that they left. They love it.\u201dIn a county that is more than 85 percent white, the Hmong are conspicuous. Their assimilation is still a work in progress, residents say.\u201cWe\u2019ve scrambled to figure out how we can incorporate their traditions,\u201d said Debbie Miller, the superintendent of the Mountain Valley Unified School District, where 30 of the 280 students are Hmong.\u201cWe\u2019ve had declining enrollment for a while, and they\u2019ve brought children to us,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cI hope more of them come.\u201dMai Vue, the founder of Conscious Cannabis Resources, a nonprofit organization that helps Hmong farmers navigate the growing thicket of regulations applied to marijuana growing, estimates that more than 1,500 Hmong live in Trinity County, which has a population of about 13,000.\u201cWhen they first came here eight years ago, they were scared to even go to the grocery store,\u201d Ms. Vue said. \u201cI would go, because my husband was white. It was just fear, I think, on both sides. It was: \u2018This is a small town. Maybe they don\u2019t accept us.\u2019\u201dBut in Trinity, Hmong are gaining acceptance. Last year, a Hmong team won a prize in a prestigious local barbecue competition. At the school holiday pageant, the students put on a Hmong fashion show.In November, Bobbi Chadwick, a farmer, was elected to a seat on the Board of Supervisors under the slogan Unite Trinity, which was understood as a sign of uniting the Hmong and the white population. Ms. Chadwick has befriended her Hmong neighbors, organized a banquet and compared slaughtering techniques.\u201cSix men came to the ranch, and we harvested two hogs and a goat,\u201d Ms. Chadwick said.From the jungles and refugee camps of Southeast Asia, the Hmong came to America starting in 1975, during the Communist takeover of Laos and the fall of Saigon. They arrived impoverished, disoriented by the industrialized society they met and, for the most part, undereducated. They scattered around the country in climates that were foreign to tropical hill dwellers, enduring subzero winters in Minnesota and Wisconsin and the baking heat of California\u2019s Central Valley summers.Mark E. Pfeifer, a scholar of Southeast Asia and the editor of the Hmong Studies Journal, describes the Hmong as a late-blooming immigrant success story, shedding reliance on government assistance and finding niches in the American economy, like Asian restaurants in Michigan and the flower business in Washington State.In 2015, the Census Bureau estimated that 285,000 Hmong were in the United States.In an area here called the Trinity Pines, three mountains connected by a network of uneven dirt roads, the older Hmong have regained a lifestyle familiar to them, farming small plots on steep hillsides.Driving his pickup truck through the Pines, Mr. Vang called out the states where his Hmong neighbors migrated from.\u201cThese guys are from Alaska, and they\u2019re from Arkansas,\u201d Mr. Vang said. \u201cTexas. \u2026 Minnesota. \u2026 He\u2019s from Wisconsin.\u201d\u201cWe were scattered around the United States, north, south, east, west,\u201d the elder Mr. Vang said.Now, at age 61, he is jarred and delighted by random, tearful reunions. He meets old army buddies, childhood friends and long-lost cousins, all of whom have come to Hayfork to grow marijuana.At a gas station in town, he ran into a junior officer, his former subordinate in Laos.At a local garden supply store, an old classmate stopped him.\u201cHe told me: \u2018I thought you were still in Laos. I thought you were dead,\u2019\u201d Mr. Vang said. \u201cWe had not seen each other since we came to this country.\u201dA visitor to the Vangs\u2019 farm is greeted by reminders of the homeland. In the kitchen is a cleaver next to a thick cross section of a pine tree used as a chopping block. On the gas burner is an hourglass-shaped pot for cooking sticky rice. A mortar and pestle serve to crush spices.The Hmong are not the first East Asians to flock to Trinity County during a boom period. In Weaverville, a 45-minute drive from Hayfork, all that is left of the Chinese community that came for the 19th century gold rush is a Taoist temple that has been turned into a museum.Mr. Vang said he hoped the Hmong would get permits and make Trinity County a more permanent home.\u201cIf they allow us to grow, the Hmong will stay,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Throw the Bums Out, Global Edition", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnly a few weeks ago, much of the global commentariat still saw the rise of right-wing populism as the defining trend of our times, but recent election results upend that notion. This month an old-fashioned socialist, Jeremy Corbyn, scored an unexpectedly strong showing in Britain. On Sunday, the new-school centrist Emmanuel Macron won a parliamentary majority in France. And conservative, Wall Street-friendly reformers are gaining momentum in, of all places, Latin America, once a hotbed of anticapitalist radicalism.If there is a common factor driving voters worldwide, it is less a particular ideology, right or left, than a deep but amorphous desire for change. Seated leaders normally have a huge advantage in name recognition alone, but these aren\u2019t normal times. In the world\u2019s 50 most populous democracies, the ruling party won just 40 percent of the national elections in 2016. It was one of the poorest showings for incumbents since 2002, when the global economy was emerging from recession and roiling crises were driving established parties from power in the emerging world.So far this year, in five major national elections, the incumbent party suffered humiliating defeats in France and South Korea, will barely hang on at the head of coalition governments in Britain and the Netherlands, and survived with a greatly diminished mandate in Ecuador.The voters\u2019 anger is mainly the byproduct of the wide and persistent slowdown that has taken root since the global financial crisis of 2008. The growth rate of the global economy has slumped to around 2.5 percent this decade, from 4 percent in the decades before 2008, undermined by weakening growth in both population and productivity. No major region of the world is growing as fast now as it was before the crisis. Among the 50 most populous democracies, only nine have dodged the global growth slowdown, and among this group \u2014 with a few exceptions, like Germany \u2014 most have relatively small economies.Worse, the disappointing recovery has been accompanied by anemic wage growth and rising income inequality. Dashed economic expectations are undermining popular support for working politicians across the economic spectrum.Based on polls in the 20 large countries for which long-term poll data is available, the median approval rating for national leaders is now just 35 percent, down from 54 percent a decade ago, when the global economy was still booming. In recent years, approval ratings in countries like Taiwan and Brazil have fallen as low as the single digits \u2014 lows I can\u2019t recall seeing before in any country.Voters are directing their anger at whoever is in office and casting their lot with whoever offers something new and different.In the United States and Britain, where millennials have little experience of socialism or personal memory of what it produced in the Soviet era, many young voters are inclined to see socialism as something new and positive. That may help explain the striking level of youth support for Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, and Mr. Corbyn, who both won clear majorities among voters under age 34.In many Latin American countries, however, left-wing governments were in office until recently, with poor economic results. These economies stumbled when commodity prices went bust earlier this decade, so in recent elections voters have turned to center-right reformers like Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru and Mauricio Macri of Argentina, who outraged many on the Latin left by appointing numerous veterans of Wall Street to key economic posts. In Chile, the front-runner in the race for president this year is a conservative billionaire and former president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era.However, this does not suggest that the right is rising uniformly across Latin America, either. In Mexico, the center-right president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, has seen his approval ratings sink below 20 percent as the economy struggles to gain speed, and the leftist firebrand Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has emerged as the front-runner to win the presidential election next year.In France, the socialist government of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was seen as a dismal failure, and his party went on to take just 29 of 577 seats in the National Assembly compared with more than 460 for center and center-right parties \u2014 perhaps the most resounding victory for pro-market forces since the dawn of the Fifth Republic in 1958. Despite low voter turnout, the biggest winner was Mr. Macron, a centrist economic reformer who plans to push France to the right and downsize the welfare state.Right-wing reformers are rising where left-wingers ruled, progressives are rising where conservatives held power, and unconventional populists are gaining in countries where the traditional parties are especially weak. It is hard to recall a time when the world was more ideologically scrambled, or when politics was more polarized in big democracies, from the United States to India.While global economic momentum has picked up somewhat over the past few months, the gains are still marginal. The forces driving the post-crisis slowdown are too deeply rooted to be fixed quickly by any political leader.If anything, the honeymoon period for the recently elected may be shrinking, as several relatively new leaders have already seen a meaningful decline in their popularity, including Justin Trudeau of Canada, Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, Malcolm Turnbull of Australia and Mr. Kuczynski in Peru. None of them has been in office even two years, yet all have a negative approval rating; President Trump, who rode the anti-incumbent wave to victory, has seen his ratings go from weak to weaker in office.Of course, there are exceptions to the anti-incumbent revolt, owing to idiosyncratic local factors. A few leaders still have high approval ratings after more than 15 years in power, such as President Vladimir V. Putin in Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey. But it is hard to trust polls in these illiberal nations.In genuine democracies, very few leaders remain genuinely popular. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is one. Under Ms. Merkel, Germany has enjoyed the highest per capita income growth of any major developed country, so her ratings are easy to understand.Exceptions aside, given how often incumbent leaders are losing re-election campaigns, and how many suffer from record-low approval ratings, the confusing pattern of recent election results seems best explained not by the rise of any one ideology but by a sentiment now common to voters all over the world: When in doubt, just throw the bums out.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Internet Is Where We Share \u2014 and Steal \u2014 the Best Ideas", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyBut a few weeks later, Entertainment Weekly reported that the social-media fantasy was actually coming to life: Netflix beat out several bidders at Cannes to buy the concept, which could go into production as early as next year. Viewed one way, this is a tale about how the web has collapsed the distance between audience and creator. But it also raises questions about ownership in the digital age.A governing ethos of the internet has been that whatever flows through it \u2014 information, ideas \u2014 is up for grabs. In his 2009 manifesto, \u201cFree,\u201d on the new digital economy, Chris Anderson wrote that \u201cit is a unique quality of the digital age that once something becomes software, it inevitably becomes free \u2014 in cost, certainly, and often in price.\u201d Anderson and his cohort envisioned a new type of cultural economy that didn\u2019t degrade the effort or labor of production. \u201cLast century\u2019s free was a powerful marketing method,\u201d Anderson noted; \u201cthis century\u2019s free is an entirely new economic model.\u201d But that model assumes that everyone within its ecosystem has equal access to resources and capital.Over the last two decades, the web has pushed every creative medium \u2014 print, film, music, even art \u2014 into brand-new territory. Creators can now take nontraditional paths to traditional success, and mainstream industries have stretched to accommodate these new digital economic models. A musician like Chance the Rapper no longer needs a record label to win a Grammy, and a comedian like Quinta Brunson can use Instagram and YouTube to land a job producing and starring in videos for BuzzFeed Motion Pictures. And the internet has also allowed for the creation of new types of cultural products, even as we struggle to recognize them as such.Was she right? The types of ideas protected by intellectual-property law typically don\u2019t include a clever catchphrase on a Vine or a film idea in a tweet. But it\u2019s difficult to dismiss Newman entirely; the \u201cfreemium economy\u201d that Anderson heralded works only if the old hierarchies of access have been dismantled. And for the most part, they are still intact.Whether or not you agree with that analysis, the incident does point to the growing schism between those driving cultural conversations online and those profiting from them. There\u2019s a rich history of excluding certain types of creators from compensation for their contributions to culture. In her 2006 article \u201cFair Use and the Fairer Sex,\u201d Ann Bartow, now the director of the Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property at the University of New Hampshire School of Law, pointed out that \u201ccopyright laws are written and enforced to help certain groups of people, largely male, assert and retain control over the resources generated by creative productivity.\u201d Historically, she noted, that infrastructure played a key role in sustaining \u201cthe material and economic inequality between women and men.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that technology isn\u2019t keeping pace with innovation,\u201d says Amanda Levendowski, a teaching fellow at the New York University School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s that we aren\u2019t keeping pace with how to serve new types of creators who have never been valued by intellectual-property regimes.\u201d Often, those people most responsible for cultural touchstones are unable to profit from them because they don\u2019t have access to capital and resources (a digital ad agency, say, or a Hollywood pitch room). The internet has become the go-to place to toss out ideas, in the hope that they could lead to a job, but it has also become the place where people go to find the best ideas, creating a lopsided dynamic that tends to benefit people in power.This dynamic is further complicated by the way social media psychologically encourages and socially rewards us for our contributions to online culture. The founders of Instagram studied psychology and computer science at Stanford University. Before Facebook acquired the app for $1 billion, Kevin Systrom, one of its creators, spoke about designing a \u201cnatural cycle\u201d of participation that would keep engagement up on his service. \u201cThe more people love seeing content on the platform, the more they use it, the more they post,\u201d he told Business of Fashion in 2014. Likes and retweets on Twitter and Tumblr perform a similar function. Researchers like Nir Eyal and BJ Fogg have written about how apps \u201chook\u201d users and cultivate addiction. Online, there is an irresistible social currency to being a user who has thousands of followers, who starts memes, who comes up with an idea that is turned into a movie. But I wonder how comfortable we should be with this arrangement.Not long ago, I watched \u201cThe Founder,\u201d the movie about the businessman Ray Kroc, who mutated McDonald\u2019s from a family-owned restaurant into the global multinational corporation it is today. There\u2019s a scene in which Kroc, played by Michael Keaton, explains his plans to Dick and Mac McDonald. Kroc, who is in the process of swindling them out of a significant fortune, tells them how he justifies his behavior, by adding value to their original idea: \u201cDo you know what I came up with, Mac? A concept. I came up with the concept of winning.\u201dIn the movie, it\u2019s easy to identify Kroc as an amoral exploiter, sponging off the labors of Dick and Mac. Which brings me back to the Rihanna-Nyong\u2019o film project. Ownership on social media is far from clear. Even the genesis of the project is disputed, with some pointing to a meme on Tumblr as the original source. For now, representatives for Issa Rae have told Vanity Fair that the Twitter users who came up with the concept will be credited in some way, and judging by their tweets, they seem to be satisfied with that recognition as adequate payment. Meanwhile, we can expect everyone else associated with the film to actually be paid.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anbang\u2019s Sales Dry Up in New Challenge for Chinese Insurers", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Anbang Insurance Group, whose chairman has been detained by the police, has seen its growth come to a screeching halt as Chinese investors who helped fund its meteoric rise prove skittish about a politically connected company that is no longer in Beijing\u2019s good graces.Anbang\u2019s sales of life insurance policies and investment products, an important source of cash, stopped almost completely in April after tumbling sharply in March, according to Chinese government data released on Thursday. Across the insurance industry, sales slowed in April compared with earlier in the year.The weakness follows the government\u2019s crackdown on a sector that is supposed to help families and companies cut their financial risks, but has recently become a hub for rampant financial speculation.Anbang has been the archetype of the industry\u2019s changing favor.Anbang\u2019s rise had been \u201cjust another example of the Wild West capitalism in Chinese finance, where people can go off and do whatever, no matter what their sectors are supposed to be doing,\u201d said David Zweig, the director of the Center on China\u2019s Transnational Relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. \u201cIt starts out by providing a needed service in the economy, but these guys end up just going out of control.\u201dAnbang is now under acute pressure. Its revenue from existing life insurance policies and certain wealth management products was down 88 percent in April compared with the same month the previous year. The rest of the industry was up 4.5 percent in the same period.Yet Anbang also has a big cushion to help sustain the company through tough times.From January through March of this year, Anbang raised three-fifths as much money as it raised all of last year, government data shows. It has maintained a large stockpile of cash after a series of big investments fell apart, including a $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels and Resorts and a deal for a Manhattan office tower with Kushner Companies, the family real estate firm partly owned by Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump and an administration adviser.But Anbang\u2019s latest figures are eye-catching for the opposite reason. Including new kinds of policies and wealth management products, it took in only $218 million in April this year, down from $5.92 billion in the same month last year, the government data on Thursday showed.Earlier investors are also getting nervous now. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t save us, the impact will be no less than the U.S. financial crisis, and those enterprises driven by debt will be involved,\u201d wrote one investor on Chinese social media. \u201cNow, we are betting whether the government will help Anbang or not.\u201dInvestors\u2019 worries \u2014 a major source of Anbang\u2019s troubles \u2014 center on wealth management products, a potentially explosive risk in the country\u2019s financial system.But companies rarely disclose how that money is invested, raising concerns about what could happen to the financial system if they sour. Fearing a source of instability among the masses, Beijing has moved to limit growth in the products.By that point, Anbang was already in trouble. Questions about Anbang\u2019s financial strength had begun circulating on social media in China in March and April, as Chinese officials publicly raised questions about sales of wealth management products by some insurers.If the drop in revenue is steep enough, Anbang could eventually be forced to liquidate some assets. A big factor will be what happens with its existing policies and investment products.Anbang\u2019s annual report provides little information on the monthly tempo at which its previously issued investments are maturing. The company might need to pay them out if they are not rolled over into further investments with the company. The company\u2019s policies do have very stiff penalties on early redemption to discourage holders from turning them in early for cash.Anbang could raise money by selling some of its investments, but that could take time.It has been an active investor in Western hedge funds, in addition to making outright acquisitions of overseas companies. And those terms tend to impose severe limits on Anbang\u2019s ability to ask for its money back quickly.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherSui-lee Wee contributed reporting from Beijing.

{"Headline": "The Fashion Outlaw Dapper Dan", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Twenty-five years after luxury labels sued his Harlem boutique out of existence, Gucci looks to him for inspiration.Supported byThe Harlem couturier Daniel Day, better known as Dapper Dan, was all over social media last week after Gucci unveiled a jacket that looked very much like one he designed nearly three decades ago for the Olympic sprinter Diane Dixon.The fur-lined piece with balloon sleeves created by Mr. Day in the 1980s made use of the Louis Vuitton logo without the brand\u2019s permission. The new Gucci jacket, designed by Gucci\u2019s creative director, Alessandro Michele, remakes the Dapper Dan jacket, but with the interlocking double-G Gucci logo in place of the Louis Vuitton markings.Things have come full circle. Litigation by luxury brands ran Dapper Dan\u2019s Boutique out of business in the \u201990s, and now here comes a major fashion house trying to grab the attention of a generation steeped in hip-hop by finding inspiration in a onetime fashion outlaw.Mr. Day confirmed on Friday that Gucci has contacted him. \u201cWe\u2019re at the table,\u201d was all he would say about it.In addition to Gucci\u2019s recent salutation, the Museum of Modern Art plans to include Mr. Day\u2019s work in its fall show \u201cItems.\u201d In an email, MoMA\u2019s senior curator of architecture and design, Paola Antonelli, called Mr. Day a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d who \u201cshowed even the guardians of the original brands the power of creative appropriation, the new life that an authentically \u2018illicit\u2019 use could inject into a stale logo, as well as the commercial potential of a stodgy monogram\u2019s walk on the hip-hop side.\u201dMr. Day started down the road to sartorial splendor from 129th Street and Lexington Avenue, where he grew up with three brothers, three sisters, a homemaker mother and a father who worked as a civil servant. In 1982, after an apprenticeship that took him across Africa, he opened Dapper Dan\u2019s Boutique on 125th Street. It lasted 10 years before lawyers from luxury brands moved in.\u201cWhat Dap did was take what those major fashion labels were doing and made them better,\u201d said the rapper Darold Ferguson, Jr., who goes by the stage name ASAP Ferg and whose father, Darold Sr., worked at the boutique in the \u201980s. \u201cHe taught them how to use their designs in a much more effective way. Dap curated hip-hop culture.\u201dAt his Harlem brownstone a few days before the Gucci controversy, Mr. Day described how his ideas on fashion, business and life in general came to be.\u201cMy sense of style came from having holes in my shoes,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in third grade, and I would put cardboard and paper in the bottom of my shoes, but it got to the point where the soles were just gone. I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I came home from church one Sunday and told my mother: \u2018Ma, my feet are killing me. They hurt so bad.\u2019 I had tears in my eyes. The next day, my older brother Cary said: \u2018Come on. We\u2019re going to the Goodwill on 124th Street.\u2019 We got there, and Cary asked me, \u2018You see anything you like?\u2019 I picked out a nice pair of shoes on the rack and tried them on. Cary asked me, \u2018How do they feel?\u2019 I told him, \u2018They feel good.\u2019\u201dAnother experience with shoes gave him an understanding of how clothes reflect social status.\u201cMy mom bought me a nice pair of split-toe loafers with a tassel,\u201d he said. \u201cThis kid from this snobbish family that lived in the brownstone next door to us began to tease me. He said, \u2018Lily Day must\u2019ve hit the number, because you got new shoes.\u2019 I got so mad at that kid, because he was right. Every time my mom hit the number, she bought me and my siblings new shoes. But after those experiences, I started to do for myself. I was going through the window.\u201dWith a group of other children from the neighborhood, he used to go downtown and break the windows of haberdasheries such as Phil Kronfeld and Fred Leighton.His childhood friend, the Harlem basketball legend Richard Kirkland, known as Pee Wee, corroborated those stories in a short documentary made for Jay Z\u2019s Life & Times blog in 2013. \u201cThey called us Ali Baba, like Ali Baba and the 40 thieves, because it would be like 40, 50 guys breaking the windows of clothing stores and jewelry stores downtown, yelling, \u2018Ali Baba! Ali Baba!\u201d Mr. Kirkland said.Much of what Mr. Day and Mr. Kirkland talk about regarding the need to dress to impress is part of a generational mind-set for many black men who grew up in Harlem.\u201cMy earliest experiences regarding race was in the home,\u201d Mr. Day said. \u201cI would listen to my mother and father talk about how the structure of white society was affecting us. I also remember Hulan Jack, who was the borough president of Manhattan, coming to my school, P.S. 24, to speak to us. This was a black man who was the borough president of Manhattan who came to tell our sixth grade class that knowledge is power. That fascinated me.\u201dMr. Day\u2019s pursuit of the American dream began in two seemingly different but analogous institutions: the street corner and the classroom. \u201cI was a professional gambler as a teenager,\u201d he said. \u201cI would break all of the crap games on 123rd Street and Lenox. I would win big.\u201dHe earned his nickname while playing craps, he said.Mr. Day grew tired of running the streets after witnessing speeches by Malcolm X. \u201cMalcolm X once said, \u2018If you want to understand the flower, study the seed.\u2019 I was getting high at the time, but once I heard that, it stuck with me. I started going to the Countee Cullen library, and began reading about opium and the Boxer Rebellion in China. I said, \u2018Oh, this is where it comes from.\u2019 I connected myself to the problem of addiction globally. And I went back to school, courtesy of a program sponsored by the Urban League and Columbia University.\u201cI wanted to be a writer. I read books by Dr. John Henrik Clarke, Lerone Bennett. One of my favorite journalists was Earl Caldwell,\u201d the pioneering black investigative reporter known for his articles in The Times on the Black Panthers.Mr. Day worked for a Harlem newspaper called Forty Acres and a Mule in the \u201960s and became aware of the sense of revolution around the country. \u201cThe young white kids were moving toward a spiritual, New Age kind of consciousness, and the people I knew were embracing black nationalism,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally was involved with the Nation of Islam, the Black Panthers and an organization called the Mighty Black Zulus. Not the Zulu nation of the Bronx, but a collection of brothers who dressed in black pants, green suspenders and red shirts.\u201dMr. Day gave up drinking, smoking and drug use, and became a vegetarian. He toured Africa in 1968 as one of the students chosen by the Columbia University-Urban League program and returned for the Muhammad Ali-George Foreman bout in 1974.\u201cIt changed my life,\u201d Mr. Day said. \u201cAll of the artwork on the walls\u201d \u2014 he gestured toward the paintings in his living room \u2014 \u201cI brought those back with me from Nigeria. I also brought some suits over there. The tailors in Africa were making their version of a westernized, American suit.\u201dHe decided that he wanted to be a clothier in his home neighborhood. He knew all the \u201cboosters\u201d \u2014 people who shoplifted from department stores \u2014 and he bought garments from them and resold them at a profit. He went from selling clothes out of his car to opening the boutique.In the \u201980s he had enough capital to get serious about fur and leather, but many merchants would not sell to him. The exceptions were Fred Schwartz (known as Fred the Furrier), his brother Harold, and Harold\u2019s son, Andrew Marc Schwartz, who started the Andrew Marc label.Mr. Day began selling Andrew Marc leather jackets with possum lining for $800. A Harlem competitor, A. J. Lester, was offering the same goods for $1,200, and its representatives demanded that Mr. Schwartz stop supplying the upstart competitor. When Mr. Day and Mr. Schwartz considered a compromise \u2014 removing the Andrew Marc label from the jackets\u2019 insides \u2014 Mr. Day had an epiphany about the importance of brands.\u201cThe label is everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe label is the thing the gangster clientele use to let the other gangsters in the street know, \u2018You ain\u2019t got what I got.\u2019 The label or logo sets you apart.\u201dAround that time, a man entered the boutique carrying a Louis Vuitton pouch. \u201cThis dude was bragging about the pouch,\u201d Mr. Day said. \u201cAnd it occurred to me, if that\u2019s how he feels about the pouch, how would he feel if that Louis Vuitton pouch became a whole outfit?\u201d He laughed at the memory. That was the moment everything changed. Mr. Day hired group of tailors, including Africans he had met in Midtown, family members and a friend from the Nation of Islam.\u201cI told this brother, \u2018I have a lot of ideas, I just need you to do the cutting as I give you the patterns.\u2019 I studied how he would sew the leather from the patterns of my design ideas. Clothes designing sounds fascinating, but it\u2019s hard work. Folks don\u2019t realize that there are limitations in the body form. We\u2019re humans: We have arms, legs, chest. The exciting part of designing clothes is that you can be really creative within the context of those limitations.\u201dMr. Day saw an irony in the fact that he was on the rise at a time when Reagan-era economic policies were damaging his home neighborhood.\u201cA lot of manufacturing businesses began selling off all of their equipment, because they were moving their operations offshore, to China,\u201d he said. \u201cAs these manufacturers began to collapse in this country, I knew I needed to get in and salvage what they were leaving behind, so I could build my business. I remember going to an auction in Maine to get a particular machine that cut leather. Most times, I would be the only black guy at these auctions and I would ask questions of all of the experts who knew about the various machines. That is how I learned this business: by asking the right questions.\u201dAt the same time, the crack epidemic was tearing neighborhoods apart.\u201cThe Italians were slowly losing their grip on Harlem and a lot of young guys were moving in, because the price of cocaine began to drop,\u201d he said. \u201cDrugs were and are a curse on places like Harlem, but they created an economy that allowed my business to thrive. The street guys wanted to look good. I was juggling the polarity of Malcolm X and a big time hustler like Joe Jackson. Being a former street guy myself, I understood what was going on around me. I was in it, but not of it.\u201dThe boutique often stayed open seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Dealers took Polaroids of the latest Dapper Dan designs in their wardrobes; those photos reached street hustlers from Philadelphia to Detroit to Los Angeles. \u201cAt 2 in the morning, people from as far away as Philly were shopping at Dapper Dan,\u201d the R&B vocalist Jeff Redd said. \u201cHe changed the game in fashion.\u201dSamira Nasr, the fashion director for Elle magazine, likened Mr. Day\u2019s work to that of the innovative hip-hop D.J.s of the era, such as Jason Mizell, a client of Mr. Day\u2019s. Mr. Mizell, who died in 2002, created beats for Run-DMC under the name Jam Master Jay. \u201cSampling was taking existing music and slicing it to recreate new sounds for original lyrics,\u201d Ms. Nasr wrote in an email. \u201cDap was sampling in a way. He was taking existing fabrications and breathing new life and beauty into them.\u201dBig Daddy Kane, Eric B. and Rakim, KRS-One and LL Cool J were among the clients who came for Mr. Day\u2019s unique retrofits of Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Fendi and MCM. He worked the logos into his leather coats, hats, suits and even car interiors.When asked to describe what he has been up to in the 25 years since his boutique closed, Mr. Day looked at his son and brand manager, Jelani Day.\u201cHe went underground,\u201d Jelani said. \u201cThere is more to the story, but that\u2019s all we need to say for now.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Harlem tailor Daniel Day, known as Dapper Dan, misspelled the given name of MoMA\u2019s senior curator of architecture and design, who called Mr. Day a \u201ctrailblazer.\u201d She is Paola Antonelli, not Paolo. The article also misspelled the given name of Mr. Day\u2019s brother. He is Cary, not Kerry. In addition, the article described Jelani Day\u2019s role in his father\u2019s business incorrectly. He serves as the brand manager for Daniel Day, not merely as his business liaison.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macedonia Has New Government, but Rocky Road Ahead", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the government, elected on Wednesday by a slim majority in Parliament and led by Zoran Zaev of the center-left Social Democrats, faces the daunting task of restoring normality to a country racked by political divisions, a feeble economy and tense relations between ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians.Mr. Zaev, the new prime minister, seems well aware of the challenges ahead and has promised urgently needed changes and nationwide unification.\u201cMost people feel relieved about the change of power,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSome even say that we were \u2018too eager\u2019 \u201d to govern.\u201cThe fact is,\u201d he said, \u201cnothing is further from the truth. We know that the hardest part is yet to come, when we will have to face the damage left\u201d by the previous government, led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party.The nation\u2019s first change in power after 11 years was greeted with cautious optimism by the United States government and European officials.Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, and Johannes Hahn, the European commissioner for neighborhood policy and enlargement negotiations, said in a joint statement on Thursday:\u201cWe expect all parliamentary parties to put their divisions aside now and work jointly on delivering, from the outset, on a common reform agenda that would benefit the country in its entirety and bring the country back on its European integration path.\u201dMacedonia, a small, landlocked Balkan country of two million, transformed from a fragile but promising democracy to an authoritarian state under Nikola Gruevski, who was prime minister from 2006 to 2016. During the period, the country witnessed a degradation in the rights of the news media, a heavily biased judiciary system, rampant corruption and abuses of power.The stability of the country, formerly a republic in Yugoslavia, is strategically important, because it is in the center of the so-called Balkan route taken by migrants fleeing war-torn countries. It applied to join the European Union and NATO, but a long-simmering dispute with Greece over the use of the name \u201cMacedonia\u201d has derailed that plan.\u201cMacedonia is a deeply polarized society, where citizens are being divided based on their religion, ethnicity, gender, political views,\u201d said Dona Kosturanova, the executive director of the Youth Educational Forum, a nongovernmental organization.\u201cSome of the political elites in the country, including the former ruling party, are only deepening the gaps between the people, instead of working to bridge them closer,\u201d she added.The nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party, known as VMRO-DPMNE, won the most seats in elections in December, but not enough to form a government. After the April attack inside Parliament, President Gjorge Ivanov opened the door for an alternative government.Mr. Gruevski attributed his party\u2019s loss to foreign interference, which he said was prompted by his party\u2019s insistence \u201con a fair solution for the name issue with Greece, which blocked our E.U. and NATO integration\u201d effort. Greece objects to the name \u201cMacedonia\u201d in part because a region of Greece has the same name.Bojan Maricik, the executive director of Eurothink: Center for European Strategies, an independent think tank based in Skopje, the Macedonian capital, said he believed that Western governments did try to influence events in the country, but only to prevent wide-scale interethnic conflict and to ensure that basic democratic principles were being respected, such as the rule of law and freedom of the press.He said that in the past few years, Macedonia\u2019s blocked integration into the European Union had \u201cfueled nationalistic tensions insomuch as the level of unprecedented corruption and power abuse.\u201dAny revival of ethnic tensions, however, would be an \u201cexplosive\u201d issue for neighboring Serbia, Kosovo and Albania, Mr. Maricik added.Mr. Zaev, the new prime minister, said that it would take six months for Macedonians to see the first results of his changes and around two years for everyone to start feeling the improvements in the country.For the international community, the violence in Parliament in late April was a serious warning about the future and the stability of Macedonia.\u201cWe need a strong and independent judicial system, critical media and strong opposition, a strong Parliament that will control the executive organs, not act on instructions from the government,\u201d Mr. Zaev said. \u201cThat is why we will leave all control mechanisms to the independent experts, to safeguard the country from us, from the Social Democrats and from the government coalition.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the month of a violent confrontation in Macedonia\u2019s Parliament. It occurred in April, not May.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maldives, Tourist Haven, Casts Wary Eye on Growing Islamic Radicalism", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "After the killing of a liberal blogger in April, many fear that the Maldives, a Muslim island nation, is ill equipped to guard against extremism.Supported byMAL\u00c9, Maldives \u2014 This island paradise made news recently for a reason other than its pristine beaches and high-end resorts: the gruesome killing of a liberal blogger, stabbed to death by multiple assailants.But critics say these initiatives are cosmetic, doing little to standardize safety policies, and have come only after international stakeholders pressured the Maldivian authorities to acknowledge the threat extremism poses to visitors.The Maldives\u2019 unusual approach to tourism, in which a single island houses a single resort, has also meant that entire islands without robust security teams are vulnerable to being seized.Over the years, efforts to report on radical cells have been met with violent resistance. In 2014, a prominent Maldivian journalist who wrote about secularism and extremism, Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla, was abducted.Mr. Rasheed was part of a campaign dedicated to finding Mr. Abdulla, who was a close friend and is still missing.\u201cMost of the resorts have one official access point. There are security posts set up to monitor who comes on and off the island,\u201d he said. \u201cBut like any island, it\u2019s fairly easy to enter from other sides as well.\u201dAbeer Ismail, the information officer at the Ministry of Tourism, said that as far as he knew, no safety concerns had been raised officially by any resorts.Complicating those security measures, many say, is an expectation from high-end clientele that they will not be inconvenienced.Brig. Gen. Zakariyya Mansoor, the director general of the National Counter Terrorism Center, a recently formed government office spearheading efforts to increase security preparedness, agreed that it was challenging to identify noninvasive solutions and maintain the tranquil environment expected by tourists.But he said the country was well prepared to handle terrorist threats, pointing to the national policy on terrorism and the regular staging of simulated attacks at tourist facilities for training purposes.\u201cThere are certain criteria that every resort must meet in terms of safety and security,\u201d General Mansoor said. \u201cResort owners and resort operators are very cooperative with us.\u201dSecurity forces and government officials say there is currently no evidence of a planned attack in the country. But Mohamed, a former police officer who worked on counterterrorism for the Maldives Police Service and insisted on being identified only by one name because he feared reprisals from the government, urged caution.Of concern to him, he said, is what will happen when jihadis return to the country if greater security measures are not taken in the tourism industry. Those fighters, he said, hate tourism and do not care if it exists or not.Reporting for this article was facilitated through the support of the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting.Advertisement"}
