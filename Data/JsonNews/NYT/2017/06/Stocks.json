{"Headline": "Third Point, a Hedge Fund, Sets Its Activist Sights on Nestl\u00e9", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Over the past two decades, the hedge fund mogul Daniel S. Loeb has established himself as one of the biggest activist investors around. Now, he has set his sights on one of Europe\u2019s largest corporate citizens: Nestl\u00e9, the global food giant.It is the latest ambitious move by an activist investor to rattle the leaders of the corporate world. Flush with cash, these funds have taken stakes in ever-bigger companies, hoping to goad them into selling themselves or breaking themselves up to improve their stock prices.Third Point disclosed that it owned about 40 million shares in Nestl\u00e9, a stake that amounts to about $3.5 billion in stock. That would make the hedge fund the Swiss company\u2019s sixth-largest shareholder, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.Behind Third Point\u2019s investment in Nestl\u00e9 is a conviction that the company must do more to reshape its product portfolio and adapt to changing consumer tastes and competition from smaller, local brands. The hedge fund argued that the company\u2019s earnings per share figure had not meaningfully improved over the last five years.Shares in Nestl\u00e9 have risen nearly 15 percent over the last 12 months, trailing those of its fellow consumer conglomerate Unilever but outpacing those of other food companies like Mondelez and Kraft Heinz.\u201cThird Point invested in Nestl\u00e9 because we recognized a familiar set of conditions that make it ripe for improvement and change,\u201d the hedge fund wrote in its investor letter. \u201cIt is rare to find a business of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s quality with so many avenues for improvement.\u201dA representative for Nestl\u00e9 was not available for comment.But the hedge fund argued that Nestl\u00e9 should also sell its 23 percent stake in L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the big cosmetics maker whose products include its namesake beauty brand and luxury products like Kiehl\u2019s. The fund argued that the holding was nonstrategic and could be sold off without incurring huge taxes.In a change from previous investments, in which Mr. Loeb was known for his venomous attacks on the chief executives of the targeted companies, Third Point has praised Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leader, Ulf Mark Schneider. The hedge fund pointed positively to his earlier tenure at the German medical supply company Fresenius. But to succeed at Nestl\u00e9, the hedge fund argued, he needs to present a bold strategy that would overhaul the food giant\u2019s performance.The same month, it announced it was retooling its Maggi line to eliminate ingredients consumers do not like and add vegetables, grains and other more nutritional items.In addition, the company has worked over the last several years to strip preservatives and other ingredients from its ice creams and decidedly improve its vast frozen foods portfolio.Third Point said it had hired Jan Bennink, a former executive chairman of Sara Lee, to advise the hedge fund on its investment.Stephanie Strom contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clouds Are Forming Over the Bond Market", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe bond market is flashing warning signals that bad times may be ahead for the stock market and the economy.That is probably not what most people want to hear \u2014 stock investors especially. In the first half of the year, after all, stocks have performed spectacularly. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index returned 9 percent through June, churning out gains so regularly that it may seem churlish to note that clouds are appearing on the horizon.Yet like a long-range forecast about a possible storm, an old and trusted financial indicator is telling us that trouble may be looming.Simply put, while the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates since December, the bond market hasn\u2019t gotten the memo. The longer-term rates that are set through bond market trading have, for the most part, been declining, though there was a brief reversal in the last few days. But the disconnect over the last few months is a sign that bond investors believe economic growth and inflation are still weak and the Fed\u2019s actions are premature.In the past, when disputes between the Fed and the bond market have persisted and grown, they have sometimes predicted big problems ahead \u2014 like a plunging stock market and, eventually, a recession.Rain is coming, Mr. Rosenberg said, recommending that investors prepare by keeping enough cash on hand and setting up their portfolios to weather a storm. Regions like the eurozone are in an earlier stage of the economic cycle, he said, and may be better bets now. He urges caution in the United States. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you when it is going to happen,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the economic cycle has not been abolished, and the chances of a recession are rising.\u201dThough there is widespread concern about the behavior of the fixed-income markets, some analysts aren\u2019t as convinced that the forecast is quite so gloomy.\u201cThe economy is growing very slowly,\u201d he added, \u201cat a pace of less than 2 percent per year, a rate that we used to call \u2018stall speed,\u2019 in the belief that when the economy is that feeble, it will fall into a recession. But that hasn\u2019t happened. The economy keeps growing, the stock market keeps going up, yet inflation remains very low. Where are we heading? There are many possibilities here. This isn\u2019t the economy we used to know.\u201dUnderstanding the situation more deeply requires a little technical knowledge, so bear with me.The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, lowered short-term rates to near-zero levels during the financial crisis. With the economy on the mend, and asset prices like stocks and real estate soaring, Fed officials have begun raising short-term rates and say they intend to continue to do so.What is unusual is that while the short-term rates that are controlled and heavily influenced by the Fed have been rising, the longer-term rates that the bond market sets have generally been dropping. That is why 30-year fixed mortgage rates are still below 4 percent, not all that much higher than they were a year ago.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for example, declined from more than 2.6 percent in March to about 2.1 percent earlier in June. (It rose to 2.3 percent on Friday.) The rate on the 10-year note has been hovering at only about 1 percentage point above the Fed funds rate and 0.6 or 0.7 of a percentage point above the three-year Treasury note.In bond market jargon, \u201cthe yield curve has been flattening\u201d \u2014 meaning short- and long-term interest rates have been moving closer to parity. In itself, such a development is unusual. But if the trend continues, with shorter-term rates rising above longer-term rates, the message from the bond market would amount to a flashing red light.In such a case, bond mavens would say, \u201cThe yield curve has inverted,\u201d implying a reversal of the natural order of things, because most of the time, investors demand a yield premium for tying their money up for longer periods. An inversion would express deep skepticism about Fed policy and about the health of the economy. In the past, inversions have often predicted economic recessions and sharp declines in the stock market.That said, we don\u2019t have an inversion at this point, and we may not go there at all.Mr. Yardeni remains bullish on United States stocks and is cautiously positive about the economy, saying low bond yields probably reflect persistently low inflation, which could be benign. Factors like demography (the aging of the baby boom generation), technology (the efficiency of smartphones and cloud computing) and globalization have changed the economy and reduced the inflation rate, he said.Low inflation, along with low global interest rates, are at least partly responsible for the low bond yields in the United States. Those low yields have been a boon to people who own bonds because yield and price move in opposite directions: The benchmark Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate index returned more than 2.4 percent through June, despite predictions early in the year of bad times for bond investors.The danger signals from the bond market could easily change to another pattern. The Fed may pause in raising short-term rates, though that could unleash irrational exuberance and drive already stretched stock prices higher. On the other hand, the bond market could blink, raising bond yields and relieving the tension. But that would be far more likely if, counter to current expectations, inflation or economic growth began to surge.At a bare minimum, the policy choices ahead are difficult. And for investors, there is ample reason for caution.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Soccer Kept Changing, but Xabi Alonso Never Did. Then He Retired.", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMUNICH \u2014 It\u2019s not the summer that Xabi Alonso worries about. The next couple of months, he knows, will be easy.There is a family vacation to the United States scheduled, and then weeks of empty days to fill however he sees fit. His calendar has been left deliberately, enticingly blank.He wants to use that time to travel more. He will continue to read, voraciously, once he has finished his current book, \u201cWhere Are We Going to Dance Tonight?,\u201d a collection of short stories by a friend, the author Javier Aznar.Maybe he will not keep quite so close an eye on his fitness as he normally does. Maybe there will be the occasional morning when he does not take himself off for an hour or two and do some light conditioning work. Certainly, though, he will spend most of his time with his wife, Nagore, and their three children, Jon, Ane and Emma. They are 9, 7 and 3 now. \u201cA good age to start learning life,\u201d he said. He intends to be there to see it.It is August, the middle of August especially, that concerns him, when the summer does not suddenly end, and the only life he has known does not resume. That will be the moment when Alonso\u2019s retirement will become real.\u201cI have negotiated with myself, dealt with the process, and I am feeling it is right,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the vacation, when the Bundesliga starts, La Liga starts, the Premier League starts, and I am here on the sofa, on the other side, that is the moment when I will realize, when I will find out if I am fine here, or I would love to be there.\u201dOn March 9, Alonso, 35, picked up a pair of spotless soccer shoes and walked with Nagore to the park near his home in Munich. He turned his back and waved as she took a picture.A few minutes later, he uploaded it to Twitter, along with a brief message. One of the finest midfielders of his generation, a player who has won everything there is to win, in a career that has taken him to Real Sociedad, Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, was saying goodbye.In the months since, Alonso said, he has not doubted his decision. He was not tired of soccer, had not fallen out of love with the sport. He still watches as many games as he can, indulging his \u201cweakness for midfielders.\u201d There is much about it he will miss: the \u201cadrenaline\u201d shot of being in the thick of the action, and the more quotidian feel of training.\u201cI am going to miss this,\u201d he said, taking in the view of Bayern\u2019s sun-bleached S\u00e4bener Strasse training complex a few weeks ago. \u201cThe grass, the sound of the ball, the jokes with my teammates. That\u2019s what I will miss most. That is what fulfills you most on a daily basis.\u201dBut he knew that the time was right. \u201cI read that leaving is like buying and selling stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is either too early or too late. In football, it is similar. It is hard to find the right moment, but I feel in peace. I am a mature fruit, and I have dropped from the tree.\u201dIt is a ripening so subtle as to be virtually imperceptible. At his peak, Alonso was always said to be one of those players who had time, on the ball, on his side, and that was the case in what turned out to be the last year of his career, too.He jokes that age has not improved him \u2014 \u201cI am still as slow as I was when I was 20\u201d \u2014 but nor did it visibly diminish him. Right up until his last game on May 27, he was the same Alonso who won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005, the European Championship with Spain in 2008 and 2012 and the World Cup in 2010: composed, assured, spraying passes the width of the field, gently seizing control of the game until it bowed under his command.What makes his longevity remarkable is that, even as Alonso did not change, the game around him did. In the 18 years since he made his debut for Real Sociedad, the team he supported as a child, the team with which his father, Periko Alonso, won the Spanish championship, Alonso has witnessed firsthand dozens of evolutions and revolutions. His relationship with soccer has never changed, he said, but soccer itself is markedly different.He was at Liverpool when the Premier League was the best league in the world, and in the thick of the most toxic years of Real Madrid\u2019s rivalry with Barcelona. He played tiki-taka with Spain to conquer the world, lived without the ball for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Madrid, and became an integral part of Pep Guardiola\u2019s shape-shifting Bayern Munich.Riquelme is regarded by many as a player born half a century too late; an analog player forced to operate in a digital world. He was around when Alonso started his career, but is now the first name that leaps to Alonso\u2019s mind when he is asked how soccer has changed. Riquelme, Alonso said, was too much of an individual, too contemplative, to thrive in the modern era. \u201cI loved him,\u201d he said.His eyes light up, too, at the mention of Juan Carlos Valer\u00f3n, Riquelme\u2019s Spanish equivalent, but these are just the parts of the game we see.Beneath soccer\u2019s surface, its internal structures are different, too. In recent years, Alonso\u2019s fitness work has become more individual, more tailored. Coaches have access to more data, more analysis, more knowledge \u2014 and so do players. \u201cYou know your opponents much better,\u201d he said. And they know you better, too.Off the field, social media has transformed the landscape, and not necessarily for the better. \u201cMany players are losing their focus of what the real job is,\u201d he said. On it, many of the coaches he has worked with and learned from \u2014 Mourinho, Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti \u2014 are \u201cthinking, and trying to bring new things to the game.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to have new ideas,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they are coming.\u201dAlonso feels he understands the game better now than he ever has, but it is the parts he does not quite comprehend that fascinate him.\u201cI don\u2019t think I will stop learning about football,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain parts we will never understand, like what happens in the brain of a player, or makes a team fear. We do not understand the mental part so well. I don\u2019t have an answer.\u201dFinding an answer, you sense, may be what eventually draws him back when the lure of the normal has started to fade. The game will have changed countless times again when he returns, if he returns, of course. Most likely, Alonso \u2014 deeply thoughtful, fiercely intelligent, endlessly successful \u2014 will be the same.A caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the game depicted between Spain and Germany in 2010. It was a World Cup semifinal, not a final.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fear of an End to Easy Money Prompts Sell-Off", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFears that central banks would unwind years of easy money policies rattled global markets on Thursday, prompting a sharp sell-off in European stocks and technology companies in the United States.Since the financial crisis, central banks in the United States, Europe and Japan have injected trillions of dollars into their economies in a bid to jump-start sluggish growth and halt broader deflationary trends.Now, with markets on a perpetual sugar high from so much stimulus, central bankers have become more forthright in signaling interest rate increases, or in paring bond-buying programs that have flooded the markets with cash.The initial tremors were felt in European government bonds after a cautionary speech on Tuesday by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. By Thursday, the selling had spread from the bond market to global stocks.After European stocks slumped, the sell-off extended to United States trading, particularly in technology stocks, whose rich valuations have been questioned. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 1.44 percent on Thursday.The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note, which was at 2.12 percent on Monday, had risen to 2.27 percent on Thursday. (Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.)A sign of the state of investors\u2019 nerves was an intraday spike in the index known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the VIX, which jumped 51 percent, before ending the day up 14 percent.But in calling for prudence in policy, Mr. Draghi \u2014 who, more than any other central banker, is known for his judicious choice of words \u2014 sparked an immediate sell-off in European government bonds as investors interpreted his use of the word \u201cprudence\u201d as a stepping away from the bank\u2019s commitment to keep buying European government bonds.Taken aback by the rout, central bank officials quickly said that the speech should not be seen as a statement by Mr. Draghi that he would tighten policy immediately, but investors paid them little heed.\u201cCentral bankers are saying that economies are doing well enough and conditions are loose enough that we do not need to press the pedal to the metal anymore,\u201d said Michel Del Buono, global strategist for Makena, an investment firm that caters to foundations and endowments. \u201cBut many investors are still thinking that they will be doing the maximum forever.\u201dIt is not just the European Central Bank that has, fairly abruptly, signaled a change in direction.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, another central banker known for dovish sympathies, said in a speech on Tuesday that an increase in rates might be in order just a month after he indicated that interest rates would remain low.The pound and the yield on the British 10-year note surged afterward.The swift sell-off in European stocks and bonds recalled the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when the Federal Reserve first said it would begin to taper its policy of buying mortgages and other securities in an attempt to stimulate the economy.Even though an actual rate increase was years away, stocks and bonds in emerging markets, long dependent on interest-rate sensitive capital flows, fell sharply in what would become a three-year bear market for the asset class.That Mr. Draghi and Mr. Carney moved so quickly to signal this new approach has prompted analysts to speculate that there may be some form of coordination among central bankers to warn investors who have benefited from the liquidity boom.Stock markets in the United States have hit highs and, for quite awhile, the interest rates on trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of European government bonds dipped into negative territory as global investors piled into these securities, confident that the central bank would continue to buy.In the last few weeks, some officials from the Federal Reserve have warned about overheated financial markets.On Tuesday, for example, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, described stock market valuations as being \u201csomewhat rich.\u201d Her language did not carry the punch of \u201cirrational exuberance,\u201d Alan Greenspan\u2019s phrase to refer to a runaway stock market in the late 1990s.Nevertheless it did send a clear signal to many investors that the Fed, even though it has no official mandate to guide or influence financial markets, is watching for potential bubbles. And that, perhaps, it will consider overvalued stock and bond markets when weighing its next rate increase.So in that sense, some analysts say, central bankers\u2019 recent turn to a more conservative approach should not be seen as a surprise.Of the Dow Jones industrial average\u2019s 30 members, only Goldman Sachs (up 0.9 percent) and JPMorgan Chase (up 1.48 percent) were positive for the day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Santander Rescues Troubled Rival in Test of Europe\u2019s New Rules", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the global financial crisis, Europe built a system designed to contain the collateral damage from failing banks. That new system appeared to pass its first test on Wednesday, as authorities efficiently dispatched a troubled Spanish lender.The relative lack of drama after the failure of Banco Popular, Spain\u2019s fifth-biggest bank, highlighted the large strides made by the eurozone compared with a few years ago, when the problems of even small lenders had the potential to rock financial markets and raise existential questions about European unity.Bank stocks rose in Europe after authorities in Frankfurt and Brussels declared that Banco Popular was essentially a lost cause and sold it to Banco Santander, Spain\u2019s largest bank. The swift action by European Central Bank and European Union officials defied critics who said a system for winding down sick banks, put into place at the end of 2014, was too unwieldy to deal with a fast-moving crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s very positive for establishing the new banking policy framework,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cIt will demonstrate to a number of people that the framework is working better than many doubters expected.\u201dThe rescue is the first in which the European Central Bank has determined that a eurozone lender has failed or is about to fail. The central bank assumed authority over eurozone banks in 2014 as part of changes intended to prevent banking crises like that of 2008.But the failure of Banco Popular, felled by its exposure to toxic mortgages left over from a housing boom, was nevertheless a reminder that, nearly a decade after the financial crisis, the eurozone\u2019s banking system remains vulnerable.Many banks in Italy, Germany and elsewhere in the 19-country euro area suffer from piles of bad loans, thin capital cushions and meager profits. The woes of banks continue to weigh on economic growth in the bloc.For Monte dei Paschi to qualify for government aid, the European Central Bank must determine that it is solvent. But by some measures, the Italian lender is in worse shape than Banco Popular. Monte dei Paschi fared significantly worse than the Spanish lender in assessments of bank health last year. The central bank could be accused of playing favorites if it clears the way for Monte dei Paschi to receive a taxpayer rescue.The path of the two banks also serves to illustrate the diverging economic fates of Spain and Italy.Spain, one of the countries hardest hit by the eurozone debt crisis in 2010, has since cleaned up many of its domestic banks \u2014 though clearly not Banco Popular \u2014 and taken politically unpopular steps to improve the functioning of the economy, like making it easier for companies to fire unwanted workers. Spanish unemployment is dropping from catastrophic levels and growth is among the fastest in the eurozone.By contrast, Italy is only beginning to institute such reforms, the economy is barely growing, and many Italian banks remain fragile. The government in Rome has not been willing to risk letting a big bank fail and perhaps creating a broad market panic.Italian authorities also feared the political ramifications if Monte dei Paschi collapsed. Without government aid, the bank would be forced to impose losses on thousands of middle-class savers who bought the bank\u2019s bonds. There is fear the public backlash would benefit populist parties and add to political turmoil in the country.In Spain, the government signaled it did not want taxpayers to rescue Banco Popular, even though investors would bear some of the pain.If, as is likely, the European Central Bank allows the rescue of Monte dei Paschi to proceed, it can argue the situation is different than in Spain. By requesting approval to provide capital to Monte dei Paschi, the government triggered different procedures than apply to Banco Popular.Still, Mr. V\u00e9ron of Bruegel predicted that Banco Popular\u2019s collapse would prompt lawsuits by people who own its bonds and are losing their money.The Spanish bank\u2019s problems stem from the large mortgage portfolio it built up during the country\u2019s housing boom. When the European banking crisis struck in 2012, several lenders had to take emergency action, and Banco Popular opted to raise capital multiple times over the next four years.But its mortgage problems mounted, and it reported an annual loss of \u20ac3.5 billion in 2016. In February, it hired a new chairman, Emilio Saracho, to help lead a turnaround.Mr. Saracho set about selling nonstrategic assets and began looking for new ways to raise financing, before announcing in April that his bank might instead seek a merger. He eventually hired outside bankers to organize an auction, but Banco Popular said last week that it had failed to receive any formal offers.Shares of Banco Popular had dropped by more than half in the past week over concerns that the bank would need additional capital as it struggled under the weight of billions of euros in bad real estate loans.Officials at the European Central Bank, which is responsible for supervising eurozone banks, had been closely monitoring Banco Popular. By Tuesday, as it became clear that the bank could no longer borrow money from other banks and was running out of cash, the European Central Bank had determined that the lender was \u201cfailing or likely to fail.\u201d\u201cThe significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due,\u201d the central bank said.Responsibility for winding down Banco Popular then passed to the Single Resolution Board in Brussels, which sold the bank to Santander. The multilayered system had been criticized as too cumbersome, but functioned in this case.The combined business of Banco Popular and Santander will be led by the current management team of Santander Spain with Rami Aboukhair as chief executive, Santander said.Still, while the acquisition averts a banking crisis, it also increases Santander\u2019s dominance of the Spanish banking market and reduces competition, which could eventually be bad for customers.The takeover of Banco Popular comes five years after the near-collapse of a giant Spanish mortgage lender, Bankia. That forced the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to negotiate a huge European banking bailout. In the end, Spain needed \u20ac41 billion of bailout money.Chad Bray reported from London, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt. Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Slump in Tech Stocks That Leaves Some Investors Mystified", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe laws of gravity apparently apply to technology stocks after all.No one trigger related to the fundamentals of these companies spurred the snap back. As has been the case for years now, these technology giants sit on trillions of dollars in cash, are growing at a breakneck pace and, compared with companies in earlier tech frenzies, do not have absurd valuations.Yet it has been this lack of an identifiable cause \u2014 a disappointing earnings result or a major investor\u2019s unloading stock, for example \u2014 that has been worrying some market specialists.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dOn Monday, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was also slightly lower, off 0.1 percent.Netflix helped lead the way, declining 4.2 percent. Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.In the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.The declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.To the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500\u2019s return of more than 8 percent this year.The bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.UBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.While traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors \u2014 given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market \u2014 will stick with them.According to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today\u2019s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.Hedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer \u201cFaamg,\u201d substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)Compared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins \u2014 exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges \u2014 that is a very small figure.To a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.In the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.Credit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.In the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nestl\u00e9, Under Pressure, Plans Buyback and Perhaps Acquisitions", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In revealing his investment position in Nestl\u00e9 on Sunday, the hedge fund manager Daniel S. Loeb urged the company to consider slimming down, as well as buying back its stock.Nestl\u00e9 said it could buy back almost $21 billion of its shares over the next three years to create value for its shareholders. The company added that it would consider making acquisitions in fast-growing parts of its business portfolio, including coffee, pet care, bottled water and consumer health care.The plan suggests significant change at Nestl\u00e9, the Swiss food giant whose products include Kit Kat bars and Stouffer\u2019s frozen pizzas, at a time when its once-enviable growth rates have declined as consumer tastes change.Shares of Nestl\u00e9, which surged 4.3 percent on Monday, fell 1.6 percent in trading in Zurich on Tuesday.Nestl\u00e9 said that the plans it announced on Tuesday had arisen from a regular review of the company\u2019s capital positions \u2014 its top managers began the review in January \u2014 and that the announcement was not a response to Mr. Loeb\u2019s activist campaign.While the company traditionally presents such proposals in September, this time it chose to release the announcement the same day it received regulatory clearance to do so.Yet Nestl\u00e9\u2019s new strategic course came out only two days after Mr. Loeb\u2019s hedge fund, Third Point, emerged as one of the company\u2019s biggest shareholders and presented suggestions aimed at shaking up what Third Point described as a significant underperformer.Tuesday\u2019s announcement revealed that Nestl\u00e9 had reached some of the same conclusions. The company said its board was prepared to spend up to 20 billion Swiss francs on stock buybacks. And the conglomerate said it planned to continue to \u201cadjust\u201d its portfolio of operations.Nestl\u00e9, however, also emphasized that it was prepared to spend, and potentially spend a lot, to bolster the fast-growing parts of its business. The areas it named as candidates for deal making include those that the company\u2019s chief executive, Ulf Mark Schneider, identified this year as important growth areas.Such deals would be a higher priority than the stock buybacks: Nestl\u00e9 said the bulk of its share repurchases would take place in 2019 and 2020 to let the company make takeovers first.The company said it was open to improving its profit margins, another topic broached by Third Point.A spokeswoman for Third Point declined to comment on Nestl\u00e9\u2019s announcement.An earlier version of a graphic that accompanied this article misstated the size of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s sales figures.

{"Headline": "The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "FeatureAndrew Left sniffs out corporate fraud \u2014 and gets rich doing it.Supported byIn the finance world, Left, 46, is what is known as an \u201cactivist\u201d short-seller. After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company\u2019s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries \u2014 Tesla, Valeant, GoPro \u2014 and though he makes mistakes, he has an unusually high success rate.For a year he had been assembling a file on Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefits manager with $100 billion in revenue. Pharmacy-benefits managers occupy an eye-glazingly complex netherworld in the prescription-drug supply chain, serving as intermediaries between drug makers and insurers. Express Scripts ostensibly exists to keep drug prices low, by negotiating with drug makers on behalf of insurers, but Left believed that the company was actually inflating them, because higher prices meant larger rebates from the drug makers, which meant more profit. He believed that this was true of all pharmacy-benefits managers, but especially of Express Scripts, the most powerful. Its second-largest customer was the Department of Defense; downward pressure on drug pricing from the government could seriously threaten its bottom line.By rights, then, Trump\u2019s threat in the interview should have tanked Express Scripts\u2019 stock. That the price remained unchanged indicated to Left that many people on Wall Street had no clue what a pharmacy-benefits manager does. Trump, he thought as he pulled out of the Madison Club, had given his stale, year-old story a fresh hook. (A spokesman for Express Scripts denied Left\u2019s claims, noting that \u201croughly 90 percent of rebates go directly to our clients.\u201d)Fifteen minutes later, Left was driving west on Interstate 10 in his black Bentley Continental GT. From the car, he placed a call to a hedge-fund manager, a man who was already short Express Scripts and therefore had a stake in providing Left with information. Express Scripts, this man reminded Left, did not disclose the amount it made in rebates, while some of its operating metrics exceeded those of Apple; something seemed wrong.Left heard \u201crebates\u201d and thought \u201ckickbacks.\u201d Express Scripts was, in Left\u2019s mind, \u201cthe man behind the man\u201d; it was \u201cthe mob.\u201d If he went public with a short position tomorrow, he wagered, he could sour Wall Street\u2019s perception of the company, transforming it from a sure thing into a noisy, chaotic mess. That attention might in turn attract regulators, further driving down the share price. He called his web designer, Mike Leznik, and told him that he wanted to buy a domain name to host his research on Express Scripts. An hour later the road snaked above Studio City, and he arrived at Mulholland Estates, his gated community in Beverly Hills.The next morning, Left stood in his home office and put CNBC on the television. The anchors were discussing the \u201cTrump bump,\u201d as the recent stock rally was being called. \u201cThey sit around all day long without ever knowing anything,\u201d Left said. \u201cIt\u2019s so annoying to watch them.\u201d Seated beneath the TV was Leznik, a sweet-natured Angeleno in jeans and blue-suede sneakers. Leznik lacked the macho swagger that made Left, with his money and filthy mouth, the center of a room. Nowhere was this truer than in his office. A giant desk dominated the back half. On the credenza sat cigar boxes from Enron and Madoff Securities \u2014 a short-seller\u2019s version of trophy antlers.\u201cWhat should I register the domain name as?\u201d Leznik asked.\u201cYour mother is a whore dot com?\u201d Left said.\u201cThe real story of \u2014 \u201d Leznik suggested.\u201cThe real story of your mother being a whore?\u201d Left said.Leznik settled on TheRealExpressScripts.com, then asked Left for his credit card to buy the URL.\u201cWhat are you, my wife?\u201d Left said.There were several obvious comebacks to this \u2014 \u201cYou wish\u201d being the absolute minimum \u2014 but none occurred to Leznik, who after fumbling for a moment said, \u201cI could be, if you had enough room.\u201d A whiff. The room was silenced.At 10 a.m., having placed his bet against the stock the night before, Left put out his first tweet, which he misspelled and deleted four times. Such is his mystique in the world of finance, however, that one of his followers assumed that the misspellings and deletions were part of a premeditated scheme to exploit Twitter\u2019s visibility algorithms. Finally the corrected version of the tweet came out from Left\u2019s handle, @CitronResearch, followed moments later by another: \u201cWhen @RealDonaldTrump goes after $ESRX,\u201d it read, using the ticker symbol for Express Scripts, \u201cheads will roll.\u201d We sat back and waited, eyes on CNBC. Twenty minutes passed. Suddenly a news flash interrupted the show. \u201cExpress Scripts shares are falling sharply on a spike in volume,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cCitron Research, run by Andrew Left, tweeted about the stock. They\u2019re now down by 9 or 10 percent, about 9.2 million shares so far.\u201d Left\u2019s tweet appeared in the corner of the screen. In the office, the atmosphere went taut.We watched as the stock came down, dollar after dollar, from 75 to 74 to 73; 72, 71, 70. Left wrote two more tweets, including a promise to appear on television with further revelations. Soon, the phone started ringing \u2014 reporters calling. Linette Lopez from Business Insider texted for quotes. CNBC booked him for 2 p.m. that day. \u201cThe question is,\u201d Left told a journalist from Bloomberg, \u201cis the new administration serious? He\u2019s going to rein in drug pricing. O.K., Mr. Trump, here\u2019s my advice: I know the industry. Go after Express Scripts.\u201d\u201cDo you have a short position?\u201d the reporter from Bloomberg asked.\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Left said.\u201cExpress Scripts, as we\u2019re talking, continues to drop,\u201d the anchor on CNBC said.In 15 minutes, $6 billion of market capitalization vanished. (Five months later, the stock price is still down 13 percent.) Left considered the circus around him. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201csome guys know this stuff better than me. But I know how to put it in [expletive] tweets.\u201dAt any given moment, someone, somewhere, has a short position in whatever stock you can think of \u2014 99 percent of all stocks in the world, by some estimates. Blue-chip stocks like Apple and Google are being shorted. Shake Shack is being shorted to an unhealthy degree: Almost half its shares are borrowed. As you read this, people are short on The New York Times. Almost uniquely among Wall Street maneuvers, short-selling entails what traders call infinite downside. While potential profit is constrained by the distance between the current share price and zero, the potential loss is not, because the shares, once borrowed, can rise in price indefinitely, which means the cost of returning them can, too. It\u2019s unsurprising that short-sellers tend to be aggressive men who are convinced that they see what other people miss and are comfortable with \u2014 or addicted to \u2014 risk.For many years that risk was taken on in secret: Short-sellers would make their bets and passively wait for the market to move in their direction. The figure of the activist, who goes public with his positions, emerged into prominence in recent years. One crucial event in Wall Street history provided the foundation. In 2001, James Chanos, a hedge-fund manager, discovered an accounting scandal at Enron, then a little-known energy company in Texas, and shared his information with journalists from Fortune. The journalists got a best seller, Chanos got his money and Jeffrey Skilling, Enron\u2019s chief executive, got 24 years at the Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Ala.Short-sellers of Left\u2019s generation are following this example but cutting out the middleman. You don\u2019t need an office in a flashy building in the Battery, they have realized, or the validation of the press. If you build enough of a reputation, all you need are some Twitter followers and a website. Left has emerged at the forefront of this new guard. Unlike Chanos, who managed billions of dollars of other people\u2019s money, Left invests his own, which exempts him from disclosing his holdings to the public. And now that his work has brought him national attention, he has found that others are willing to make it easier, by leaking documents to him and passing tips. In many cases, Left\u2019s dossiers against his targets are not wholly his own but built using information from a confidential source. He is, in this sense, a bit like a journalist.He also makes it look easy. One result of Left\u2019s fame is that today\u2019s younger traders believe that they, too, could be him. Wuyang Zhao, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who wrote his dissertation on activist short-selling, told me: \u201cPeople read Andrew Left, and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, my God, it\u2019s not impossibly difficult. It\u2019s not a lot of work, and you can bring down a big company.\u2019\u2009\u201d One of Left\u2019s friends recalled a visit Left made to a university to give a lecture. In the hallways afterward, the students swarmed him. \u201cIt was like he was Mick Jagger,\u201d the friend said.From 2006 to 2015, the number of activist short campaigns rose by 1,300 percent, to 1,289. In the past three years, the number of activist short-sellers working globally has nearly doubled, to 72 from 39. Very few have a positive track record. Left does. On average, the value of companies he writes about drop 10 percent in a year, and some drop as much as 95 percent.One morning last spring, Left and I stood in his lush backyard while he smoked a Marlboro Light. Beyond the swimming pool, the land fell sharply into the valley, and Los Angeles lay prone in the heat. We could see DJ Khaled\u2019s recently purchased house over the fence to our left. Tan and unshaven in loafers, Left possessed the vaguely louche charisma of a club promoter, which is what you might mistake him for were it not for his eyes \u2014 green, wet, melancholy eyes, which, because they cannot but project sincerity, are his greatest tools on television. His eyes are the reason he could stand in his million-dollar lawn and say to me, without irony, \u201cI\u2019m an investigative journalist who trades on his information.\u201dI observed that most investigative journalists could not count DJ Khaled as a neighbor.\u201cThe difference between this and journalism is you can make millions of dollars,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut you can lose millions of dollars, too.\u201dWhen I found him at the airport, he was wearing distressed jeans and a golf shirt, barking into an iPhone. He had just flown back from a vacation in Florida. During the 45-minute drive to his house, Left, never hanging up, floated and discarded a variety of plans. They were: exposing a jewelry chain as a subprime lender in disguise; shorting a maybe-fraudulent media company in Canada; and withdrawing a million-dollar cashier\u2019s check from his bank, made out to a pharmaceutical company, to be offered as a donation to the charity of its choice if it could prove to him the efficacy of a drug for multiple sclerosis, still in trials, which Left had on authority from the \u201crabbi of M.S.\u201d didn\u2019t work.The man on the other end of the line was a hedge-fund manager, this one a very close associate of Left\u2019s, at the center of his circle of sources. His relationship with Left was completely informal. His role was to trade ideas back and forth, sometimes shorting the companies they discussed. In exchange for sharing his insight and institutional muscle, Left\u2019s source avoided the legal liability that came from going public with a position. (A short campaign based on faulty information leaves you open to accusations of market manipulation, something Left has never been charged with in the United States.) Left has a number of sources on Wall Street, and during the months I spent reporting on him, he took care to keep their names from me, lest he burn them.Left also got tips as many journalists do, in large quantities, most of them useless. Business-school wannabes emailed him to get noticed. E-Trade cowboys offered schemes \u201cfor your eyes only.\u201d Hedge funds sent him research and ideas, most often because they wanted him to catalyze a short position they already held, by taking it public. What many of these people failed to grasp was that a bad company wasn\u2019t necessarily a good story. One morning, I watched him read his emails. \u201cGildan T-shirts,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThat idea does nothing for me. Who gives a [expletive] about Gildan?\u201dThen there was a third set of sources he used: tips of no discernible origin. In March 2012, for instance, a package without a return address landed on his doorstep. Inside were 68 pages of research claiming that a Chinese real estate company, Evergrande, was perpetrating an accounting fraud and would collapse. An odd tone pervaded, as if a very strait-laced stock analyst were trying to loosen up and channel Left\u2019s combative voice (\u201cChairman Hui\u2019s pet projects are comically off-strategy ... the endgame is nearing ... a maze of Ponzi-esque debt\u201d). Left hired a fact-checker, became convinced that the claims were accurate, updated some figures and published. The stock instantly dropped 7 percent. He covered a portion of his position two hours later, taking $280,000 in profit.But the profit was only the beginning of the story. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission sued Left for \u201cfalse and misleading claims,\u201d a failure to adequately support his accusations with evidence. The judge found him guilty and barred him from trading on the Chinese markets for five years. (Left objects to the decision on free-speech grounds and is appealing the ruling.) He refused to give up the name of his fact-checker. As to the identity of the anonymous sender, there was nothing to give up: Left had no idea who it was, except someone who almost certainly had a short position in Evergrande and made a fortune off the publication without the hassle of appearing in court. That was the point of using physical paper. Courts can subpoena your emails, but good luck tracing the mail backward from your gated community in Beverly Hills.As careful as Left must be to fact-check, hesitation hurts, too. If you\u2019re slow, other shorts can scoop you, which is exactly what happened with the online postage seller: A competitor had published a version of Left\u2019s thesis on a finance blog, and the stock\u2019s price had fallen too far to short. Back at his home office, Left tried to work, but the atmosphere was lazy, diffuse. He called a source. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he said, asking about the postage stock. \u201cWill it bounce?\u201d The source replied that it would not.Left squinted at CNBC. Then he roared. It began as a self-mocking \u201cWhy me?\u201d exasperation but expanded into something more unhindered, a primal American shriek. \u201cUugghHHAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH\u200bHHHHHHHHHH.\u201dWhen he was through, he said, almost to himself, \u201cThere has got to be an easier way to make money.\u201dRecognizing his ability to dazzle an audience at a young age, Black wanted her son to become a lawyer or a rabbi. Instead, he was accepted at Northeastern and chose political science. Boston confronted him for the first time with people who had always had money. They knew that Beverly Hills was an actual place in California, not a made-up city on TV. They wore black. They didn\u2019t drink Bartles & Jaymes.After graduating in 1993, Left responded to a newspaper ad from an outfit called the Universal Commodity Corporation, offering $100,000 a year for work in what the advertiser knew not to call a boiler room. Boiler rooms are cold-call centers for stocks, where men in bare-walled offices put the screws on unsophisticated marks. (As in: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Mrs. Jones. I\u2019d hate to see your husband miss out.\u201d) Roberta Karmel, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regulator who policed the Long Island boiler rooms in the 1980s, described to me a typical employee. \u201cHe tended to go to lesser schools for college,\u201d she said. \u201cOr not go to college at all. And a lot of them were kind of scrappy personalities who thought: Well, I\u2019m just as smart as the people at the white-shoe firms. I can make a lot of money, too.\u201dMaybe \u2014 if you\u2019re good at it. Left was not. He would meander off script and lose the sale. He quit after nine months, ejecting himself into the mid-\u201990s froth, where there was very little oversight and, almost everywhere you looked, a thick layer of scumminess. These were the years when the future \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d author Jordan Belfort ran a brokerage firm on Long Island, taking small companies public. Left started flipping penny-stock I.P.O.s, including Belfort\u2019s \u2014 he would call up the \u201cbucket shops,\u201d or storefront stock exchanges, ask for shares before a company went public and then sell them later at a profit.At the time, the Long Island bucket shops were pumping obscure stocks to whoever would buy them. The typical scam involved inflating the price by lying to your customers, then selling your own shares as close to the peak as possible before those customers got wiped out. (In 1999, a judge sentenced Belfort to four years for fraud. He served 22 months.) In the back of Left\u2019s mind, a realization glimmered. With the money he had saved from a few successful trades, he started shorting Belfort and the others, covering his positions after the price bottomed out \u2014 in effect profiting from their fraud. He was just getting the hang of it when the market crashed. He moved to California.In the mid-\u201990s, traders were just beginning to publish their theses online. An idea occurred to Left: Take the short positions he wielded against the Long Island companies and aim them up at big companies, the more elite the better, using the internet to disseminate the research. Instead of writing in the mode of a traditional stock analyst, he would distill his arguments down to internet-friendly length. The word \u201cblog\u201d was just starting to enter the lexicon. Left registered a domain name. He decided to stay in California. He would come to talk about frauds the way surfers talk about waves.To its fans on Wall Street, Valeant represented a brand-new model for the drug business. It didn\u2019t spend money on research and development, as most drug companies did. Instead, it bought valuable patents for drugs that others had developed, then jacked up the prices. To critics, Valeant was an abusive acquisition machine that produced nothing of value and would choke on its own debt. Senator Bernie Sanders lambasted it. Shares traded above $200.On Sept. 28, 2015, Left released his first report on the company. \u201cThis article is not for you hedge-fund managers who think that this quarter\u2019s profit is more important than human decency,\u201d it read. \u201cThis article is for the millions of Americans who together can mandate change.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhile the whole country is in an uproar about Turing Pharmaceuticals, a one-drug start-up pharma company attempting to raise prices on a single AIDS drug, the real issue is a $100 billion monster only Wall Street could love \u2014 an extremely leveraged company that set the standard for this type of abuse, while being cheered on by a cadre of Wall Street high-rollers too wealthy to fret over their own personal health care costs, and its posse of hedge-fund operators.\u201d A second report followed, demanding that Congress subpoena Valeant\u2019s executives.Pearson called the comparison \u201cerroneous\u201d and asked the S.E.C. to investigate Left. But as any public-relations agent knows, if you\u2019re denying, you\u2019re already on the back foot. By the time the company announced an emergency news conference the following morning, the stock was down 40 percent. \u201cAndrew erased the idea that buying Valeant was a smart strategy,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI just thought it was a good story. Andrew knew it was a ball of gasoline-soaked rags. He threw a match on it.\u201dAmong those who smelled smoke was the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. In November 2016, he indicted two men on charges of wire fraud and kickbacks: Gary Tanner, a senior executive at Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, the chief executive of Philidor. For all intents and purposes, the indictment alleges, Philidor was not an independent company. That much Left had suspected. What was shocking was the nature of the relationship between the businesses. It was not simple channel stuffing, the indictment alleges, but theft. According to the document, Tanner would sell Davenport millions of dollars of drugs. Then Davenport would share with Tanner the incentive payments he received from Valeant, moving the money through a shell company. Meanwhile Tanner misled his Valeant colleagues into believing that a competitor wanted to buy Philidor. The ultimate goal, the indictment claims, was to inflate Philidor\u2019s value until Valeant acquired it at a huge markup, at which point the two would split the millions that Davenport would earn from the sale as Philidor\u2019s largest stakeholder. (Through a representative, Valeant said it was the victim, not the perpetrator, of the fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note the indictment involved one former employee,\u201d the company wrote, adding that it has increased R.&D. investment by 26 percent.)We rode the elevator to a silent floor, where the receptionist clocked him as he entered. \u201cHey, Andy.\u201d Desks sat empty; the morning crew was here to shoot the 9:30 spots for the New York market, but in Los Angeles the day hadn\u2019t started. A tech came out to lead us to the studio. He was a gentle man in middle age, soft-featured, wearing cargo pants and thick black sneakers, a big brown mustache, warm eyes. He knew Left from the Valeant short and liked to watch him stick it to the Wall Street bosses. All day, people came through the studio rattling off finance acronyms, Ebitda this and Gaap that. Left spoke English.The tech set Left up on a director\u2019s chair. A screen behind his head projected a slightly more outdated version of the skyline than was visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows off-camera to the left and right. Left opened his notes and put his earpiece in. A few seconds into the interview, the anchor fell into a trap. \u201cHow much do you think Express Scripts makes off rebates off a high-priced drug?\u201d he asked.The tech was looking at Left. \u201cYou\u2019re our best guest,\u201d he said. \u201cOur most controversial guest.\u201d\u201cBut not the handsomest,\u201d Left said.\u201cWe\u2019re in West Hollywood,\u201d the tech apologized. On-screen, the anchors moved on to the morning\u2019s next story, the appointment to the Trump administration of the president of Goldman Sachs. Left rode the elevator down to the lobby and slipped outside, where the blue glass tower dwarfed him.Claire Stovall, a researcher at the industry analyst Activist Shorts, told me that the situation was not necessarily to be feared. \u201cThe market is often quicker than the government at catching frauds,\u201d Stovall said. And most successful activist short campaigns produce no regulatory action anyway. But Zhao took a dimmer view. \u201cIf you create a deregulated boom not supported by fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will have a disaster. The activist short-sellers will make a fortune. But sometimes, as a member of society, you don\u2019t want to have a total collapse.\u201dIn retrospect, it is not coincidental that 2015 was the year Left became famous. His tactics matched our mood. Most of us do not care about a random pharmaceutical company meeting its debt covenants. We care about getting medicine at a price we can afford. We don\u2019t care about organic versus inorganic growth, but we worry that our kids will have no coverage if the Trump administration repeals Obamacare. Left\u2019s very timely gift is to connect our daily human concerns to the convoluted operations of the economy, wrapping financial analysis in a moral, populist language that is calibrated precisely to draw maximum attention in a media environment in which screaming is the only way to be heard.As for those being screamed at, the banks and the business schools that feed them, Left represents at best an interesting character and at worst a nuisance. American high finance is extraordinarily good at absorbing attacks on it. Just a few months ago, Left delivered a keynote speech at Harvard Business School\u2019s annual investment conference, where students who could afford the $72,000 tuition calmly imbibed Left\u2019s strategies, which were once considered fringe. He texted me a photo of himself in Harvard Yard, looking comfortable and middle-aged, smiling, his eyes closed.An article on June 11 about a short-seller referred incorrectly to Daraprim, the drug whose price was increased 56-fold by Turing Pharmaceuticals. The company bought the marketing rights, not the patent, to the drug.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Long Run, There\u2019s No Such Thing as an Einstein Investor", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThere are no easy answers in investing. It is tempting to replicate a successful strategy \u2014 one created by an outstanding investor, like Warren Buffett, or through in-depth statistical analysis of the wisdom of crowds \u2014 and such approaches can actually work for long periods.But paint-by-number portfolios won\u2019t succeed forever. And without deep expertise, it makes little sense to veer much from a simple market portfolio \u2014 one that seeks to match the overall performance of the market, and not beat it.Albert Einstein, who may have been the most famous person ever to be publicly identified as a genius, had a disrespectful attitude toward the dignitaries of the physics profession of his time, and a lonely and unique approach to science.Yet great as Einstein\u2019s theories were, others in the scientific community had been on the verge of discovering them when he came along. In fact, it is possible to argue that large numbers of collegial scholars who do not keep secrets, do not pretend to know everything and share freely will eventually surpass the achievements of a lone genius.Similar debates dominate professional investing. For help in making important financial decisions, some of us are looking for Einsteins, others for communities of scholars or professional money managers with solid ideas.In terms of popular reputation, Mr. Buffett may be investing\u2019s closest approximation of an Einstein. Some investors have done well simply by copying Mr. Buffett\u2019s financial moves.On the other hand, many investors embrace the catchy methods that bubble up from time to time, like \u201csmart beta,\u201d a phrase for a form of systematic investing that claims to outperform the market. There is no universal agreement on what smart beta means, but it typically refers to published theories and replicable statistical analysis, and mechanical procedures aimed at beating them. Smart beta clearly is the epitome of community property, not quirky genius.A lone investor, whether a genius or not, can typically keep a secret better than a community can, and does not have to publish his methods. This difference is important but not absolute, because the Securities and Exchange Commission generally requires large institutional investment managers to file quarterly reports listing their holdings.There are even bigger problems in replicating strategies extracted from the community of scholars who publish not only what they do, but why they do it.The researchers looked at the performance of each of these strategies, assuming you had started right after publication of research papers on them and then continued for years. They found that while the strategies outperformed the market, their success decreased by more than 50 percent after publication.So what\u2019s an investor to do? Both published statistical analyses and published actions and opinions of knowledgeable people, whether geniuses or just smart and well-informed investors, are worth mulling over, if you have a taste for such things. But don\u2019t follow these strategies blindly. We need to exercise our intuitive judgment as well as rely on the wisdom of smart, well-informed people to decide whether to continue to rely on statistical indicators and investment strategies that seemed to work in the past.His reasoning is still valid. We need to use statistical analysis but also respect human intuition and even genius, if we are able to identify it. But do so with caution. No single strategy is likely to beat the market forever.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bonds Continue Decline as Central Banks Signal Waning Stimulus", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA sell-off in global bonds continued on Friday, as the realization set in that the end is near for policies that have kept interest rates exceptionally low for a decade.A speech this week by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, signaled at best a very small change in the direction of monetary policy. But a confluence of upbeat utterances by Mr. Draghi and other top central bankers, along with growing optimism about the long-suffering eurozone, added up to an aha moment for financial markets.Investors and traders seemed to suddenly realize that the era of ultracheap money is coming to an end. The revelation led to a wholesale reassessment of the relative prices of stocks and bonds.Markets, which had been sleepy most of the year, awoke with a start. Yields on government bonds in Britain, Germany and the United States have all moved higher.The comment that investors picked up on, however, was convoluted and open to interpretation.\u201cAs the economy continues to recover,\u201d Mr. Draghi said, \u201ca constant policy stance will become more accommodative, and the central bank can accompany the recovery by adjusting the parameters of its policy instruments \u2014 not in order to tighten the policy stance, but to keep it broadly unchanged.\u201dSome analysts interpreted the cryptic sentence to mean that the European Central Bank will dial back its stimulus as the economy improves. That is not exactly news. Mr. Draghi said as much at a news conference this month.But markets are acutely sensitive to any sign that the central bank will begin reducing the size of its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a process known as tapering. Mr. Draghi\u2019s remark was seen as a slight departure from his previous signals, and European Central Bank officials were quick to try to temper market reaction.\u201cPersonally,\u201d V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, the central bank\u2019s vice president, said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in the speech that would be different from, say, the previous two main interventions about monetary policy done by the president.\u201dStill, bond markets took notice. Yields for 10-year bonds in Britain and Germany, which move inversely to price, have risen in the past week, indicating expectations that interest rates and inflation will rise.The yield on the 10-year German government bond, the benchmark debt for the eurozone, has increased to 0.457 percent, from 0.253 percent a week ago. Britain\u2019s 10-year bond yield has also risen, to 1.246 percent, from 1.031 percent, while yields on 10-year Treasury bonds were up, as well.In the United States on Friday morning, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 were both slightly higher after losses the previous day. Earlier, Asian stocks fell, while shares in Europe were little changed.\u201cIt is the opening for the E.C.B. to move toward tapering,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Bank in Frankfurt.Mr. Brzeski said he thought the market reaction was overdone. \u201cApparently there are still market participants who thought this stimulus would last forever,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Victory Over Einhorn Provides Little Solace to General Motors", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsDavid Einhorn\u2019s financial engineering effort has hit a dead end at General Motors.His Greenlight Capital\u2019s proposal to increase the automaker\u2019s value by issuing a new class of dividend shares got a drubbing from investors at Tuesday\u2019s annual meeting. Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, can\u2019t afford to gloat, however. The company\u2019s stock is flatlining, and plenty of speed bumps lie ahead.Mr. Einhorn contended that splitting the stock into one class of shares entitled to the company\u2019s dividend in perpetuity and a separate class entitled to any additional profit generated by growth would attract more investors. He also argued that it would lift the company\u2019s $52 billion market value by as much as $38 billion.General Motors countered that the plan would reduce its financial flexibility while doing nothing to improve the fundamentals of its business. It helped that Moody\u2019s labeled the idea \u201ccredit negative\u201d and that the proxy advisers Institutional Shareholders Services and Glass Lewis recommended that shareholders reject it. They did so overwhelmingly; more than 91 percent of those voting \u2014 96 percent if Greenlight\u2019s stake is excluded \u2014 backed the company.The valuation issue that prompted the hedge fund manager\u2019s intervention hasn\u2019t gone away, though. G.M. shares trade at just 5.59 times consensus earnings expectations for 2017, the lowest multiple of any profitable company in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. At just over $34 a share, the stock is barely above the price at its initial public offering in November 2010.Ms. Barra hasn\u2019t been standing still. She is aggressively refreshing the company\u2019s vehicle lineup, agreed in February to sell the European business to the PSA Group for $2.2 billion and expects to return $7 billion to shareholders this year through buybacks and dividends.The company is heading toward nasty-looking traffic, though. United States auto sales are softening and discounts are spreading to the sport utility vehicles and light trucks that generate a large chunk of Detroit\u2019s profit. Spending heavily to develop electric cars and self-driving technology will make it even harder to maintain current levels of profitability.Ms. Barra can take some comfort from Tuesday\u2019s shareholder support. But she has only to look at her crosstown rival, Ford Motor \u2014 which abruptly ejected Mark Fields last month \u2014 to realize how quickly that can evaporate. Steering General Motors to the future could yet be a rocky road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ten Years After Going Public, Blackstone Stock Hasn\u2019t Budged", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIn a sense, Blackstone is back where it started. On June 22, 2007, at what turned out to be a market peak, Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson took their private equity firm public in a ballyhooed transaction that inspired rivals to do the same. A decade on, the firm\u2019s units are trading just above their $31 price ahead of their New York Stock Exchange debut. A better result over the next 10 years could require Blackstone to financially re-engineer itself.Even including dividends, assumed reinvested to derive a total return, Blackstone\u2019s performance has been just ordinary. At about 7 percent a year since the initial public offering, its stock has fared no better than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, and at a much higher risk. The firm has roughly $360 billion to deploy into buyouts, real estate and credit on behalf of pension and sovereign wealth funds, and that has historically generated at least twice as much return for the investors in the funds Blackstone runs.Inside 32-year-old Blackstone, the stock performance isn\u2019t the main measure of the I.P.O.\u2019s success. Simply going public conferred a certain brand status, particularly overseas. Selling a big slug of the new units to China Investment Corporation also paid off. China Investment gritted its teeth through a share-price decline of nearly 90 percent at one stage and helped Blackstone forge relationships with other pools of capital in the People\u2019s Republic. Over the years, the firm has sold more than $30 billion of its holdings, including stakes in Hilton Worldwide and the European warehouse owner Logicor, to Chinese buyers. And Mr. Schwarzman established a unique scholarship program at Tsinghua University.The units also provided a currency to reward employees and expand the firm. For example, less than a year after the listing, Blackstone used units to help fund the acquisition of GSO Capital Partners, which significantly enlarged its credit-investment arm. Since going public, Blackstone has quadrupled its assets under management while increasing its work force less than threefold, to about 2,100.That\u2019s a measure of the economies of scale Mr. Schwarzman and his right-hand man, Tony James, have produced, with the right people to help them. They\u2019re not alone, though. Over the same span, Larry Fink\u2019s far larger BlackRock has nearly quintupled the amount it oversees, to some $5.1 trillion, with two and a half times the staff, now numbering 13,000.Opening its books to public scrutiny also may have made it easier for Blackstone to get a credit rating. That in turn has allowed it to borrow and to entice incoming fund investors with an extra demonstration of its financial robustness.Nevertheless, it is the stock market perceptions of Blackstone that perplex Mr. Schwarzman, who routinely complains about them. Merely putting its profit on the broad average price-to-earnings multiple would make it a roughly $50 stock, he recently argued. If instead of its recent dividend yield of about 8 percent the units were priced on the S.&P. 500 average payout of a little over 2 percent, they\u2019d fetch over $100 apiece, he claimed. With Blackstone\u2019s current market capitalization at about $40 billion, that would represent a huge markup for investors.Despite years of trying to educate outside investors, and the subsequent I.P.O.s of rivals such as Apollo, Carlyle and KKR, portfolio managers are reluctant to ascribe much value to private equity\u2019s secret sauce, which is generating profit on investments and collecting a cut. Instead, it is steady management fees of 1 to 2 percent on assets that are coveted.This attitude favors investment managers who worry more about gathering assets than making money for those who invest in them. Blackstone did say from the start that its main goal would be making money for limited partners in its funds, a group that includes its own senior people, rather than for investors in the firm\u2019s publicly traded units. The trouble is that when the profit does flow through to unit holders, they don\u2019t value it as highly as they might.Such an unchanging mind-set suggests that if Blackstone is genuinely eager to see its stock rise more strongly in the next decade, it may take more than Mr. Schwarzman thumping the table. One option could be to pay a fixed annual dividend rather than a variable one based on performance. It\u2019s a solution that could perversely mean giving back less to unit holders than the firm has of late, but it might help assuage investor fears about the lumpiness of returns.Any excess funds stockpiled also could be used to buy back units, thus enabling Blackstone, in theory at least, to nudge up their price. One case study is not encouraging so far, though. KKR unveiled such a plan in October 2015 and has not benefited much in terms of its stock price.An even bigger Blackstone makeover might have a greater effect. Converting the firm from a partnership to a more conventional sort of corporation would garner considerable attention. For one thing, it would make its stock eligible for entry into indexes, thus attracting many index-following funds that would be forced to buy them. Investors who are currently put off by the firm\u2019s complex partnership structure and paperwork might consider putting their money into a simpler Blackstone that has shares, not units, and pays regular corporate taxes rather than passing untaxed income through to unit holders.Making such a radical restructuring financially worthwhile, however, could require a reduction in business tax rates in the United States . In one of his other roles, Mr. Schwarzman is serving as a consigliere to President Trump, who says he is eager to cut taxes. The association may provide a modest advantage. More likely, Blackstone and its leadership team will have to find one for themselves.An earlier version of this article misstated its author. It is Jeffrey Goldfarb, not Rob Cox.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did the Jack Welch Model Sow Seeds of G.E.\u2019s Decline?", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor Fortune magazine in 1999, Jack Welch, then General Electric\u2019s chief executive, wasn\u2019t just the country\u2019s best executive, or the manager of the year, but nothing less than the best manager of the 20th century, \u201cfar and away the most influential manager of his generation.\u201dMr. Welch himself was more circumspect. \u201cMy success will be determined by how well my successor grows it in the next 20 years,\u201d he said at a management conference that year.Eighteen years later, with this week\u2019s announcement that Mr. Welch\u2019s handpicked successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, would step down as G.E.\u2019s chief executive, the verdict would appear to be in.\u201cGiven how horrendous the stock performance has been for so many years, the most amazing thing is why the board didn\u2019t act sooner\u201d to replace Mr. Immelt, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Mr. Welch brought much needed energy and charisma to the chief executive\u2019s job and streamlined G.E.\u2019s bloated bureaucracy. Had he stayed on through the financial crisis, perhaps he would have recaptured the growth that eluded Mr. Immelt.But hardly anyone considers Mr. Welch, now 81, a management role model anymore, and the conglomerate model he championed at G.E. \u2014 that with strict discipline, you could successfully manage any business as long as your market share was first or second \u2014 has been thoroughly discredited, at least in the United States.No wonder, given the performance of the company\u2019s stock over the past 10 years. G.E. shares dropped 25 percent during that period, in contrast with a 59 percent rise for the S.&P. 500. The rival industrial conglomerate Honeywell\u2019s stock has more than doubled, and Danaher\u2019s has tripled. United Technologies gained 67 percent.Nonetheless, Mr. Immelt remained one of the country\u2019s highest-paid executives: $21.3 million in 2016, $33 million in 2015, and $37 million in 2014. Even without a formal severance package, Mr. Immelt, 61, will get an additional $211 million when he retires, Fortune estimates.\u201cI\u2019m a long-term G.E. shareholder,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cThe bottom line is, I did poorly and he did very well.\u201dSpeaking of his tenure as G.E.\u2019s leader, Mr. Immelt pointed to the increased strength of the company\u2019s industrial businesses, their competitiveness and large market shares.\u201cI\u2019ll say that will stand the test of time,\u201d he said in an interview on Monday with my colleague Steve Lohr. \u201cLet other people make their own judgments.\u201dMr. Immelt\u2019s defenders have pointed out that he had to contend with the collapse of the tech bubble, the Sept. 11 attacks and the financial crisis, all circumstances beyond his control. But so did the chief executives of every other major company.\u201cAbout the best that can be said is that he enabled G.E. to survive through a difficult time,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, professor of finance and asset management at Columbia. \u201cBut he never really understood how to create value through growth.\u201dAnd he inherited \u201ca highly inflated stock price,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said, thanks to Mr. Welch\u2019s aura and lofty expectations that probably no one could have met.As Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, put it, \u201cIt\u2019s always tough to follow a legend.\u201d\u201cJeff Immelt brought his best every day for 16 years,\u201d Mr. Welch said in a statement. His office said he was not available to comment about his own legacy.Mr. Immelt tacitly repudiated the Welch model himself, moving to dismantle parts of the sprawling G.E. empire by getting rid of NBCUniversal and the once-too-big-to-fail GE Capital. The problem, many critics said, is that he didn\u2019t do so nearly fast enough.\u201cI don\u2019t think Jack Welch was ever as good as he was made out to be,\u201d said Mr. Damodaran, who has spent years trying to value G.E. During Mr. Welch\u2019s tenure, \u201che benefited from the growth of financial services in the American economy and the growth of GE Capital,\u201d Mr. Damodaran added. \u201cThat\u2019s what made it untouchable for so long.\u201dMr. Damodaran said he warned G.E. executives in 2005 that complexity could become a problem. \u201cIf you wanted to create a valuation hell, it would be G.E.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was too complex by design, growing through numerous acquisitions. I told them back then, \u2018You\u2019re getting away with this now, but if there\u2019s ever a crisis, it will come back to haunt you.\u2019\u201dMr. Greenwald, the Columbia professor, agreed that much of G.E.\u2019s success, and then its problems, stemmed from an overreliance on its huge financial services business. \u201cIt was contributing 60 percent of profits, and Jack Welch could always tweak the earnings by turning to GE Capital,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it had no stable source of deposits\u201d to fall back on in the financial crisis.That is the main reason G.E.\u2019s rivals have fared so much better, Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cThey were never the broad conglomerate G.E. was, with huge financing businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re much more focused on industrial production.\u201dBoth Mr. Greenwald and Mr. Damodaran said the Welch conglomerate model had been thoroughly repudiated, so much so that there is a widely recognized \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d applied by investors to the stock prices of companies consisting of businesses with no obvious synergies. Activist investors have pounced on this to urge the breakup of disparate operations, and G.E. itself has been the target of the activist investor Nelson Peltz.\u201cSpecialization is something that provides real value,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a conglomerate, by definition you\u2019re not specialized.\u201dEven companies like Honeywell and United Technologies \u201caren\u2019t trying to do everything,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have areas of specialization.\u201dMr. Damodaran said few of the world\u2019s conglomerates, if any, are superstars.\u201cThey may be doing better than G.E., but they all suffer from similar problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not nimble and adaptable. It\u2019s much harder to be a conglomerate today than it was 20 or 30 years ago. The Welch model is certainly dated. Maybe it\u2019s still used in a few old-line manufacturing businesses, but not in the rest of the economy, where a start-up can destroy your business.\u201dEven though Mr. Immelt deserves praise for abandoning the Welch model, Mr. Damodaran said, he did it much too late. \u201cThey\u2019d be much better off if they\u2019d started sooner,\u201d he said.In a statement, a General Electric spokeswoman said, \u201cToday, G.E. is a more focused industrial company with strong growth opportunities in the long term.\u201dThat left investors salivating for more divestitures or spinoffs. \u201cDoes anyone really think there are any synergies between medical equipment and jet engines?\u201d Mr. Greenwald asked. \u201cA complicated, specialized business like medical equipment would be much better on its own.\u201dMore divestitures may well result in pretty much the same G.E. that Mr. Welch inherited, which is \u201ca boring, mature company,\u201d Mr. Damodaran said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a company that\u2019s going to work miracles. Even if well run, about the best G.E. can hope for is to grow at the rate of the economy. But that may be the best-case scenario. If it tries to rediscover its youth, that would make me nervous.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Easy Money Is Drying Up, and Markets Tremble", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt could be time for markets to come down from their sugar highs.After years of injecting trillions of dollars into their economies in an effort to encourage growth, central bankers have become more forthright in signaling an end to easy-money policies.What started as tremors in European government bonds after a speech on Tuesday by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, had spread to global stocks by Thursday.Mr. Draghi called for prudence in policy, and investors seemed to interpret that as a step back from the bank\u2019s commitment to buying European government bonds. Central bank officials were quick to point out that Mr. Draghi did not say that he would tighten policy immediately. But investors apparently ignored that.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, also indicated on Tuesday that an increase in rates might be in order.Those signals have prompted speculation that central bankers may be coordinating efforts to warn investors who benefited from the liquidity boom.Indeed, officials from the Federal Reserve have been saying for several weeks that financial markets were overheated.Investors are also keeping a close eye on the \u201cFaang\u201d stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which dropped briefly in early June. Those stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of market gains, and they are getting more expensive. A sustained fall could also lead to a bear market.Those jumps promised some notable benefits:\u2022 Investors get a bump in their dividends;\u2022 Executives could see their pay packages swell;\u2022 The big institutions might have more flexibility to lend, which could promote more long-term growth.Critics worry, however, that less regulatory pressure could set the stage for a return to the bad old days of enormous leverage and freewheeling.Instead, Rite Aid will sell 2,186 of its 4,600 stores to Walgreens, along with three distribution centers, for $5.18 billion. The announcement sent Rite Aid shares tumbling.The resistance was not unexpected \u2014 the companies\u2019 original $9.3 billion deal would have created a group with more outlets than CVS Health, the biggest drugstore chain by market capitalization in the United States.In spite of hopes that antitrust regulation would ease under President Trump, several deals, including in the health care sector, have been derailed this year.The British authorities have asked regulators to further examine a $15 billion bid by 21st Century Fox to take over the 61 percent of Sky, the European satellite giant, that it does not already own.Rupert Murdoch and his family will now face a review by Britain\u2019s competition authority, but they have dodged a regulatory bullet. The authorities ruled that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, even as they concluded that the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had pointed to \u201csignificant corporate failures.\u201dThe British Office of Communications, or Ofcom, did not hold back in its criticism of the scandal at Fox News, noting that 21st Century Fox was aware of multiple cases against Bill O\u2019Reilly that had led to settlements when it renewed its contract with the former host.Advertisement"}

His entourage claimed the immense surroundings for Catherine the Great and traded iron and beads for a native boy to serve as interpreter.Russian Alaska eventually consolidated under a vast trading corporation that reached to Hawaii and California, before receding. The region was sold to the U.S. in 1867, for $7.2 million (about $125 million today).Penn Bullock contributed reporting._____Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Index-Fund Evangelist Is Straying From His Gospel", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThree years later, Vanguard, the asset manager where Mr. Malkiel served on the board for 27 years, started the first passive index fund, an innovation that has swept the financial world.Now, at age 84, Mr. Malkiel has had a remarkable change of heart: Maybe the experts can beat the monkeys after all. That is, if the experts are software engineers writing sophisticated algorithms for computer-generated trading.Mr. Malkiel is chief investment adviser for Wealthfront, a pioneering automated investment manager that last week adopted a new approach it calls Advanced Indexing. The strategy aims to exploit market inefficiencies and beat the passive approach, based on an index weighted by stocks\u2019 market capitalization, which Mr. Malkiel has long championed. This falls within a broad investing category known as \u201csmart beta,\u201d beta being a measure of the volatility of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole.\u201cI have been a critic of smart-beta funds because they have typically been sold with high expense ratios and have ignored tax consequences,\u201d Mr. Malkiel told me this week. \u201cSmart beta has in effect been expensive beta.\u201d But decades of academic research into efficient markets and Wealthfront\u2019s ability to deliver a smart-beta approach at low cost, coupled with tax efficiency, finally won him over, he said.Rob Arnott, founder of Research Affiliates, which devises smart-beta products for money managers like Pimco and BlackRock, greeted news of Mr. Malkiel\u2019s conversion as \u201ca fascinating turn of events.\u201d\u201cEven though Burt Malkiel was never a die-hard efficient market person, he was pretty staunchly in that camp,\u201d Mr. Arnott said. \u201cHe has acknowledged there may be some market inefficiencies, but any advantage from trading on them got eaten up in fees. Now the approach has become so cost-effective that even a skeptic like him is acknowledging it can add value.\u201dA large and growing body of academic research suggests there are market anomalies that can be exploited to beat a strict index approach. Some of that research has been recognized with Nobels in economic science \u2014 William F. Sharpe in 1990 and Eugene F. Fama in 2013. One of these findings is that value outperforms growth, rewarding those who identify stocks with lower price-earnings ratios and other metrics that suggest they\u2019re undervalued. Another factor is momentum, in which stocks that are already outperforming market averages continue to do so.Even so, \u201csmart beta isn\u2019t the kind of thing you hear talked about at cocktail parties, unless you move in very geeky social circles,\u201d said Matt Hougan, chief executive of Inside ETFs, which provides research and conferences on exchange-traded funds.That may change now that someone of Mr. Malkiel\u2019s stature has thrown his weight behind it.Wealthfront stressed that it was not abandoning the essence of Mr. Malkiel\u2019s long-held belief in passive investing, and it calls its new approach PassivePlus. \u201cBurt Malkiel is still the high priest of passive investing,\u201d said Jakub Jurek, vice president for research at Wealthfront. \u201cTo be absolutely clear, we\u2019re not stock pickers. There are decades of research on active investors, which show they underperform.\u201d At the same time, he said, \u201cthere are small adjustments you can make to improve after-tax returns.\u201dIn addition to value and momentum factors, Wealthfront\u2019s approach embraces stocks with high dividend yields, low market beta and low volatility, all factors that \u201chave proven robust across long time periods, geographies and asset classes,\u201d Mr. Jurek said. (Wealthfront excluded another widely cited factor, small market capitalization, because its investment universe is limited to large-cap issues.)Wealthfront\u2019s testing against historical data indicates its multifactor approach outperformed a strict index approach by an average of 1 percentage point per year over the past 50 years, and even more since 2000, without any increase in volatility. As would be expected, there were some periods in which it underperformed.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of statistical and, perhaps more important, behavioral support for these strategies,\u201d Mr. Hougan said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find plenty of two- or three-year stretches where this will underperform, but if you buy and hold, it\u2019s going to add value. We\u2019ve seen value outperform for over 80 years. And Wealthfront is blending five factors that should smooth out and reduce those periods of underperformance.\u201dSmart beta has its critics, including Mr. Arnott, viewed by many as the godfather of the field. \u201cSmart beta can be smart, and then it can be not so smart,\u201d Mr. Arnott said. \u201cThere are tons of strategies being offered now based on nothing but back tests. Anyone can create a brilliant strategy with benefit of hindsight. But does that mean anything for future returns?\u201d\u201cPretty much everyone is looking at the same factors, which is a danger,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a very crowded space. If 10,000 quants are all looking at the same data and trading on it, the chances are that it\u2019s not going to work.\u201dMr. Jurek responded that \u201cat a very general level, you could say that every back test is problematic.\u201d But he stressed that \u201cwhen designing Advanced Indexing, we relied on decades of peer-reviewed research to select factors that have stood the test of time\u201d \u2014 even after being widely publicized \u2014 and \u201cacross asset classes.\u201d He noted that smart-beta exchange-traded products account for about $500 billion in assets, still a relatively small fraction of total assets invested.Multifactor smart-beta E.T.F.s are now available from many major fund providers, including BlackRock\u2019s iShares, Invesco\u2019s PowerShares, State Street\u2019s SPDRs and WisdomTree E.T.F.s, but their track records are too short to draw any meaningful conclusions. And despite similar names and what purport to be similar strategies, their actual holdings can vary widely.Mr. Malkiel stressed that low fees were critical in enhancing long-term smart-beta returns. Wealthfront charges its standard 0.25 percent management fee, with no additional charge for its Advanced Indexing feature. (Some smart-beta E.T.F. fees are even lower, although the average fee is over 1 percent.)Mr. Hougan agreed. \u201cYou can easily waste away all the outperformance if the strategy isn\u2019t carefully implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to have to pay 1 percent and 1.5 percent to overpaid managers. Now we can get those strategies for 30 basis points or less. I think that\u2019s great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Move Signals End of Line for Many Cashiers", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobot RevolutionImagine this scene from the future: You walk into a store and are greeted by name, by a computer with facial recognition that directs you to the items you need. You peruse a small area \u2014 no chance of getting lost or wasting time searching for things \u2014 because the store stocks only sample items. You wave your phone in front of anything you want to buy, then walk out. In the back, robots retrieve your items from a warehouse and deliver them to your home via driverless car or drone.Our mental image of job-killing automation is robots in factories or warehouses. But the next jobs to disappear are probably ones that are a much bigger part of most people\u2019s daily lives: retail workers and cashiers in stores and restaurants.For a long time, economists argued that routine jobs like factory and clerical work were vulnerable to automation but that jobs in both the service and knowledge sectors were safer. They require human skills that are hard for machines to imitate, like judgment and adaptability. These skills are useful when an executive makes strategic business decisions or when a chef fries one customer\u2019s egg and scrambles another\u2019s.But it has become increasingly clear that parts of every job will be automated \u2014 and that the service sector is next. Although certain service jobs like health aide or preschool teacher still seem safe, others, like those in retail and food service, are already being displaced. It\u2019s not hard to teach a machine to do routine tasks like scanning bar codes, stocking shelves or dunking fries in oil.Estimates like these are guesses at best, because imagining the future is an act of science fiction. And even when technologies exist, companies adopt them slowly. That\u2019s one reason productivity isn\u2019t increasing at the rate economists might expect, even though more work is able to be automated. But there is evidence that retail jobs are transforming rapidly.Companies won\u2019t invest in technology unless it\u2019s less expensive than employing people, and most retail workers make near minimum wage. But in a case study of grocery stores, McKinsey found that the savings from automation were three times the cost, and 68 percent of the savings were from reduced labor costs.Retailers say automating certain tasks doesn\u2019t necessarily displace employees, but frees them to do other things that are more valuable to customers. Lowe\u2019s, for instance, said its customer service robot answered simple questions so employees could provide more personalized expertise, like home project planning.Whole Foods, before the Amazon acquisition, made a similar argument to Forrester. \u201cWe intentionally don\u2019t over-automate our stores, at least not on the front end,\u201d an executive told Forrester, which didn\u2019t name the person in its report. \u201cWe want to have the personal touch of real people.\u201dBut shoppers often prefer to save time by interacting with fewer people, especially when they just need coffee or paper towels \u2014 thus the convenience of online ordering for in-store pickup at places like Walmart and Starbucks.On the other hand, said David Autor, an M.I.T. economist, it would make the job market even more challenging for a group of workers who already struggle to find stable, well-paid employment and are unlikely to have the education to move into better jobs.Amazon said it had no plans to lay off Whole Foods workers or use Amazon Go technology to automate cashiers\u2019 jobs.Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy, said Amazon\u2019s plans could be much bigger than simply automating stores.\u201cThe bigger and more profound way that technology affects jobs is by completely reinventing the business model,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon didn\u2019t go put a robot into the bookstores and help you check out books faster. It completely reinvented bookstores. The idea of a cashier won\u2019t be so much automated as just made irrelevant \u2014 you\u2019ll just tell your Echo what you need, or perhaps it will anticipate what you need, and stuff will get delivered to you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

R.B.S., which remains 72 percent owned by the government, received a \u00a345 billion bailout that year.Investors in the shareholder litigation have claimed that they were misled about the bank\u2019s financial health ahead of the share offering.The bank, based in Edinburgh, has agreed to settle about 87 percent of the remaining claims based on value against it after reaching an agreement with the RBoS Shareholders Action Group, which represents about 9,000 individual investors, according to Jonathan Nash, a lawyer for the shareholders.Shareholders representing the remaining claims are undecided and need more time to determine whether they want to proceed, Mr. Nash said on Wednesday.Mr. Nash said the bank and the shareholder group were confident the majority of those remaining claim holders would agreed to settle.The trial was supposed to begin last month, but has been delayed several times after R.B.S. increased the size of its settlement offer and the parties asked for more time to try to resolve the case. The revised settlement offer is worth about \u00a3200 million.Under an agreement between the parties on Wednesday, the trial will be put on hold and the undecided shareholders will have to decide if they want to settle by June 20.At the moment, there is no funding available for the case to continue, so any shareholders who want to go to trial would need to secure funding and notify the court by July 28.

{"Headline": "Five Big Tech Stocks Build Market Euphoria, and Jitters", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google.In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes \u2014 Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain \u2014 as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies.But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded.\u201cThere is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. \u201cNo one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.\u201dDespite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks.Other markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election.The stock market, however, remains the main attraction.Late in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end.According to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion \u2014 a consequence of investors\u2019 buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value.As is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment.The push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership.Through these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks \u2014 an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented.It is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market.\u201cIn terms of magnitude, we have not seen this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist.In Mr. Paulsen\u2019s view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period.So when Facebook\u2019s net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon\u2019s sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice.\u201cYou have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cSo yes, you can see how valuations would get extended.\u201dStock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today\u2019s technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era.Still, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce?For example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year \u2014 with more than half that amount from Apple, the world\u2019s richest company.Of course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business.Amazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard.Still, it is not today\u2019s earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow\u2019s, the argument goes.Surprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it.Bill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Mr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google\u2019s cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered.\u201cI have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cYet that is how the market is pricing it.\u201dAnother well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position.While skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division.\u201cAmazon is more fully valued than when we bought it,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages.\u201dAs these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns.That is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures. For a manager not to match the share of an Apple or an Amazon in a benchmark would result in an actively managed fund trailing its index and its peers.And as investors pour billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds \u2014 a record $314 billion in the last year \u2014 no active manager can afford to lag the competition for too long.So be it a mutual fund, hedge fund, sovereign wealth fund or family office, the strategy has been consistent \u2014 put aside any fears, and stay invested.\u201cIt\u2019s like you are riding a missile that you know could explode at any moment beneath you,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo. He has warned in his reports that some of these stocks have entered a stage of mania. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have no choice but to be sucked into the trade.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Businesses Show Mixed Returns During Campaign and Presidency", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump International Hotel in Washington and the Mar-a-Lago private resort in Florida have been among President Trump\u2019s favorite spots to visit in the months since he became president. And both were among the most lucrative properties in his portfolio during what otherwise was a mixed year for the Trump family businesses, according to a financial disclosure report released Friday.Revenues at his aircraft company, which the Trump campaign used to move him around the country during his presidential bid, more than doubled to $7.7 million.Mr. Trump filed the disclosure, which generally covers a period from January 2016 to April 2017, with the assistance of the Office of Government Ethics to follow a practice set by President Barack Obama. He was technically not required to make the filing until next year. It is not known how profitable the golf clubs and resorts are, because The Trump Organization is a private business and Mr. Trump only releases revenue figures in his public disclosures. \u201cPresident Trump welcomed the opportunity to voluntarily file his personal financial disclosure form; while this filing is voluntary (as no report was due until May 2018), it has been certified by the Office of Government Ethics pursuant to its normal procedures,\u201d White House representatives said in a statement.Revenue from his international operations \u2014 including residential buildings, golf courses and hotels in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East \u2014 did not change significantly in the last year even though several properties, for which he collects a licensing fee, opened recently including in Manila and Dubai. There were some exceptions, including a new tower in Vancouver, which produced at least $5 million in revenue, and an entity affiliated connected to Kolkata, India, which brought in $100,000 to $1 million.Renewed sales of his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal, also increased. The title brought in at least $100,000, double the minimum revenue listed last year.Lawyers involved in suing Mr. Trump, based on allegations that he is violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because his businesses are accepting payments from foreign governments, said that the financial disclosure, while helpful, left many of their questions unresolved. \u201cIt just elevates questions,\u201d said Maryland state Attorney General Brian E. Frosh, who this week sued Mr. Trump, along with the attorney general from Washington, D.C., in what is one of at least three such lawsuits. \u201cJust how much money is he getting from foreign sources, who is he getting it from and what impact does it have on his foreign policy and his actions as president?\u201dIn total, he listed at least $310 million in liabilities, about the same amount as last year, although that is debt held only by companies that his family has majority control over. His creditors include a range of financial companies and banks, from big names like Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch, to lesser-known ones like Amboy Bank in New Jersey.Steve Eder and Andrew W.

{"Headline": "OPEC Took Aim at U.S. Oil Producers, but Hurt Itself, Too", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Picture a three-year-old tug of war waged across the globe that leaves both sides wobbly and scarred but unmoved. That\u2019s one way of looking at the high-stakes competition between the world\u2019s big oil exporters and the companies drilling in American shale fields.On one side of the rope is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the Saudi-led group whose strategy for retaining market dominance has twirled from one failed tactic to another as it struggles to conquer a glut that will almost surely suppress prices for at least another year.At least 123 of the companies operating in North America have filed for bankruptcy since early 2015, and the survivors, like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have watched their share prices slump well below bull market averages as they borrow to keep up their dividends. More than 150,000 oil workers lost their jobs in the United States alone, although the job market is beginning to recover.\u201cFor both sides, there has been one twist in the road after another,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit, an energy research consultancy. For prices to rise again, \u201cinventories have to be seen as coming down, and there needs to be a tempering in the growth of U.S. shale production,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the two things that are defining the market right now.\u201dBut neither is happening.United States oil production, which averaged 8.9 million barrels a day in 2016, will rise to 9.3 million barrels a day this year, according to the Energy Department. The department is projecting production of 10 million barrels a day in 2018, exceeding the record set in 1970. Last week domestic crude inventories eased a bit, but gasoline stockpiles rose by 2.1 million barrels.OPEC set the latest market cycle in motion in late 2014, when the Saudis and their allies decided to swing cartel policy in an unexpected direction. Instead of cutting production to support prices, as it had done so often in the past, OPEC decided to let market forces loose and then even raised production.The goal was a sharp but brief price slump that would drive independent American producers out of business to guarantee continued OPEC dominance of international markets.American drilling did drop precipitously, as companies decommissioned more than half their rigs and neglected to complete wells already drilled through 2015 and part of last year.But the American producers proved durable. They pushed innovation to produce more oil at lower costs by drilling longer lateral wells through shale fields. Their effort was helped along by cost reductions for drilling and production made possible in part by new technologies, including robotics and sensors to improve efficiencies.Companies generally lost money through much of 2015 and 2016, and while some are beginning to earn a profit again, others risk being taken over or going out of business altogether.\u201cNobody wants to come to grips with the fact the days of $70 and $80 oil are over,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \u201cThe shale producers continue to cut costs, and that gives them the hope to survive. But if oil prices don\u2019t rise significantly from the current level, 50 percent of the shale producers will go out of business.\u201d\u201cThe unexpected resilience and revival of U.S. shale production is already frustrating OPEC\u2019s efforts to draw down global stocks,\u201d said Badr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, based in the United Arab Emirates, \u201cand threatening its market share at the same time.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.But OPEC\u2019s cuts were partly a mirage. Its production actually rose by 290,000 barrels a day in May, to the highest level of the year, because Libya and Nigeria were exempted from the cuts and were gushing crude onto world markets.Political instability could throttle production from either country at any moment, but both continue to surprise the markets with their robust exports.But another twist may lie ahead in the battle for markets. Lower prices could force companies to slash production again. Already, some are cutting back on exploration and new projects in fields where it is expensive to operate, like the Canadian oil sands.\u201cIt remains to be seen if drilling can continue at the same pace in a sub-$50 environment once price hedges expire,\u201d Mr. Jafar said, referring to the American shale producers. \u201cBut if it does, I believe OPEC producers will have no choice but to revert to preservation of market share once again, which could see prices nose-dive. And the cycle will continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.E.C. Lets All Firms Keep Parts of I.P.O. Filings Secret", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an attempt to revitalize the public capital markets, the nation\u2019s top regulator of stocks is turning to stealth mode.The Securities and Exchange Commission, in Walter J. Clayton\u2019s first major policy move as chairman, is expanding a program that will allow all private companies to keep some details of their finances and business strategies under wraps early in the process of an initial public offering.Currently, only smaller companies are allowed to confidentially file draft registration statements for review by the agency before offerings. Some well-known companies, like Snap, Twitter and the burger chain Shake Shack have been able to do so, but the threshold of annual gross revenue of $1 billion has barred others.Filing confidentiality is intended to make it easier for companies that want to go public. It allows companies to iron out any wrinkles in their financial reporting with the regulator privately. And they do not have to worry about competitors getting an early peek at their figures.Yet some market specialists say confidential filing has had little impact and question why markets regulators are emphasizing secrecy over openness.Since the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Start-Ups) Act was enacted, some 1,350 confidential filings have been submitted, as of March 31, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.The Nasdaq stock market, which competes with the New York Stock Exchange for the listings of new companies, cheered the S.E.C.\u2019s decision.\u201cWe have long supported such an action and believe it is one step forward in making the public markets more attractive, which will foster economic growth,\u201d Adena Friedman, the chief executive of Nasdaq, said in a statement.Jay R. Ritter, a professor at the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida, who studies initial public offerings, was more skeptical about its effects, although he generally supported the idea.\u201cThis is not necessarily going to encourage more companies to go public,\u201d Professor Ritter said. \u201cThe whole JOBS Act has had very marginal impact.\u201dOne criticism of the confidentiality provision has been that it shortens the time between when a prospectus becomes public and the road show for investors before the trading debut of a stock. But that should not be a major obstacle for big investors who can spend time poring over the filing, Professor Ritter said.At his confirmation hearing in March, Mr. Clayton \u2014 who as a longtime lawyer at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell worked on a number of initial public offerings, including Alibaba\u2019s and Och-Ziff Capital Management\u2019s \u2014 emphasized that he would \u201clike to see more companies going public here.\u201dHe and Republican lawmakers have pointed to regulation as a prime culprit for the shrunken universe in American stocks.\u201cWe are striving for efficiency in our processes to encourage more companies to consider going public, which can result in more choices for investors, job creation and a stronger U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Clayton said on Thursday.Yet other forces have clearly been at work over the last two decades. Wave after wave of mergers and acquisitions have caused many stocks to be delisted. Mutual funds and other big investors tend to prefer bigger investments to many small investments in new company offerings and the like.Perhaps more important, younger companies, particularly in technology, are now able to raise huge sums of capital privately and have no need of public markets. Take Uber, which has raised more than $14 billion from venture capitalists and other investors, giving the private company a valuation of $70 billion.Mr. Clayton cited Uber during his confirmation hearing as an example of a company that 20 years ago probably would have gone public at this point.This year, however, there have been signs of improvement in the market for new stocks. Renaissance Capital noted on Thursday that 54 initial offerings raised $11 billion in the second quarter \u2014 the most in number and proceeds in two years. Already, the market for new stocks, led by companies like Altice USA and Blue Apron, has raised more capital this year than in all of 2016.The commission said on Thursday that permitting all companies to file secretly would give them more flexibility to plan their offerings and reduce \u201cthe potential for lengthy exposure to market fluctuations that can adversely affect the offering process and harm existing public shareholders.\u201dAnna Pinedo, a partner at Morrison & Foerster who specializes in securities law, said the expansion on confidential filing would also apply to companies considering a direct listing on a stock exchange without seeking to raise capital through a public offering.But until now, a company considering a direct listing had to make its filing public when it applied. Ms. Pinedo said the commission\u2019s action would permit any company to keep its financial statements confidential until 15 days before its shares are set to begin trading.\u201cIf you look at how much money unicorns have raised, perhaps they don\u2019t need to do a conventional I.P.O.,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the burger chain that recently made its initial public offering.

{"Headline": "Can Good Corporate Citizenship Be Measured?", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookIf you spend time around corporate boardrooms these days, you\u2019ll hear the abbreviation \u201cE.S.G.\u201d thrown around with such frequency it is almost a trope.E.S.G. stands for \u201cenvironmental, social and governance.\u201d Basically, it refers to the three main ways to measure a company\u2019s commitments to ecological sustainability, to its community and to corporate governance.Big investors, like pension funds and others, have publicly declared that they now consider environmental, social and governance issues to be key metrics of their investment decisions. To pass muster, companies seeking their favor must show a proven track record of responsible stewardship in all three categories.BlackRock, for one \u2014 the world\u2019s largest asset manager, with more than $5 trillion \u2014 sent a letter to company chief executives earlier this year, suggesting that if they don\u2019t take these issues seriously, the firm might pull its money.But for all the happy talk about focusing on these issues, many on Wall Street have privately cast a skeptical eye, chalking up all the bluster on the topic to politically correct marketing efforts run amok. Some critics have gone so far as to say that financial firms are now trying to profit from the trend by offering mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that include only the stocks of companies with the \u201cvalues\u201d of certain social missions and governance structures.And the results are as surprising for what the authors conclude as for what they do not.The good news version: Investors who look at environmental, social and governance metrics are less likely to buy shares in companies with volatile stocks. Those investors are also significantly less likely to buy into companies headed toward bankruptcies. And \u201cstocks that ranked within the top third by E.S.G. scores relative to their peers would have outperformed stocks in the bottom third by about 18 percentage points from 2005 to today,\u201d the authors reported.But the study also found, repeatedly, that if you\u2019re looking for stocks that outperform their peers, simply looking at E.S.G. issues isn\u2019t a panacea.Even though the companies that rated the best on E.S.G. issues performed better, on average, than others, the study said that \u201cthis performance was not consistent, and was very similar to the performance of large versus small companies.\u201dIndeed, the authors found that in certain industries, like health care, technology and consumer staples, companies that scored highly on E.S.G. metrics actually underperformed their peers. And in the financial sector, \u201cE.S.G. was generally a weak signal of future returns,\u201d though there is some evidence that investors might have avoided some of the banks that struggled the most in the financial crisis.The study has caused a bit of stir because, in truth, the results were so mixed.Some large institutional firms that have backed the E.S.G. movement will most likely use the results to buttress their argument that these issues deserve more attention. Others may use them to debunk the E.S.G. effort.Bank of America has been a big proponent of focusing on E.S.G. issues, remaking itself in recent years and publicly calling on others to follow suit.The report suggested that companies that rank highly on these issues are meaningly less risky. E.S.G. metrics \u201chave been a better signal of future earnings volatility than any other measure we have found,\u201d with companies that rank highest in E.S.G. tending to rank lowest in volatility (and vice versa), the study said. It also found that stocks with superior E.S.G. scores \u201csignaled higher future\u201d return-on-equity in every industry sector it examined.The study relied on a scoring system of E.S.G. factors for companies that was conducted by Thomson Reuters, which graded companies based on emissions and resource reductions, human rights, community engagement, work force diversity, training and development plans, board structure and compensation policy, and shareholder rights, among other things.The phrase \u201cenvironmental, social and governance\u201d attempts to encompass a lot. It involves trying to measure a company\u2019s environmental impact \u2014 that is, what it is doing about the environment and climate change \u2014 as well as its record on social issues and corporate citizenship. On the governance front, measurements include factors like whether shareholders are given a say on pay.It is only logical that companies that take these issues seriously should do well over the long term. But it will take more evidence \u2014 and perhaps more time \u2014 to prove itself as an investment thesis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Market Surges, but Analysts Worry of Looming Trouble", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s main stock index surged to an 18-month high on Friday, breaking the 20,000 level for the first time since late 2015.Shares have surged on the back of stronger economic growth in Japan and in the United States, as well as improved corporate profits. But analysts have raised concerns that the rally could soon lose steam, arguing that company earnings have been bolstered by tax cuts rather than improved bottom lines.The benchmark Nikkei average gained 1.6 percent on Friday to close at 20,177, the first time it topped the symbolic 20,000 mark since December 2015. Markets in Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia and India also rose.A modest decline in the value of the yen has helped. A weaker currency makes Japanese multinationals like Toyota and Hitachi more profitable, by increasing the value of the revenue they earn outside Japan.Buoyed by robust global demand, earnings at publicly traded Japanese companies during the most recent fiscal year, which ended in March, rose to their highest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis. The gains in the Japanese stock market on Friday were widely shared, with businesses as diverse as steel makers, insurance companies and department stores attracting investors.A strong American economy has also pushed global markets higher, and any sign that the pace of growth in the United States was slowing could undercut those advances.Japanese stocks have in effect been playing catch-up, as well. In spite of the recent surge in share prices, Japan has still underperformed other big markets this year.Some analysts expect the rally to lose steam.One reason is taxes. Profits at Japanese companies have been strengthened in part by falling corporate income tax rates. The government has cut taxes three times since 2013, a change that has been the largest contributor to earnings gains over the past five years, analysts at UBS said in a note to clients this week.Another small tax cut is planned for next year, but the overall momentum for cuts is slowing, UBS noted. That would mean companies will have to find ways to improve their bottom lines on their own, or see the earnings growth that has drawn investors to the Nikkei fade.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drivers Head Into Summer With a Gift at the Gas Pump", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Looking for an excuse to pack up the car for a road trip this weekend?The immediate cause of the price break was the shock to global oil markets that came when the Energy Department reported this week that domestic inventories of both crude oil and gasoline had surprisingly surged the week before despite heavy driving on the Memorial Day weekend.Crude oil prices plummeted by more than 5 percent on Wednesday alone, and are near a one-year low at less than $46 a barrel.But whatever lies behind the dividend at the pump, drivers are happy to have it. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline tumbled to $2.35 on Friday, a drop of 3 cents in the past week and more than 2 cents below last year at this time, according to AAA. And Friday was the first time this year that prices were lower than a year earlier.Among the beneficiaries was Charlene Kotlarsic of Garfield Heights, Ohio, who was filling up her 2016 Kia Sorento in the Cleveland suburbs for $2.21 a gallon. She expects to take advantage of the lower prices for a road trip to Myrtle Beach, S.C., in July. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have planned it if gas prices were $3 and above,\u201d she said.Ohio drivers are among those most likely to notice the impact. Of the 23 states where prices are lower than a year ago, a cluster of states \u2014 Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 are seeing the biggest declines. Indiana drivers are paying 28 cents a gallon less on average than last year, meaning a driver can save around $5 in filling up a midsize car.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Most energy experts say the break in gasoline prices may last only a few weeks, because stronger seasonal demand will soon draw down refinery storage levels. And if oil prices stay low, that would depress new production, which could eventually push prices higher.\u201cDrivers should be very happy because all prognosticators overestimated what they would be paying,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service. \u201cThis is a slump, a buying opportunity, and Americans can enjoy it. But I think it is a little bit of an anomaly, and I expect to see higher crude oil prices in the second half of the year.\u201dThe recent lows become more stark in comparison to mid-2008, when the American oil benchmark hit $145 a barrel and the average price of gasoline hit a record of $4.11 a gallon, according to AAA. Economists credit the slide with helping to keep inflation and interest rates low, and benefiting low-income consumers who spend the most money on energy relative to their incomes.Tom Sech, a real estate agent from Independence, Ohio, who drives a nine-year-old compact sport-utility vehicle, likes to make trips to his lakeside cottage in Chautauqua, N.Y. \u201cI can go more often because gas is cheaper,\u201d he said.Americans consume roughly 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so every penny decline means around $4 million a day to American consumers.Prices at the pump are determined by a variety of factors, including consumer demand, domestic storage levels and OPEC production decisions. And there are great regional variations, reflecting differences in refinery operations as well as state taxes.The average driver in South Carolina could fill up for $2.02 a gallon on Friday, compared with $3.06 in California and Hawaii, according to AAA. The Western states are seeing the biggest increases from last year, because of rising demand by drivers and unplanned maintenance of local refineries. Drivers in New Jersey are paying 23 cents a gallon more than a year ago because of an increase in gasoline taxes.There was strong American consumption growth in 2015 and 2016, due in large part to the collapse of oil and gasoline prices. But with winter oil and gasoline prices considerably higher this year than last, motorists drove a bit less and domestic oil companies ramped up production to take advantage of higher crude prices. That produced a glut, with refineries able to pull stocks from storage rather than buy more expensive, new crude.American oil production, after a two-year slump, is soaring again, with the active drilling rig count more than doubling since May 2016. The Energy Department recently predicted that domestic oil production, which averaged 8.6 million barrels a day in 2016, will average 9.3 million barrels a day this year and 10 million barrels a day in 2018, blowing past the record set in 1970. The bulk of the new production is coming from the shale fields of Texas.\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable ramp-up considering that the price of a barrel of oil has not increased significantly,\u201d said Matthew Hale, chief executive of S.O.C. Industries, a pump truck and production chemical services company that operates in the West Texas oil fields. \u201cThe activity level has really boomed, and with technological advances, the increase in the number of barrels we\u2019re getting out of each well is pretty amazing to watch.\u201dThe expanded United States production has canceled out much of the reduction in OPEC output, now more a million barrels a day below last year. While Russia and some other producers besides OPEC have also cut production, Brazil and Canada are among those producing more. Nevertheless, the Energy Department is predicting that global oil inventories will fall in the second half of the year.The Energy Department recently forecast an average regular gasoline retail price of $2.46 a gallon during this summer driving season, 23 cents higher than last summer. But experts say predictions are unreliable, given that demand from China and other developing countries frequently varies because of changing economic and political circumstances. Also, Venezuela, a top source of imported oil, might collapse at any time, and hurricanes can suddenly shut down Gulf refineries.In short, don\u2019t get used to filling the tank for less. Or take advantage while you can.\u201cForecasting the price of gasoline is an art form, not a science,\u201d said Larry Goldstein, a director at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which studies energy economics. \u201cThere are simply too many variables. The best you could hope for is a range of plus or minus 10 cents a gallon.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a news alert sent with this article incorrectly listed the national average price of a gallon of gasoline. It is $2.35, not $3.25.Bob Sandrick contributed reporting from Valley View, Ohio.Advertisement"}

Those people have all the fun! They seem to know exactly what\u2019s going to happen in whatever market they\u2019re investing in and have this aura of self-assurance that is really annoying. It\u2019s enough to cause even the most rational, non-hip among us to doubt our boring, old-style investing.In fact, I remember feeling a bit this way back in 1999. I was surrounded by tech people with their BlackBerries and Hotmail accounts. I resisted the siren call of the Nasdaq and the technology bubble \u2014 until I finally gave in. Then, I took some hard-earned money out of a boring diversified investment and bought Infospace.Remember that? If you do, it may not be pleasant. In fact, I can\u2019t remember the exact details because they\u2019re too painful, but I know I invested a lot of money (for me) back then. When I sold, I didn\u2019t have enough to pay for a burrito and a Coke. I even considered buying more on \u201cthe dip.\u201d Except I didn\u2019t have any more money to invest, and this wasn\u2019t a dip. The stock never recovered to anything close to what I had paid to buy it. Today, I still have the stock certificate as a reminder of that valuable lesson.So, Shawn, the moral of the story is that your friend just might be right. But then again, he might be flat-out wrong.What he is talking about is speculation at best, and it\u2019s probably closer to gambling. If you have some spare money and you feel like gambling, fire away.But here\u2019s an alternative idea.

As the second quarter ends this week, 2017 has so far been a banner year, with major indexes hitting records.But as the bull market rolls on, some see storm clouds on the horizon. \u201cValuations are high and it\u2019s one of the longest and largest bull markets in history,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cBull markets don\u2019t last forever. So the question is, when will the music stop?\u201dInvestors \u201care on a knife\u2019s edge,\u201d said Michael J. Kelly, global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments. With many still scarred by the financial crisis, \u201cthey see a potential disaster around every corner.\u201dThis month the so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which have led the market\u2019s rally \u2014 faced a sudden downdraft, which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times to come. Those jitters were on display Thursday, as tech shares led a sell-off that put a dent in the major indexes.And then there\u2019s Mr. Trump himself, whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential to rattle markets.So I asked some prominent investors and market analysts whether they were pulling back from stocks, and how they viewed these latest developments.There\u2019s no question that these market darlings, which together have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the market\u2019s gains, are expensive, and getting more so. Price-to-earnings ratios range from 38 (Facebook) to 184 (Amazon). Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes. They show up not only in so-called growth funds, but also in value and low-volatility funds. Should they embark on a sustained plunge, a bear market could quickly follow.The tremor in June was \u201ca warning shot across the bow,\u201d said Bill Smead, the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. The Faang stocks \u201care showing all the classic signs of being overcooked,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat magazine hasn\u2019t had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover? There\u2019s no question this can end very badly. But the market can stay irrational for a very long time. My sense is that there\u2019s one big blowout rally left in these stocks.\u201dMr. Stack noted that the Faang stocks had brief sell-offs last June and October, only to rebound. Still, he said, \u201cthe Faang stocks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due to the amount of money that flowed into them and the high expectations that have driven them higher.\u201dBut like Mr. Smead, he doesn\u2019t expect that to be imminent. \u201cWe\u2019re not buying them, but we\u2019re not necessarily saying sell,\u201d Mr. Stack said. He urged investors to rebalance portfolios that have become too heavily weighted in these stocks.Everyone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market, but that may still be years away.\u201cHistorically it\u2019s difficult to find a bear market that wasn\u2019t triggered to some extent by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as they\u2019re going to will have a significant impact. What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced to raise rates faster than everyone anticipates. The Fed has prepared investors for one more rate hike this year. That\u2019s where the potential surprise could come. If we see two or three by year\u2019s end, we\u2019re going to see definite headwinds and maybe a market top of some significance.\u201dMr. Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room to maneuver before stocks start to be affected. \u201cWe just had a once-in-70-year crisis that left very long scars. Businesses basically didn\u2019t invest for eight years. In tightening, the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate. But we\u2019re just getting to the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and we\u2019re seeing more normal economic activity.\u201dMr. Kelly said bull markets typically last another three to four years after such a point in the economic cycle, and can even go another eight or nine. \u201cBull markets die from excess, not old age,\u201d he said.Mr. Smead agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re getting closer to normal rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be difficult for the stock market when it happens. People will be less willing to be adventurous. But that\u2019s still years away.\u201dOver at InvesTech Research, \u201cwe\u2019re still quite bullish,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe\u2019re not increasing cash reserves. We are rebalancing towards more defensive and out-of-favor sectors, like consumer staples and health care.\u201d\u201cThe risks don\u2019t lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cFor political mayhem to upset the economic apple cart, it has to irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level. So far we don\u2019t see that happening. Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16-year highs, and C.E.O. confidence in April was the highest since 2004.\u201dNor have investors given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver business-friendly corporate tax reform and a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code, despite the president\u2019s troubles.At the same time, \u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t be looking to the market for vindication,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a Trump rally. He\u2019s basically riding on the Obama years. \u201cHis bottom line: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to politics, and that\u2019s been a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Making Ignorance Great Again", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump just took us out of the Paris climate accord for no good reason. I don\u2019t mean that his decision was wrong. I mean, literally, that he didn\u2019t offer any substantive justification for that decision. Oh, he threw around a few numbers about supposed job losses, but nobody believes that he knows or cares where those numbers came from. It was just what he felt like doing.And here\u2019s the thing: What just happened on climate isn\u2019t an unusual case \u2014 and Trump isn\u2019t especially unusual for a modern Republican. For today\u2019s G.O.P. doesn\u2019t do substance; it doesn\u2019t assemble evidence, or do analysis to formulate or even to justify its policy positions. Facts and hard thinking aren\u2019t wanted, and anyone who tries to bring such things into the discussion is the enemy.Consider another huge policy area, health care. How was Trumpcare put together? Did the administration and its allies consult with experts, study previous experience with health reform, and try to devise a plan that made sense? Of course not. In fact, House leaders made a point of ramming a bill through before the Congressional Budget Office, or for that matter anyone else, could assess its likely impact.When the budget office did weigh in, its conclusions were what you might expect: If you make huge cuts in Medicaid and reduce subsidies for private insurance \u2014 all so you can cut taxes on the wealthy \u2014 a lot of people are going to lose coverage. Is 23 million a good estimate of those losses? Yes \u2014 it might be 18 million, or it might be 28 million, but surely it would be in that range.But Mulvaney and his party don\u2019t study issues, they just decide, and attack the motives of anyone who questions their decisions.Which brings us back to climate policy.On climate change, influential conservatives have for years clung to what is basically a crazy conspiracy theory \u2014 that the overwhelming scientific consensus that the earth is warming due to greenhouse-gas emissions is a hoax, somehow coordinated by thousands of researchers around the world. And at this point this is effectively the mainstream Republican position.Do G.O.P. leaders really think this conspiracy theory is true? The answer, surely, is that they don\u2019t care. Truth, as something that exists apart from and in possible opposition to political convenience, is no longer part of their philosophical universe.After all, they insist that the private sector is infinitely flexible and innovative; the magic of the marketplace can solve all problems. But then they claim that these magical markets would roll over and die if we put a modest price on carbon emissions, which is basically what climate policy would do. This doesn\u2019t make any sense \u2014 but it\u2019s not supposed to. Republicans want to keep burning coal, and they\u2019ll say whatever helps produce that outcome.And as health care and climate go, so goes everything else. Can you think of any major policy area where the G.O.P. hasn\u2019t gone post-truth? Take budgeting, where leaders like Paul Ryan have always justified tax cuts for the rich by claiming the ability to conjure up trillions in extra revenue and savings in some unspecified way. The Trump-Mulvaney budget, which not only pulls $2 trillion out of thin air but counts it twice, takes the game to a new level, but it\u2019s not that much of a departure.But does any of it matter? The president, backed by his party, is talking nonsense, destroying American credibility day by day. But hey, stocks are up, so what\u2019s the problem?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wrecking the Ship of State", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter Donald Trump\u2019s surprise election victory, many people on the right and even in the center tried to make the case that he wouldn\u2019t really be that bad. Every time he showed a hint of self-restraint \u2014 even if it amounted to nothing more than reading his lines without ad-libbing and laying off Twitter for a day or two \u2014 pundits rushed to declare that he had just \u201cbecome president.\u201dAnd that\u2019s a huge problem. Think, for a minute, of just how much damage this man has done on multiple fronts in just five months.Take health care. It\u2019s still unclear whether Republicans will ever be able to pass a replacement for Obamacare (although it is clear that if they do, it will take coverage away from tens of millions). But whatever happens on the legislative front, there are big problems developing in the insurance markets as we speak: companies pulling out, leaving some parts of the country unserved, or asking for large increases in premiums.Normally, we would consider it ridiculous to suggest that an American president could be so ignorant of crucial issues, and be led to take dangerous foreign policy moves with such crude inducements. But can we believe this about a man who can\u2019t accept the truth about the size of his inauguration crowds, who boasts about his election victory in the most inappropriate circumstances? Yes.The point, again, is that everything suggests that Trump is neither up to the job of being president nor willing to step aside and let others do the work right. And this is already starting to have real consequences, from disrupted health coverage to ruined alliances to lost credibility on the world stage.That risk is, however, all too real \u2014 and one suspects that the big money, which tends to equate wealth with virtue, will be the last to realize just how big that risk really is. The American presidency is, in many ways, sort of an elected monarchy, in which a temperamentally and intellectually unqualified leader can do immense damage.That\u2019s what\u2019s happening now. And we\u2019re barely one-tenth of the way through Trump\u2019s first term. The worst, almost surely, is yet to come.Advertisement"}

Amazon became serious only in late April, when the company\u2019s team signed confidentiality agreements. That means some shareholders, notably Jana Partners, an activist owner of an 8 percent stake, could be receptive to a higher price. A grocery industry buyer like Walmart could also cut costs, helping to justify paying more than the 27 percent premium Amazon is offering.Then there\u2019s the defensive value. If investors were right to sell off grocery chain stocks across the board in the United States and Europe on news of Amazon\u2019s plunge into the sector, it could be worth keeping Jeff Bezos\u2019 online giant away from Whole Foods.Walmart is one of few candidates. Its $230 billion market value dwarfs other listed United States grocers, including Target, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market, as well as Albertsons, which is private. Its balance sheet cash could in theory finance nearly half the acquisition, and with total debt at about 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, it could borrow more.Adding an upscale brand might help Walmart attract new customers and lift its grocery business. Yet that would be a change of direction. Its recent strategy has been to improve its e-commerce offering, including with Friday\u2019s deal to buy the men\u2019s clothing online retailer Bonobos.Financially, too, topping Mr. Bezos\u2019 offer would be tough. Assume Walmart is able to cut Whole Foods\u2019 operating costs by a generous 3 percent, or about $450 million a year. Taxed at 35 percent and capitalized on a multiple of 10, those savings are worth just under $3 billion today, roughly the same as Amazon\u2019s premium. Walmart would be irrational to pay more, especially since it would also have to cover a $400 million break fee.This math applies to any interloper. And even hefty cost cuts wouldn\u2019t make Whole Foods\u2019 Ebitda expand enough for the after-tax return on an acquisition to exceed the 8.6 percent weighted average cost of capital Morningstar attaches to the company.

In a normal world, an American who could come up with two cabinet names besides the secretary of state\u2019s would be regarded as an unusually dedicated citizen.But this year, every appointee is a potential star. For one thing, cabinet officials are particularly important in an administration in which nobody else \u2014 not the president, not the White House staff, not the kids \u2014 knows what they\u2019re doing.So, got to say Ben\u2019s a comer.Still, everybody can\u2019t be a Worst finalist.

You have to give extra attention to the people who actually appear capable of getting a load of terrible things done, like Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cThe problem is that Pruitt knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock of Emily\u2019s List.Pruitt, of course, helped prod Donald Trump into dropping out of the Paris climate accord, although chances are the big guy didn\u2019t need a whole lot of urging.\u201cSo many choices,\u201d said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: White House Looks to Defang Financial Watchdog", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration has offered its most detailed plans to date for the unraveling of financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.In a report issued on Monday, the Treasury said that the president should be able to remove the bureau\u2019s director and recommended greater exemptions from the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d which bans banks from trading for their own gain.The report also called for relief from regulatory scrutiny, such as stress tests for community banks.The plan sets up a clash between President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was her brainchild.According to the Treasury report, \u201cThe C.F.P.B. was created to pursue an important mission, but its unaccountable structure and unduly broad regulatory powers have led to predictable regulatory abuses and excesses.\u201d\u201cThe C.F.P.B.\u2019s approach to rule making and enforcement has hindered consumer access to credit, limited innovation and imposed unduly high compliance burdens, particularly on small institutions,\u201d the report added.Critics argue that the plan would put the economy at risk.\u201cWe need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.Chief executives say they\u2019re optimistic about the economy and about the prospect of lower regulation and lower tax.And investors have bid up the stock market.Usually, when corporate leaders are confident, they do deals.But that has not happened since Mr. Trump was elected. In fact, the number of mergers have fallen off a cliff.Bellwether companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google led a two-day sell-off, after a relentless three-year ascent.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dUBS published a research report noting the heavy influence of these stocks on investor portfolios. Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far the stocks had run. Two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple.Hedge funds could be bailing out, too.The question now is whether retail investors will stick with them.The group of Uber executives that formed the inner circle around Travis Kalanick, the chief executive, is fraying.The A-Team, as it was informally known, shared Mr. Kalanick\u2019s aggressive approach and helped him barrel into new markets around the world.\u2022 Emil Michael, Uber\u2019s senior vice president for business and its second in command, left the company.\u2022 Eric Alexander, a top executive in Asia, was fired for mishandling the rape case of an Uber passenger in India.\u2022 Thuan Pham, Uber\u2019s chief technology officer, is under scrutiny for what many see as his shortcomings in listening to employee complaints.Uber staff members who sell even part of their stock back to the company under a repurchase program must give the voting rights associated with all their shares to Mr. Kalanick, according to a copy of the buyback agreement obtained by The New York Times.That voting power is crucial as the ride-hailing service wrestles with its issues and as the board considers whether Mr. Kalanick should take a three-month leave of absence.Even if he took time off, his ability to influence the direction of the company would appear to be secure, thanks to his \u201csuper-voting shares.\u201dAnd employees must follow the \u201cinstructions of Travis Kalanick,\u201d according to the buyback agreement, \u201cwith respect to any and all matters\u201d that are submitted to a shareholder vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Martin Shkreli, \u2018Pharma Bro,\u2019 Prepares for Trial: \u2018I\u2019m So Innocent\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMartin Shkreli, former hedge fund manager, \u201cpharma bro\u201d and self-styled bad boy, sat in federal court for a hearing on Monday before his fraud trial begins next week.Like most defendants, he sat mostly still; like most defendants, he stayed quiet, declining to speak to reporters as he left.Then he went home, turned on his web camera and live-streamed himself on the computer for almost two and a half hours. He played League of Legends; he filled in Excel models on pharmaceutical stocks and bonds; he patted his cat; he drank Coca-Colas; he checked Twitter. He voice chatted while live chatting in another window while playing online chess. The only sign of his federal case was a window that could be seen briefly, showing a PowerPoint titled \u201cWitness Guide\u201d and a slide on a former boss of his.This is how a self-promoter goes to trial.His trial, in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, is on eight counts of securities and wire fraud. The charges stem from two hedge funds he founded and ran between 2009 and 2012, MSMB Capital Management and MSMB Healthcare, and from Retrophin, a biopharmaceutical company he founded in 2011. Mr. Shkreli has denied the charges.Investors began to get suspicious after he told them, in September 2012, that he was winding down both funds and that they could redeem their stakes for cash or for shares in Retrophin, according to the indictment. But Mr. Shkreli didn\u2019t give cash to those who had requested it.According to the indictment, he then arranged to pay the MSMB investors through Retrophin. He created settlements between MSMB investors and Retrophin without board approval, and made up sham consulting agreements with MSMB investors so that Retrophin routed them money.Asked for a comment, a lawyer for Mr. Shkreli, Benjamin Brafman, said, \u201cBecause of the many complicated issues in this trial, I am intent on doing all of my commenting in the courtroom, not in the press.\u201dMr. Shkreli is a curious mix of blue-collar-boy-made-good and attention seeker \u2014 particularly when that attention is negative.While at Baruch, he continued working at the hedge fund, and at night read patent filings and other drug-research documents, according to a filing by his lawyers. He started his first hedge fund in 2006, then MSMB Capital in 2009, followed by running the pharmaceutical companies Retrophin, Turing and one other.While neither his personality nor the pharmaceutical prices are on trial, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s out-of-court exploits have already complicated his lawyers\u2019 in-court arguments.A prosecutor also described the behavior of one of Mr. Shkreli\u2019s family members as \u201cless than appropriate,\u201d in a separate hearing on Thursday. A member of the defendant\u2019s family contacted a witness, the prosecutor, Alixandra Smith, said, and \u201cit has veered into the territory of suggesting a witness not testify.\u201dMr. Shkreli\u2019s notoriety came into play Thursday as lawyers argued over whether to restrict journalists from portions of jury selection that take place at a sidebar conference. Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers said the negative press coverage had been intense.A lawyer arguing on behalf of several media organizations, including The New York Times, said that Mr. Shkreli himself helped create his reputation. \u201cMr. Shkreli live-streamed his life,\u201d said the lawyer, Katherine M. Bolger.At Monday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers outlined a few lines of defense.They indicated that they would portray Mr. Shkreli as a \u201cboy genius,\u201d as his lawyer, Mr. Brafman, put it, who never meant to defraud his investors. In fact, Mr. Brafman said, Mr. Shkreli never did defraud them, as the investors ultimately got their money back.If Mr. Shkreli testifies, the lawyer said, he will discuss why he worked on these companies, how hard he worked on them, and whether he intended to defraud or was trying to make good on money he lost trading.A prosecutor, Jacquelyn Kasulis, argued that investors getting money back was not a legitimate defense. Fraud, she said, can mean depriving investors of a right to control their assets.\u201cThere is law here, there are rules, they apply to Mr. Shkreli,\u201d she said.Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers have also indicated that they will go after Retrophin in their defense. By fall 2014, Retrophin had removed Mr. Shkreli as chief executive, replacing him with Stephen Aselage. Then, Retrophin wanted Mr. Shkreli out of the company altogether, his lawyers have argued. But according to his employment contract, only a felony conviction for \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d could oust him.Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers say Retrophin dealt extensively with federal authorities before his indictment, and knew an indictment was likely, giving them the confidence to remove him from the board even given his employment-contract terms. Retrophin, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers pointed out, filed a $65 million lawsuit against Mr. Shkreli in August 2015, before his arrest, with many claims similar to the later criminal case.\u201cThere is a motive, that will become crystal clear when people like Aselage testify,\u201d Mr. Brafman said in court on Monday.Chris Cline, a Retrophin spokesman, said Wednesday that Mr. Shkreli was put on leave as chief executive and \u201cvoluntarily resigned\u201d as an officer and board member soon after, in October 2014, \u201cwell after the government investigation of Mr. Shkreli had begun.\u201d Mr. Cline said that all of the documents Retrophin gave to the government were in response to grand-jury subpoenas, and that Retrophin cooperated with the government investigation by \u201cproviding information relating to those documents and by responding to government inquiries.\u201dThe trial is expected to last six weeks. And Mr. Shkreli sounds confident about it.\u201cI\u2019m so innocent, the jury, judge and the prosecution are gonna give me an apology,\u201d he said in a recent live stream. (Several of his live streams, available early this week, had been taken down by midweek.)The cost of defending himself, though, has already affected one of his bragging rights: how rich he is.Mr. Shkreli told federal authorities he was worth $70 million after he was arrested, Ms. Smith, the prosecutor said, said at Monday\u2019s hearing.But in asking for a reduction in Mr. Shkreli\u2019s $5 million bail, Mr. Brafman, his lawyer, said that his client had no bank accounts, and no valuable assets other than his share in Turing, worth $30 million to $50 million. And Mr. Shkreli is restricted from selling that because of how his stake in the private company is structured, Mr. Brafman said.\u201cHe has a Picasso,\u201d Ms. Smith noted.Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto has yet to rule on the bail matter. And Mr. Brafman characterized some of his client\u2019s words as \u201cpreposterous promises.\u201d\u201cThey are still part of this effort, if you will, for him to remain a person in his own right, traveling to the beat of his very unique drummer,\u201d which will become evident during the trial, Mr. Brafman said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Will Be Part of a Popular Stock Index, Opening the Door to Foreign Money", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s effort to open its door to foreign investors has received a big push, as its stocks were accepted into a closely followed global index.The index provider MSCI announced in New York on Tuesday that it would add domestic Chinese stocks to its influential emerging markets benchmark. As a result, investment funds representing $1.6 trillion will be under heavy but informal pressure to start buying Chinese domestic stocks next year, leading to $17 billion in fresh money being pumped into the stock markets, according to MSCI.Currently, foreign investors own just under 1.5 percent of Chinese stocks.The decision is a symbolic victory for China. The Chinese government had lobbied MSCI for years to include in its indexes the so-called A shares traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets.Those stocks would account for just 0.73 percent of the overall MSCI emerging market index at first. But that share could grow if China continues to reform its financial markets.\u201cMSCI is very hopeful that the momentum of positive change witnessed in China over the past years will continue to accelerate,\u201d the index company said.Many investors measure the performance of money managers, like mutual fund and hedge fund managers, against MSCI indexes. That puts pressure on active managers to buy the shares in the index, and then add or subtract a few stocks in an effort to beat the index.China\u2019s inclusion, even on a limited scale, means that money managers will find the indexes more attractive. Many investors have also gravitated toward index funds that try to match the indexes directly, by buying all or nearly all of the stocks in them.The Chinese government had long sought MSCI inclusion because it could help establish Shanghai and Shenzhen as global financial centers.It could also push international money managers to pay more attention to corporate governance in China and demand that Chinese executives improve business practices, such as providing greater financial disclosure and limiting insider transactions.\u201cMSCI inclusion not only mandated global investors to allocate more funding into the Chinese A share market, but also provided a much-needed impetus to move Chinese stock markets closer to global standards,\u201d said Shen Jianguang, a China economist at Mizhuho Securities.\u201cHaving exhausted the ability to use state-owned banks as A.T.M.s, Beijing would love to entice foreign money into China\u2019s stock and bond markets,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, a China specialist at Enodo Economics, a financial advisory firm. \u201cBut the MSCI symbolic move falls well short of diverting global passive money into China\u2019s equity markets.\u201dAt the Lujiazui Forum, an annual gathering of top Chinese economic and financial policy makers in Shanghai, Chinese officials underlined on Tuesday their desire for foreign participation in the country\u2019s financial markets.\u201cThe financial service industry is a competitive service industry which benefits from opening up, and will continue to expand its opening up,\u201d said Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the country\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China.But international companies have to some extent been exempted from those restrictions, particularly since the start of this year, in an effort to convince them that if they put more money into China, they will be able to take it out someday. Limits on the repatriation of dividends have been removed, and limits on foreign trading of Chinese bonds have been lightened.On the previous occasions that MSCI chose not to include Chinese shares, it was also considering whether to include them as a sizable percentage of its emerging markets index. The index company disclosed in a draft paper this year that it was considering a much smaller percentage role for Chinese shares in its emerging market index than in previous years, notably by reducing by two-thirds the number of Chinese stocks that would be tracked in the index.Chinese shares traded on markets outside mainland China, such as in Hong Kong, already represent the largest concentration of companies from a single country in the MSCI emerging markets index, fluctuating at about a quarter of the entire index.While China received a greenlight from MSCI, another emerging market hopeful, Argentina, was not so lucky.Despite Argentina\u2019s successful sale of a 100-year government bond on Monday, the index company said it was not ready to upgrade the country to its emerging markets index because recent market reforms \u201cneeded to remain in place for a longer time period to be deemed irreversible.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong, and Alexandra Stevenson from New York.

{"Headline": "All-Clear for Big Banks Raises Fears of a Return to Risk", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt took a decade \u2014 and $200 billion in fines \u2014 but the big banks are back.While some of the consequences will be felt sooner than others, they will be far-reaching. The immediate winners include investors as well as bank executives, who could see their already ample pay packages expand further.Even as the broader market fell Thursday, bank stocks surged as investors cheered the big dividend increases announced by JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and others following the Fed\u2019s statement.Looking out further, many big institutions might have more flexibility to lend, a major factor in promoting the long-term growth of businesses. And at least in theory, the more capital the banks now hold and less stringent oversight of the financial sector by Washington could give the economy a shot in the arm after years of caution.\u201cIt\u2019s not a sudden thing. It\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d said Guy Moszkowski, managing partner at Autonomous Research U.S., an independent firm in New York. \u201cBut American banks are more soundly capitalized today than at any time in my career, which started in 1979.\u201dOn the other hand, critics fear the easing of regulatory pressure and a more laissez-faire-oriented White House could set the stage for a return to the bad old days of enormous leverage and freewheeling deals until the music inevitably stops.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to put the brakes on regulation,\u201d said Mark T. Williams, a banking expert at Boston University and a former bank examiner for the Federal Reserve. He noted that with the 10 largest American banks holding 80 percent of all banking assets, \u201cthis concentrated financial power residing at the top banks should be carefully monitored.\u201d\u201cWithout regulators and cops in the corner, you will have incentives for banks to take excessive risks,\u201d Mr. Williams added.It was exactly 10 years ago this month, as the housing bubble collapsed, that the first cracks in what would nearly bring down the country\u2019s economic edifice appeared.Within 18 months, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were gone, and once invincible names like Citigroup and Bank of America teetered on the edge, necessitating a federal bailout.The economic and psychological scars of the financial crisis and the ensuing recession linger, as do the industry\u2019s public relations woes.But in terms of financial metrics like earnings, dividends for shareholders and the ability to absorb potential losses in the event of a recession, the financial sector has clearly turned a page. The banks tested by the Fed now have a $1.25 trillion capital cushion, compared with less than half that in 2009.In a statement on Wednesday, the chief executive of Citigroup, Michael Corbat, said, \u201cToday marks a significant milestone for Citi and our shareholders.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s assessment, he said, demonstrated that \u201cCiti has the ability to withstand a severe economic scenario and remain well capitalized, while also substantially increasing our level of capital return.\u201dAlthough President Trump has promised to roll back many of the rules imposed after the financial crisis while appointing regulators with a much lighter touch, many bank analysts say memories of 2008 and the penalties that followed will also inhibit risk-taking in the future.\u201cParts of the industry had a near-death experience, while some financial institutions actually had a death experience,\u201d Mr. Moszkowski noted. And as was the case following the crash of 1929, \u201cthe legislative and regulatory response was quite harsh.\u201dThe 2008 crisis \u201cforced the U.S. banking system to recognize its losses and recapitalize itself quickly,\u201d Mr. Moszkowski said. \u201cThe lack of that type of pressure in Europe has contributed to what has been a longer period of weakness and recovery there.\u201dWith European banks still hobbled, American firms have benefited in recent years, lifting their share of global revenues from underwriting and advice on mergers and acquisitions.Nearly a decade of historically low interest rates engineered by the Fed also helped banks rebuild their financial fortunes, even if savers and investors watched the yields on money market accounts and C.D.s shrink to the point of vanishing.\u201cThe banking industry has pretty radically de-risked its balance sheet,\u201d said Chris Kotowski, a senior research analyst at Oppenheimer. For example, in 2007 banks held more than a quarter of a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of corporate bonds on their trading desks and other accounts. By April 2017, that figure stood at just over $54 billion.The current rate of delinquencies on products like credit cards and commercial real estate loans is half what it was during previous periods of healthy economic growth, Mr. Kotowski said.At the same time, while banks may have the ability to lend more freely, anemic demand for credit and slow economic growth are likely to restrain new loan growth. And the Fed is in the process of slowly raising interest rates in the face of what policy makers see as stronger economic growth.If rates keep moving up, higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers would most likely offset whatever benefit slightly easier credit from a healthier banking system provides.There are other shifts by big banks wrought by the financial crisis and the long economic recovery since then that won\u2019t be reversed.After shedding tens of thousands of workers, and shuttering hundreds of branches, the banking industry isn\u2019t about to go on a hiring or building spree.\u201cNecessity is the mother of invention, and banks have been forced to operate more cheaply,\u201d Mr. Moszkowski said. \u201cChanging customer behavior, like use of mobile banking, has also enabled them to cut back on branches and staff.\u201dWhile bankers themselves might be more cautious about lending or blurring the distinction between traditional banking and Wall Street-style trading, one element of the go-go years has made a comeback recently: big pay packages for top executives.With the big rally in bank stocks since the election in November, the options packages and other stock-based incentives that bank executives received in recent years have swollen in value.\u201cExecutive compensation hasn\u2019t declined since the financial crisis. It\u2019s gone up,\u201d Mr. Williams said. In 2016, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, received a total pay package of $28 million. In 2006, his overall compensation equaled $27 million.In 2016, Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs was paid a total of $20.2 million, well below the $70 million he received a decade ago, but far above the postcrisis compensation package of $9.6 million in 2009.For his part, Mr. Kotowski believes that memories of Lehman, plus the enormous fines paid to regulators, will serve as a check on appetite for risk for years to come.\u201cEven if bankers all started behaving like drunken sailors tomorrow, it would take years before problems arose,\u201d Mr. Kotowski said. \u201cAnd with the stress tests by the Fed every year, and the memory of the fines, they\u2019re not about to do that.\u201dIt was painful for banks to give up the revenues and profits that came with added risk, Mr. Kotowski said, \u201cbut having made that adjustment, there\u2019s no point in going back to the old world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The main portfolio at Viking, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., is said to be up this year.In recent years, a number of large hedge funds have returned money to investors as they have found that managing too much money can hurt performance as it makes firms less nimble and hard to move in and out of positions.Mr. Halvorsen said in the letter that Mr. Sundheim was \u201cin a league of his own as a stock picker.\u201dMr. Sundheim, who became co-chief investment officer in 2010 and took over the role on a solo basis in 2014, had managed a significant amount of money at the firm.

{"Headline": "Big Banks Clear First Phase of Federal Reserve Stress Tests", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnce universally dreaded by banks, the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual stress tests are becoming less stressful.The banking system, according to the test results, has an even larger capital cushion than it did going into last year\u2019s exam. That is likely to increase calls from the financial industry and its allies in the Trump administration and Congress to start watering down the regulations.Even the Fed governor overseeing the tests this year has said he wants to pull back some rules.Banks have complained that regulators have unduly required banks to pile on capital that they could use to lend to small business and homeowners. The required capital buildup has also squeezed the industry\u2019s profits, which can cut into bankers\u2019 pay and bonuses.Thursday\u2019s results are very likely a good harbinger for next week\u2019s even more consequential test, when Fed officials will decide whether to approve the banks\u2019 plans to pay dividends and repurchase shares.Wall Street analysts expect that those payouts will increase this year \u2014 a big plum for investors who have gone through nearly a decade of lagging stock prices. Bank stocks, which rallied sharply in the wake of President Trump\u2019s election victory, are for the most part off the highs they reached earlier in the year.The Federal Reserve analyzes the banks\u2019 soundness by running their actual loans and other assets through a series of scenarios that would lead to huge losses.This year\u2019s fictional challenges for 34 banks included unemployment of about 10 percent and commercial real estate losses of 35 percent.The Fed governor overseeing this year\u2019s tests is Jerome H. Powell, a Republican former private equity executive appointed by President Barack Obama in 2011.Although the criteria for the stress tests are reviewed and approved by the entire Board of Governors, Mr. Powell has made it clear that some rules need to be adjusted now that the banks are well capitalized.America\u2019s biggest banks breezed through the first phase of the annual test. Next week, the Fed will decide whether to approve plans to pay dividends and repurchase shares.Banks have complained that the qualitative aspect of the test is subject to the whims of individual regulators, allowing them to fail a certain bank just to set an example.\u201cAs we consider the progress that has been achieved in improving the resiliency and resolvability of our banking industry, it is important for us to look for ways to reduce unnecessary burden,\u201d Mr. Powell said in his prepared testimony.The tone of Mr. Powell\u2019s remarks is different from that of his predecessor, Daniel K. Tarrullo, who had overseen regulation for the Fed before stepping down in April.On the eve of last year\u2019s stress tests, Mr. Tarrullo publicly signaled the need for higher capital surcharges on the eight largest banks.Looking ahead to future tests, banks have even more reason to feel relieved.Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who used to run OneWest Bank, wants to limit the number of banks that must undergo the stress tests. The Treasury recommends that only banks with assets of $50 billion or more be subject to the exercise. Currently, banks with at least $10 billion are tested.The Treasury also proposes doing away with the qualitative part of the stress test, which will be administered next week.It also would require banks to submit their dividend plans every two years instead of every year.Banking trade groups seized on the results Thursday as proof that the time had come to ease up on the tests. At the largest banks, overall capital levels have increased to $1.2 trillion, from about $500 billion in 2009.\u201cFrom this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,\u201d Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement.Senate Democrats warned that the Trump administration\u2019s proposals would allow banks to more easily \u201cgame\u201d the tests and hide their risks.\u201cThese recommendations would make the watchdogs\u2019 jobs harder and prevent them from spotting risks before they balloon out of control,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said in a statement.Banks have dedicated entire staffs to prepare for the tests, which had become, in some cases, an annual referendum on a banking chief\u2019s job performance.But as the capital levels have steadily grown, the outcome of the tests for most banks has become less in doubt.\u201cThe overall feel of it and the intensity of it has subsided significantly,\u201d said Bill Hines, a portfolio manager focused on banks at Aberdeen Asset Management.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Kansas Investment Firm Spurring Change on Wall Street", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEAWOOD, Kan. \u2014 Tucked away in a sleepy office park in this Kansas City suburb, a $26 billion investment advisory firm is helping drive Wall Street\u2019s latest wealth boom.Inside, there are no televisions tuned to CNBC and there is hardly a Bloomberg terminal to be seen. There is a dentist on the top floor. The boss drives a Honda.Yet the company, Creative Planning, is at the vanguard of a profound shift in finance: the move away from brokers and mutual fund companies peddling products for a fee, and toward firms offering truly independent, low-cost investment advice.These firms, known as registered investment advisers, number about 30,000 and can manage as little as $1 million and as much as $70 billion. They now oversee about $4.5 trillion in assets.That is about $1 trillion more than what hedge funds administer, and with no sign that this growth will diminish anytime soon, independent advisers \u2014 with their vast exposure to \u201csticky\u201d retirement money throughout the country \u2014 have become crucial distribution channels for the biggest names in the industry, including BlackRock, Vanguard, Pimco and Goldman Sachs.As the independent advice industry has grown, Creative Planning has grown faster, with assets exploding to $26.2 billion today from just $34 million in 2004. Peter Mallouk, an estate planning attorney who started the business with an eye toward servicing medical professionals in suburban Kansas City, now oversees a national fleet of wealth advisers in more than 30 states.Although most Creative clients have their funds in broader stock and bond markets accessed largely via passive investment vehicles, the firm\u2019s growth has attracted a who\u2019s who of Wall Street firms, eager to pitch more complex, less liquid investment options.Once a month, Creative\u2019s Honda-driving founder, Mr. Mallouk, and 10 of his top executives gather in a conference room to hear pitches \u2014 in person and over the phone \u2014 from these investment shops.Plain-spoken and dressed casually in polo shirts and chinos, they seem more like high school teachers than seasoned investment professionals.\u201cHow would you explain the benefit of your fund to a 15-year-old?\u201d one team member asked at a recent meeting, after a windy presentation from a big-name investment firm pushing a private-equity-style credit fund.But don\u2019t mistake anyone here for a rube. That investment house would slash its fees and its multimillion-dollar investment minimum to get on Creative\u2019s approved list. That means, higher-net-worth Creative clients would have the opportunity to invest directly in the vehicle, alongside traditional private equity investors like pensions and sovereign wealth funds.Mr. Mallouk, who led the meeting, was fresh off a plane, having just landed a $75 million account.And he was urging his colleagues to be more flexible in allowing sophisticated clients to get maximum exposure to these types of elite, alternative investments.\u201cWe have to be able to do what we do for all clients, which is give them our best advice but give them the power to adjust as they wish,\u201d Mr. Mallouk said. \u201cOtherwise they are going to kick my butt out the door.\u201dAt a time in finance when a firm\u2019s ability to gather assets in large amounts has become the ultimate emblem of sway and success (see fund leaders like Vanguard and BlackRock or the private equity giant Blackstone Group), Creative\u2019s asset growth numbers border on the unfathomable.That is doubly true because the growth has been largely organic. Unlike many other large registered investor advisers, Creative Planning has not expanded via acquisitions, or by luring away teams of brokers from the likes of Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley.Instead, Mr. Mallouk has bet the ranch on a single principle: that as clients become ever more aware that the first priority of large brokerage firms is to direct investors to in-house investments, they will instead choose independent advisers like Creative Planning.\u201cI honestly think that if you are a financial consumer and you are dealing with a brokerage house, you are just out of your mind,\u201d Mr. Mallouk said, his voice rising as it often does when he talks about investors\u2019 right to receive conflict-free advice. \u201cThe problem in American finance is that if you go to a large broker, you are assuming he will act in your best interest \u2014 but by law he does not have to. \u201dWhile it is true that much of Wall Street is moving toward the independent model of charging a flat fee tied to assets, Mr. Mallouk notes that many brokers at the big houses are still paid by commission, which is tied to their ability to sell proprietary investments to clients.\u201cIt\u2019s horrible \u2014 people don\u2019t even know that they are paying someone to sell them something,\u201d Mr. Mallouk said. \u201cHere is the bottom line: Compensation drives behavior.\u201dAt Creative, which has no in-house funds, there is no such temptation and the firm\u2019s advisers are compensated not on what they sell, but on how their client assets grow and are retained.Industry experts say that the fee independent advisers charge clients is, on average, about 1 percent of assets under management. That would include the central function of creating a financial plan for clients and other services as well, including tax, legal and estate planning advice.Since 2005, the market share for independent financial advisers has increased to 23 percent from 13 percent, according to a recent report by Cerulli Associates, a financial research firm. The gains for registered investment advisers have been strongest in recent years, as a combination of steep fees and heightened investor scrutiny since the financial crisis has prompted a small exodus of funds from traditional brokerage houses.Fueling Creative Planning\u2019s own success are two critical developments that have been instrumental in driving the growth of independent advice.One is the increasing popularity of low-cost, passive investing styles, exemplified by the emergence of exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which give independent advisers cheap and easy exposure to every imaginable investment preference.At Creative, for example, planners rarely if ever buy individual securities or traditional mutual funds. Nor do they pay much attention to the daily ups and downs of the market: Mr. Mallouk\u2019s ban on CNBC-spouting televisions is supposed to favor long-term sang-froid over shorter-term panic.Accordingly, a basket of E.T.F.s, Mr. Mallouk believes, keeps his employees \u2014 and clients \u2014 from succumbing to the temptation to try to outsmart the market by taking big risks.Creative Planning is now among the larger individual holders of Vanguard funds. And at BlackRock, Mr. Mallouk and his $26 billion pool of client assets loom large as a crucial distribution channel for the firm\u2019s fleet of iShares E.T.F.s.All of which is heady stuff for Mr. Mallouk, who is 47.With 426 workers workers, Creative is hiring, on average, a new employee every day \u2014 each of whom Mr. Mallouk interviews. The company recently broke ground on new headquarters to house its expanding work force.And about $400 million in new investor funds has been flowing into the firm each month.Still, Mr. Mallouk likes to keep things simple. He has no secretary and he leaves the office most days at 5 p.m. to catch a son\u2019s baseball or basketball game.\u201cWe are building a rocket ship even though the rocket has already taken off,\u201d said Mr. Mallouk, who believes it will not be long before an independent adviser reaches $100 billion in client assets.The son of Egyptian immigrants, Mr. Mallouk grew up not far from where he works today, and he celebrates what he calls Creative\u2019s \u201csolid, not flashy\u201d Kansan sensibility.He runs the firm but still considers himself a customer man, even though he does not play golf and eschews client dinners, industry conferences and other schmooze-driven outings.\u201cYou don\u2019t call up your doctor and say, \u2018Let\u2019s go to dinner,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mallouk said. \u201cI like where I sit \u2014 on the side of the client.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Comcast rolled out a mobile initiative in April using Verizon\u2019s network, and Charter has similar designs.Mr. Son, who controls Sprint though Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, has been agitating to do a deal for ages, starting by merging Sprint with T-Mobile U.S. They are the No. 3 and No. 4 mobile carriers in the United States and have been locked in battle over the price-conscious clients of the rivals AT&T and Verizon.However their discussions proceed, it is hard to imagine the three alpha executives easily coming to any agreement. Mr. Malone is known for whipping up complex structures that involve a maze of tracking stocks and holding companies. Mr. Malone is trying to convince a skeptical Mr. Roberts to buy the troubled Sprint, valued at $65 billon with debt, The Journal reported.Mr. Roberts, though, could be tempted by the cost savings that a deal would bring. New Street Research estimated as much as $6 billion can be shed annually in network operating and capital expenses. Taxed at roughly 35 percent and capitalized, the current value of savings could reach nearly $40 billion.With a potential windfall like that on the horizon, even the oldest of dogs might be convinced of a three-headed trick.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Global Investors See Fresh Worries in an Old Problem: China", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 While investors have been preoccupied with President Trump and chaos in Washington, nerve-rattling elections in Europe and the uncertainty created by Federal Reserve policy and Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, a once-familiar \u2014 and possibly bigger \u2014 risk to global markets has been bubbling in the background.China.Two years after China first set off investor alarm bells worldwide with a stock market crash, a slumping currency and concerns over rising debt, many investors have put those concerns out of mind. Shares of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong and other places outside the mainland have surged to their highest levels since the crash, beating markets in other developing countries, as investors embrace China\u2019s thriving technology and consumer scenes.Even in China, where the long-downtrodden domestic stock market still suffers from investor skepticism and government meddling, local shares enjoyed a run-up for much of this year before falling back recently.\u201cThe vast majority of consensus opinion is that China is fine,\u201d said Kevin Smith, the founder and chief executive of Crescat Capital, an asset management firm based in Denver that is betting against Chinese investments. Referring broadly to China\u2019s debt and other financials, he added: \u201cPeople are really not looking at the potential bubble. The bubble just keeps getting bigger.\u201dChina\u2019s fate has major sway over global markets, given its longtime role as a growth driver \u2014 and investors may soon have a bigger stake in the ups and downs of Chinese stocks.MSCI, an investment advisory firm that compiles stock indexes that are widely tracked by mutual funds and pension funds around the world, is considering adding domestic Chinese stocks to a key benchmark. The company is scheduled to unveil its decision on Tuesday.Investors have already received some encouragement to jump in. In March, Goldman Sachs recommended investors increase their holdings of Chinese stocks, citing improved economic growth, stable policies and other positives.But some investors have started to worry again. In a survey released by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, fund managers in May named China the biggest potential source for an unpleasant surprise for global markets for the first time since January 2016. The investor services firm Moody\u2019s also downgraded China\u2019s sovereign credit rating last month, its first such move in 28 years.Debt is a central theme to these rising concerns. To shore up its economy, China resorted to pumping up credit, adding to an already mountainous pile of debt. According to the Bank for International Settlements, that debt reached 257 percent of its gross domestic product at the end of 2016, slightly above the same measure in the United States, and significantly higher than the 184 percent for emerging economies over all.But what worries economists most is the pace at which it has mounted. At the end of 2007, China\u2019s debt stood at only 152 percent of G.D.P.The research company Capital Economics, in a June report, warned that debt in China \u201chas risen far faster than in almost any other major economy on record,\u201d and that its continued buildup was the \u201cbiggest risk facing emerging Asia.\u201dOver the last several months, the government has tried to reverse this trend, helping slow credit growth. But that, too, has rattled financial markets in China. The fear is that tighter credit could both slow growth and make it more difficult for highly indebted firms to pay back those loans. In a sign of strain, the interest rates charged by banks when lending to one another have been rising.Policy makers in China appear more worried, too. In late May, the government indicated it would tighten its grip on the renminbi, stepping back from a longstanding commitment to allow market forces a greater role in its valuation.Mr. Smith of Crescat said he believed global investors remained too complacent about the China threat. Calling China \u201cthe largest macro bubble in our lifetime,\u201d he said the situation had \u201calready gone beyond what global financial watchdogs claim are levels where other countries historically have gotten into trouble.\u201dMr. Smith has arranged his portfolio with these fears in mind. He said he was shorting China equity funds. (When investors short, they are making financial bets that the price of something is going to fall.) And though such positions have subtracted from his returns so far this year, he has doubled down.Just since May, he has shorted individual Chinese companies listed in New York, including the e-commerce companies Alibaba Group and JD.com and the search engine specialist Baidu, which he argues are more exposed to China\u2019s shaky financial sector than many investors realize.Investors may steer clear of China until the uncertainty about its heavy debt \u2014 and the government\u2019s will and ability to handle it \u2014 clears up.\u201cThe biggest crisis tends to happen when people are not looking, when the government is not trying to tackle the risk,\u201d said Jian Shi Cortesi, who oversees the Asian equities portfolio at the asset-manager GAM, based in Zurich. \u201cSo far they are managing it quite well. But the market is always scared if they cannot manage it. \u201dNot all China watchers are quite so nervous. Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist in Hong Kong at AXA Investment Managers, which has more than $800 billion under management, said investors should see the current effort to bring down leverage as a positive for the economy\u2019s future health.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m not all that concerned,\u201d Mr. Yao said. Policy makers, he added, \u201care managing the situation quite carefully.\u201dThere is also some confidence among China analysts that politics will keep the country\u2019s currency and stock markets on track in the coming months. This year, a major Communist Party conference will take place. To avoid any undue surprises, policy makers are likely to do whatever they can to prevent drastic shifts in asset values before the meeting.It is unclear whether MSCI, the stock-index compiler, will broaden global access for Chinese stocks. It has rejected adding China\u2019s domestic shares for three consecutive years, citing regulations that hamper an investor\u2019s ability to sell shares and take funds out of the country. The Chinese authorities have introduced some measures to address these issues.Mr. Yao of AXA said he believed that Chinese regulators had opened up enough access to domestic markets to win over MSCI. But even he does not see that translating into an immediate rush into Chinese stocks, given China\u2019s problems.\u201cLong term, we are fairly cautious as well,\u201d Mr. Yao said. \u201cPeople already know there is no easy out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Kushner\u2019s Office of American Innovation brought together the executives for 10 workshops on topics such as cybersecurity, analytics and using technology to better connect people to government services.Mr. Kushner opened the event in the White House Indian Peace Treaty room by emphasizing the potential of the companies to improve the government\u2019s outdated and inefficient technology systems.\u201cTogether we will unleash the creativity of the private sector to provide citizen services in a way that has never happened before,\u201d he said.The opportunity for Silicon Valley is enormous.

{"Headline": "Blue Apron, a Meal Delivery Service, Files for Public Offering", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBlue Apron was a pioneer in delivering food kits to customers for assembling meals at home. Now it is beating a path to an initial public offering.Blue Apron is seeking to go public as it faces intensifying competition from a host of rivals, including HelloFresh, Sun Basket and the vegetarian-focused Purple Carrot. And its filing shed light on some of the high costs of that race: Even as the company\u2019s revenue grew, its losses and marketing costs soared.A successful public offering would make Blue Apron one of the most recognizable names to enter the public markets since Snap, the parent of Snapchat, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in March.Founded in 2012, Blue Apron was one of the earliest purveyors of so-called meal kits, which provide subscribers with mostly prepared ingredients that they cook at home, following an accompanying recipe. The premise: home cooking, without the trips to the grocery store or the hassle of deciding what to make.The size of Blue Apron\u2019s offering has yet to be determined. The prospectus listed a $100 million fund-raising target, a preliminary number used to determine filing fees.The filing highlighted the enormous growth that Blue Apron has enjoyed since starting. Its sales have risen 10-fold from 2014 to 2016, reaching $795.4 million last year.But its net loss grew 16 percent last year from 2015, to $54.8 million, according to the filing. Using the company\u2019s preferred measure of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, which excludes expenses like stock-based pay and taxes, it lost $43.6 million in 2016, up 32.5 percent from the year before, the filing shows.Some of the increased loss stemmed from the rising cost of ingredients and from spending on marketing, which jumped 10-fold from 2014 to 2016, to $144.1 million.Blue Apron has shown signs of stalled growth in other ways. Its average order value for the first three months of 2017 shrank slightly from the same period a year ago, to $57.23. Both the number of orders per customer and the average revenue per customer also fell slightly in the first quarter of this year compared with the first quarter of 2016.The company has also made moves to grow, including acquiring BN Ranch, one of its beef suppliers.Going public does not mean that Blue Apron\u2019s management is intent on giving up control of the company. The start-up will have three classes of stock: Class A shares that will be sold to the public and will carry one vote per share; Class B shares, which the founders and early investors own, which carry 10 votes per share; and Class C shares, which come with no voting rights and will be used for purposes like acquisitions.As of now, the company\u2019s biggest shareholders are Matthew B. Salzberg and Ilia M. Papas, the founders, who together own just under 40 percent of the class B shares, and the venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners and First Round Capital.Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Barclays are leading on the offering.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Charter, Comcast and Sprint?", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byThe cable companies are considering taking a stake in Sprint to invest in its network. In exchange, they would get favorable terms to offer wireless services.There is also a possibility that the cable companies will buy Sprint (although The Wall Street Journal said that was much less likely).A deal with Sprint could help them retain customers by adding mobile phone services to their bundles.We\u2019ve seen them bend the knees of even the biggest corporate titans in the United States. Now, activist investors may be looking to throw their weight around overseas.Other notable examples:\u2022 Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners pushed for changes at Danone, the French multinational that owns Evian and various yogurt brands.What\u2019s the attraction?There is plenty of competition in the United States, and European countries sometimes lack the sort of defenses that American companies can use against activists.For example, Swiss corporate law could help Mr. Loeb get someone on the board at Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 in Switzerland, shareholders elect each member of the board individually, so if Mr. Loeb chose to nominate a new member and they received a majority of the vote, that candidate would be added without contest.Still, American activists have mixed records abroad.And then there is the tricky issue of other shareholders being suspicious of what they might see as American interlopers. Many companies in Europe and Asia have one large shareholder that is either a family or the government.Still, Nestl\u00e9 investors seemed to like Mr. Loeb\u2019s effort \u2014 his letter sent shares up on Monday.On a call with analysts in April, Mr. Schneider said that he had been encouraged by support in investor meetings, but noted, \u201cWe do understand from these meetings that you want to see meaningful steps toward improved combinations of growth rates and margins.\u201dAnd any changes that Mr. Schneider makes would have to pass muster with Paul Bulcke, his predecessor and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chairman. A new, external chairman would make it easier to make the changes that Mr. Loeb\u2019s hedge fund has called for.Big investors like to tout their credentials when it comes to environmental, social and governance issues, telling companies that they need to show their responsible stewardship in those categories to gain their favor.But many on Wall Street remain skeptical about the value of such policies.So a new study that aims to quantify and correlate stock performance with so-called E.S.G. factors is generating chatter among the investor class.The good news: Investors who look at these metrics are less likely to buy shares in companies with volatile stocks or that are headed toward bankruptcy.But E.S.G. considerations are not enough to help a stock outperform its peers.In fact, \u201cE.S.G. was generally a weak signal of future returns,\u201d according to the study. Companies that rated the best on E.S.G. issues performed better, on average, but the study said that \u201cthis performance was not consistent, and was very similar to the performance of large versus small companies.\u201dIt seems it will take more evidence \u2014 and perhaps more time \u2014 to prove itself as an investment thesis.Advertisement"}
