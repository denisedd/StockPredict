{"Headline": "Cyberattack Hits Ukraine Then Spreads Internationally", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byIn Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, A.T.M.s stopped working. About 80 miles away, workers were forced to manually monitor radiation at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant when their computers failed. And tech managers at companies around the world \u2014 from Maersk, the Danish shipping conglomerate, to Merck, the drug giant in the United States \u2014 were scrambling to respond. Even an Australian factory for the chocolate giant Cadbury was affected.The outbreak was the latest and perhaps the most sophisticated in a series of attacks making use of dozens of hacking tools that were stolen from the National Security Agency and leaked online in April by a group called the Shadow Brokers.The National Security Agency has not acknowledged its tools were used in WannaCry or other attacks. But computer security specialists are demanding that the agency help the rest of the world defend against the weapons it created.\u201cJust because you roll out a patch doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be put in place quickly,\u201d said Carl Herberger, vice president for security at Radware. \u201cThe more bureaucratic an organization is, the higher chance it won\u2019t have updated its software.\u201dBecause the ransomware used at least two other ways to spread on Tuesday \u2014 including stealing victims\u2019 credentials \u2014 even those who used the Microsoft patch could be vulnerable and potential targets for later attacks, according to researchers at F-Secure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm, and others.A Microsoft spokesman said the company\u2019s latest antivirus software should protect against the attack.The Ukrainian government said several of its ministries, local banks and metro systems had been affected. A number of other European companies, including Rosneft, the Russian energy giant; Saint-Gobain, the French construction materials company; and WPP, the British advertising agency, also said they had been targeted.Ukrainian officials pointed a finger at Russia on Tuesday, although Russian companies were also affected. Home Credit bank, one of Russia\u2019s top 50 lenders, was paralyzed, with all of its offices closed, according to the RBC news website. The attack also affected Evraz, a steel manufacturing and mining company that employs about 80,000 people, the RBC website reported.In the United States, the multinational law firm DLA Piper also reported being hit. Hospitals in Pennsylvania were being forced to cancel operations after the attack hit computers at Heritage Valley Health Systems, a Pennsylvania health care provider, and its hospitals in Beaver and Sewickley, Penn., and satellite locations across the state.Qantas Airways\u2019 booking system failed for a time on Tuesday, but the company said the breakdown was due to an unrelated hardware issue.The Australian government has urged companies to install security updates and isolate any infected computers from their networks.\u201cThis ransomware attack is a wake-up call to all Australian businesses to regularly back up their data and install the latest security patches,\u201d said Dan Tehan, the cybersecurity minister. \u201cWe are aware of the situation and monitoring it closely.\u201dA National Security Agency spokesman referred questions about the attack to the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security is monitoring reports of cyberattacks affecting multiple global entities and is coordinating with our international and domestic cyber partners,\u201d Scott McConnell, a department spokesman, said in a statement.Computer specialists said the ransomware was very similar to a virus that emerged last year called Petya. Petya means \u201cLittle Peter,\u201d in Russian, leading some to speculate the name referred to Sergei Prokofiev\u2019s 1936 symphony \u201cPeter and the Wolf,\u201d about a boy who captures a wolf.That means anyone could launch the ransomware with the click of a button, encrypt someone\u2019s systems and demand a ransom to unlock it. If the victim pays, the authors of the Petya ransomware, who call themselves Janus Cybercrime Solutions, get a cut of the payment.That distribution method means that pinning down the people responsible for Tuesday\u2019s attack could be difficult.The attack is \u201can improved and more lethal version of WannaCry,\u201d said Matthieu Suiche, a security researcher who helped contain the spread of the WannaCry ransomware when he created a kill switch that stopped the attacks.In just the last seven days, Mr. Suiche noted, WannaCry had tried to hit an additional 80,000 organizations but was prevented from executing attack code because of the kill switch. Petya does not have a kill switch.The hackers behind Petya demanded $300 worth of the cybercurrency Bitcoin to unlock victims\u2019 machines. By Tuesday afternoon, online records showed that 30 victims had paid the ransom, although it was not clear whether they had regained access to their files. Other victims may be out of luck, after Posteo, the German email service provider, shut down the hackers\u2019 email account.In Ukraine, people turned up at post offices, A.T.M.s and airports to find blank computer screens, or signs about closures. At Kiev\u2019s central post office, a few bewildered customers milled about, holding parcels and letters, looking at a sign that said, \u201cClosed for technical reasons.\u201dThe hackers compromised Ukrainian accounting software mandated to be used in various industries in the country, including government agencies and banks, according to researchers at Cisco Talos, the security division of the computer networking company. That allowed them to unleash their ransomware when the software, which is also used in other countries, was updated.The ransomware spread for five days across Ukraine, and around the world, before activating Tuesday evening.\u201cIf I had to guess, I would think this was done to send a political message,\u201d said Craig Williams, the senior technical researcher at Talos.One Kiev resident, Tetiana Vasylieva, was forced to borrow money from a relative after failing to withdraw money at four automated teller machines. At one A.T.M. in Kiev belonging to the Ukrainian branch of the Austrian bank Raiffeisen, a message on the screen said the machine was not functioning.Ukraine\u2019s Infrastructure Ministry, the postal service, the national railway company, and one of the country\u2019s largest communications companies, Ukrtelecom, had been affected, Volodymyr Omelyan, the country\u2019s infrastructure minister, said in a Facebook post.Officials for the metro system in Kiev said card payments could not be accepted. The national power grid company Kievenergo had to switch off all of its computers, but the situation was under control, according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. Metro Group, a German company that runs wholesale food stores, said its operations in Ukraine had been affected.At the Chernobyl plant, the computers affected by the attack collected data on radiation levels and were not connected to industrial systems at the site, where, although all reactors have been decommissioned, huge volumes of radioactive waste remain. Operators said radiation monitoring was being done manually.Cybersecurity researchers questioned whether collecting ransom was the true objective of the attack.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that this attack could have been a smoke screen,\u201d said Justin Harvey, the managing director of global incident response at Accenture Security. \u201cIf you are an evildoer and you wanted to cause mayhem, why wouldn\u2019t you try to first mask it as something else?\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the occupation of Justin Harvey. He is the managing director of global incident response at Accenture Security, not the chief security officer for the Fidelis cybersecurity company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Cyberattack Was Meant to Paralyze, not Profit, Evidence Shows", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The day started like most for Roman N. Klimenko, an accountant in Kiev who had just settled in at his desk, typing at a computer keyboard and drinking coffee. He was unaware that concealed within his tax preparation software lurked a ticking bomb.Both had the appearance of hacker blackmail assaults known as ransomware attacks: screens of infected computers warn users their data will be destroyed unless ransoms are paid.But in Ukraine\u2019s case, a more sinister motive \u2014 paralysis of the country\u2019s vital computer systems \u2014 may have been at work, cybersecurity experts said on Wednesday. And many Ukrainians cast their suspicions on Russia.Cybersecurity experts based their reasoning partly on having identified the group of Ukrainian users who were initially and improbably targeted: tax accountants.All are required by law to use a tax preparation software such as that made by a Ukrainian company, M.E.Doc. The software that runs on Microsoft Windows-based computers was recently updated. Microsoft issued a statement on Wednesday saying it \u201cnow has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate M.E.Doc updater process.\u201dCybersecurity experts said that whoever launched the assault \u2014 on the eve of a holiday celebrating Ukrainian independence \u2014 must have known that M.E.Doc software, which is integrated into Ukrainian government computers, was their gateway.\u201cYou don\u2019t hit the day before Constitution Day for no reason,\u201d said Craig Williams, the senior technical researcher with the Talos division of Cisco, the American technology company, which helped pinpoint the origin of the Tuesday attack.Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and computer operations at Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, the country\u2019s equivalent to the National Security Agency, said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the money.\u201d\u201cThis attack is about disabling how large companies and governments can operate,\u201d he added. \u201cYou get a double whammy of the initial cyberattack and then organizations being forced to shut down their operations.\u201dFor Mr. Klimenko, the software update seemed to go fine \u2014 until hours later. \u201cThe screen became red,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cA warning appeared, and everything on the hard drive was scrambled.\u201dMr. Klimenko quickly realized he had lost all past-year filings, a catastrophe for an accountant. \u201cNow I cannot confirm that I filed,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t understand what happened.\u201dYet to be determined is the source of the virus. But Russia was seen as the prime suspect because it has been engaged in overt and covert warfare with Ukraine since the 2014 revolution that deposed a Kremlin-friendly government. A Russian role has yet to be proven and may never be. Nevertheless, analysts said on Wednesday that if the attackers\u2019 object was to sow chaos at the highest levels in Ukraine, M.E.Doc provided an ideal way. Its software is not only widely installed at government agencies and banks, but is mandatory at many Ukrainian businesses and government agencies.M.E.Doc said in a statement that it could not confirm whether the virus had been distributed through the update, but that it was \u201ccooperating with Ukraine\u2019s cyberpolice on the investigation.\u201dIn another indication that Ukraine was a prime target, the national police said on Wednesday that more than 1,500 companies had filed complaints or appealed for help because of computer intrusions. That was far more than in other countries, although Russia seemed to be the second-most widely affected.While analysts remained cautious about assigning blame, there was little reticence in official circles in Ukraine, particularly as it became clear that the country was the primary target. The timing was an especially clear sign of political intent, they said.Adding to their suspicions, just a few hours before the computer strike, a Ukrainian military intelligence officer, Maksim Shapoval, was killed by a car bomb in Kiev. It was the latest in a string of assassinations of opponents and critics of Russia in the Ukrainian capital.\u201cWar in cyberspace, seeding fear and horror among millions of personal computer users, and inflicting direct material damage from destabilizing the work of businesses and the state, is just one part of the hybrid war of the Russian empire against Ukraine,\u201d Anton Gerashenko, a member of Parliament, wrote on Facebook. The assassination of Mr. Shapoval is another, he wrote. Mr. Gerashenko called the spread of the virus the \u201cmost massive computer attack in the history of Ukraine.\u201d He said it was only \u201cmasked as an effort to extort money from computer users,\u201d with the real goal economic disruption.The timing of the attack was suspect in another way, coming after a rare stretch of upbeat news in Ukraine. Last week, the European Union waived visa requirements for Ukrainians, at least those few fortunate enough to have the means to travel. That was a euphoric moment for many Ukrainians, some of whom could be seen celebrating with raised fists after gliding through immigration lanes in European airports.President Petro O. Poroshenko met in Washington with President Trump, undermining what politicians here say is an overarching Russian goal of weakening Ukraine by highlighting the incompetence and corruption of the government.The attack also comes in the context of a long-running trade war between Russia and Ukraine, on the sidelines of the actual shooting war in eastern Ukraine between the government and Russian-backed separatists.In recent months, the authorities in Kiev have banned Russian software imports and blocked coal shipments from areas under rebel control. The coal embargo cut off a vital financial lifeline in the east, forcing Russia to take some of the coal.The police have established a computer headquarters with the domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., and Cisco to analyze the attack in hopes of tying it to Russia. Though cybersecurity experts have not linked the malware to any particular state or criminal group, a Russian computer attack targeting Ukraine\u2019s economy would be consistent with the recent economic skirmishing, analysts say.\u201cIf you look at Ukrainian cyberspace, M.E.Doc is an excellent carrier for a virus,\u201d Ivan Lozowy, director of the Institute of Statehood and Democracy, said in a telephone interview. The software is used by businesses large and small, and it can transmit a virus to government computers, where it is designed to file returns. \u201cThe Russians are interested in Ukraine having as many problems as possible,\u201d he said.Mark Scott contributed reporting from Rome, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dissecting Marissa Mayer\u2019s $900,000-a-Week Yahoo Paycheck", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byIt will also conclude the remarkable five-year run of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who was paid nearly a quarter of a billion dollars \u2014 a generous sum even by Silicon Valley\u2019s lofty standards \u2014 while presiding over the company\u2019s continued decline.The company ended up so weakened that its board had little choice but to sell.\u201cEveryone acknowledges that it was a difficult situation to come into,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research who has studied Yahoo for years. \u201cBut the company was not run well under her tenure.\u201dSo why did Ms. Mayer receive more than $900,000 a week? The answer, like so many things about Yahoo, is surprisingly complicated. It is rooted partly in the never-lose structure of modern executive compensation packages, but also in two farsighted investments made long ago by one of Yahoo\u2019s founders, Jerry Yang.Ms. Mayer\u2019s pay was mostly in stock and stock options, and she reaped the rewards alongside the other stockholders.\u201cThe only sign you can point to when evaluating a company over a long period of time is how shareholders have done in the exchange,\u201d said David Wise, who heads North American sales at Korn Ferry Hay Group, a firm that advises companies on executive pay packages. \u201cOver the last five years, Yahoo shareholders couldn\u2019t have done a lot better than this.\u201dMore than most chief executives, Ms. Mayer was working for those shareholders.She was essentially hired by one hedge-fund manager, Daniel S. Loeb, who got her predecessor fired and won three seats on Yahoo\u2019s board in 2012. Mr. Loeb was particularly interested in finding a way to unlock the value of Yahoo\u2019s stake in Alibaba, which was already shaping up to be one of China\u2019s leading internet companies. He pushed the board to recruit a star like Ms. Mayer to get people excited about a company that had been stumbling for years.When Ms. Mayer\u2019s early efforts to turn around Yahoo\u2019s business and spin off the Alibaba shares failed to bear fruit, another hedge fund manager, Jeffrey C. Smith of Starboard Value, led a campaign to push for her ouster. Mr. Smith eventually garnered four board seats so he could keep the pressure on.Yahoo declined to comment for this article, citing this coming Thursday\u2019s shareholder vote to approve the Verizon deal. Ms. Mayer and the board chairman, Maynard Webb, who approved her pay packages, also declined interview requests. So did Mr. Smith.\u201cShe was an attractive, high-visibility C.E.O. trying to bring some excitement and glamour to Yahoo,\u201d said Martha Josephson, a senior partner at the recruiting firm Egon Zehnder, who helped Ms. Mayer find several of her top executives. \u201cAs hard as the job was, she didn\u2019t get a break. If she were an ugly man, she\u2019d be a hero.\u201dOn July 16, 2012, the day she was hired, Yahoo\u2019s share price was $15.65. On Friday, it closed at $50.60. The stock\u2019s performance has topped other venerable tech companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco Systems, and matched the gains of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Yahoo\u2019s most direct competitor.As Yahoo shareholders profited, so did Ms. Mayer. By the time the deal closes, she will have made about $239 million, based on Friday\u2019s share price, according to calculations by Equilar, a provider of executive compensation data.To lure Ms. Mayer from Google and compensate her for options she forfeited there, Yahoo\u2019s board offered her a lucrative employment agreement. She initially received restricted stock worth $35 million and stock options worth $21 million, based on 2012 stock prices for Yahoo, along with a cash salary and bonus. Although she gave up a portion of those stock grants after failing to meet performance targets, the rise in Yahoo\u2019s share price more than offset the losses. She received further stock grants in later years, adding to her overall compensation.Yet most of Ms. Mayer\u2019s paycheck ultimately came from the gains in Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments, over which she had little control. Thanks to an investment made in 2005, Yahoo had a 24 percent stake in Alibaba, which today is China\u2019s leading e-commerce company.When Alibaba first sold shares to the public in 2014, Yahoo sold 140 million shares in the offering. It hung on to 384 million shares, which are now worth about $48 billion.Yahoo also owns about 36 percent of Yahoo Japan, now worth about $9 billion, that it received as part of a deal struck in 1996, shortly after Yahoo was founded.The surging value of those investments \u2014 not any brilliant business moves by Ms. Mayer \u2014 is why Yahoo\u2019s shares went up. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone coming into an oil company, and all of a sudden oil prices go up and the stock goes up,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, the director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cWas the return based on what she did?\u201dStill, managing those investments was a key reason that Yahoo\u2019s board hired Ms. Mayer. Mr. Loeb had accused Yahoo\u2019s previous leaders of mishandling both their core business and the Alibaba relationship. When he and two allies gained seats on the board in 2012, they wanted a new chief executive who would fix both problems.Ms. Mayer delegated the Alibaba issue, hiring an experienced dealmaker, Jacqueline Reses, to be the company\u2019s principal liaison to Alibaba and its leaders, Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai. Ms. Reses helped the Chinese company navigate its initial public offering. She also renegotiated an agreement, struck just before Ms. Mayer arrived, that would have forced Yahoo to sell an additional 122 million shares in the offering. Those extra shares are now worth $15 billion.Ms. Mayer, meanwhile, focused on turning around Yahoo\u2019s internet business. It had missed the mobile revolution and was experiencing steady declines in its display and search advertising. There, her record is decidedly mixed.Yahoo had no real strategy for reaching customers on mobile devices when she arrived \u2014 a sure route to obsolescence as smartphones became the principal internet device for most people.Through a combination of acquisitions and hiring, she vastly expanded Yahoo\u2019s mobile team, which initially produced some buzzy hits like the Yahoo Weather app and Yahoo News Digest, along with more prosaic updates of core Yahoo features like fantasy sports and email. Yet Ms. Mayer largely failed in her quest to make Yahoo a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for more users in online video, search and messaging.Yahoo did acquire advertising technology and built a new ad system from scratch, but marketers never embraced it.Yahoo\u2019s board recognized Ms. Mayer\u2019s failure to meet business targets and docked her bonuses and stock awards in four of the five years she was in charge. But under terms of her original employment agreement, it also granted her new shares annually, easing the sting.Given those missteps, was Ms. Mayer overpaid?\u201cFor the existing amount of compensation, could Yahoo shareholders have done better?\u201d Mr. Wieser of Pivotal Research said. \u201cOr for the same outcome, could they have paid less? Ultimately it\u2019s a hard question to answer.\u201dPeter Monaco, who was a vice president for engineering at Yahoo for three years before leaving for Facebook last September, said Ms. Mayer does not get enough credit for transforming Yahoo\u2019s culture. \u201cShe eliminated the dead wood, drove out the politics, put in place compensation policies that rewarded high achievers and energized people to create great products again,\u201d he said.Arguably, Yahoo was unfixable. The company\u2019s DNA and technology were built around its original identity as a web portal \u2014 a powerful position in the early 2000s but increasingly outmoded in the mobile era, as apps and phone platforms like iOS and Android became the gateways to the internet.\u201cGiven the hand she was dealt, I doubt anyone could have done a better job transforming the culture and making Yahoo healthy again,\u201d Mr. Monaco said.Unlike Kilimanjaro, though, the Yahoo challenge proved insurmountable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delphi, the Auto Parts Supplier, Embarks on a High-Tech Overhaul", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byBitsTROY, Mich. \u2014 As automakers rush to catch up to Silicon Valley in the race to create the superintelligent, self-driving cars of the future, one old-line parts manufacturer is hoping to win by switching sides.Delphi Automotive has a corporate background that is as greasy and grimy as the steering gears it once produced.It began as the parts arm of General Motors, and years ago operated dozens of unionized plants that churned out the type of mechanical auto components that put venture capitalists to sleep: air-conditioners, brakes, heaters and radios.Its complicated corporate history includes years of downsizing and a long, messy reorganization in bankruptcy court.Cars produced today include dozens of computer chips along with cameras, radar, millions of lines of software and wireless communications links. Future vehicles will have all that and more, said Kevin P. Clark, Delphi\u2019s chief executive.Delphi, he added, hopes to be the supplier of networking components \u2014 like wiring, software and intelligent connectors \u2014 that link all those complex systems and enable them to work together under the hood.\u201cIt\u2019s the intelligent architecture that allows all the advanced safety systems, all the autonomous driving software, all the infotainment software to operate effectively,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Cisco \u201cis a pretty good analogy for us,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner who tracks the development of connected and self-driving cars, said Delphi is attempting the most extensive transformation by an old-line automotive company that he has run across. \u201cThey are the standard-bearer for this,\u201d he said.Its success is by no means assured. Technology shifts quickly, and the company has far more experience in the slower-paced, low-risk approach of the traditional auto industry, where innovations are engineered and tested for years before they are introduced. And Delphi\u2019s investments in start-ups may not pan out.Delphi hopes to create a new business that can gather vast amounts of data from vehicles \u2014 about how and where they go, how they\u2019re driven and how they\u2019re running. The company then envisions selling insights drawn from the data trove to automakers, insurance companies and possibly even advertisers.A driver who frequently drives to Starbucks locations, for example, could be targeted with Starbucks coupons via email or text. Someone whose data shows a pattern of gentle driving could be offered lower insurance rates, said David Ploucha, the president and co-founder of Control-Tec, a start-up Delphi acquired for $124 million as part of this data business strategy.It\u2019s a business model unlike anything the auto industry has ever seen. It\u2019s similar to what Google does by targeting ads to users based on terms they have searched, or how Facebook tailors ads and news posts based on what a member has \u201cliked\u201d on the social networking site.\u201cThe idea is to influence how people spend money in relation to their vehicle,\u201d Mr. Ploucha said.Mr. Clark said he was convinced such data services will evolve into a multibillion-dollar industry, though it may be years before this vision is confirmed.The boldness of Delphi\u2019s plan underscores how dramatic technological changes are loosening the dominant role traditional carmakers have in the auto industry, while opening opportunities for new players.Already, Tesla has jumped ahead in battery-powered cars, and in distributing software updates to its cars over the air, the same way iPhones receive new operating systems. Both Tesla and Google are ahead of many, if not most, automakers in self-driving technology. Uber, the ride-hailing company, is trying to press ahead in autonomous cars, too.Danny Shapiro, a senior executive at Nvidia, a chip maker that provides some of the powerful processors used by Tesla, Audi and many other automakers, said he would not be surprised to see some reordering of the auto industry in the next five to 10 years. \u201cI do believe there will be a rise and fall for some players,\u201d he said.Tesla, thanks to its rising stock, recently passed both Ford and G.M. in terms of market value.Mr. Clark, the Delphi chief executive, hopes his company will be one of the rising stars. For most of the last 20 years, it has been in a slow decline. Delphi was created to take over all the parts businesses G.M. no longer wanted in-house.It was spun off as a stand-alone company in 1999. Six years later, it filed for bankruptcy, slammed by high labor costs and the razor-thin margins of making low-tech commodity parts.Its Chapter 11 reorganization lasted four years, and resulted in plant closings and the elimination of tens of thousands of factory jobs. The company\u2019s steering systems business was sold to a Chinese investor. The remaining company kept operations in automotive electronics and engine technologies such as fuel injectors and diesel components.Over the last few years, as autonomous driving technology began developing rapidly, Mr. Clark saw an opportunity to take Delphi in a new direction.To preserve Control-Tec\u2019s freewheeling start-up culture, Delphi is allowing it to operate largely as an independent company. That includes one lounge where its engineers build Lego cars and occasionally play board games, and another where they share homemade beers.\u201cThe worst thing we could do is stifle the creativity, the energy they have,\u201d Mr. Clark said.This year, Delphi went further, acquiring a start-up with technology for wirelessly transferring data and software to and from vehicles, and investing $15 million in another Israeli company, Otonomo, which specializes in organizing masses of data into forms that automakers and others will pay for. These two investments, along with Control-Tec, make up the foundation of the data business Mr. Clark thinks Delphi can create.Then in May, Mr. Clark announced a final break with the traditional automotive industry. Delphi\u2019s powertrain business, which makes fuel injectors and diesel technology, will be spun off as a separate company by the first quarter of next year.The split will leave behind a new high-tech Delphi, known inside the company for now as \u201cRemain Co.\u201d \u201cHow we get there from here, we\u2019re all doing a lot to figure that out,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated when Delphi will spin off its powertrain business into a separate company. It will be by the first quarter of next year, not the end of this year.Advertisement"}
