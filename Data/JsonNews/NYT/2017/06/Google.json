{"Headline": "Hunting the Manosphere", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byNotebookIn the final days of May, after police in Portland, Ore., reported that Jeremy Joseph Christian stabbed three men on a train, killing two of them, an unusual theory as to why the attack occurred emerged in certain parts of the internet. Mainstream commentators had already pointed to Christian\u2019s alt-right flavored racism, which seemed obvious enough; the victims, after all, had been defending two Muslim women from his Islamophobic abuse, according to the police. Others raised the possibility that Christian was mentally unstable. But according to this new theory, the primary blame lay not with Christian at all and instead with an ideology internalized by the victims.\u201cTwo good men killed by chivalry,\u201d tweeted Paul Elam, a notorious figure in the field of \u201cmen\u2019s rights activism.\u201d \u201cLet this be a lesson to your sons.\u201d In follow-up tweets, Elam elaborated: If the victims had not been culturally conditioned to risk their lives on women\u2019s behalf, they would still be alive. Therefore, while Christian was heading to trial, the real perpetrator was America\u2019s anti-male status quo.I don\u2019t follow Elam on Twitter. I came across his theory only thanks to the blog We Hunted the Mammoth, run by a 51-year-old Chicagoan named David Futrelle. In a post called \u201cKilled by Chivalry: Everything Wrong With the Men\u2019s Right\u2019s Movement in One Tweet,\u201d Futrelle mockingly summarized Elam\u2019s hypotheses and then went on to argue \u2014 making heavy reference to Elam\u2019s writing over the years \u2014 that this \u201ckiller chivalry\u201d argument epitomized a general disdain in the men\u2019s rights movement not only for women but for the very notions of altruism and empathy.Over the course of seven years spent running We Hunted the Mammoth, Futrelle has made himself an expert on the \u201cmanosphere\u201d: the amorphous, fractious constellation of online men\u2019s groups united in their belief that feminism is ruining the world. Most days, he trawls a constantly-updated list of sites he hates (including Elam\u2019s \u201cA Voice for Men\u201d), seeking out arguments he finds repulsive, baffling and, he admits, fascinating to watch play out in real time. Clicking through his list, he reads post after post, charting the themes and preoccupations of the day, the latest catchphrases and memes, the shifting alliances and disputes.\u201cI plunge myself into this endlessly swirling caldron, and I see what\u2019s new,\u201d Futrelle told me recently. When he began the site in 2010, it was an after-work hobby. Since 2014, it has become a full-time enterprise, bankrolled by advertising revenue and PayPal donations from his readers. Most of those readers, Futrelle says, are women, for whom the site\u2019s lively discussion threads offer a place they can talk (and laugh and cry and yell) about internet misogyny without being harassed on all sides by internet misogynists. The discussion under \u201cKilled by Chivalry\u201d quickly stretched to over 700 comments.Futrelle\u2019s journey toward his idiosyncratic career began in the late 2000s, when he kept finding himself in long, drawn-out Reddit arguments with self-described men\u2019s rights activists (M.R.A.s, in manosphere shorthand). At first he was shocked to discover that M.R.A.s even existed \u2014 that there really was, in his words, \u201ca group of guys who saw men as America\u2019s most oppressed class.\u201d Some of these men, he realized early on, were hardened misogynists or trolls: They argued that only men should be allowed to vote, or they gleefully condoned the use of violence to keep women in their proper place. But some of the less extreme posters reminded Futrelle uncomfortably of his younger self. Looking back on his high-school years, he saw himself as under the sway of some of the same flawed assumptions prevalent among the M.R.A.s.\u201cLike the \u2018nice guy\u2019 fallacy,\u201d he told me, referring to the implicit belief that being persistently \u201cnice\u201d to a woman could lead to her owing you sex. \u201cIt\u2019s rapey and gross. But it\u2019s very widespread. And I had a little bit of it, back then.\u201d Challenging those notions online sometimes felt, for Futrelle, like a form of penance; whether he was changing minds or not, he felt compelled to keep arguing.Futrelle started his own site in 2010, originally under the goofy name Man Boobz, aiming to build a stand-alone repository of careful anti-M.R.A. analysis. Perhaps, he speculated, his site could become a web destination that a confused young man might conceivably stumble upon while Googling for answers. \u201cThat does happen, now and then,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll get an email saying, you know, \u2018Thanks, I was going down a bad path.\u2019 \u201d At first, almost all of his readers were committed M.R.A.s; they had followed him for Reddit so they could leave argumentative comments under whatever he wrote about them. But within just a few months, Futrelle was attracting a significant female audience: women eager to learn what men were getting up to online but put off by the prospect of trudging through the manosphere themselves.\u201cHe\u2019s basically our filter for looking at an eclipse,\u201d said Jaclyn Friedman, a feminist writer and activist who relied on Futrelle and his site while assembling an early guide to the manosphere for The American Prospect, in 2013. As Friedman\u2019s work became more visible, she was increasingly mentioned in the manosphere or contacted by its participants, occasionally in posts or emails suggesting she deserved to be raped or killed; Futrelle, she says, would help her sift through the threats, using his experience to make judgments about which were worth taking seriously.In We Hunted the Mammoth\u2019s early years, Futrelle assumed the communities he was scrutinizing were essentially fringe movements with a fixed and fairly low limit to their growth. This changed in 2014 with GamerGate, a snowballing manosphere-born campaign of that directed a large volume of misogynistic harassment who called out sexism in the world of video games. \u201cThe old-school M.R.A.s mostly sat GamerGate out,\u201d Futrelle said. \u201cThey thought video games were for wusses.\u201d But the movement rallied a new coalition of online misogynists, not just gamers but pranksters from message boards like 4chan and 8chan and \u201cedgy\u201d conservatives like those reading Breitbart News, which, sensing an opportunity to expand its audience, hitched its wagon to GamerGate early on. (The notorious former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos was a particularly vocal evangelist for the movement.)In the eyes of the post-Gamergate manosphere, Futrelle is the prime example of a S.J.W. (social-justice warrior) trying to \u201cwhite knight\u201d his way to approval by the feminists and liberals who dominate American cultural discourse. On the site Encyclopedia Dramatica, a Wikipedia-style compendium of articles written from a broadly pro-manosphere perspective, the entry for \u201cDavid Futrelle\u201d (\u201coccasionally referred to as FATrelle or \u201cFatrolle\u201d) cherry-picks quotes from Futrelle\u2019s writing in hopes of characterizing him as an apologist for pedophilia, torture porn and child prostitution. Another site, Demagogue, apes the visual style of We Hunted the Mammoth almost to a tee, attempting to target Futrelle with the same zeal he targets them.\u201cIn the long run, David Futrelle\u2019s been a big boost to my career,\u201d says Elam, one of Futrelle\u2019s most frequent individual targets. \u201cEventually he sent all kinds of people to my website that figured out they weren\u2019t exactly getting the straight picture from him. Some of these people have not only stayed and started reading the site, they\u2019ve become financial supporters.\u201d Futrelle, Elam says, \u201cclaims to mock misogyny, but what he really does, in essence, is he mocks the pain of men that are really going through hard times. He might as well be on a cancer unit making fun of people for being sick.\u201dMike Cernovich, a prominent online conspiracy theorist, is another frequent subject of We Hunted the Mammoth posts. By email, Cernovich suggested that Futrelle intentionally exaggerated the size of his readership by creating \u201csock puppets\u201d (fake users) to write comments under his own posts. \u201cWhen I Google myself, his stuff shows up,\u201d Cernovich added. \u201cI don\u2019t read the blogs, as they are predictable and boring.\u201dThe posts themselves often follow a template not dissimilar from the one used by the John Olivers and Seth Meyerses of the world. Some recent manosphere rant or manifesto is held up for inspection and then broken down into snippets and interspersed with Futrelle\u2019s commentary, designed to bring the absurdities of the target into view. It would be fair to criticize the site as an echo chamber: a place where almost everyone agrees that online misogyny is rampant and congratulates themselves for knowing so, taking what pleasure they can in laughing at their enemies\u2019 latest mutterings. Over the years, while poring through Futrelle\u2019s posts for help with magazine articles about the manosphere, I have wondered what the site would look like, and what it might accomplish, if it made more of an effort, alongside its fact-finding and analysis, to speak directly to manosphere denizens. But Futrelle believes that direct engagement simply isn\u2019t part of his mission. \u201cPut bluntly, this blog isn\u2019t for you,\u201d he wrote in a 2010 post directed to the M.R.A. readers still hanging on after following his migration from Reddit. \u201cIt\u2019s for all the people in the world who aren\u2019t you.\u201dAs Donald Trump blustered his way to the presidency, Futrelle watched the manosphere thrill to the rule-breaking candidate as an avatar of their collective worldview: an old-school misogynist unshackled by politically correct strictures; a self-proclaimed anti-elite outsider but also a boastful \u201calpha\u201d male who unapologetically did what he wanted with the political establishment, much like, it was gleefully pointed out, a powerful pickup artist or \u201cseduction artist\u201d did what he wanted with unsuspecting women.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate the extent to which, for a lot of these guys, Trump is a wet dream come true,\u201d Futrelle said. Increasingly, staying on top of his beat has meant adding more destinations to his daily roster, following his manosphere subjects as they branched out to a new generation of racist alt-right stamping grounds and meme-filled neo-Nazi sites like the Daily Stormer, which, as he documented, was now making calculated appeals to a manosphere readership, claiming that all-male neo-Nazi clubs could be hubs for sharing tips and tricks on how to \u201chunt and capture your own women.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant reading,\u201d Futrelle said glumly. \u201cSomething about it still fascinates me, but it\u2019s definitely not pleasant.\u201dPeter C.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Meddlesome Priest", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBy now many people will have googled the words \u201cmeddlesome priest.\u201d The phrase was uttered by James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, during his testimony on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. When he was asked if he took President Trump\u2019s \u201chope\u201d that he would drop the Flynn-Russia investigation \u201cas a directive,\u201d Mr. Comey responded, \u201cYes, yes. It rings in my ears as kind of \u2018Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?\u2019 \u201dThese are the words that King Henry II of England allegedly cried out in 1170, frustrated by the political opposition of Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury. Four royal knights immediately rushed off to Canterbury and murdered the meddlesome priest.Unlike many contemporary references to medieval history, this one is apt. Mr. Comey\u2019s point was that a desire expressed by a powerful leader is tantamount to an order. When Senator James E. Risch, a Republican, noted that the president had merely \u201choped for an outcome,\u201d Mr. Comey replied, \u201cI mean, this is the president of the United States, with me alone, saying \u2018I hope this.\u2019 I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.\u201dKing Henry\u2019s contemporaries likewise assumed that a ruler\u2019s wish constituted a command: Although he denied any intention of inciting murder, Henry was widely held responsible for Becket\u2019s death. The pope issued an order prohibiting Henry from attending church services or participating in the sacraments, and the king was eventually forced to do penance for the violence perpetrated in his name.There are even more instructive parallels. Although the administration offered various reasons for the firing of Mr. Comey, it is clear that Mr. Trump considered his allegiance to F.B.I. protocol over presidential preference to be a form of disloyalty. Likewise, the main issues at stake in 1170 were divided loyalty and institutional independence.Before Becket had been elected archbishop, he had been a close friend and faithful servant to the king. Henry had engineered Becket\u2019s election in the expectation that, as archbishop, Becket would continue to serve royal interests. This was not an unreasonable assumption; for centuries bishops had performed dual roles, acting as temporal as well as spiritual lords. They commanded armies, enforced royal decrees, and took it for granted that the rulers who appointed them could claim their loyalty.It was not until the 1070s that secular control over bishops began to be challenged by a series of reformist popes who sought to free clerics from secular influence and insisted that bishops\u2019 first allegiance was to the church. This goal was rarely fully realized \u2014 kings were generally closer than the pope and more able to dispense both patronage and punishment. But to Henry\u2019s fury, Becket unexpectedly embraced reform, becoming a vigorous defender of church privileges and critic of royal interference. Henry felt intensely betrayed. Becket died not because he was \u201cmeddlesome,\u201d but because, in the king\u2019s view, he was disloyal.No wonder the four knights were so eager to take the hint. Henry\u2019s courtiers may well have feared that if they didn\u2019t make a conspicuous display of loyalty, the king might turn on them next. Treachery was a capital offense.The aftermath of the Becket episode may, moreover, resonate in one final way. Although Henry had longed to get rid of Becket for years, he presumably came to rue the day his words of rage were heeded. In addition to performing humiliating penance, he had to swear obedience to the pope, make a series of concessions to the church and eventually face rebellion. One suspects that Mr. Trump, too, might come to feel the wisdom of the words \u201cbe careful what you wish for.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uncle Sam Wants Your Deep Neural Networks", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is turning to data scientists to improve screening techniques at airports.Although data scientists can apply any technique in building these algorithms, the contest is a way of capitalizing on the progress in a technology called deep neural networks, said the Kaggle founder and chief executive, Anthony Goldbloom. Neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn specific tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Feed millions of cat photographs into a neural network, for instance, and it can learn to recognize a cat.Companies like Google and Facebook use the technology to do things like identify faces in online images, recognize commands spoken into smartphones and translate one language into another. But the possibilities extend well beyond smartphone apps and other online services.Earlier this year, Kaggle ran a $1 million contest to build algorithms capable of identifying signs of lung cancer in CT scans, helping to fuel a larger effort to apply neural networks to health care. Now, the hope is that neural networks can also help automated systems read body scans with greater accuracy, so checkpoint workers can spend less time pulling passengers aside and patting them down.\u201cWe started by trying to figure out what was a dog and what was a cat,\u201d said Goldbloom, referring to the growing community of companies, academics and other researchers working with neural networks. \u201cNow, we\u2019re moving into more serious territory.\u201dJohn W. Halinski, a former deputy administrator at the Transportation Security Administration who now works as a security consultant, welcomed the \u201ccrowdsourcing\u201d idea because it could draw on the skills of any data scientist. This is increasingly important, he said, as airport security consolidates around just a few large corporations.\u201cThere are a lot of people out there that are good at solving difficult problems,\u201d said John Fortune, a program manager in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s science and technology arm.Homeland Security and other organizations are working on ways to improve the technologies used at airport checkpoints, with the T.S.A. set to roll out new CT systems that can automatically identify items hidden in passenger baggage, and at least one company, Smiths Detection, exploring the use of neural networks at security checkpoints.To help data scientists and machine-learning researchers train their algorithms, Homeland Security is supplying more than 1,000 three-dimensional body scans.The department is not sharing scans of the more than two million people screened each day at the nation\u2019s airports. Instead, T.S.A. workers volunteered to help create the data for the contest from scratch, repeatedly walking through a set of test scanners at a laboratory in New Jersey. In some cases, the workers carried concealed items through the scanners, and these images are carefully labeled.By analyzing this data, neural networks and other algorithms can learn to pinpoint concealed items on their own. Jeremy Achin, a founder and the chief executive of the data analysis company DataRobot, said that neural networks were well suited to such a task.But he also warned that the technology could make mistakes and that in some cases it could be vulnerable to bad actors. Research has shown that after analyzing the performance of an image-recognition system driven by a neural network, miscreants could mark or otherwise alter items in ways that fool the system into seeing things that are not there \u2014 or failing to see things that are.For those reasons, the immediate aim is not to build technology that replaces human screeners but to find a way of removing some of the burden from those screeners, Mr. Goldbloom said.But the hope is that this technology and others, over time, will significantly improve this security-checkpoint task and others, including passenger baggage scans, cargo scans and face recognition.\u201cWhen identifying risk items in a piece of luggage or through a body scan, today\u2019s algorithms aren\u2019t bad,\u201d said Anthony Roman, a former commercial pilot who runs the risk-management firm Roman & Associates. \u201cBut false positives will be driven way down. We may in the next 10 to 15 years reach a point where all this is automatic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Needs to Reinvent Itself. It Just Might Be Doing So.", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 One of Apple\u2019s greatest strengths is timing. The company that\u2019s hailed for innovation does not often invent things first \u2014 it didn\u2019t create the first personal computer, the first digital music player or the first smartphone. Instead, Apple reinvents, slipping in and producing something more original than what we used to use.Apple\u2019s version ticks all the Apple-y boxes: It\u2019s very pretty; it\u2019s about twice the price of the Echo; and it has much better sound, including the ability to create a kind of surround sound customized to your room.Yet the reinvention that matters here isn\u2019t about a single device \u2014 it\u2019s larger: The success of HomePod will really depend on whether Apple can reinvent itself.HomePod will be a test of how Apple responds to these difficulties. That\u2019s because for Apple to outdo Amazon in the home assistant game, it will need to prioritize skills that have long been on its back burner \u2014 cloud services and A.I., for instance.But here\u2019s the surprising thing: Apple seems to be up for such reinvention. If you read between the lines at its keynote address on Monday, you would have noticed something. Again and again, like shamans calling on some new and powerful magic, Apple executives invoked the buzzwords of modern computing: \u201cmachine learning,\u201d \u201cdeep learning\u201d and \u201ccomputer vision.\u201dSubtly but unmistakably, they were suggesting a shift. Apple seems to be transforming itself into a new kind of company, one that prioritizes the nerdy technical stuff that will become the foundation of tomorrow\u2019s intelligent machines \u2014 whereas in the past, the company tended to hide this stuff, even if it recognized its importance.In broad strokes, the device seems to do much of what its rivals can. Say, \u201cHey Siri, play me some Carly Rae Jepsen,\u201d and it will belt out perfect Canadian pop. It will also answer questions about the music it\u2019s playing, and, just like the Echo, it can perform a wide variety of other functions \u2014 setting timers, telling you the weather and controlling your smart lights and other home devices.Yet many of these are omissions that you\u2019d expect in a new device, and Apple will most likely add improvements in updates. What will matter most, at first, is how reliably HomePod can perform the basics.If you\u2019re a longtime Siri user, your skepticism is warranted. The best thing about Amazon\u2019s speaker is its reliability: Say something from far away, even in a noisy room, and most of the time it will at least recognize what you asked it. Once you get an idea of the kinds of requests it can handle, Alexa begins to seem like a completely natural interface to computers. It responds so quickly that it starts to seem like a helpful member of the family rather than a computer in a can.Can Siri in HomePod do that? I can\u2019t tell you yet for certain. I got a chance to listen to HomePod \u2014 but not use any of its voice-activated features \u2014 after Apple\u2019s keynote. As the company promised, it does sound much deeper and richer than a Sonos Play 3 or an Amazon Echo, closer to what you might hear in a high-end home stereo system. But the true test for such a device is how it works in real-world conditions, handling the multiplicity of requests that you might think up during a day \u2014 and for now, we have no idea how that might work.Yet I am cautiously optimistic, mainly on the basis of the many other computationally difficult features that Apple showed off on Monday. Many of them are versions of features that rivals like Google have spent years perfecting.For example, Siri will now translate languages for you. Like a true assistant, Siri is also now more predictive \u2014 it aims to spot common computing problems and offer to help. (If it notices that you\u2019ve been chatting about a coming appointment, for instance, it will offer to add it to your calendar.)Best of all, Siri is finally a single unified personality that sits across all of your devices. In the past, Siri on your iPad was different from Siri on your Mac \u2014 one would learn that you\u2019re traveling to Iceland, and the other might never know. Now, similar to other assistants, Siri knows you and can anticipate your interests on whatever device you use.There was more, too. Apple is letting developers create apps that can perform machine learning tasks on its devices. It\u2019s also diving heavily into computer vision. Developers can now create augmented reality features, meaning they can add virtual objects overlaid on images from the real world.If you follow the tech industry you know these are all hot topics that other companies are investing in heavily. Apple is still a laggard, and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to beat Google in an A.I. contest anytime soon.But it doesn\u2019t need to. All Apple has to do is stay competitive \u2014 it\u2019s got to invest just enough in the A.I.-driven future to keep its devices compelling. There\u2019s no mistake, now, that it\u2019s doing so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robocalypse Now? Central Bankers Argue Whether Automation Will Kill Jobs", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported bySINTRA, Portugal \u2014 The rise of robots has long been a topic for sci-fi best sellers and video games and, as of this week, a threat officially taken seriously by central bankers.The bankers are not yet ready to buy into dystopian visions in which robots render humans superfluous. But, at an exclusive gathering at a golf resort near Lisbon, the big minds of monetary policy were seriously discussing the risk that artificial intelligence could eliminate jobs on a scale that would dwarf previous waves of technological change.\u201cThere is no question we are in an era of people asking, \u2018Is the Robocalypse upon us?\u2019\u201d David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told an audience on Tuesday that included Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and dozens of other top central bankers and economists.The discussion occurred as economists were more optimistic than they had been for a decade about growth. Mr. Draghi used the occasion to signal that the European Central Bank is edging closer to the day when it will begin paring measures intended to keep interest rates very low and bolster the economy.But along with the optimism is a fear that the economic expansion might bypass large swaths of the population, in part because a growing number of jobs could be replaced by computers capable of learning \u2014 artificial intelligence.Policy makers and economists conceded that they have not paid enough attention to how much technology has hurt the earning power of some segments of society, or planned to address the concerns of those who have lost out. That has, in part, nourished the political populism that contributed to Britain\u2019s vote a year ago to leave the European Union, and the election of President Trump.In the past, technical advances caused temporary disruptions but ultimately improved living standards, creating new categories of employment along the way. Farm machinery displaced farmworkers but eventually they found better paying jobs, and today their great-grandchildren may design video games.But artificial intelligence threatens broad categories of jobs previously seen as safe from automation, such as legal assistants, corporate auditors and investment managers. Large groups of people could become obsolete, suffering the same fate as plow horses after the invention of the tractor.Central bankers have begun examining the effect of technology on employment because it might help solve several economic quandaries.Why is workers\u2019 share of total earnings declining, even though unemployment is at record lows and corporate profits at record highs? Why is productivity \u2014 the amount that a given worker produces \u2014 stuck in neutral?\u201cThe mere fact that we are organizing this conference here in Sintra testifies to our interest in that discussion,\u201d Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s executive board, said in an interview, referring to the \u201cRobocalypse\u201d debate.Of particular interest to the European Central Bank is why faster economic growth has not caused wages and prices to rise. The central bank has pulled out all the stops to stimulate the eurozone economy, cutting interest rates to zero and even below, while printing money. Four years of growth have led to the creation of 6.4 million jobs. Yet inflation remains well below the bank\u2019s official target of below, but close to, 2 percent.One explanation is that more work is being done by advanced computers, with the rewards flowing to the narrow elite that owns them.Still, among the economists in Sintra there was plenty of skepticism about whether the Robocalypse is nigh.Since the beginning of the industrial age, almost every major technological innovation has led to dire predictions that humans were being permanently replaced by machines.While some kinds of jobs were lost forever, greater efficiency led to more affordable goods and other industries soaked up the excess workers. Few people alive today would want to return to the late 1800s, when 40 percent of Americans worked on farms.Robocalypse advocates underestimate the power of scientific advances to beget more scientific advances, said Joel Mokyr, a professor at Northwestern University who studies the history of economics.\u201cThink about what computers are doing to our ability to discover science,\u201d Professor Mokyr said during a panel discussion, citing computers that can solve equations that have baffled mathematicians for decades. There may be breakthroughs that \u201cwe can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\u201dThere are other explanations for stagnant wages besides technology.Companies in Japan, the United States and Europe are sitting on hoards of cash, doling out the money to shareholders rather than investing in new buildings, equipment or innovative products. Just why is another topic of debate.Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google \u2014 whose self-driving technology may someday make taxi drivers unnecessary \u2014 said that the plunging cost of information technology \u201chas virtually eliminated the fixed cost of entering a business.\u201d Companies can rent software and computing power over the internet.And flat wages reflect the large number of women who have entered the work force in recent decades as well as the post World War II baby boom, Mr. Varian said, adding that those trends have run their course. \u201cWe are going to see a higher share going to labor,\u201d he said.Yet already, disruptions caused by technology help account for rampant pessimism among working-class and middle-class people across the developed world.Mr. Bernanke referred to polls showing that about twice as many Americans say the United States is on the wrong track than say the country is moving in the right direction.As a result, \u201clast November Americans elected as president a candidate with a dystopian view of the economy,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said.Mr. Autor, co-author of the Robocalypse paper, concluded that it was too early to say that robots are coming for people\u2019s jobs. But it could still happen in the future.\u201cI say not Robocalypse now,\u201d Mr. Autor said, \u201cperhaps Robocalypse later.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Fine by End of August", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "Supported byEuropean antitrust officials are preparing to hit Google with a potentially record fine by the end of August over some of the Silicon Valley giant\u2019s search services, according to two people with direct knowledge of the case.As well as the fine, European officials could also force Google to alter how it operates in the region, and potentially elsewhere, to give rivals a greater ability to compete.European officials claim that the company favored many of its own digital services, including search and online maps, over those of rivals. Google has denied any wrongdoing.A spokeswoman for the European Union\u2019s executive arm, the European Commission, declined to comment. Representatives for Google were not immediately available for comment.Here\u2019s what you need to know about Google\u2019s lengthy standoff with European competition authorities:Google\u2019s rivals have long complained that it has used its dominant position in online search to favor its other services, including restaurant recommendations and online maps.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The same year, European officials opened a separate investigation into whether Google\u2019s Android software hampered digital competition. That led to official charges against the company last year.The European Union\u2019s third investigation of Google \u2014 into whether some of the company\u2019s advertising products had restricted consumer choice \u2014 resulted in another charge sheet in July 2016.While the investigations are limited to Google\u2019s activities in Europe, the consequences for the company \u2014 whose digital search and advertising businesses dominate in much of the world \u2014 could be far-reaching.Along with a hefty fine, the company, whose online search services have a roughly 90 percent market share in Europe, may also face \u201cremedies,\u201d or changes dictated by the European Union\u2019s competition authority on how it operates across the bloc.That could include tweaking its search algorithms and other technology to give rivals greater prominence in search queries, as well as greater regulatory oversight of its vast online businesses.European competition authorities are expected to hit Google with a combination of large fines and demands that the company changes how it operates across the 28-member bloc.They can fine Google up to about $7.6 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, but the financial penalty is likely to be significantly less than that. While the company can handle the fine, it is likely to appeal to the bloc\u2019s highest court, the European Court of Justice, to contest any efforts to change how it operates.The judges of the European Court of Justice have never overruled the region\u2019s competition authority, though that is still a possibility. Litigation could drag on for years.Google has vocally rebutted Europe\u2019s charges, saying that competition for its search, advertising and other products is only a click away on the internet.The search giant also says that its services have helped consumers, advertisers and even some competitors find digital information.The company adds that the strength of other American technology companies in Europe, including Amazon and Facebook, shows that Google has not restricted Europe\u2019s digital market.In the short term, it will not affect them very much.Legal action is likely to continue for several years.But if European competition officials get their way, experts say that Google may have to tweak its digital services to comply with regulators\u2019 demands.That could either be limited to changes for European users, or it could extend beyond the region, depending on Google\u2019s ability to limit the region\u2019s antitrust actions to the bloc\u2019s borders.Advertisement"}

The company, based in San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, has already raised about $500 million over the past three years and was valued by investors last year at about $4 billion.In the past few years, Slack has also stirred acquisition interest from potential buyers, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, according to three people with knowledge of the acquisition offers. Most recently, Amazon expressed interest in acquiring Slack, these people said.Slack\u2019s messaging product, introduced in 2014, was initially a cult hit that grew mostly by word of mouth, a rare feat for a company that caters to businesses rather than consumers.Tools made by Slack are now used daily by five million people, up from four million in October. For about 1.5 million of those, Slack is paid $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search, but most customers use a free version. The company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable.Stewart Butterfield, Slack\u2019s chief executive, has said publicly that he wants to build a giant company and that he has therefore been opportunistic about amassing a war chest of capital.Slack is trying to sign on more large companies as customers. It recently expanded its sales and marketing teams. Last fall, it brought in a seasoned sales executive, Kevin Egan, who had most recently worked at Dropbox.

{"Headline": "Robot Cars Can\u2019t Count on Us in an Emergency", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Three years ago, Google\u2019s self-driving car project abruptly shifted from designing a vehicle that would drive autonomously most of the time while occasionally requiring human oversight, to a slow-speed robot without a brake pedal, accelerator or steering wheel. In other words, human driving was no longer permitted.The company made the decision after giving self-driving cars to Google employees for their work commutes and recording what the passengers did while the autonomous system did the driving. In-car cameras recorded employees climbing into the back seat, climbing out of an open car window, and even smooching while the car was in motion, according to two former Google engineers.Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Google\u2019s self-driving car effort, now called Waymo, disputed the accounts that went beyond what Mr. Urmson described, but said behavior like an employee\u2019s rummaging in the back seat for his laptop while the car was moving and other \u201cegregious\u201d acts contributed to shutting down the experiment.We humans are easily distracted by our games, phones and mates. And automotive engineers, computer interaction designers and, yes, lawyers, wonder if the self-driving cars they are working on will ever really be able to count on us in an emergency.Engineers say they believe that cars will be intelligent enough to do all the driving, somewhere between five years and a decade from now, depending on whom you ask. But until then, what passes for autonomous driving will be a delicate ballet between human and machine: Humans may be required to take the wheel at a moment\u2019s notice when the computer can\u2019t decide what to do.But many automotive technologists are skeptical that the so-called handoff from machine to human can be counted on, because of the challenge of quickly bringing a distracted human back into control of a rapidly moving vehicle.Nauto\u2019s data shows that a \u201cdriver distraction event\u201d occurs, on average, every four miles. Mr. Heck said there was evidence that the inattention of human drivers was a factor in half of the approximately 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.\u201cThere is a motor-learning process if I haven\u2019t been controlling the vehicle and I have to take control,\u201d said J. Christian Gerdes, a Stanford University mechanical engineering professor who was one of the authors of the study.The handoff challenge is compounded by what is known as \u201cover-trust\u201d by automotive engineers.Solving the over-trust issue is a key to autonomous vehicles in the Level 3 category, where the computer hands off to humans.The first commercial vehicle to offer Level 3 autonomy is expected to be released next month by Audi. A version of its luxury A8 model will be able to drive in stop-and-go freeway traffic up to 37 miles an hour while allowing drivers to pursue other tasks. The vehicle reportedly will notify drivers in emergencies, giving them eight to 10 seconds to intervene.Despite these limited advances, many automotive technologists remain uncertain about whether technology will ever be able to operate smoothly with a human driver who may be reading email or playing World of Warcraft.\u201cI believe that Level 3 autonomous driving is unsolvable,\u201d said John Leonard, a mechanical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has collected detailed examples of driving situations that are currently impossible for state-of-the-art autonomous driving systems. \u201cThe notion that a human can be a reliable backup is a fallacy.\u201dYet, despite widespread skepticism, the automotive industry is spending heavily on artificial intelligence technologies designed to make cars safer before they are fully autonomous. The idea is that self-driving technology (warning lights, emergency braking) can help humans be safer drivers.Instead, he said, he saw the ratings as different ways of addressing the same car-safety question, regardless of who or what is in control.Unlike many in the industry who say that advances in machine learning will soon make self-driving cars safer than those driven by humans, Mr. Pratt has pushed for less futuristic \u201cguardian\u201d technologies that could be added to a car the same way that anti-lock brakes, stability control, blind-spot warning lights and other features have become common.One possible new feature being designed by the Toyota Research Institute is adding the ability not just to stop when a pedestrian is detected, but also to swerve to avoid an accident, he said.Toyota is also working on technologies that will assist human drivers in remaining vigilant when they are required to oversee an autonomous driving system for long stretches of time. There is already a rich literature that explores the challenges of keeping airplane pilots vigilant; Toyota researchers say they will be able to develop techniques to maintain human driver attention.Mr. Pratt said Toyota had not given up on the challenge of Level 3 driving. But to make a safe Level 3 car, he said, it may be necessary to develop technologies that see risks as much as 15 seconds in the future.Still, over-trust will be a tough challenge to overcome. \u201cImagine if the autopilot disengages once in 10,000 miles,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be very tempted to over-trust the system. Then when it does mess up, you will be unprepared.\u201dAnd if all those issues do get resolved, there is one more question: Will people really use self-driving cars?The researchers found that 23 percent of Americans would refuse to drive in autonomous cars and 36 percent would be so nervous that they would not take their eyes off the road. An additional 3 percent said they would be too motion-sick to take advantage of the cars.\u201cAlso of importance is the fact that current trips in light-duty vehicles average only about 19 minutes, a rather short duration for sustained productive activity or invigorating sleep,\u201d the researchers concluded.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of the level of automotive human-to-machine control that is consider complete autonomy. It is Level 6, not 5.Advertisement"}

What were those postings and why do you remember them?A few years ago I started teaching workshops to high school and college students about the importance of maintaining a clean digital reputation. I wanted to ensure that they learned that the things you type, post and share behind a computer screen can still impact your life.I am of the bridge generation that remembers life before social media permeated everything, but cannot imagine life without it now. I was a sophomore at the University of Illinois in 2004, the year \u201cTheFacebook\u201d launched and was made available to college students who went to Ivy League and Big 10 schools.

It turned out these platforms we kids were all loitering on could be used for business! It was perfect for my next move.

{"Headline": "HomePod Speaker and New iMacs: What We Saw at Apple\u2019s WWDC", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported by\u2022 Apple gave a sneak peek of HomePod, a speaker, to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home. It\u2019s the first brand-new hardware product for Apple since the Apple Watch.\u2022 The company also showed new iPads at its annual developer conference, which typically focuses on software instead of hardware.\u2022 Also unveiled: a new iMac Pro, upgraded iMacs and MacBooks, and updates to its operating systems.Amazon, with the Echo, pioneered a device that lets you play music, look up basic information and control your lighting and other home accessories. Now Apple\u2019s answer to the Echo \u2014 the HomePod \u2014 is here, kind of. Apple showed off HomePod on Monday, and it will be available in December.So how will Apple compete? In a very Apple-like manner: The speaker, powered by the Siri voice assistant, looks spiffier than either Amazon\u2019s or Google\u2019s version \u2014 it is a seven-inch-tall canister wrapped in a shiny mesh speaker. The company also said it had prioritized the speaker\u2019s sound, which can be lackluster on rival devices. HomePod has an array of speakers to create virtual surround sound.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know what any of that is; just know that it sounds incredible,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s marketing chief, who added that HomePod would be priced at $349.Although Apple appears to be trying to make up ground on Amazon and Google, the primary casualty may be Sonos. That company offers a wireless multispeaker system that allows users to listen to music throughout the home, similar to HomePod\u2019s ability to chain together speakers.The big question, though, is whether the intelligence inside Apple\u2019s speaker is good for anything beyond music. Apple was early to the voice game with Siri on the iPhone, but rivals have since lapped it \u2014 their voice-command devices are faster, they know more, and they are less annoying to use. Apple promises the new Siri is better, but the improvements it showed were only minor.Apple\u2019s developer conference typically showcases software improvements. In a departure from that routine, Apple showed a lot of new hardware this time.That included updated versions of the iPad, which has been declining in sales. Apple showed that it was continuing to bet on the tablets by unveiling an iPad upgrade that the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said was pushing the device \u201cfurther than it ever has before.\u201dThe new version of the iPad Pro has a 10.5-inch display, 20 percent larger than the previous 9.7-inch model, and it will start at $649. Apple said the size made it perfect for displaying a virtual keyboard comparable to a full-size physical keyboard. The company also highlighted a feature called ProMotion that increases the refresh rate and makes motion smoother in video content.After Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad in 2010, tablets exploded in popularity, but iPad sales have slumped for more than a year now. So Apple, under increasing pressure from investors to strengthen its revenue, has upgraded iPads more frequently than many of its other products. The company introduced a cheaper version of the 9.7-inch iPad, priced at $329, in March and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compatible with an Apple stylus and keyboard, in 2015.Apple\u2019s predicament seems to be that for existing iPad customers, their tablets are still quite capable and running strong, giving them little reason to upgrade. For new customers, the iPad may be overkill for basic tasks, especially if you can just pay $50 for a media tablet from Amazon.One of Apple\u2019s splashiest hardware debuts was a brand new iMac Pro that will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega. Translation: It is Apple\u2019s all-in-one desktop on steroids.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the most powerful Mac we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d said John Ternus, Apple\u2019s vice president for hardware engineering.The new iMac Pro may help compensate for Apple\u2019s previous professional desktop, the Mac Pro, which was widely panned by critics and customers. The iMac Pro will start at $5,000 and ship in December.With this device, Apple is broadly catering to members of the professional community, like filmmakers and hard-core coders. For years, these users have felt left behind as Apple has focused on consumer-oriented products like the iPhone, shifting away from high-performance equipment for professionals.The company also announced upgrades of its 27-inch and 21.5-inch iMacs, its desktop computers, which will start at $1,099, with additional models at $1,299 and $1,799. And Apple lowered some prices for its MacBooks and said the MacBook Air, its entry-level lightweight laptop, would get a speed increase. The 21.5-inch model with 4K high resolution will start at about $1,300, with a new 13-inch MacBook Pro starting at $1,300.Every year, Apple updates the underlying operating systems that power its devices. The changes are geeky \u2014 remember, they are aimed at software developers \u2014 but they eventually trickle down to how we use iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches.The most important update was to iOS, the operating system that underpins Apple\u2019s biggest seller, iPhones, as well as iPads. Apple introduced iOS 11, with improved camera software; upgrades for Siri; an expansion of its mobile payment system, Apple Pay; and a new version of Apple Maps, with indoor mapping and features to prevent distracted driving.Because the show is about giving new tools to developers, Apple also focused on emerging technologies. Specifically, Apple highlighted augmented reality, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.Apple demonstrated changes to the operating system for the Apple Watch including a new watch face that uses Siri to suggest directions, show calendar items and generally predict what you will want to see. The most substantive changes focused on fitness, including the ability to track new types of high-intensity workouts.Advertisement"}

But because the sex of children is random \u2014 providing natural experimental and control groups \u2014 and because it affected the likelihood of hiring female partners, the study was able to compare the effect of diversity on performance. The researchers were Paul Gompers, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Sophie Wang, a Harvard economics Ph.D. student.The probability of a venture firm\u2019s succeeding, as measured by start-ups going public or being acquired for more than the amount invested, was 3 percent higher in firms in which investing partners had more daughters. The rate of return for the funds also increased 3 percent. The researchers controlled for factors like firms\u2019 size, age and demographic makeup.\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of pure test, to have a separate source of variation and find that diversity does good,\u201d said Larry Summers, a Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary. He called it \u201ca clever and important study that seems applicable to a variety of professions.\u201dVenture capital, even more than other industries, tends to be homogeneous \u2014 mostly white or Asian-American men with similar education and work backgrounds. The investors control billions of dollars and work in small teams that hire infrequently, so even small biases in hiring have industrywide effects. Only about 10 percent of new hires in the industry are women, and three-quarters of firms have never had a female senior investor, according to the data.The researchers ran a calculation comparing firms, and found that on average, the presence of one more daughter instead of a son for each senior partner increased the probability of hiring a female senior investor over a male by 24 percent. In firms with more daughters, 12 percent of new hires were women, compared with 9 percent in firms with more sons.The researchers used the Dow Jones VentureSource database to track venture-backed start-ups and their investors from 1990 to 2016. They created a data set of venture capitalists\u2019 children by using publicly available information, like alumni directories, and by sending personal email queries. The data set of children is not representative because they could not find data for every investor, but they included 1,403 of 3,329 people.The researchers wanted to know whether working only with people of similar backgrounds is a positive thing, because it could make communication easier and more efficient, or detrimental, because it could lead to harmful groupthink. The latter appears to be true, Mr. Gompers said.\u201cIf you have five white guys who all went to Harvard Business School and worked at Google, it\u2019s likely when they see an investment or problem or decision, they frame it in the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a diverse set of people really means you\u2019re much less likely to have blind spots.\u201dAll executives and policy makers can\u2019t magically be given daughters. Still, the research demonstrates the value of including a diverse set of people in the room.\u201cIt becomes really hard to deny we probably would see very large effects of other experiences, too, like serving in the military, growing up in a disadvantaged neighborhood, going on a mission, being a first-time college graduate,\u201d Ms. Sen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice illustration of the potential benefits of lived experience.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Anti-Uber", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byOpinionHURON, CALIF. \u2014 Carmen Lopez, a retired farmworker, keeps a Bible on the back seat of her silver 2003 Honda and crochet hooks and a Spanish-language potboiler in her purse. In her line of work, she waits a lot.Huron\u2019s mayor, Rey L\u00e9on, thinks of the Latino tradition of rural ride sharing as \u201cindigenous Ubers\u201d and has plans to formalize the service. One of seven raiteras in town, Mrs. Lopez now works in exchange for gas money, lunch at a local buffet or taqueria, and the pleasure of some company and conversation. Passengers who can afford it pay $0.50 a mile.Last week, the founder of the country\u2019s most famous ride-sharing start-up, Uber, agreed to take a leave of absence. The company, valued at an estimated $68 billion, has been tripping over itself in a series of disasters, including allegations of sexual harassment and the exposure of an app cooked up to trick regulators. But anyone who thinks that the future of ride sharing is threatened by Silicon Valley\u2019s misbehavior should look elsewhere, to some of the most isolated parts of America, where intrepid networks of volunteers and entrepreneurs are making it possible for their neighbors to get around.The indigenous Ubers are a must in Huron, a predominantly Latino city ringed by garlic and tomato fields. There are no real Ubers here; few could afford them anyway. The lone county-operated bus takes nearly three hours to get to Fresno, making 16 stops at even tinier locales like Raisin City (population 380) before turning around four hours later and heading back. A round-trip ticket costs $9.Once called Knife Fight City and still plagued by gang violence, Huron seems like an unlikely incubator for renegade transportation ideas. But starting this fall, the city will provide two electric vehicles for use by Mrs. Lopez and others, part of a project called Green Raiteros that is supported by Valley LEAP, a nonprofit Mr. L\u00e9on founded. It will employ a longtime raitera as a dispatcher \u2014 riders will need only a phone number, no app necessary \u2014 and pay drivers a small amount based on the miles they travel. A flotilla of charging stations will open next to pistachio and almond groves on the roads to Fresno.The California Public Utilities Commission approved $519,000 to build the stations, and more funding will probably come from a novel policy that sets aside 35 percent of the state\u2019s cap-and-trade auction dollars for clean energy in poor communities. The law is intended to wrestle \u201cEVs\u201d away from \u201ctheir boutique-ish environment,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the state senator who sponsored the bill. \u201cIf the market is left to its own devices, it will not correct the inequities that exist,\u201d he said.Green Raiteros and Van y Vienan (\u201cthey come and go\u201d), a shared electric van that, starting this summer, will connect nearby tiny Cantua Creek and El Porvenir \u2014 twin communities separated by a spine-rattling road \u2014 are the latest examples of a movement to democratize ride sharing as a solution to rural isolation. The goal is to lower transportation costs, provide a living wage for drivers and reduce pollution, which is a real problem in this area.The air is consistently ranked by the American Lung Association as among the country\u2019s worst. Those who have driven the Central Valley\u2019s Highway 99 have probably seen the white scrim that often obscures the Sierra Nevada, a nasty blend of pollutants from tractor-trailers, farm equipment, pesticides and more.More broadly, \u201cpeople in rural communities really get social capital,\u201d said Katherine Freund, founder of ITN America, a nonprofit network of more than 700 drivers across the country, most of them volunteers, who give rides to seniors and the visually impaired.Huron has no movie theater, no newspaper, no pharmacy, and the main highway is impassable in heavy rains. As in many rural towns, increased consolidation \u2014 regional schools, hospitals, courthouses and malls \u2014 \u201cmakes the transportation element more vexing,\u201d said Scott Bogren, the executive director of Community Transportation Association of America.In Cantua Creek, there is only one bus: the school bus. \u201cThe lack of transit is a huge obstacle to economic opportunity,\u201d said Phoebe Seaton, a co-director of the nonprofit Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, which is working with residents on the new electric van. \u201cIt affects access to employment, health services, education and healthy food.\u201dSilvia Mora, a 52-year-old case manager for a social services agency in Huron, had no car in the 1990s when her baby Minerva, now a 26-year-old teacher, became seriously ill and had to be airlifted to Valley Children\u2019s Hospital in Madera, 62 miles away. Mrs. Mora had to scrounge for a ride.Now Mrs. Mora spends one day a week volunteering as a raitera; she recently drove a victim of domestic violence to the Mexican consulate in Fresno to get a passport so that she could apply for a special visa for crime victims. \u201cI tell myself, if I can help this person, why not?\u201d she said from behind the wheel, a crystal angel hanging from her rearview mirror.The Central Valley isn\u2019t the only place where grass-roots models are flourishing. In Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota, drivers for a start-up called Liberty Mobility Now are familiar with 16-mile gravel roads and addresses that don\u2019t exist on Google maps. Passengers pay $1 a mile (the drivers keep up to $0.80), and local social services agencies pay a monthly fee to request rides for clients through an \u201centerprise portal.\u201d Valerie Lefler, the start-up\u2019s executive, recruits drivers at the local Lions and Rotary Clubs. \u201cThose are the drivers who are going to get out of the car to help you into the hospital and find your doctor,\u201d she said.In Watertown, N.Y., about 30 miles from the Canadian border, the 25-year-old Volunteer Transportation Center has 250 drivers covering a three-county area the approximate size of Connecticut. Charlie Lehman, a 75-year-old retired teacher, frequently takes people in wheelchairs to dialysis. He has to dodge winter whiteouts and twice totaled his car after hitting deer. The center reimburses drivers for mileage, subsidizing the operation through Medicaid and contracts with local social services agencies. \u201cOur model is about neighbors helping neighbors, versus a side hustle,\u201d said Samuel M. Purington, the agency\u2019s executive director.These rural areas have \u201ca culture of engagement and a level of benevolence that could be galvanized to create innovative forms of mobility,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, a co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. The challenge will be finding ways to make initiatives like Green Raiteros sustainable over the long haul.Driving in Mrs. Mora\u2019s van, past fruit-packing warehouses and palm trees, I thought about transportation as a human right, like clean air and potable water, and the best way to protect it. At a moment when autonomy is the darling of Silicon Valley, efforts like Mrs. Mora\u2019s represent the opposite: community.Patricia Leigh Brown, a former reporter for The New York Times, writes on culture and community from California.Advertisement"}

On its face, the relationship between a news outlet and its readers is fairly straightforward. Readers pay for a subscription or view an ad, and the news outlet uses the funds to report the news.To protect our conversations from bad actors, The New York Times\u2019s community desk reviews almost all reader submissions by hand. With 12,000 comments moderated per day, this work is labor intensive, and has forced us to close comments on stories sooner than we would like simply because we didn\u2019t have the resources to sort through them all. Many of our best stories are never opened for comments at all.That\u2019s about to change.We have implemented a new system called Moderator, and starting today, all our top stories will allow comments for an 8-hour period on weekdays. And for the first time, comments in both the News and Opinion sections will remain open for 24 hours.If The Times has innovated in the comments space, it is by treating reader submissions like content. The community desk has long sought quality of comments over quantity. Surveys of Times readers have made clear that the approach paid off \u2014 readers who have seen our comment sections love them.\u201cPublishers often rely on advertising, and advertising relies on reader engagement,\u201d Jared Cohen, chief executive of Jigsaw, wrote in response to questions from The Times. Jigsaw\u2019s efforts help \u201cplatforms to create more space to engage their readers in civil discussion.\u201dHow The Times Will Use ModeratorOur new moderation platform diverges from the most common approach for organizing user generated content, which is to prioritize each submission in the order it was received.In Moderator, each comment is scored based on the likelihood that Times staff members would make a certain judgment, i.e.: approve or reject the comment.To the Times moderator, each comment appears as a dot on a histogram chart, illustrated below.Its placement on the chart indicates the probability that it would be rejected by a Times moderator. Moderator also tries to predict why the comment would be rejected (e.g.: inflammatory or insubstantial).For many stories, Times moderators will be able to check the machine learning model against an article\u2019s comments by reading through the submissions with between, say, a 15 to 20 percent likelihood to be rejected. If those comments can be approved, then a moderator might approve all comments between the 0 to 20 percent range. In our previous platform, we would need to read each of those comments individually before they were approved.Most comments will initially be prioritized based on a \u201csummary score.\u201d Right now, that means judging comments on three factors: their potential for obscenity, toxicity and likelihood to be rejected.As The Times gains more confidence in this summary score model, we are taking our approach a step further \u2014 automating the moderation of comments that are overwhemingly likely to be approved.\u201cThe best part about machine learning models is they get better with time,\u201d Mr. Cohen told The Times.In the long run, we hope to reimagine what it means to \u201ccomment\u201d online. The Times is developing a community where readers can discuss the news pseudonymously in an environment safe from harassment, abuse and even your crazy uncle.

{"Headline": "BMW and Volkswagen Try to Beat Apple and Google at Their Own Game", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byWheelsFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen is delving into quantum computing. BMW is building a giant new data center. And Bosch this week announced plans to construct a factory to build chips for self-driving cars.The moves are part of an expanding effort by European carmakers and suppliers to build the computing capacity \u2014 so-called big data \u2014 they will need as vehicles digitize and become driverless.Cars will need to constantly communicate, absorbing and analyzing information from thousands of vehicles at once, to make decisions to smooth traffic flow, save fuel and avoid hazards.That presents a huge new challenge for companies traditionally focused on manufacturing.\u201cThe processing power needed to deal with all this data is orders of magnitude larger than what we are used to,\u201d said Reinhard Stolle, a vice president in charge of artificial intelligence at the German automaker BMW, which is building a data center near Munich that is 10 times the size of the company\u2019s existing facility. \u201cThe traditional control engineering techniques are just not able to handle the complexity anymore.\u201dBig data is a challenge for all automakers, but especially German companies because they target affluent customers who want the latest technology.At the same time, the focus on computing pits the automakers against Silicon Valley tech companies with far more experience in the field, and creates an opening for firms like Apple and Google, which are already encroaching on the car business.That has put pressure on automakers. German companies in particular have already made investments in ride-sharing services, in part to combat the rise of Uber, and are now looking further into the future.Efforts by Volkswagen, trying to remake itself as a technology leader as it recovers from an emissions scandal, show how far into exotic realms of technology carmakers are willing to go.Volkswagen, a German company, recently joined the handful of large corporations worldwide that are customers of D-Wave Systems, a Canadian maker of computers that apply the mind-bending principles of quantum physics.While some experts question their usefulness, D-Wave computers \u2014 housed in tall, matte black cases that recall the obelisks in the science fiction classic \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d \u2014 can in theory process massive amounts of information at unheard-of speeds. Martin Hofmann, Volkswagen\u2019s chief information officer, is a believer.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s a new era of technology,\u201d Mr. Hofmann said in an interview at Volkswagen\u2019s vast factory complex in Wolfsburg, Germany.This year Volkswagen used a D-Wave computer to demonstrate how it could steer the movements of 10,000 taxis in Beijing at once, optimizing their routes and thereby reducing congestion.Because traffic patterns morph constantly, the challenge is to gather and analyze vehicle flows quickly enough for the data to be useful. The D-Wave computer was able to process in a few seconds information that would take a conventional supercomputer 30 minutes, said Florian Neukart, a scientist at a Volkswagen lab in San Francisco.Such claims are met with skepticism by some experts, who say there is no convincing proof that D-Wave computers are faster than a well-programmed conventional supercomputer. And unlike a quantum computer, a supercomputer does not have components that must be kept at temperatures colder than deep space.\u201cIt would be particularly astonishing that this milestone should happen first for a Volkswagen application problem,\u201d Mr. Aaronson said in an email.Volkswagen executives say they will publish the results of their work with D-Wave computers, allowing outsiders to try to debunk them.If the D-Wave collaboration proves to be a misstep for Volkswagen, it would illustrate the hazards of big data for companies whose main focus for the past century has been the internal combustion engine. It also reflects the stakes for one of the world\u2019s biggest carmakers.Suppliers are also gearing up for an era of automotive big data. Bosch, the electronics maker based in a suburb of Stuttgart, said Monday that it would invest 1 billion euros, or $1.1 billion, to build a new factory in Dresden to produce chips for a variety of applications, including the sensors used in self-driving cars.Bosch prefers to build its own chips rather than buy them from a supplier, said Christine Haas, director for connected services at the company. \u201cWhen you have done it yourself, then you have a much deeper understanding of the technology,\u201d she said.Some car companies have decided to concentrate on what they do best and let others handle the computing.\u201cWe are trying to embrace it,\u201d said Martin Kristensson, senior director for autonomous driving and connectivity strategy at Volvo, of the challenge from Silicon Valley.But, like Volkswagen, many are trying to develop capabilities in-house. Mr. Stolle of BMW said that the carmaker \u2014 which hired more information technology specialists last year than mechanical engineers \u2014 needs huge data-crunching capability.The company has a fleet of 40 prototype autonomous cars it is testing in cooperation with Intel, a chip maker; Mobileye, an Israeli self-driving technology company; and Delphi, an auto components supplier.BMW uses artificial intelligence to analyze the enormous amounts of data compiled from test drives, part of a quest to build cars that can learn from experience and eventually drive themselves without human intervention.After test sessions, hard disks in the cars are physically removed and connected to racks of computers at BMW\u2019s research center near Munich. The data collected would fill the equivalent of a stack of DVDs 60 miles high, Mr. Stolle said.That is much more than could be efficiently transmitted over the internet to remote data storage facilities operated by outside providers in the \u201ccloud.\u201d\u201cA large part of the data center has to be on premises,\u201d Mr. Stolle said. \u201cThe amount is so huge it doesn\u2019t work in the cloud.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Airbnb helps many of those travelers and is now a household name.But personal vehicles, which are also near the top of the list of many people\u2019s most expensive assets, are even more underused than homes. Most people don\u2019t drive more than two hours a day, after all. So why isn\u2019t there a globe-straddling colossus on the tip of our tongues that puts millions of privately owned vehicles into a part-time rental pool?Because of \u201climited availability,\u201d said a Turo spokesman, Steve Webb, no one was available to talk to me on the phone. He said via email that less than 1 percent of Turo rentals result in damage.One of Turo\u2019s own insurance partners filed suit in federal court last year over another death. In that instance, a Turo vehicle struck another car and killed its driver in Smyrna, Ga. Brian Lewis, a lawyer representing a passenger in the Turo vehicle, said that the Turo renter was not the person actually behind the wheel, and that the suit would resolve the question of whether Turo\u2019s insurance ought to cover that situation. (The lawyers for the insurance company did not respond to a request for comment.)In an email, Mr. Webb said that the Turo vehicle in the Smyrna accident had been stolen, that the insurance company does not believe it owes coverage to a criminal, and that the coverage would indeed protect the car owner. He declined to provide overall theft figures, though he did say that it was \u201cextraordinarily rare.\u201dA spokeswoman for Getaround, Jacqueline Tanzella, said that its rate of recovered cars from in-trip thefts was 100 percent.Even Mr. Root is willing to give Turo a fourth chance if he replaces his car after the three accidents. While he found the company difficult to deal with after the damage occurred, he was often making twice as much from renting it out as the car cost in monthly lease payments, at least until it was totaled.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

Our site had vanished from the internet in Egypt. After some technical tests and conversations with users of different internet service providers, we realized what had happened: Mada Masr was being blocked in Egypt.Mada Masr was born in a moment of political uncertainty. It was June 2013, when people were protesting the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood. Then the military intervened, ousted President Mohamed Morsi and appointed a government until their commander, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was elected president a few months later.Dissent \u2014 or any act resembling critique of public policy \u2014 was the casualty: endless administrative detentions for some political dissidents, hasty litigation and harsh mass verdicts for others; random killings of political opponents; systematic intimidation of activists, independent journalists and human rights defenders; legislated restrictions on the media and civil society. The authorities rendered the political space void. All other actors were pushed to the margins.Stepping into this void, a number of journalists in Egypt started publishing about all of the above. We called ourselves Mada Masr. \u201cMada\u201d is the Arabic word for \u201creach,\u201d like the horizon. We chose it as a reminder of the possibility of seeing a way out. Mada is also the spot where a gem or stone is placed on a ring, a symbol of taking a position, not succumbing to the reality of our violent exclusion from politics.Four years after its founding, and after constant news coverage, multiple investigative reports and scores of insightful articles about what Egypt has become, Mada Masr was blocked. No one has claimed responsibility for the blockade, which was conducted through an RST injection, a technology China uses to block websites as part of its infamous firewall. An RST injection is a reset command by a third party that prevents data from traveling through an internet protocol, which is the system that connects computers to the internet.News spread in state-affiliated media, which quoted anonymous security sources saying that the authorities had ordered the blocking of a number of websites in Egypt for supporting terrorism and spreading lies. In addition to Mada Masr, a number of other sites have been blocked, including Al Jazeera, the HuffPost\u2019s Arabic-language site, and the Egyptian financial newspaper Al Borsa and its English sister publication, Daily News Egypt.But still, no one from the government has spoken to us.Of course we want freedom. But we at Mada Masr \u2014 like many other groups \u2014 have learned how to thrive in precarity.I am not sure that blocking our website and other websites is the most productive way to stop the flow of knowledge. We are agile. And although the internet has morphed from an ultimately free space into one that governments and big private players have turned into their own terrain, it is still a place where we are able to emerge and re-emerge. Do those invisible powers that come up with the idea of blocking websites or sign off on such decisions know that?The state is powerful and will always be more powerful. But we have also been building power. We at Mada Masr belong to the many in Egypt today who did not disappear when we lost but instead remain in the hide-outs created by that political void. At moments of crisis, at times of direct collision with state power, those hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of us have not really drowned in despair, but rather we have been able to craft politics. And in being political, we recognize and grab moments of possibility, even if they come wrapped in crisis.Advertisement"}

For years, Stari Grad, or Old Town, with its thick medieval walls, Gothic buildings and deep blue Adriatic Sea backdrop, has drawn tens of thousands of summer visitors who march up and down its shiny limestone-paved streets admiring the city\u2019s Mediterranean-meets-medieval aesthetics. It didn\u2019t matter that the restaurant fare was mediocre, or that it was hard to find a good cup of coffee. But things are changing in this Croatian city of 42,000 along the southern Dalmatian Coast. The summer crowds are still here, but you can now find restaurants serving inspired Dalmatian fare, hipster coffee shops pouring above-average java, and serious cocktail bars that are shaking up quaffable libations. Dubrovnik in 2017 is a feast for more than just the eyes.\nExplore the map and find things to do in Dubrovnik.\nStroll the 1.2-mile stretch atop the city\u2019s walls, pausing at the various towers and bastions along the way, and at viewpoints along Stradun, the beloved main thoroughfare of Stari Grad, where locals enjoy lingering as if it were a collective living room. The entry fee for walking the walls is 150 kuna (or $22.75), 50 kuna for children; it includes admission to St. Lawrence Fort, or Fort Lovrijenac, which lies outside the walls to the west.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Role in European Elections Under Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byMr. Dodd, a maker of musical instruments in northern England, joined an experiment. He and around 10,000 others volunteered their data, allowing researchers to monitor in real time which political ads were showing up in their Facebook news feeds as Britain\u2019s election approached.Their goal: to shed more light on how political campaigns are using Facebook and other digital services \u2014 technologies that are quickly reshaping the democratic process, but which often offer few details about their outsize roles in elections worldwide.\u201cThese political ads aren\u2019t regulated; nobody knows what is being said on Facebook,\u201d said Mr. Dodd, 26, who planned to vote for the Labour Party on Thursday elections, but who continued to be bombarded with online messages from the Conservatives. \u201cWherever politics is concerned, there needs to more transparency.\u201dFacebook provides little information on how political parties use ads to reach undecided voters on the site. And concern has been growing since the American presidential election about the company\u2019s role in campaigns, including about how politically charged fake news is spread online.Costing less than $1,000 to build, the technology, which works as a plug-in on desktop web browsers and anonymizes users\u2019 personal information, was created because the social network does not share information on political ads shown to its more than 36 million users in Britain, roughly half the country\u2019s population.That lack of information has raised hackles about the activities of both Facebook and politicians in a country where campaigns are highly regulated and political financing is tightly capped.\u201cPolitical advertising is fundamentally different; there\u2019s a lot of concern about what\u2019s being seen on Facebook,\u201d said Sam Jeffers, the group\u2019s co-founder and a former digital media strategist. \u201cThe people deserve some sense of what\u2019s going on.\u201dAs the volunteer group is not completely representative of the British population, the data is by no means perfect, highlighting the difficulty of tracking political activity on Facebook.In the buildup to the election, for instance, the data showed that the Liberal Democrats \u2014 who are likely to remain a minority presence in Parliament \u2014 posted the largest number of political ads on Facebook. The Conservative Party was second, despite the political party\u2019s pledge to spend 1 million pounds, or $1.3 million, on social media messaging. The Labour Party, which planned to spend a similar amount, was in third place.Initially, all the British parties spent money on broad-brush messages that blanketed the social network without targeting specific voters. But as Election Day approached, that strategy began to change.The ads have included Conservative Party messages about potential nuclear energy jobs in three areas in northern England with ties to the industry, and that are some of the country\u2019s most contested districts. By contrast, the Labour Party targeted older women nationwide with directed ads about potential threats to their pensions.\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental conversation to have about how we regulate this,\u201d said Nick Anstead, a media and communications expert at the London School of Economics. \u201cFacebook has a responsibility to tell its users who is buying advertising that is targeting their votes.\u201dIn response, the company says its roughly two billion users worldwide have complete control over which ads they are shown on the network, and that it is the responsibility of individual political parties to comply with their countries\u2019 electoral laws. Facebook adds that its commercial agreements and protection of individuals\u2019 privacy restrict it from sharing more data on how information is distributed on the platform.\u201cFacebook\u2019s goal is to make it easier for people to get the information they need to vote,\u201d Andy Stone, a company spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage any and all candidates, groups and voters to use our platform to engage in the elections.\u201dAcademics and others scrutinizing the vote also said the company\u2019s failure to provide data on what Facebook users in France shared among themselves made it virtually impossible to determine if false reports spread on the network affected the overall result.For Ben Scott, such issues bring back mixed memories of the American presidential election, when he was a digital consultant for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.He has now turned his attention to a project at the New Responsibility Foundation, a Berlin-based research organization that is monitoring the spread and impact of fake news ahead of Germany\u2019s election in September.He and his team are categorizing potential online misinformation in a digital database, tracking how these false reports spread across social media and the wider web and conducting focus groups to gauge the impact on voters\u2019 decisions.The role of companies like Facebook in spreading online falsehoods is limited in Germany, Mr. Scott said, because social media does not play as significant a role in everyday politics as it does in the United States.Still, the social media giant \u2014 which has roughly 36 million users in Germany \u2014 is a force to reckon with in the coming election.Despite Mr. Scott\u2019s discussions with Facebook about potential collaborations, the company has so far declined to give his research project any data on how local users share potential misinformation among themselves on the social network.\u201cIf we see something getting significant media attention and there\u2019s a sudden spike,\u201d Mr. Scott said, \u201cthen we can guess there\u2019s something going on inside Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Undoing All the Good Work on Cuba", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported byEditorialTo the long list of Barack Obama\u2019s major initiatives that President Trump is obsessed with reversing, we may soon be able to add Cuba. In 2014, Mr. Obama opened a dialogue with Cuba after more than a half-century of unyielding hostility, leading to an easing of sanctions. Mr. Trump promised in his campaign to return to a more hard-line approach. If he does, as seems likely, he will further isolate America, hurt American business interests and, quite possibly, impede the push for greater democracy on the Caribbean island.Soon after his election, Mr. Trump declared, vaguely but ominously, that if Cuba did not \u201cmake a better deal\u201d he would \u201cterminate deal.\u201d He gave no specifics and no decisions have been announced. But details of what a policy reversal could look like are emerging.The aim generally would be to reimpose limits on travel and commerce, supposedly to punish Cuba\u2019s despotic government, now led by Ra\u00fal Castro, brother of the revolutionary leader Fidel Castro. Among the measures being considered are blocking transactions by American companies with firms that have ties to the Cuban military, which is deeply enmeshed in the economy, and tightening restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba that Mr. Obama eased last year before his historic trip to Havana.This hard-line sanctions-based approach was in place for more than 50 years after the 1959 revolution and never produced what anti-Castro activists hoped would be the result, the ouster of Cuba\u2019s Communist government in favor of democracy. Isolating Cuba has become increasingly indefensible.Mr. Obama\u2019s opening to Havana has enabled the freer flow of people, goods and information between the two countries, even as significant differences remain over human rights. It has produced bilateral agreements on health care cooperation, joint planning to mitigate oil spills, coordination on counternarcotics efforts and intelligence-sharing. In April, Google\u2019s servers went live in Cuba and thus it became the first foreign internet company to host content in one of the most unplugged nations on earth. Mr. Obama\u2019s approach also encouraged Latin American countries to be more receptive to the United States as a partner in regional problem-solving.The White House and its allies argue that the Cuban government remains despotic and must be pressured to reform. But pressure has had a minimal impact and the human rights concerns are disingenuous, given Mr. Trump\u2019s effusive embrace of authoritarian leaders from President Vladimir Putin in Russia to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Egypt. He also pointedly told Sunni Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia last month that he has no intention of lecturing them on their repressive behavior toward their citizens.As with his decision to withdraw from the global climate agreement, Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to Cuba reflects a craven desire to curry favor with his political base, in this case conservative Republicans from Florida who are viscerally anti-Castro. That might help him get re-elected in 2020, but it would help no one else.Strengthening ties with Cuba cannot guarantee Cuban reforms, but it is the best bet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa, What Happens if the Echo Has a Screen? You Get This Review", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byTech FixWith the $230 Echo Show, Alexa has gained some new capabilities. The touch screen means that you can ask Alexa to place a video call to a friend, pull up a YouTube video on making ice cream and show you lyrics when you play music. And unlike a tablet or smartphone, the stationary Echo Show sits at a fixed angle and stays plugged in for power at all times, similar to a digital picture frame.But the device\u2019s kinship to a smartphone\u2019s or tablet\u2019s capabilities are unmistakable. Asking Alexa to do a video call with Echo Show reminded me of asking Siri to do a FaceTime call on an iPhone. Ditto for when I asked Alexa what my day looked like on the Echo Show, which produced the same summary of events as when I asked Google the same question on an Android phone.After a week of tests, while I concluded that the product is ideal on a kitchen counter or an office desk, I also decided it was superfluous if you already own an Echo speaker and a smartphone or tablet. Whether or not you will be persuaded to buy one will probably hinge on your affinity for Alexa.The setup process for the Echo Show was one of the easiest and fastest I have ever experienced: Just plug it in and enter your Wi-Fi password and Amazon credentials. From there, I could start putting Alexa to work. (If you use third-party services like Spotify, you have to log in to those as well.)The Echo Show\u2019s screen constantly stayed on with a background photo of my choice. It displayed the time while rotating through captions showing future calendar events, the weather and tips on questions I could ask Alexa.Video calling and video playback are the most important features of the Echo Show. After a command like \u201cAlexa, show me how to roast a duck from YouTube,\u201d the screen loaded a list of YouTube videos; each video is numbered, so you could ask Alexa to play a specific clip by naming the number.You could also ask Alexa to place a call to another Echo customer. When I tried it, the Alexa app synchronized with my smartphone\u2019s address book to determine who else was using an Echo. Then just by asking Alexa to call the name of a contact, I could immediately commence a video call.What was also nice about the Echo Show\u2019s being stationary is that it remained fixed on a flattering angle of my face. (If you\u2019re tired of staring up people\u2019s nostrils on FaceTime calls, you\u2019ll know what I mean.)There\u2019s another task that the Echo Show handled better than the Echo speaker: shopping on Amazon. By saying, for example, \u201cAlexa, order me some batteries,\u201d you get the screen to show a list of batteries to choose from. By contrast, with the Echo speaker, the device could only reorder batteries you had bought before \u2014 or, if you hadn\u2019t ordered batteries before, choose a pack of batteries for you.For audio, the Echo Show included two small stereo speakers. They sounded loud and clear but lacking in bass. Compared with fancy speakers, the Echo Show sounded average, but it\u2019s adequate for watching YouTube videos in the kitchen or streaming music if you aren\u2019t a nitpicky audiophile.The Echo Show is buggy. In my tests with a fellow product reviewer as well as an Amazon spokesman, video calls were inconsistent. While video calls from my apartment looked clear and sounded good, other calls placed from the New York Times building failed to show any video \u2014 and, soon after, the calls disconnected. (In both locations, I used a strong Wi-Fi connection.)There were also some quirks with so-called Skills, which are essentially third-party apps that you can install to expand Alexa\u2019s capabilities. For example, for looking up recipes in the kitchen, I tried a skill by AllRecipes.But when I told Alexa, \u201cShow me how to make pasta,\u201d the device loaded a list of recipes from AllRecipes.com, and then I had trouble quitting the app. The command \u201cGo home\u201d was supposed to quit the AllRecipes Skill, but it got stuck until I said, \u201cAlexa, quit.\u201dWhen I was shopping, the Echo Show displayed a pared-down list of items from Amazon. For example, when I asked Alexa to buy a dog bed, the screen showed only 18 results for dog beds. But searching \u201cdog bed\u201d on Amazon.com brought up hundreds. That\u2019s not to say that more is better, but shopping on the Echo Show will make you wonder if you are missing out on better options.What I found most baffling about the Echo Show was that the screen always stayed on. Even when I asked Alexa to turn the screen off, it dimmed the screen and showed the time. While that made it act like a digital clock, the background of the screen was still lit up black, emitting a faint glow in the dark. What\u2019s more, the screen turned back on when the camera detected motion.In other words, light sleepers will not want an Echo Show on their night stands.Amazon said that third-party Skills had not yet been finalized for the Echo Show, and that for shopping, the device displayed only the top search results to simplify the interface for customers. The company did not have a clear explanation for my video-calling issues.But the worst part about the Echo Show is its aesthetic design. Reminiscent of a black doorstop, the Echo Show looks like an uninspired piece of tech that you\u2019d find in a Brookstone store or SkyMall catalog.The Echo Show\u2019s greatest strengths are its stationary applications: getting a quick glance at your calendars while checking the time, for instance, or having a dedicated TV screen in the kitchen for learning recipes. Calendar addicts in the office, people who cook with Alexa and, more broadly, Alexa fans with multiple Echo products deployed throughout the home will love having another Echo, this time with a screen.But the average person would be wise to wait before buying the Echo Show.The device is the priciest in the Echo family \u2014 $50 more than the Echo speaker and $180 more than the Echo Dot, the miniature version of the speaker. And it remains to be seen what third-party companies do with applications designed for an always-on screen that stays put.Until then, you could always grab a tablet you already own, put it on a stand and leave it plugged in. The results will most likely be the same.Advertisement"}

It is simply a matter of how long it will take for the technology to be reliably safe. The ability to respond to spoken commands or hand signals from law enforcement or highway safety employees. Driving safely despite unclear lane markings.This, too, is a question of intuition. The most challenging driving environments require self-driving cars to make guidance decisions without white lines, Botts Dots (those little plastic bumps that mark lanes) or clear demarcations at the edge of the road. Reliably recognizing traffic lights that are not working.Picking out traffic lights is now done reliably by self-driving car vision systems. Making correct decisions in the event of a power failure is more challenging. Yet again, it\u2019s a question of teaching a machine human intuition and how to cooperate among multiple vehicles. Making left turns into intersections with fast-moving traffic.Recognizing objects is something that machine-vision systems can now do reliably. But so-called scene understanding, which would inform a determination like whether a bag on the road is empty or hides a brick inside, is more challenging for computer vision systems. The ability to operate safely in all weather conditions. Software improvements to lidar (short for light detection and ranging) technology may help someday, but not yet.A self-driving car is a collection of networked computers and sensors wirelessly connected to the outside world. Keeping the systems safe from intruders who may wish to crash cars \u2014 or turn them into weapons \u2014 may be the most daunting challenge facing autonomous driving.Advertisement"}

Is anxiety, or feeling overwhelming worry, nervousness and even panic, a common part of your life or the lives of people around you?According to data from the National Institute of Mental Health, some 38 percent of girls ages 13 through 17, and 26 percent of boys, have an anxiety disorder. On college campuses, anxiety is running well ahead of depression as the most common mental health concern, according to a 2016 national study of more than 150,000 students by the Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Pennsylvania State University. Meanwhile, the number of web searches involving the term has nearly doubled over the last five years, according to Google Trends. (The trendline for \u201cdepression\u201d was relatively flat.)To Kai Wright, the host of the politically themed podcast \u201cThe United States of Anxiety\u201d from WNYC, which debuted this past fall, such numbers are all too explicable. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at war since 2003, we\u2019ve seen two recessions,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cJust digital life alone has been a massive change.

But if social media can lead to anxiety, it also might help relieve it.The \u201cwe have no secrets here\u201d ethos of online discourse has helped bring anxiety into the open, and allowed its clinical sufferers to band together in a virtual group-therapy setting. Hence the success of campaigns like #ThisIsWhatAnxietyFeelsLike, which helped turn anxiety \u2014 a disorder that afflicts some 40 million American adults \u2014 into a kind of rights movement. \u201cPeople with anxiety were previously labeled dramatic,\u201d said Sarah Fader, the Brooklyn social media consultant who also runs a mental-health advocacy organization called Stigma Fighters. \u201cNow we are seen as human beings with a legitimate mental health challenge.\u201d\u2014 What details from the article, if any, resonate with your own experiences with anxiety and stress, or in observing anxiety and stress in others?\u2014 Which of the causes of anxiety that are identified in the article do you think are the most harmful?

So it was with Google and its self-driving car project.Several years ago, Google thought it was a good idea to ask a number of its employees to use the company\u2019s self-driving cars on their daily commutes to the office. The company recorded what the engineers did while the machine did the driving; what it found was, as a company spokesman put it, \u201cegregious\u201d behavior.In other words, the employees were not paying attention to the road. And that\u2019s a problem when self-driving cars are designed to hand control back to the driver in an emergency.The results of Google\u2019s experiment unnerved the autonomous-car developers enough that they went back to the drawing board. Instead of trying to manage the handoff between machine and man, Google decided to keep at it until the company had a vehicle that could handle every bit of the driving \u2014 so much so, in fact, that later prototypes didn\u2019t even have steering wheels or brake pedals.That cars will one day drive themselves seems to many technologists just a matter of time.

{"Headline": "Greetings, E.T. (Please Don\u2019t Murder Us.)", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byFeatureTo celebrate the reopening, the astronomers who maintained the observatory decided to take the most sensitive device yet constructed for listening to the cosmos and transform it, briefly, into a machine for talking back. After a series of speeches, the assembled crowd sat in silence at the edge of the telescope while the public-address system blasted nearly three minutes of two-tone noise through the muggy afternoon heat. To the listeners, the pattern was indecipherable, but somehow the experience of hearing those two notes oscillating in the air moved many in the crowd to tears.That 168 seconds of noise, now known as the Arecibo message, was the brainchild of the astronomer Frank Drake, then the director of the organization that oversaw the Arecibo facility. The broadcast marked the first time a human being had intentionally transmitted a message targeting another solar system. The engineers had translated the missive into sound, so that the assembled group would have something to experience during the transmission. But its true medium was the silent, invisible pulse of radio waves, traveling at the speed of light.It seemed to most of the onlookers to be a hopeful act, if a largely symbolic one: a message in a bottle tossed into the sea of deep space. But within days, the Royal Astronomer of England, Martin Ryle, released a thunderous condemnation of Drake\u2019s stunt. By alerting the cosmos of our existence, Ryle wrote, we were risking catastrophe. Arguing that \u2018\u2018any creatures out there [might be] malevolent or hungry,\u2019\u2019 Ryle demanded that the International Astronomical Union denounce Drake\u2019s message and explicitly forbid any further communications. It was irresponsible, Ryle fumed, to tinker with interstellar outreach when such gestures, however noble their intentions, might lead to the destruction of all life on earth.In its intended goal of communicating with life-forms outside our planet, the Arecibo message has surprisingly sparse company. Perhaps the most famous is housed aboard the Voyager 1 spacecraft \u2014 a gold-plated audiovisual disc, containing multilingual greetings and other evidence of human civilization \u2014 which slipped free of our solar system just a few years ago, traveling at a relatively sluggish 35,000 miles per hour. By contrast, at the end of the three-minute transmission of the Arecibo message, its initial pulses had already reached the orbit of Mars. The entire message took less than a day to leave the solar system.In the age of radio telescopes, scientists have spent far more energy trying to look for signs that other life might exist than they have signaling the existence of our own. Drake himself is now more famous for inaugurating the modern search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) nearly 60 years ago, when he used a telescope in West Virginia to scan two stars for structured radio waves. Today the nonprofit SETI Institute oversees a network of telescopes and computers listening for signs of intelligence in deep space. A new SETI-like project called Breakthrough Listen, funded by a $100 million grant from the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, promises to radically increase our ability to detect signs of intelligent life. As a species, we are gathered around more interstellar mailboxes than ever before, waiting eagerly for a letter to arrive. But we have, until recently, shown little interest in sending our own.Now this taciturn phase may be coming to an end, if a growing multidisciplinary group of scientists and amateur space enthusiasts have their way. A newly formed group known as METI (Messaging Extra Terrestrial Intelligence), led by the former SETI scientist Douglas Vakoch, is planning an ongoing series of messages to begin in 2018. And Milner\u2019s Breakthrough Listen endeavor has also promised to support a \u2018\u2018Breakthrough Message\u2019\u2019 companion project, including an open competition to design the messages that we will transmit to the stars. But as messaging schemes proliferate, they have been met with resistance. The intellectual descendants of Martin Ryle include luminaries like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, and they caution that an assumption of interstellar friendship is the wrong way to approach the question of extraterrestrial life. They argue that an advanced alien civilization might well respond to our interstellar greetings with the same graciousness that Cort\u00e9s showed the Aztecs, making silence the more prudent option.If you believe that these broadcasts have a plausible chance of making contact with an alien intelligence, the choice to send them must rank as one of the most important decisions we will ever make as a species. Are we going to be galactic introverts, huddled behind the door and merely listening for signs of life outside? Or are we going to be extroverts, conversation-starters? And if it\u2019s the latter, what should we say?The Interval seemed like a fitting backdrop for my first meeting with Doug Vakoch, in part because Long Now has been advising METI on its message plans and in part because the whole concept of sending interstellar messages is the epitome of long-term decision-making. The choice to send a message into space is one that may well not generate a meaningful outcome for a thousand years, or a hundred thousand. It is hard to imagine any decision confronting humanity that has a longer time horizon.As Vakoch and I settled into a booth, I asked him how he found his way to his current vocation. \u2018\u2018I liked science when I was a kid, but I couldn\u2019t make up my mind which science,\u2019\u2019 he told me. Eventually, he found out about a burgeoning new field of study known as exobiology, or sometimes astrobiology, that examined the possible forms life could take on other planets. The field was speculative by nature: After all, its researchers had no actual specimens to study. To imagine other forms of life in the universe, exobiologists had to be versed in the astrophysics of stars and planets; the chemical reactions that could capture and store energy in these speculative organisms; the climate science that explains the weather systems on potentially life-compatible planets; the biological forms that might evolve in those different environments. With exobiology, Vakoch realized, he didn\u2019t have to settle on one discipline: \u2018\u2018When you think about life outside the earth, you get to dabble in all of them.\u2019\u2019As early as high school, Vakoch began thinking about how you might communicate with an organism that had evolved on another planet, the animating question of a relatively obscure subfield of exobiology known as exosemiotics. By the time Vakoch reached high school in the 1970s, radio astronomy had advanced far enough to turn exosemiotics from a glorified thought experiment into something slightly more practical. Vakoch did a science-fair project on interstellar languages, and he continued to follow the field during his college years, even as he was studying comparative religion at Carleton College in Minnesota. \u2018\u2018The issue that really hit me early on, and that has stayed with me, is just the challenge of creating a message that would be understandable,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch says. Hedging his bets, he pursued a graduate degree in clinical psychology, thinking it might help him better understand the mind of some unknown organism across the universe. If the exosemiotics passion turned out to be a dead end professionally, he figured that he could always retreat back to a more traditional career path as a psychologist.During Vakoch\u2019s graduate years, SETI was transforming itself from a NASA program sustained by government funding to an independent nonprofit organization, supported in part by the new fortunes of the tech sector. Vakoch moved to California and joined SETI in 1999. In the years that followed, Vakoch and other scientists involved in the program grew increasingly vocal in their argument for sending messages as well as listening for them. The \u2018\u2018passive\u2019\u2019 approach was essential, they argued, but an \u2018\u2018active\u2019\u2019 SETI \u2014 one targeting nearby star systems with high-powered radio signals \u2014 would increase the odds of contact. Concerned that embracing an active approach would imperil its funding, the SETI board resisted Vakoch\u2019s efforts. Eventually Vakoch decided to form his own international organization, METI, with a multidisciplinary team that includes the former NASA chief historian Steven J. Dick, the French science historian Florence Raulin Cerceau, the Indian ecologist Abhik Gupta and the Canadian anthropologist Jerome H. Barkow.The newfound interest in messaging has been piqued in large part by an explosion of newly discovered planets. We now know that the universe is teeming with planets occupying what exobiologists call \u2018\u2018the Goldilocks zone\u2019\u2019: not too hot and not too cold, with \u2018\u2018just right\u2019\u2019 surface temperatures capable of supporting liquid water. At the start of Drake\u2019s career in the 1950s, not a single planet outside our solar system had been observed. Today we can target a long list of potential Goldilocks-zone planets, not just distant clusters of stars. \u2018\u2018Now we know that virtually all stars have planets,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch says, adding that, of these stars, \u2018\u2018maybe one out of five have potentially habitable planets. So there\u2019s a lot of real estate that could be inhabited.\u2019\u2019When Frank Drake and Carl Sagan first began thinking about message construction in the 1960s, their approach was genuinely equivalent to the proverbial message in a bottle. Now, we may not know the exact addresses of planets where life is likely, but we have identified many promising ZIP codes. The recent discovery of the Trappist-1 planets, three of which are potentially habitable, triggered such excitement in part because those planets were, relatively speaking, so close to home: just 40 light-years from Earth. If the Arecibo message does somehow find its way to an advanced civilization in M13, word would not come back for at least 50,000 years. But a targeted message sent to Trappist-1 could generate a reply before the end of the century.Drake has been retired for more than a decade, but when I asked him about the Arecibo message, his face lit up at the memory. \u2018\u2018We had just finished a very big construction project at Arecibo, and I was director then, and so they said, \u2018Can you please arrange a big ceremony?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he recalled. \u2018\u2018We had to have some kind of eye-catching event for this ceremony. What could we do that would be spectacular? We could send a message!\u2019\u2019But how can you send a message to a life-form that may or may not exist and that you know nothing at all about, other than the fact that it evolved somewhere in the Milky Way? You need to start by explaining how the message is supposed to be read, which is known in exosemiotics as the \u2018\u2018primer.\u2019\u2019 You don\u2019t need a primer on Earth: You point to a cow, and you say, \u2018\u2018Cow.\u2019\u2019 The plaques that NASA sent into space with Pioneer and Voyager had the advantage of being physical objects that could convey visual information, which at least enables you to connect words with images of the objects they refer to. In other words, you draw a cow and then put the word \u2018\u2018cow\u2019\u2019 next to the drawing and slowly, with enough pointing, a language comes into view. But physical objects can\u2019t be moved fast enough to get to a potential recipient in useful time scales. You need electromagnetic waves if you want to reach across the Milky Way.But how do you point to something with a radio wave? Even if you figured out a way to somehow point to a cow with electromagnetic signals, the aliens aren\u2019t going to have cows in their world, which means the reference will most likely be lost on them. Instead, you need to think hard about the things that our hypothetical friends in the Trappist-1 system will have in common with us. If their civilization is advanced enough to recognize structured data in radio waves, they must share many of our scientific and technological concepts. If they are hearing our message, that means they are capable of parsing structured disturbances in the electromagnetic spectrum, which means they understand the electromagnetic spectrum in some meaningful way.The trick, then, is just getting the conversation started. Drake figured that he could count on intelligent aliens possessing the concept of simple numbers: one, three, 10, etc. And if they have numbers, then they will also very likely have the rest of what we know as basic math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Furthermore, Drake reasoned, if they have multiplication and division, then they are likely to understand the concept of prime numbers \u2014 the group of numbers that are divisible only by themselves and one. (In \u2018\u2018Contact,\u2019\u2019 the intercepted alien message begins with a long string of primes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on.) Many objects in space, like pulsars, send out radio signals with a certain periodicity: flashes of electromagnetic activity that switch on and off at regular rates. Primes, however, are a telltale sign of intelligent life. \u2018\u2018Nature never uses prime numbers,\u2019\u2019 Drake says. \u2018\u2018But mathematicians do.\u2019\u2019Drake\u2019s Arecibo message drew upon a close relative of the prime numbers to construct its message. He chose to send exactly 1,679 pulses, because 1,679 is a semiprime number: a number that can be formed only by multiplying two prime numbers together, in this case 73 and 23. Drake used that mathematical quirk to turn his pulses of electromagnetic energy into a visual system. To simplify his approach, imagine I send you a message consisting of 10 X\u2019s and 5 O\u2019s: XOXOXXXXOXXOXOX. You notice that the number 15 is a semi-prime number, and so you organize the symbols in a 3-by-5 grid and leave the O\u2019s as blank spaces. The result is this:If you were an English speaker, you might just recognize a greeting in that message, the word \u2018\u2018HI\u2019\u2019 mapped out using only a binary language of on-and-off states.Drake took the same approach, only using a much larger semiprime, which gave him a 23-by-73 grid to send a more complicated message. Because his imagined correspondents in M13 were not likely to understand any human language, he filled the grid with a mix of mathematical and visual referents. The top of the grid counted from one to 10 in binary code \u2014 effectively announcing to the aliens that numbers will be represented using these symbols.Having established a way of counting, Drake then moved to connect the concept of numbers to some reference that the citizens of M13 would likely share with us. For this step, he encoded the atomic numbers for five elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorous, the building blocks of DNA. Other parts of the message were more visually oriented. Drake used the on-off pulses of the radio signal to \u2018\u2018draw\u2019\u2019 a pixelated image of a human body. He also included a sketch of our solar system and of the Arecibo telescope itself. The message said, in effect: This is how we count; this is what we are made of; this is where we came from; this is what we look like; and this is the technology we are using to send this message to you.One of the most recent planets added to that list orbits the star Gliese 411, a red dwarf located eight light-years away from Earth. On a spring evening in the Oakland hills, our own sun putting on a spectacular display as it slowly set over the Golden Gate Bridge, Vakoch and I met at one of the observatories at the Chabot Space and Science Center to take a peek at Gliese 411. A half moon overhead reduced our visibility but not so much that I couldn\u2019t make out the faint tangerine glimmer of the star, a single blurred point of light that had traveled nearly 50 trillion miles across the universe to land on my retina. Even with the power of the Oakland telescope, there was no way to spot a planet orbiting the red dwarf. But in February of this year, a team of researchers using the Keck I telescope at the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii announced that they had detected a \u2018\u2018super-earth\u2019\u2019 in orbit around Gliese, a rocky and hot planet larger than our own.The METI group aims to improve on the Arecibo message not just by targeting specific planets, like that super-earth orbiting Gliese, but also by rethinking the nature of the message itself. \u2018\u2018Drake\u2019s original design plays into the bias that vision is universal among intelligent life,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch told me. Visual diagrams \u2014 whether formed through semiprime grids or engraved on plaques \u2014 seem like a compelling way to encode information to us because humans happen to have evolved an unusually acute sense of vision. But perhaps the aliens followed a different evolutionary path and found their way to a technologically advanced civilization with an intelligence that was rooted in some other sense: hearing, for example, or some other way of perceiving the world around them for which there is no earthly equivalent.Like so much of the SETI/METI debate, the question of visual messaging quickly spirals out into a deeper meditation, in this instance on the connection between intelligence and visual acuity. It is no accident that eyes developed independently so many times over the course of evolution on Earth, given the fact that light conveys information faster than any other conduit. That transmission-speed advantage would presumably apply on other planets in the Goldilocks zone, even if they happened to be on the other side of the Milky Way, and so it seems plausible that intelligent creatures would evolve some sort of visual system as well.But even more universal than sight would be the experience of time. Hans Freudenthal\u2019s \u2018\u2018Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse,\u2019\u2019 a seminal book of exosemiotics published more than a half-century ago, relied heavily on temporal cues in its primer stage. Vakoch and his collaborators have been working with Freudenthal\u2019s language in their early drafts for the message. In Lincos, duration is used as a key building block. A pulse that lasts for a certain stretch (say, in human terms, one second) is followed by a sequence of pulses that signify the \u2018\u2018word\u2019\u2019 for one; a pulse that lasts for six seconds is followed by the word for six. The words for basic math properties can be conveyed by combining pulses of different lengths. You might demonstrate the property of addition by sending the word for \u2018\u2018three\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018six\u2019\u2019 and then sending a pulse that lasts for nine seconds. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a way of being able to point at objects when you don\u2019t have anything right in front of you,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch explains.Other messaging enthusiasts think we needn\u2019t bother worrying about primers and common referents. \u2018\u2018Forget about sending mathematical relationships, the value of pi, prime numbers or the Fibonacci series,\u2019\u2019 the senior SETI astronomer, Seth Shostak, argued in a 2009 book. \u2018\u2018No, if we want to broadcast a message from Earth, I propose that we just feed the Google servers into the transmitter. Send the aliens the World Wide Web. It would take half a year or less to transmit this in the microwave; using infrared lasers shortens the transmit time to no more than two days.\u2019\u2019 Shostak believes that the sheer magnitude of the transmitted data would enable the aliens to decipher it. There is some precedent for this in the history of archaeologists studying dead languages: The hardest code to crack is one with only a few fragments.Sending all of Google would be a logical continuation of Drake\u2019s 1974 message, in terms of content if not encoding. \u2018\u2018The thing about the Arecibo message is that, in a sense, it\u2019s brief but its intent is encyclopedic,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch told me as we waited for the sky to darken in the Oakland hills. \u2018\u2018One of the things that we are exploring for our transmission is the opposite extreme. Rather than being encyclopedic, being selective. Instead of this huge digital data dive, trying to do something elegant. Part of that is thinking about what are the most fundamental concepts we need.\u2019\u2019 There is something provocative about the question Vakoch is wrestling with here: Of all the many manifestations of our achievements as a species, what\u2019s the simplest message we can create that will signal that we\u2019re interesting, worthy of an interstellar reply?But to METI\u2019s critics, what he should be worrying about instead is the form that the reply might take: a death ray, or an occupying army.One signatory to that statement was the astronomer and science-fiction author David Brin, who has been carrying on a spirited but collegial series of debates with Vakoch over the wisdom of his project. \u2018\u2018I just don\u2019t think anybody should give our children a fait accompli based on blithe assumptions and assertions that have been untested and not subjected to critical peer review,\u2019\u2019 he told me over a Skype call from his home office in Southern California. \u2018\u2018If you are going to do something that is going to change some of the fundamental observable parameters of our solar system, then how about an environmental-impact statement?\u2019\u2019The anti-METI movement is predicated on a grim statistical likelihood: If we do ever manage to make contact with another intelligent life-form, then almost by definition, our new pen pals will be far more advanced than we are. The best way to understand this is to consider, on a percentage basis, just how young our own high-tech civilization actually is. We have been sending structured radio signals from Earth for only the last 100 years. If the universe were exactly 14 billion years old, then it would have taken 13,999,999,900 years for radio communication to be harnessed on our planet. The odds that our message would reach a society that had been tinkering with radio for a shorter, or even similar, period of time would be staggeringly long. Imagine another planet that deviates from our timetable by just a tenth of 1 percent: If they are more advanced than us, then they will have been using radio (and successor technologies) for 14 million years. Of course, depending on where they live in the universe, their signals might take millions of years to reach us. But even if you factor in that transmission lag, if we pick up a signal from another galaxy, we will almost certainly find ourselves in conversation with a more advanced civilization.It is this asymmetry that has convinced so many future-minded thinkers that METI is a bad idea. The history of colonialism here on Earth weighs particularly heavy on the imaginations of the METI critics. Stephen Hawking, for instance, made this observation in a 2010 documentary series: \u2018\u2018If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn\u2019t turn out well for the Native Americans.\u2019\u2019 David Brin echoes the Hawking critique: \u2018\u2018Every single case we know of a more technologically advanced culture contacting a less technologically advanced culture resulted at least in pain.\u2019\u2019METI proponents counter the critics with two main arguments. The first is essentially that the horse has already left the barn: Given that we have been \u2018\u2018leaking\u2019\u2019 radio waves in the form of \u2018\u2018Leave It to Beaver\u2019\u2019 and the nightly news for decades, and given that other civilizations are likely to be far more advanced than we are, and thus capable of detecting even weak signals, then it seems likely that we are already visible to extraterrestrials. In other words, they know we\u2019re here, but they haven\u2019t considered us to be worthy of conversation yet. \u2018\u2018Maybe in fact there are a lot more civilizations out there, and even nearby planets are populated, but they\u2019re simply observing us,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch argues. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s as if we are in some galactic zoo, and if they\u2019ve been watching us, it\u2019s like watching zebras talking to one another. But what if one of those zebras suddenly turns toward you and with its hooves starts scratching out the prime numbers. You\u2019d relate to that zebra differently!\u2019\u2019Brin thinks that argument dangerously underestimates the difference between a high-power, targeted METI transmission and the passive leakage of media signals, which are far more difficult to detect. \u2018\u2018Think about it this way: If you want to communicate with a Boy Scout camp on the other side of the lake, you could kneel down at the end of the lake and slap the water in Morse code,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018And if they are spectacularly technologically advanced Boy Scouts who happened also to be looking your way, they might build instruments that would be able to parse out your Morse code. But then you whip out your laser-pointer and point it at their dock. That is exactly the order of magnitude difference between picking up [reruns of] \u2018I Love Lucy\u2019 from the 1980s, when we were at our noisiest, and what these guys want to do.\u2019\u2019METI defenders also argue that the threat of some Klingon-style invasion is implausible, given the distances involved. If, in fact, advanced civilizations were capable of zipping around the galaxy at the speed of light, we would have already encountered them. The much more likely situation is that only communications can travel that fast, and so a malevolent presence on some distant planet will only be able to send us hate mail. But critics think that sense of security is unwarranted. Writing in Scientific American, the former chairman of SETI, John Gertz, argued that \u2018\u2018a civilization with malign intent that is only modestly more advanced than we are might be able to annihilate Earth with ease by means of a small projectile filled with a self-replicating toxin or nano gray goo; a kinetic missile traveling at an appreciable percentage of the speed of light; or weaponry beyond our imagination.\u2019\u2019Brin looks to our own technological progress as a sign of where a more advanced civilization might be in terms of interstellar combat: \u2018\u2018It is possible that within just 50 years, we could create an antimatter rocket that could propel a substantial pellet of several kilograms, at half the speed of light at times to intersect with the orbit of a planet within 10 light-years of us.\u2019\u2019 Even a few kilograms colliding at that speed would produce an explosion much greater than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki detonations combined. \u2018\u2018And if we could do that in 50 years, imagine what anybody else could do, completely obeying Einstein and the laws of physics.\u2019\u2019Interestingly, Frank Drake himself is not a supporter of the METI efforts, though he does not share Hawking and Musk\u2019s fear of interstellar conquistadors. \u2018\u2018We send messages all the time, free of charge,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a big shell out there now 80 light-years around us. A civilization only a little more advanced than we are can pick those things up. So the point is we are already sending copious amounts of information.\u2019\u2019 Drake believes that any other advanced civilization out there must be doing the same, so scientists like Vakoch should devote themselves to picking up on that chatter instead of trying to talk back. METI will consume resources, Drake says, that would be \u2018\u2018better spent listening and not sending.\u2019\u2019N= R* x \u0192p x ne x \u0192l x \u0192i x \u0192c x LN represents the number of extant, communicative civilizations in the Milky Way. The initial variable R* corresponds to the rate of star formation in the galaxy, effectively giving you the total number of potential suns that could support life. The remaining variables then serve as a kind of nested sequence of filters: Given the number of stars in the Milky Way, what fraction of those have planets, and how many of those have an environment that can support life? On those potentially hospitable planets, how often does life itself actually emerge, and what fraction of that life evolves into intelligent life, and what fraction of that life eventually leads to a civilization\u2019s transmitting detectable signals into space? At the end of his equation, Drake placed the crucial variable L, which is the average length of time during which those civilizations emit those signals.What makes the Drake Equation so mesmerizing is in part the way it forces the mind to yoke together so many different intellectual disciplines in a single framework. As you move from left to right in the equation, you shift from astrophysics, to the biochemistry of life, to evolutionary theory, to cognitive science, all the way to theories of technological development. Your guess about each value in the Drake Equation winds up revealing a whole worldview: Perhaps you think life is rare, but when it does emerge, intelligent life usually follows; or perhaps you think microbial life is ubiquitous throughout the cosmos, but more complex organisms almost never form. The equation is notoriously vulnerable to very different outcomes, depending on the numbers you assign to each variable.The most provocative value is the last one: L, the average life span of a signal-transmitting civilization. You don\u2019t have to be a Pollyanna to defend a relatively high L value. All you need is to believe that it is possible for civilizations to become fundamentally self-sustaining and survive for millions of years. Even if one in a thousand intelligent life-forms in space generates a million-year civilization, the value of L increases meaningfully. But if your L-value is low, that implies a further question: What is keeping it low? Do technological civilizations keep flickering on and off in the Milky Way, like so many fireflies in space? Do they run out of resources? Do they blow themselves up?Since Drake first sketched out the equation in 1961, two fundamental developments have reshaped our understanding of the problem. First, the numbers on the left-hand side of the equation (representing the amount of stars with habitable planets) have increased by several orders of magnitude. And second, we have been listening for signals for decades and heard nothing. As Brin puts it: \u2018\u2018Something is keeping the Drake Equation small. And the difference between all the people in the SETI debates is not whether that\u2019s true, but where in the Drake panoply the fault lies.\u2019\u2019If the left-hand values keep getting bigger and bigger, the question is which variables on the right-hand side are the filters. As Brin puts it, we want the filter to be behind us, not the one variable, L, that still lies ahead of us. We want the emergence of intelligent life to be astonishingly rare; if the opposite is true, and intelligent life is abundant in the Milky Way, then L values might be low, perhaps measured in centuries and not even millenniums. In that case, the adoption of a technologically advanced lifestyle might be effectively simultaneous with extinction. First you invent radio, then you invent technologies capable of destroying all life on your planet and shortly thereafter you push the button and your civilization goes dark.The L-value question explains why so many of METI\u2019s opponents \u2014 like Musk and Hawking \u2014 are also concerned with the threat of extinction-level events triggered by other potential threats: superintelligent computers, runaway nanobots, nuclear weapons, asteroids. In a low L-value universe, planet-wide annihilation is an imminent possibility. Even if a small fraction of alien civilizations out there would be inclined to shoot a two-kilogram pellet toward us at half the speed of light, is it worth sending a message if there\u2019s even the slightest chance that the reply could result in the destruction of all life on earth?Other, more benign, explanations for the Fermi Paradox exist. Drake himself is pessimistic about the L value, but not for dystopian reasons. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s because we\u2019re getting better at technology,\u2019\u2019 he says. The modern descendants of the TV and radio towers that inadvertently sent Elvis to the stars are far more efficient in terms of the power they use, which means the \u2018\u2018leaked\u2019\u2019 signals emanating from Earth are far fainter than they were in the 1950s. In fact, we increasingly share information via fiber optics and other terrestrial conduits that have zero leakage outside our atmosphere. Perhaps technologically advanced societies do flicker on and off like fireflies, but it\u2019s not a sign that they\u2019re self-destructive; it\u2019s just a sign that they got cable.But to some METI critics, even a less-apocalyptic interpretation of the Fermi Paradox still suggests caution. Perhaps advanced civilizations tend to reach a point at which they decide, for some unknown reason, that it is in their collective best interest not to transmit any detectable signal to their neighbors in the Milky Way. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s the other answer for the Fermi Paradox,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch says with a smile. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a Stephen Hawking on every planet, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t hear from them.\u2019\u2019There is something about the METI question that forces the mind to stretch beyond its usual limits. You have to imagine some radically different form of intelligence, using only your human intelligence. You have to imagine time scales on which a decision made in 2017 might trigger momentous consequences 10,000 years from now. The sheer magnitude of those consequences challenges our usual measures of cause and effect. Whether you believe that the aliens are likely to be warriors or Zen masters, if you think that METI has a reasonable chance of making contact with another intelligent organism somewhere in the Milky Way, then you have to accept that this small group of astronomers and science-fiction authors and billionaire patrons debating semi-prime numbers and the ubiquity of visual intelligence may in fact be wrestling with a decision that could prove to be the most transformative one in the history of human civilization.All of which takes us back to a much more down-to-earth, but no less challenging, question: Who gets to decide? After many years of debate, the SETI community established an agreed-\u00adupon procedure that scientists and government agencies should follow in the event that the SETI searches actually stumble upon an intelligible signal from space. The protocols specifically ordain that \u2018\u2018no response to a signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence should be sent until appropriate international consultations have taken place.\u2019\u2019 But an equivalent set of guidelines does not yet exist to govern our own interstellar outreach.One of the most thoughtful participants in the METI debate, Kathryn Denning, an anthropologist at York University in Toronto, has argued that our decisions about extraterrestrial contact are ultimately more political than scientific. \u2018\u2018If I had to take a position, I\u2019d say that broad consultation regarding METI is essential, and so I greatly respect the efforts in that direction,\u2019\u2019 Denning says. \u2018\u2018But no matter how much consultation there is, it\u2019s inevitable that there will be significant disagreement about the advisability of transmitting, and I don\u2019t think this is the sort of thing where a simple majority vote or even supermajority should carry the day .\u2009.\u2009. so this keeps bringing us back to the same key question: Is it O.K. for some people to transmit messages at significant power when other people don\u2019t want them to?\u2019\u2019In a sense, the METI debate runs parallel to other existential decisions that we will be confronting in the coming decades, as our technological and scientific powers increase. Should we create superintelligent machines that exceed our own intellectual capabilities by such a wide margin that we cease to understand how their intelligence works? Should we \u2018\u2018cure\u2019\u2019 death, as many technologists are proposing? Like METI, these are potentially among the most momentous decisions human beings will ever make, and yet the number of people actively participating in those decisions \u2014 or even aware such decisions are being made \u2014 is minuscule.\u2018\u2018I think we need to rethink the message process so that we are sending a series of increasingly inclusive messages,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch says. \u2018\u2018Any message that we initially send would be too narrow, too incomplete. But that\u2019s O.K. Instead, what we should be doing is thinking about how to make the next round of messages better and more inclusive. We ideally want a way to incorporate both technical expertise \u2014 people who have been thinking about these issues from a range of different disciplines \u2014 and also getting lay input. I think it\u2019s often been one or the other. One way we can get lay input in a way that makes a difference in terms of message content is to survey people about what sorts of things they would want to say. It\u2019s important to see what the general themes are that people would want to say and then translate those into a Lincos-like message.\u2019\u2019When I asked Denning where she stands on the METI issue, she told me: \u2018\u2018I have to answer that question with a question: Why are you asking me? Why should my opinion matter more than that of a 6-year-old girl in Namibia? We both have exactly the same amount at stake, arguably, she more than I, since the odds of being dead before any consequences of transmission occur are probably a bit higher for me, assuming she has access to clean water and decent health care and isn\u2019t killed far too young in war.\u2019\u2019 She continued: \u2018\u2018I think the METI debate may be one of those rare topics where scientific knowledge is highly relevant to the discussion, but its connection to obvious policy is tenuous at best, because in the final analysis, it\u2019s all about how much risk the people of Earth are willing to tolerate. .\u2009.\u2009. And why exactly should astronomers, cosmologists, physicists, anthropologists, psychologists, sociologists, biologists, sci-fi authors or anyone else (in no particular order), get to decide what those tolerances should be?\u2019\u2019Wrestling with the METI question suggests, to me at least, that the one invention human society needs is more conceptual than technological: We need to define a special class of decisions that potentially create extinction-level risk. New technologies (like superintelligent computers) or interventions (like METI) that pose even the slightest risk of causing human extinction would require some novel form of global oversight. And part of that process would entail establishing, as Denning suggests, some measure of risk tolerance on a planetary level. If we don\u2019t, then by default the gamblers will always set the agenda, and the rest of us will have to live with the consequences of their wagers.In 2017, the idea of global oversight on any issue, however existential the threat it poses, may sound na\u00efve. It may also be that technologies have their own inevitability, and we can only rein them in for so long: If contact with aliens is technically possible, then someone, somewhere is going to do it soon enough. There is not a lot of historical precedent for humans voluntarily swearing off a new technological capability \u2014 or choosing not to make contact with another society \u2014 because of some threat that might not arrive for generations. But maybe it\u2019s time that humans learned how to make that kind of choice. This turns out to be one of the surprising gifts of the METI debate, whichever side you happen to take. Thinking hard about what kinds of civilization we might be able to talk to ends up making us think even harder about what kind of civilization we want to be ourselves.Near the end of my conversation with Frank Drake, I came back to the question of our increasingly quiet planet: all those inefficient radio and television signals giving way to the undetectable transmissions of the internet age. Maybe that\u2019s the long-term argument for sending intentional messages, I suggested; even if it fails in our lifetime, we will have created a signal that might enable an interstellar connection thousands of years from now.Drake leaned forward, nodding. \u2018\u2018It raises a very interesting, nonscientific question, which is: Are extraterrestrial civilizations altruistic? Do they recognize this problem and establish a beacon for the benefit of the other folks out there? My answer is: I think it\u2019s actually Darwinian; I think evolution favors altruistic societies. So my guess is yes. And that means there might be one powerful signal for each civilization.\u2019\u2019 Given the transit time across the universe, that signal might well outlast us as a species, in which case it might ultimately serve as a memorial as much as a message, like an interstellar version of the Great Pyramids: proof that a technologically advanced organism evolved on this planet, whatever that organism\u2019s ultimate fate.As I stared at Drake\u2019s stained-glass Arecibo message, in the middle of that redwood grove, it seemed to me that an altruistic civilization \u2014 one that wanted to reach across the cosmos in peace \u2014 would be something to aspire to, despite the potential for risk. Do we want to be the sort of civilization that boards up the windows and pretends that no one is home, for fear of some unknown threat lurking in the dark sky? Or do we want to be a beacon?An article on July 2 about new efforts to contact extraterrestrials misstated the impact a few kilograms traveling half the speed of light would have if they collided with Earth. The impact would be less than that of the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs, not more.Steven Johnson is the author of 10 books, most recently \u2018\u2018Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delete Hate Speech or Pay Up, Germany Tells Social Media Companies", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Social media companies operating in Germany face fines of as much as $57 million if they do not delete illegal, racist or slanderous comments and posts within 24 hours under a law passed on Friday.The law reinforces Germany\u2019s position as one of the most aggressive countries in the Western world at forcing companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter to crack down on hate speech and other extremist messaging on their digital platforms.Technology companies and free speech advocates argue that there is a fine line between policy makers\u2019 views on hate speech and what is considered legitimate freedom of expression, and social networks say they do not want to be forced to censor those who use their services. Silicon Valley companies also deny that they are failing to meet countries\u2019 demands to remove suspected hate speech online.\u201cWith this law, we put an end to the verbal law of the jungle on the internet and protect the freedom of expression for all,\u201d Mr. Maas said. \u201cWe are ensuring that everyone can express their opinion freely, without being insulted or threatened.\u201d\u201cThat is not a limitation, but a prerequisite for freedom of expression,\u201d he continued.The law will take effect in October, less than a month after nationwide elections, and will apply to social media sites with more than two million users in Germany.It will require companies including Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, to remove any content that is illegal in Germany \u2014 such as Nazi symbols or Holocaust denial \u2014 within 24 hours of it being brought to their attention.The law allows for up to seven days for the companies to decide on content that has been flagged as offensive, but that may not be clearly defamatory or inciting violence. Companies that persistently fail to address complaints by taking too long to delete illegal content face fines that start at 5 million euros, or $5.7 million, and could rise to as much as \u20ac50 million.Every six months, companies will have to publicly report the number of complaints they have received and how they have handled them.In Germany, which has some of the most stringent anti-hate speech laws in the Western world, a study published this year found that Facebook and Twitter had failed to meet a national target of removing 70 percent of online hate speech within 24 hours of being alerted to its presence.The report noted that while the two companies eventually erased almost all of the illegal hate speech, Facebook managed to remove only 39 percent within 24 hours, as demanded by the German authorities. Twitter met that deadline in 1 percent of instances. YouTube fared significantly better, removing 90 percent of flagged content within a day of being notified.Facebook said on Friday that the company shared the German government\u2019s goal of fighting hate speech and had \u201cbeen working hard\u201d to resolve the issue of illegal content. The company announced in May that it would nearly double, to 7,500, the number of employees worldwide devoted to clearing its site of flagged postings. It was also trying to improve the processes by which users could report problems, a spokesman said.Twitter declined to comment, while Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The standoff between tech companies and politicians is most acute in Europe, where freedom of expression rights are less comprehensive than in the United States, and where policy makers have often bristled at Silicon Valley\u2019s dominance of people\u2019s digital lives.But advocacy groups in Europe have raised concerns over the new German law.\u201cSetting the rules of the digital public square, including the identification of what is lawful and what is not, should not be left to private companies,\u201d they wrote.Even in the United States, Facebook and Google also have taken steps to limit the spread of extremist messaging online, and to prevent \u201cfake news\u201d from circulating. That includes using artificial intelligence to remove potentially extremist material automatically and banning news sites believed to spread fake or misleading reports from making money through the companies\u2019 digital advertising platforms.An article on Saturday about Germany\u2019s new law to crack down on hate speech in social media misstated the surname of a member of the Global Public Policy Institute who criticized the legislation.

{"Headline": "Oracle Arena vs. Quicken Loans: Like Night and Day (or Warriors and Cavs)", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byCLEVELAND \u2014 Sports arenas for successful franchises can sometimes seem interchangeably generic, all noise and flash and money. But if there are two places that can be said to reflect the character and ethos of the teams that play within them, they are surely the basketball arenas in Oakland, Calif., and Cleveland.You might start with their names: Oracle Arena, named after a multinational computer technology company based in the rich community of Redwood Shores, Calif.; and Quicken Loans Arena, named after a national mortgage company based in downtown Detroit. (Some people in Cleveland call it the Q, but Quicken Loans it is.)As is so often the case with places in California, Oracle is situated right off the highway. It\u2019s hard to get there without driving or using public transportation. In Cleveland, by contrast, Quicken Loans is right downtown, next to the Cuyahoga River.Speak to Warriors fans at a home game, and they\u2019ll tell you straight out how much they love their team and who wouldn\u2019t? Have the same conversation in Cleveland, and Cavaliers fans will answer with passionate reveries about their love for their city, and how city and team are symbiotically linked.They\u2019ll mention Cleveland\u2019s old reputation as a symbol of backwater parochialism and Rust Belt decline, and how all that has changed with a resurgent economy, the improved fortunes of the Cavaliers and also the Indians, and the Republican National Committee\u2019s decision to hold its convention here last year.\u201cBut now the city is really wonderful,\u201d Smart said.The contrast between the two arenas has become only more striking now that they are the sites for this year\u2019s finals. Last Sunday, when Golden State was pounding Cleveland in Game 2 \u2014 the Warriors now lead the series, three games to one \u2014 the mood at Oracle Arena was brash, self-congratulatory, unsurprised, as if the Warriors\u2019 dominance was as much a natural right as the shiny presence of the Teslas, Priuses and Porsches that dotted the parking lot outside.Oracle Arena can have a kind of improvisational feel, as if it just now happens to be home to the endless party that is the world\u2019s best basketball team. But it never lets you forget that its fans live in Northern California, with all its attendant preoccupations.\u201cA lot of people want gluten-free hot dogs or burgers,\u201d said Delilah Gaden, who works at an Oracle concession stand featuring (healthy) grilled food. \u201cOr they\u2019ll ask what kind of oil is in the popcorn, or if we use real butter.\u201d The veggie burgers are the same kind you can get at Whole Foods, Gaden noted, adding, \u201cJust because they\u2019re fans, doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t also be vegetarians.\u201dThat makes sense, said Mark Figueiredo, 46, a businessman and longtime Warriors fan who was buying Chinese food (MSG-free) at Oracle during Game 2 on Sunday.\u201cA lot of people are allergic to gluten,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between the Bay Area and the Midwest. Vegans, vegetarians, fruitarians, pescatarians \u2014 we have it all here.\u201d (That, and Larry Page of Google, who was sitting in front of him at Game 1, he said.)At Quicken Loans, even the food stands were Cleveland-themed. Cleveland on the Rocks was the name of a bar in the concourse, with \u201con the\u201d written in tiny letters, inside the \u201co\u201d in Rocks. Another stand featured \u201cThe Best Chefs in the Land\u201d and their signature dishes, including \u201cChef Heather Haviland\u2019s Reuben Balls,\u201d basically Reuben sandwiches shaped into balls, coated with bread crumbs and deep fried.\u201cSure, people here might ask about the ingredients if they have a peanut allergy or are vegetarians,\u201d said John Kitko, a salesman for a company selling erosion-control geotextile products, who was raising money for charity by volunteering at the Quicken Loans Quaker Steak and Lube concession stand. (\u201cLube,\u201d in this context, means beer.) \u201cBut in Cleveland you\u2019re going to get some nice cooked kielbasa and pierogies.\u201dThe songs blaring from the loudspeakers before Game 3 included \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019 \u201d by Journey and \u201cDream On\u201d by Aerosmith. When the drum fill in Phil Collins\u2019s \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d came on, a whole hallway of Cleveland men began reflexively air-drumming.The Warriors have their share of passionate fans who stuck around during the ignominious years and are now reveling in their current great fortune. But the come-lately fans from the Bay Area\u2019s high-tech world, old-time fans say, have changed the experience, pricing out some of the locals. Tickets for the finals, they said, can easily resell for $5,000.Some fans wistfully recalled the days when you could buy a family package \u2014 four seats, four meals \u2014 for under $100. \u201cIf you\u2019re a middle-class kid, you can\u2019t afford it anymore,\u201d said Albert Blackwell, 60, a doorman in his 17th season as a fan, whose Game 2 ticket was a gift from a friend.At Oracle, people were not spending a ton of time thinking about Cleveland. But in Cleveland, at least in the fans\u2019 minds, the contrast was striking.\u201cThey\u2019re shiny and glossy and fueled by tech money and start-ups,\u201d said Pradeep Giri, 33, a manager at PricewaterhouseCooper. \u201cBut we\u2019re a lunch-pail, blue-collar team. They have Eddy Cue and the Apple and Google execs down on the floor. Here we have the guy who owns 20 car dealerships.\u201d\u201cThe popular television show \u2018The Drew Carey Show\u2019 was set in Cleveland,\u201d you read above one of the arena gates. \u201cCleveland\u2019s Willard Park is home to the world\u2019s largest rubber stamp,\u201d it says atop one of the women\u2019s bathrooms on the main concourse. And down the hall: \u201cCleveland\u2019s own Arthur Lovett invented the first padded bicycle seat in 1897.\u201dAs heartbroken as they were after the loss in Game 3, Cleveland fans said there was no need to lose faith in a city that has more than proved its worth to the rest of the country.\u201cWe\u2019ve had such a good run,\u201d Giri said. \u201cWe won the finals last year. The fact we made it this far, this is gravy.\u201dSo the Cleveland fans streamed out of the Q, dejected but not despairing. Their faith in the Cavaliers would more than pay off in Game 4 on Friday night. And besides, they also have the Indians. (Plus the Browns, a fixer-upper team that managed to win just one game last year, losing the other 15.)\u201cCleveland has an identity, a brotherhood \u2014 we\u2019ve been through so much,\u201d said Joel Bailey, 55, an executive in an electric company. (\u201cDon\u2019t hold that against me.\u201d) \u201cWe\u2019re Charlie Brown, and one day the Great Pumpkin will come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is a \u2018Regret Clause\u2019 a Good Idea for Cases of Academic Dishonesty?", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byStudent OpinionTo what extent is plagiarism or any form of academic dishonesty common in your school? Have you ever copied someone else\u2019s work and turned it in as your own? If so, were you caught in the act?What are the rules, and the penalties, for academic dishonesty in your school? Do you think those rules and penalties are fair and effective? Why or why not?College students have flooded into computer science courses across the country, recognizing them as an entree to coveted jobs at companies like Facebook and Google, not to mention the big prize: a start-up worth millions.The exploding interest in these courses, though, has coincided with an undesirable side effect: a spate of high-tech collegiate plagiarism. Students have been caught borrowing computer code from their friends or cribbing it from the internet.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about it, both inside a department as well as across the field,\u201d said Randy H. Katz, a professor in the electrical engineering and computer science department at the University of California, Berkeley, who discovered in one year that about 100 of his roughly 700 students in one class had violated the course policy on collaborating or copying code.Computer science professors are now delivering stern warnings at the start of each course, and, like colleagues in other subjects, deploy software to flag plagiarism. They have unearthed numerous examples of suspected cheating.At Brown University, more than half the 49 allegations of academic code violations last year involved cheating in computer science.At Stanford, the alma mater of the founders of Google, Snapchat and countless other internet wonders, as many as 20 percent of the students in one 2015 computer science course were flagged for possible cheating.In interviews, professors and students said the causes were not hard to pin down.\u201cYou\u2019ve got kids who were struggling with spending a third of their time on their problem sets with the option to copy from the internet,\u201d said Jackson Wagner, who took the Harvard course in 2015 and was not accused of copying. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why people cheat.\u201dComplicating matters is the collaborative ethos among programmers, which encourages code-sharing in ways that might not be acceptable in a class. Professors also frequently allow students to discuss problems among themselves, but not to share actual code, a policy that some students say creates confusion about what constitutes cheating.\u2014 Do you think academic dishonesty should be handled differently in computer programming classes than in other subjects? If so, how? If not, why not?\u2014 Is the Harvard professor David J. Malan\u2019s \u201cregret clause,\u201d which lets students who cheat and admit it within 72 hours receive an unsatisfactory or failing grade on the assignment, and avoid further discipline \u2014 unless they do it again \u2014 a good idea? Why or why not?\u2014 Would you use the \u201cregret clause\u201d if your teacher offered it after a test, and you needed it? Why or why not?Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

{"Headline": "A Slump in Tech Stocks That Leaves Some Investors Mystified", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byThe laws of gravity apparently apply to technology stocks after all.No one trigger related to the fundamentals of these companies spurred the snap back. As has been the case for years now, these technology giants sit on trillions of dollars in cash, are growing at a breakneck pace and, compared with companies in earlier tech frenzies, do not have absurd valuations.Yet it has been this lack of an identifiable cause \u2014 a disappointing earnings result or a major investor\u2019s unloading stock, for example \u2014 that has been worrying some market specialists.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dOn Monday, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was also slightly lower, off 0.1 percent.Netflix helped lead the way, declining 4.2 percent. Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.In the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.The declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.To the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500\u2019s return of more than 8 percent this year.The bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.UBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.While traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors \u2014 given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market \u2014 will stick with them.According to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today\u2019s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.Hedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer \u201cFaamg,\u201d substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)Compared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins \u2014 exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges \u2014 that is a very small figure.To a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.In the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.Credit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.In the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Getting Rid of Bail Is Only the Start", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "Supported byBig CityToward the end of last year, Peter Goldberg, who gave up a remunerative career providing legal counsel to hedge-fund and private-equity firms, received a call that put him in Brooklyn Criminal Court at midnight to help a 16-year-old boy charged with petty larceny. The boy had been accused of stealing a pair of sneakers belonging to the teenage son of his foster mother, an act of retaliation, apparently, for the theft of a Game Boy.Because he had been arrested twice before \u2014 once on a charge of jumping a turnstile and another time on a suspicion of possessing marijuana \u2014 and had missed certain court dates associated with those arrests because, like most teenage boys, he failed to maintain an unerring Google calendar \u2014 the bail set for him that night was $500. Given his circumstance, this was a daunting sum.To many who work in the legal system, the thought that the elimination of bail might prompt a crisis of flight risk seems comically out of touch. \u201cMy clients couldn\u2019t afford a MetroCard,\u201d Cynthia Godsoe, a former public defender turned law professor, told a roomful of affluent Brooklynites recently at a fund-raiser for the Bail Fund. \u201cWhite-collar criminals are the flight risk.\u201dBut bail reform alone cannot stanch the flow of people into the criminal justice system who shouldn\u2019t be there in the first place. Over the past few years, city officials have congratulated themselves for ending the era of stop-and-frisk policing; last year there were just over 12,400 stops in New York, a sharp decline from a peak of more than 685,000 in 2011. But we seem to be nowhere near the point of upending the ways in which we criminalize personal dispute.Over the course of several hours spent in Brooklyn Criminal Court recently, I was struck by the number of people who wound up before a judge because of conflicts with ex-lovers, roommates (one man was accused of flipping over the bed of another man at a homeless shelter) and fellow teenagers. (The number of children who end up in court because of fights over stolen sneakers remains astonishing, Ms. Godsoe told me.)The judges I witnessed were not abusive of the bail system; bail was barely administered. But in nearly every case in which conflict, physical or not, was the issue, the judicial reflex was to issue a restraining order preventing the accused from having any contact with the opposing party. In cases of domestic violence, when a victim\u2019s safety is a concern, this makes sense. But in cases where people might benefit from the kind of conflict resolution that the education system has so emphatically embraced, the action seems counterproductive.The case of Mr. Goldberg\u2019s teenage client points to another flaw in the system: the propensity for exhausted parents in poor communities to call the police to resolve conflicts with or between children. It was the foster mother, Mr. Goldberg said, who called the police in that case. The failure to offer adequate social services to the poor leaves them, in many instances, relying on law enforcement to fill the gaps, which puts children needlessly in contact with the legal system and exerts extra stress on the police, as David O. Brown, the police chief in Dallas at the time, so movingly pointed out last year in the aftermath of a sniper attack on five officers there.Email bigcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nancy Pelosi, Washington\u2019s Latest Wicked Witch", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byDispatchThe wicked witch is back. This time, her name is Nancy Pelosi.Ms. Pelosi is just the latest in a long line of female politicians \u2014 on the left and the right \u2014 who have proved rich and resonant targets. Hillary Clinton. Sarah Palin. Michele Bachmann, the former House member from Minnesota. Then Hillary Clinton once more.In each case, gender wasn\u2019t the only issue. There were plenty of self-inflicted wounds, as well as genuine ideological opposition. Yet each woman was attacked in ways that play off sometimes subliminal, often indignantly denied, biases about women shared by men and women alike.Overtly ambitious women stir unease and register as less likable, said Adrienne Kimmell, executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which has been studying women\u2019s political races for 20 years. Voters have more trouble relating to a powerful woman than a powerful man. Women who are seen as political insiders \u2014 or as dishonest, which many voters lump together \u2014 suffer more than do men. Witness the 2016 election.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t even aware that it\u2019s discomfort with women who have too much power,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a veteran strategist and president of Bellwether Research who has advised many Republican campaigns. \u201cRepublican women disliked Hillary Clinton even more than Republican men. They couldn\u2019t stand her. They couldn\u2019t relate to her.\u201d As Ms. Kimmell put it: \u201cAmbition is a four-letter word for women.\u201dThat discomfort is reflected in visual portrayals of female politicians, who are often depicted as unstable and physically repulsive. Unless, as in Ms. Palin\u2019s case, they\u2019re mocked as too attractive to take seriously.Another frequent trope is labeling women as crazy, which Ms. Matthews said was thrown at Mrs. Bachmann, along with Ms. Pelosi and Mrs. Clinton \u2014 who, for good measure, was mocked for her laugh, often likened to a cackle.Ms. Pelosi and Mrs. Clinton have also come under fire from their own party, with pointed references to their ages and the need to step aside to make way for a younger generation. \u201cTo me, what keeps coming back is women aren\u2019t allowed to age,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cWe don\u2019t drum out older men and tell them they can\u2019t be in the positions that they\u2019re in.\u201d She said she did not recall comparable pressure being brought to bear on Tip O\u2019Neill, who served five consecutive terms as speaker of the House and retired at 75.

{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley Billionaires Remaking America\u2019s Schools", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byEducation DisruptedIn San Francisco\u2019s public schools, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, is giving middle school principals $100,000 \u201cinnovation grants\u201d and encouraging them to behave more like start-up founders and less like bureaucrats.In Maryland, Texas, Virginia and other states, Netflix\u2019s chief, Reed Hastings, is championing a popular math-teaching program where Netflix-like algorithms determine which lessons students see.In the space of just a few years, technology giants have begun remaking the very nature of schooling on a vast scale, using some of the same techniques that have made their companies linchpins of the American economy. Through their philanthropy, they are influencing the subjects that schools teach, the classroom tools that teachers choose and fundamental approaches to learning.The involvement by some of the wealthiest and most influential titans of the 21st century amounts to a singular experiment in education, with millions of students serving as de facto beta testers for their ideas. Some tech leaders believe that applying an engineering mind-set can improve just about any system, and that their business acumen qualifies them to rethink American education.But the philanthropic efforts are taking hold so rapidly that there has been little public scrutiny.Tech companies and their founders have been rolling out programs in America\u2019s public schools with relatively few checks and balances, The New York Times found in interviews with more than 100 company executives, government officials, school administrators, researchers, teachers, parents and students.Furthermore, there is only limited research into whether the tech giants\u2019 programs have actually improved students\u2019 educational results.One of the broadest philanthropic initiatives directly benefits the tech industry.Mr. Hastings of Netflix and other tech executives rejected the idea that they wielded significant influence in education. The mere fact that classroom internet access has improved, Mr. Hastings said, has had a much greater impact in schools than anything tech philanthropists have done.\u201cIn our society as a democracy, I think it is healthy that there is a debate about what are the goals of public education,\u201d Mr. Hastings added.Captains of American industry have long used their private wealth to remake public education, with lasting and not always beneficial results.What is different today is that some technology giants have begun pitching their ideas directly to students, teachers and parents \u2014 using social media to rally people behind their ideas. Some companies also cultivate teachers to spread the word about their products.Such strategies help companies and philanthropists alike influence public schools far more quickly than in the past, by creating legions of supporters who can sway legislators and education officials.\u201cWe should be asking a lot more questions about who is behind the curtain,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Mr. Benioff, the billionaire behind Salesforce, had a blunt message for San Francisco\u2019s mayor and its schools superintendent.It was 2013, and the two city officials had approached Mr. Benioff hoping to persuade him to pony up a few million dollars to install Wi-Fi in schools and buy some classroom laptops. But the request seemed too penny-ante to the software mogul.\u201cThat\u2019s when I had to say, \u2018You guys need to think bigger!\u2019\u201d Mr. Benioff recalled in an interview in his San Francisco home. He urged the superintendent to imagine \u201cwhat nirvana would look like\u201d in his schools, if money were no object.With that conversation, Mr. Benioff set in motion a transformation of the relationship between philanthropist and public education. He has emerged as a kind of personal venture capitalist to the city\u2019s public schools \u2014 one intent on remaking a traditional school bureaucracy in Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurial image.Mr. Benioff ultimately pledged $100 million over a decade to the San Francisco Unified School District through his company\u2019s nonprofit arm, Salesforce.org. Unlike conventional benefactors, he is hands-on: School district administrators now submit an annual grant wish list to the Salesforce.org board for review. And Mr. Benioff dispenses not just money, but also management prescriptions.\u201cHe\u2019s almost a public-sector V.C.,\u201d said Richard A. Carranza, who was then the superintendent of San Francisco schools.Mr. Benioff rejected the notion that his approach to education philanthropy was venture-capitalist-like. \u201cWe are not giving them a new religion,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are trying to work with them in a smart way and augment what they are doing.\u201dThe partnership with the district kicked off in 2012 when San Francisco\u2019s mayor, Edwin M. Lee, asked Mr. Benioff to help the city\u2019s middle schools. The mayor wanted to give students a better chance at landing tech jobs. And he wanted Mr. Benioff to pay for it.\u201cI would like to give our kids the opportunity, when they graduate, to see themselves working at those tech companies,\u201d Mr. Lee recalled telling Mr. Benioff.But Mr. Benioff\u2019s \u201cthink bigger\u201d mandate also led to culture clashes. Chief among these: He established a Principal\u2019s Innovation Fund, which awards annual unrestricted grants of $100,000 to the principal at each of the district\u2019s 21 middle and K-8 schools.Administrators subsequently asked principals to select projects that fit with the district\u2019s priorities. Principals have used the grants to start robotics clubs, provide English-tutoring programs for immigrant students and redesign a school library with hangout zones where children can sit with their laptops.Mr. Benioff said he knew that his methods pushed some administrators beyond their comfort zones. \u201cYou\u2019d have the same issue at Salesforce if somebody from the outside came in and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to help you to blah-blah-blah,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBureaucrats would try to stop them.\u201dSo far, Salesforce.org has provided about $20 million to the schools. By hiring additional teachers, schools reduced the average class size across eighth-grade math to 24 students from 33 \u2014 enabling teachers to give more individualized instruction, district officials said.\u201cPeople think school districts are too bureaucratic, can\u2019t be nimble and can\u2019t innovate,\u201d Mr. Carranza said. \u201cWe are proving that this is just not true.\u201dThere are limits to Mr. Benioff\u2019s approach: Most school districts will not be able to secure their own billionaire benefactors. But Mr. Benioff said he intended to keep working with local schools for decades to come.\u201cThis is not just a sea gull strategy where we are dumping a bunch of money and leaving town,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are in the trenches.\u201dThey also share a guardian angel: Mr. Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive.In 2009, he heard about a start-up that used artificial intelligence to adapt math lessons to students. The math program worked a bit like the software Netflix used to customize its video recommendations.\u201cIt is probably fair to say I recognized the power of personalization maybe more than other people, because I had seen it in my own working life,\u201d Mr. Hastings said in an interview at Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles office.There was just one problem: DreamBox Learning was running low on cash. So Mr. Hastings stepped in, donating about $11 million to a nonprofit charter-school fund so it could buy the math platform.Today, more than two million students use the program for supplemental math instruction.DreamBox takes elements from animated video games, with some math lessons populated by aliens that whoosh about and animals that cluck. When students complete a math lesson successfully, they earn points that they can use to unlock virtual rewards.Administrators in some districts said that students so enjoyed the math program that some had begged their parents to let them play DreamBox even during trips to the supermarket. But four parents with children in public schools in Baltimore County, Md., said the program was so stimulating that they had curbed its use at home.\u201cIt really can suck a kid in,\u201d said Brenda Peiffer, a former school counselor, whose son, a third grader, was assigned DreamBox for homework. After noticing that he seemed more interested in spending points to customize his avatar than in actually doing math, she put the kibosh on DreamBox. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing it at home,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect solution for everyone,\u201d she said.And some experienced teachers said it was preposterous to think that algorithms could be better than skilled teachers at adapting to students\u2019 abilities. \u201cWhat you are seeing right now is a heavy push to disrupt and diminish the role of teachers as experts,\u201d said Arienne Adamcikova, a high school teacher in San Mateo, Calif.Mr. Hastings saw it differently.DreamBox Learning tracks a student\u2019s every click, correct answer, hesitation and error \u2014 collecting about 50,000 data points per student per hour \u2014 and uses those details to adjust the math lessons it shows. And it uses data to help teachers pinpoint which math concepts students may be struggling with.Mr. Hastings described DreamBox as a tool teachers could use to gain greater insights into their students, much the way that physicians use medical scans to treat individual patients. \u201cA doctor without an X-ray machine is not as good a doctor,\u201d Mr. Hastings said.Is DreamBox effective?DreamBox is among the minority of digital learning start-ups that have allowed independent academic researchers to examine and publicly report on their data. Still, the platform\u2019s effectiveness is difficult to gauge.Even so, Ms. Woolley-Wilson, DreamBox\u2019s chief executive, described the study as good news, saying it confirmed encouraging reports from teachers. She pointed out that, unlike DreamBox, many other education start-ups lacked research to prove even the most basic assumption: that their apps did not harm students\u2019 educational results.\u201cThat sounds like a low bar,\u201d Ms. Woolley-Wilson said. \u201cBut with the history of education technology, it is not.\u201dMr. Hastings (who is a company director but has no financial interest in the math company) said he was enthusiastic about DreamBox\u2019s potential and predicted wider classroom use for the technology as artificial intelligence improved.Still, he emphasized that he did not view technology generally as a panacea for education. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little cynical and jaundiced about technology,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe tech can help, but it is often oversold.\u201dIf Facebook\u2019s Mr. Zuckerberg has his way, children the world over will soon be teaching themselves \u2014 using software his company helped build.It\u2019s a conception that upends a longstanding teaching dynamic. Now educators are no longer classroom leaders, but helpmates.In public remarks and Facebook posts, Mr. Zuckerberg has described how it works. Students cluster together, working at laptops. They use software to select their own assignments, working at their own pace. And, should they struggle at teaching themselves, teachers are on hand to guide them.\u201cWhen you visit a school like this, it feels like the future \u2014 it feels like a start-up,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told an audience last fall in Peru. \u201cYou get the feeling this is how more of the education system should work.\u201dHe is well on his way to achieving this vision. In 2015, 19 American schools introduced the software that Facebook helped develop. This school year, more than 100 schools use it. Next fall, Mr. Zuckerberg said, he expects that \u201cmany hundreds of more schools will upgrade.\u201dThe effort began a few years ago with visits by Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician who is his wife, to Summit Denali, a middle school in Sunnyvale, Calif. There, classrooms lack walls, and students with laptops often zoom around on caster chairs.Mr. Zuckerberg, she said, admired the software that Summit had created for its schools. He offered Ms. Tavenner a team of Facebook engineers to further develop it and make it available free to schools nationwide.Summit developed its student-directed learning approach after administrators there discovered that their teachers had been so supportive of students, Ms. Tavenner said, that many of its graduates were struggling in college, unprepared to pace themselves or seek help.That is how Summit\u2019s platform came to show students every lesson they will need to complete for the year. They may tackle lessons in any order. At the end of each unit, they take a 10-question multiple-choice test.Not all educators agree. Four former Summit teachers said they found the system problematic. They asked that their names be withheld, saying they feared repercussions for their careers.At Summit, they said, they were required to teach students cognitive skills (like how to construct an argument) while making students responsible for teaching themselves underlying lesson material (like how diverse plants and animals coexist). But some students raced through lessons without actually understanding basic facts, the teachers said, making it difficult to help them structure arguments on specific topics, like climate change.Ms. Tavenner of Summit, however, said that was exactly the point: to make students discover for themselves that they cannot succeed on applied projects without learning the fundamentals.Students think to themselves, \u201c\u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to actually go back and deeply understand it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Tavenner said. \u201cThose are the habits of success that we are trying to instill in kids that simply don\u2019t get instilled in the normal system.\u201dIt can be a steep learning curve.\u201cKids were self-pacing to failure,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.Teachers remedied that by helping students set realistic goals. The school is now happy with the program, she said, and has expanded it to the seventh grade. Even so, Ms. Fisher said, \u201cWe definitely have a concern about the quality of the assessments in the curriculum and whether it actually promotes deeper learning.\u201d\u201cOur hope over the next decade is to help upgrade a majority of these schools to personalized learning and then start working globally as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told the audience. \u201cGiving a billion students a personalized education is a great thing to do.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Making Google the Censor", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe fears and frustrations behind these proposals are understandable. But making private companies curtail user expression in important public forums \u2014 which is what platforms like Twitter and Facebook have become \u2014 is dangerous. The proposed laws would harm free expression and information access for journalists, political dissidents and ordinary users. Policy makers should be candid about these consequences and not pretend that Silicon Valley has silver-bullet technology that can purge the internet of extremist content without taking down important legal speech with it.European politicians tout the proposed laws as curbs on the power of big American internet companies. But the reality is just the opposite. These laws give private companies a role \u2014 deciding what information the public can see and share \u2014 previously held by national courts and legislators. That is a meaningful loss of national sovereignty and democratic control.Moving this responsibility from state to private actors also eliminates key legal protections for internet users. Private-platform owners are not constrained by the First Amendment or human rights law the way the police or courts are. Users most likely have no remedy if companies are heavy-handed or sloppy in erasing speech. Governments that outsource speech control to private companies can effectively achieve censorship by proxy.But violent and extremist material is different. Almost any such image or video is legal in some context. Filters can\u2019t tell the difference between footage used for terrorist recruitment and the same footage used for journalism, political advocacy or human rights efforts. When filters fail to make those distinctions, they will take down information and discussion on topics of vital public importance. Risk-averse companies erring on the side of over-removal for this kind of speech will disproportionately silence Arabic speakers and Islamic religious material.Outraged demands for \u201cplatform responsibility\u201d are a muscular-sounding response to terrorism that shifts public attention from the governments\u2019 duties. But we don\u2019t want an internet where private platforms police every word at the behest of the state. Such power over public discourse would be Orwellian in the hands of any government, be it Ms. May\u2019s, Donald Trump\u2019s or Vladimir Putin\u2019s.Daphne Keller is the director of Intermediary Liability at Stanford Law School\u2019s Center for Internet and Society, and previously was associate general counsel to Google.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Keep Your College Admission Offer: Start With Digital Literacy", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byOn CampusThe jokes were posted in the form of memes, those photographs or images overlaid with captions that you see everywhere on the internet. That young people post offensive memes on Facebook is not news. What\u2019s unique about this situation is that Harvard found out about incoming students who were doing so and retracted their admission, sending a strong message that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.One of the jokes referred to the hypothetical hanging of a \u201cMexican kid\u201d in the school bathroom as \u201cpi\u00f1ata time.\u201d Another, an image of a Pok\u00e9mon lying in bed with an erection, was captioned: \u201cWhen you\u2019re tryna sleep but your neighbor is beating his kids.\u201d Most of the memes could not be printed or explained in this newspaper.This situation is a stark reminder of our collective failing to teach the first generation of digital natives \u2014 those who were born and raised on high-speed internet \u2014 that there are real-life consequences for virtual actions.Since Facebook became widely available, incoming freshman classes have connected with one another in Facebook groups before arriving on campus. Each graduating class usually has its own group. But splinter groups also form, and meme groups with names like \u201cYale Memes for Special Snowflake Teens\u201d or \u201cMIT Memes for Intellectual Beings and Spicy Memelords\u201d are especially popular right now. The group that got the would-be Harvard students in trouble was a private meme group that only students who posted provocative memes could join.You almost have to feel bad for these kids. They don\u2019t realize: \u201cPrivacy\u201d ain\u2019t privacy anymore. It just means your mom might not know about something you did immediately after you did it.A few years ago I started teaching workshops to high school and college students about the importance of maintaining a clean digital reputation. I wanted to ensure that they learned that the things you type, post and share behind a computer screen can still impact your life.I am of the bridge generation that remembers life before social media permeated everything, but cannot imagine life without it now. I was a sophomore at the University of Illinois in 2004, the year \u201cTheFacebook\u201d launched and was made available to college students who went to Ivy League and Big 10 schools. I signed up for the new social network, and never looked back (except shadily) at BlackPlanet or Myspace.When I graduated from college in 2006, I went into marketing and ended up introducing the organizations I worked for to social media. It turned out these platforms we kids were all loitering on could be used for business! It was perfect for my next move. I got a job as a marketing coordinator at a nonprofit that taught other nonprofits how to tell their stories through social media and on the web. My position expanded: I started coaching and teaching social media strategy.A year into my job, I found out from my boss how he\u2019d decided to hire me for the role. He was down to two candidates who were equally qualified but I had the cleaner online reputation, meaning that nothing weird came up when he Googled my name.Today\u2019s young\u2019uns \u2014 would we call them Generation Z? \u2014 have more than just a few years of a digital trail. They were born into the technology age, and all they know is fast internet. This means, of course, that they will never know the trials and tribulations of leaving your computer on overnight so you could download a single song from Kazaa. They probably don\u2019t even know what Kazaa is. But they are in the most danger in terms of their digital reputations: They can be made or broken from the permanent digital record of actions they don\u2019t even fully understand.In my workshops for young adults, the most important thing I emphasize is that anything posted online, no matter how private they think it is, is permanent.Then I tell them how they can avoid pitfalls and big mistakes, while still staying true to themselves. I am in a great position to do that, as I make my living as a cultural critic who doesn\u2019t shy away from speaking up and out. You do not have to be an incredibly sanitized or boring version of yourself online, I tell them. You can still show the most colorful, funny side of who you are, without embarrassing your family\u2019s good name. But if you wouldn\u2019t want something you posted to end up on a jumbotron in Times Square, DO NOT POST IT.With that advice, provocative memes, and that act of keyboard courage it takes to post them, become a little less attractive.Digital literacy couldn\u2019t have helped kids who thought referring to a Mexican child as pi\u00f1ata was funny \u2014 that\u2019s a much deeper issue that falls on the shoulders of their families and communities. Jokes like the ones that were shared in the private group of would-be Harvard students went well beyond provocative and well into the territory of hate speech. But for your average teen, a quick class in the rules of online conduct could mean the difference between a youthful indiscretion kept private and a life derailed by immaturity that became public.Digital media literacy is just as important as financial literacy now: Who we appear to be online can significantly impact earning power. This isn\u2019t just a lesson for young adults. Adults are certainly making these same mistakes. But if we can teach high school and college students these lessons now, we can better prevent them from stumbling. And prevention is always better than treatment.Advertisement"}

And its active monthly listener base shrank to a two-year low in this year\u2019s first quarter, to 76.7 million.Amazon, Apple and Google also have streaming music offerings, and all face the same fundamental challenge: Paying for music rights and marketing has proved an expensive proposition.Pandora was particularly slow to adapt.Its radio business is supported by advertising that generated a respectable $1 billion in revenue last year.\u201cPandora\u2019s done something sensible,\u201d Mr. Mulligan said, \u201cbut sensible doesn\u2019t always get enough credit.\u201dInternet radio ads, however, are not enough to compete with the likes of Apple and Spotify.Too little, too late, analysts said, suggesting that the expense of the new product would weigh down a company that has never reported an annual profit.Enter Sirius XM.The investment came as little surprise to Wall Street. Sirius XM has flirted with doing a deal for Pandora for some time, with its chairman, Gregory B. Maffei, saying publicly that he could be interested in a transaction, but only at what he considered the right price.The deal announced on Friday includes an agreement for the two companies to work together on internet streaming on mobile devices and in cars. It also gives Sirius XM an edge in any possible takeover of Pandora, with the satellite radio provider taking not only a 19 percent stake but also three board seats, including chairman.All that gives it a formidable advantage over any other potential rival who would seek to buy Pandora, although Sirius XM agreed not to make any such move for 18 months.\u201cLonger term, this makes it more likely that they will end up together,\u201d said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie.For Sirius XM \u2014 part of the constellation of companies controlled by Liberty Media \u2014 the new stake in Pandora will give it an important toehold in a number of businesses, including ad-supported radio and particularly internet radio. Despite Sirius XM\u2019s traditional strength in cars, its new partner has an attractive presence in the wider world of internet and mobile music outside cars.\u201cThis strategic investment in Pandora represents a unique opportunity for Sirius XM to create value for its stockholders by investing in the leader in the ad-supported digital radio business, a space where Sirius XM does not play today,\u201d James E. Meyer, Sirius XM\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The agreement on Friday means Sirius XM will replace KKR, the giant investment firm, as Pandora\u2019s major financial backer. Just last month, KKR agreed to invest $150 million in the internet radio service.Pandora, already reeling, will be penalized for swapping partners so quickly: As part of Friday\u2019s complex series of deals, it agreed to pay KKR a $22.5 million termination fee for what amounts to a month of work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "FeatureAndrew Left sniffs out corporate fraud \u2014 and gets rich doing it.Supported byIn the finance world, Left, 46, is what is known as an \u201cactivist\u201d short-seller. After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company\u2019s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries \u2014 Tesla, Valeant, GoPro \u2014 and though he makes mistakes, he has an unusually high success rate.For a year he had been assembling a file on Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefits manager with $100 billion in revenue. Pharmacy-benefits managers occupy an eye-glazingly complex netherworld in the prescription-drug supply chain, serving as intermediaries between drug makers and insurers. Express Scripts ostensibly exists to keep drug prices low, by negotiating with drug makers on behalf of insurers, but Left believed that the company was actually inflating them, because higher prices meant larger rebates from the drug makers, which meant more profit. He believed that this was true of all pharmacy-benefits managers, but especially of Express Scripts, the most powerful. Its second-largest customer was the Department of Defense; downward pressure on drug pricing from the government could seriously threaten its bottom line.By rights, then, Trump\u2019s threat in the interview should have tanked Express Scripts\u2019 stock. That the price remained unchanged indicated to Left that many people on Wall Street had no clue what a pharmacy-benefits manager does. Trump, he thought as he pulled out of the Madison Club, had given his stale, year-old story a fresh hook. (A spokesman for Express Scripts denied Left\u2019s claims, noting that \u201croughly 90 percent of rebates go directly to our clients.\u201d)Fifteen minutes later, Left was driving west on Interstate 10 in his black Bentley Continental GT. From the car, he placed a call to a hedge-fund manager, a man who was already short Express Scripts and therefore had a stake in providing Left with information. Express Scripts, this man reminded Left, did not disclose the amount it made in rebates, while some of its operating metrics exceeded those of Apple; something seemed wrong.Left heard \u201crebates\u201d and thought \u201ckickbacks.\u201d Express Scripts was, in Left\u2019s mind, \u201cthe man behind the man\u201d; it was \u201cthe mob.\u201d If he went public with a short position tomorrow, he wagered, he could sour Wall Street\u2019s perception of the company, transforming it from a sure thing into a noisy, chaotic mess. That attention might in turn attract regulators, further driving down the share price. He called his web designer, Mike Leznik, and told him that he wanted to buy a domain name to host his research on Express Scripts. An hour later the road snaked above Studio City, and he arrived at Mulholland Estates, his gated community in Beverly Hills.The next morning, Left stood in his home office and put CNBC on the television. The anchors were discussing the \u201cTrump bump,\u201d as the recent stock rally was being called. \u201cThey sit around all day long without ever knowing anything,\u201d Left said. \u201cIt\u2019s so annoying to watch them.\u201d Seated beneath the TV was Leznik, a sweet-natured Angeleno in jeans and blue-suede sneakers. Leznik lacked the macho swagger that made Left, with his money and filthy mouth, the center of a room. Nowhere was this truer than in his office. A giant desk dominated the back half. On the credenza sat cigar boxes from Enron and Madoff Securities \u2014 a short-seller\u2019s version of trophy antlers.\u201cWhat should I register the domain name as?\u201d Leznik asked.\u201cYour mother is a whore dot com?\u201d Left said.\u201cThe real story of \u2014 \u201d Leznik suggested.\u201cThe real story of your mother being a whore?\u201d Left said.Leznik settled on TheRealExpressScripts.com, then asked Left for his credit card to buy the URL.\u201cWhat are you, my wife?\u201d Left said.There were several obvious comebacks to this \u2014 \u201cYou wish\u201d being the absolute minimum \u2014 but none occurred to Leznik, who after fumbling for a moment said, \u201cI could be, if you had enough room.\u201d A whiff. The room was silenced.At 10 a.m., having placed his bet against the stock the night before, Left put out his first tweet, which he misspelled and deleted four times. Such is his mystique in the world of finance, however, that one of his followers assumed that the misspellings and deletions were part of a premeditated scheme to exploit Twitter\u2019s visibility algorithms. Finally the corrected version of the tweet came out from Left\u2019s handle, @CitronResearch, followed moments later by another: \u201cWhen @RealDonaldTrump goes after $ESRX,\u201d it read, using the ticker symbol for Express Scripts, \u201cheads will roll.\u201d We sat back and waited, eyes on CNBC. Twenty minutes passed. Suddenly a news flash interrupted the show. \u201cExpress Scripts shares are falling sharply on a spike in volume,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cCitron Research, run by Andrew Left, tweeted about the stock. They\u2019re now down by 9 or 10 percent, about 9.2 million shares so far.\u201d Left\u2019s tweet appeared in the corner of the screen. In the office, the atmosphere went taut.We watched as the stock came down, dollar after dollar, from 75 to 74 to 73; 72, 71, 70. Left wrote two more tweets, including a promise to appear on television with further revelations. Soon, the phone started ringing \u2014 reporters calling. Linette Lopez from Business Insider texted for quotes. CNBC booked him for 2 p.m. that day. \u201cThe question is,\u201d Left told a journalist from Bloomberg, \u201cis the new administration serious? He\u2019s going to rein in drug pricing. O.K., Mr. Trump, here\u2019s my advice: I know the industry. Go after Express Scripts.\u201d\u201cDo you have a short position?\u201d the reporter from Bloomberg asked.\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Left said.\u201cExpress Scripts, as we\u2019re talking, continues to drop,\u201d the anchor on CNBC said.In 15 minutes, $6 billion of market capitalization vanished. (Five months later, the stock price is still down 13 percent.) Left considered the circus around him. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201csome guys know this stuff better than me. But I know how to put it in [expletive] tweets.\u201dAt any given moment, someone, somewhere, has a short position in whatever stock you can think of \u2014 99 percent of all stocks in the world, by some estimates. Blue-chip stocks like Apple and Google are being shorted. Shake Shack is being shorted to an unhealthy degree: Almost half its shares are borrowed. As you read this, people are short on The New York Times. Almost uniquely among Wall Street maneuvers, short-selling entails what traders call infinite downside. While potential profit is constrained by the distance between the current share price and zero, the potential loss is not, because the shares, once borrowed, can rise in price indefinitely, which means the cost of returning them can, too. It\u2019s unsurprising that short-sellers tend to be aggressive men who are convinced that they see what other people miss and are comfortable with \u2014 or addicted to \u2014 risk.For many years that risk was taken on in secret: Short-sellers would make their bets and passively wait for the market to move in their direction. The figure of the activist, who goes public with his positions, emerged into prominence in recent years. One crucial event in Wall Street history provided the foundation. In 2001, James Chanos, a hedge-fund manager, discovered an accounting scandal at Enron, then a little-known energy company in Texas, and shared his information with journalists from Fortune. The journalists got a best seller, Chanos got his money and Jeffrey Skilling, Enron\u2019s chief executive, got 24 years at the Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Ala.Short-sellers of Left\u2019s generation are following this example but cutting out the middleman. You don\u2019t need an office in a flashy building in the Battery, they have realized, or the validation of the press. If you build enough of a reputation, all you need are some Twitter followers and a website. Left has emerged at the forefront of this new guard. Unlike Chanos, who managed billions of dollars of other people\u2019s money, Left invests his own, which exempts him from disclosing his holdings to the public. And now that his work has brought him national attention, he has found that others are willing to make it easier, by leaking documents to him and passing tips. In many cases, Left\u2019s dossiers against his targets are not wholly his own but built using information from a confidential source. He is, in this sense, a bit like a journalist.He also makes it look easy. One result of Left\u2019s fame is that today\u2019s younger traders believe that they, too, could be him. Wuyang Zhao, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who wrote his dissertation on activist short-selling, told me: \u201cPeople read Andrew Left, and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, my God, it\u2019s not impossibly difficult. It\u2019s not a lot of work, and you can bring down a big company.\u2019\u2009\u201d One of Left\u2019s friends recalled a visit Left made to a university to give a lecture. In the hallways afterward, the students swarmed him. \u201cIt was like he was Mick Jagger,\u201d the friend said.From 2006 to 2015, the number of activist short campaigns rose by 1,300 percent, to 1,289. In the past three years, the number of activist short-sellers working globally has nearly doubled, to 72 from 39. Very few have a positive track record. Left does. On average, the value of companies he writes about drop 10 percent in a year, and some drop as much as 95 percent.One morning last spring, Left and I stood in his lush backyard while he smoked a Marlboro Light. Beyond the swimming pool, the land fell sharply into the valley, and Los Angeles lay prone in the heat. We could see DJ Khaled\u2019s recently purchased house over the fence to our left. Tan and unshaven in loafers, Left possessed the vaguely louche charisma of a club promoter, which is what you might mistake him for were it not for his eyes \u2014 green, wet, melancholy eyes, which, because they cannot but project sincerity, are his greatest tools on television. His eyes are the reason he could stand in his million-dollar lawn and say to me, without irony, \u201cI\u2019m an investigative journalist who trades on his information.\u201dI observed that most investigative journalists could not count DJ Khaled as a neighbor.\u201cThe difference between this and journalism is you can make millions of dollars,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut you can lose millions of dollars, too.\u201dWhen I found him at the airport, he was wearing distressed jeans and a golf shirt, barking into an iPhone. He had just flown back from a vacation in Florida. During the 45-minute drive to his house, Left, never hanging up, floated and discarded a variety of plans. They were: exposing a jewelry chain as a subprime lender in disguise; shorting a maybe-fraudulent media company in Canada; and withdrawing a million-dollar cashier\u2019s check from his bank, made out to a pharmaceutical company, to be offered as a donation to the charity of its choice if it could prove to him the efficacy of a drug for multiple sclerosis, still in trials, which Left had on authority from the \u201crabbi of M.S.\u201d didn\u2019t work.The man on the other end of the line was a hedge-fund manager, this one a very close associate of Left\u2019s, at the center of his circle of sources. His relationship with Left was completely informal. His role was to trade ideas back and forth, sometimes shorting the companies they discussed. In exchange for sharing his insight and institutional muscle, Left\u2019s source avoided the legal liability that came from going public with a position. (A short campaign based on faulty information leaves you open to accusations of market manipulation, something Left has never been charged with in the United States.) Left has a number of sources on Wall Street, and during the months I spent reporting on him, he took care to keep their names from me, lest he burn them.Left also got tips as many journalists do, in large quantities, most of them useless. Business-school wannabes emailed him to get noticed. E-Trade cowboys offered schemes \u201cfor your eyes only.\u201d Hedge funds sent him research and ideas, most often because they wanted him to catalyze a short position they already held, by taking it public. What many of these people failed to grasp was that a bad company wasn\u2019t necessarily a good story. One morning, I watched him read his emails. \u201cGildan T-shirts,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThat idea does nothing for me. Who gives a [expletive] about Gildan?\u201dThen there was a third set of sources he used: tips of no discernible origin. In March 2012, for instance, a package without a return address landed on his doorstep. Inside were 68 pages of research claiming that a Chinese real estate company, Evergrande, was perpetrating an accounting fraud and would collapse. An odd tone pervaded, as if a very strait-laced stock analyst were trying to loosen up and channel Left\u2019s combative voice (\u201cChairman Hui\u2019s pet projects are comically off-strategy ... the endgame is nearing ... a maze of Ponzi-esque debt\u201d). Left hired a fact-checker, became convinced that the claims were accurate, updated some figures and published. The stock instantly dropped 7 percent. He covered a portion of his position two hours later, taking $280,000 in profit.But the profit was only the beginning of the story. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission sued Left for \u201cfalse and misleading claims,\u201d a failure to adequately support his accusations with evidence. The judge found him guilty and barred him from trading on the Chinese markets for five years. (Left objects to the decision on free-speech grounds and is appealing the ruling.) He refused to give up the name of his fact-checker. As to the identity of the anonymous sender, there was nothing to give up: Left had no idea who it was, except someone who almost certainly had a short position in Evergrande and made a fortune off the publication without the hassle of appearing in court. That was the point of using physical paper. Courts can subpoena your emails, but good luck tracing the mail backward from your gated community in Beverly Hills.As careful as Left must be to fact-check, hesitation hurts, too. If you\u2019re slow, other shorts can scoop you, which is exactly what happened with the online postage seller: A competitor had published a version of Left\u2019s thesis on a finance blog, and the stock\u2019s price had fallen too far to short. Back at his home office, Left tried to work, but the atmosphere was lazy, diffuse. He called a source. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he said, asking about the postage stock. \u201cWill it bounce?\u201d The source replied that it would not.Left squinted at CNBC. Then he roared. It began as a self-mocking \u201cWhy me?\u201d exasperation but expanded into something more unhindered, a primal American shriek. \u201cUugghHHAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH\u200bHHHHHHHHHH.\u201dWhen he was through, he said, almost to himself, \u201cThere has got to be an easier way to make money.\u201dRecognizing his ability to dazzle an audience at a young age, Black wanted her son to become a lawyer or a rabbi. Instead, he was accepted at Northeastern and chose political science. Boston confronted him for the first time with people who had always had money. They knew that Beverly Hills was an actual place in California, not a made-up city on TV. They wore black. They didn\u2019t drink Bartles & Jaymes.After graduating in 1993, Left responded to a newspaper ad from an outfit called the Universal Commodity Corporation, offering $100,000 a year for work in what the advertiser knew not to call a boiler room. Boiler rooms are cold-call centers for stocks, where men in bare-walled offices put the screws on unsophisticated marks. (As in: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Mrs. Jones. I\u2019d hate to see your husband miss out.\u201d) Roberta Karmel, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regulator who policed the Long Island boiler rooms in the 1980s, described to me a typical employee. \u201cHe tended to go to lesser schools for college,\u201d she said. \u201cOr not go to college at all. And a lot of them were kind of scrappy personalities who thought: Well, I\u2019m just as smart as the people at the white-shoe firms. I can make a lot of money, too.\u201dMaybe \u2014 if you\u2019re good at it. Left was not. He would meander off script and lose the sale. He quit after nine months, ejecting himself into the mid-\u201990s froth, where there was very little oversight and, almost everywhere you looked, a thick layer of scumminess. These were the years when the future \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d author Jordan Belfort ran a brokerage firm on Long Island, taking small companies public. Left started flipping penny-stock I.P.O.s, including Belfort\u2019s \u2014 he would call up the \u201cbucket shops,\u201d or storefront stock exchanges, ask for shares before a company went public and then sell them later at a profit.At the time, the Long Island bucket shops were pumping obscure stocks to whoever would buy them. The typical scam involved inflating the price by lying to your customers, then selling your own shares as close to the peak as possible before those customers got wiped out. (In 1999, a judge sentenced Belfort to four years for fraud. He served 22 months.) In the back of Left\u2019s mind, a realization glimmered. With the money he had saved from a few successful trades, he started shorting Belfort and the others, covering his positions after the price bottomed out \u2014 in effect profiting from their fraud. He was just getting the hang of it when the market crashed. He moved to California.In the mid-\u201990s, traders were just beginning to publish their theses online. An idea occurred to Left: Take the short positions he wielded against the Long Island companies and aim them up at big companies, the more elite the better, using the internet to disseminate the research. Instead of writing in the mode of a traditional stock analyst, he would distill his arguments down to internet-friendly length. The word \u201cblog\u201d was just starting to enter the lexicon. Left registered a domain name. He decided to stay in California. He would come to talk about frauds the way surfers talk about waves.To its fans on Wall Street, Valeant represented a brand-new model for the drug business. It didn\u2019t spend money on research and development, as most drug companies did. Instead, it bought valuable patents for drugs that others had developed, then jacked up the prices. To critics, Valeant was an abusive acquisition machine that produced nothing of value and would choke on its own debt. Senator Bernie Sanders lambasted it. Shares traded above $200.On Sept. 28, 2015, Left released his first report on the company. \u201cThis article is not for you hedge-fund managers who think that this quarter\u2019s profit is more important than human decency,\u201d it read. \u201cThis article is for the millions of Americans who together can mandate change.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhile the whole country is in an uproar about Turing Pharmaceuticals, a one-drug start-up pharma company attempting to raise prices on a single AIDS drug, the real issue is a $100 billion monster only Wall Street could love \u2014 an extremely leveraged company that set the standard for this type of abuse, while being cheered on by a cadre of Wall Street high-rollers too wealthy to fret over their own personal health care costs, and its posse of hedge-fund operators.\u201d A second report followed, demanding that Congress subpoena Valeant\u2019s executives.Pearson called the comparison \u201cerroneous\u201d and asked the S.E.C. to investigate Left. But as any public-relations agent knows, if you\u2019re denying, you\u2019re already on the back foot. By the time the company announced an emergency news conference the following morning, the stock was down 40 percent. \u201cAndrew erased the idea that buying Valeant was a smart strategy,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI just thought it was a good story. Andrew knew it was a ball of gasoline-soaked rags. He threw a match on it.\u201dAmong those who smelled smoke was the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. In November 2016, he indicted two men on charges of wire fraud and kickbacks: Gary Tanner, a senior executive at Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, the chief executive of Philidor. For all intents and purposes, the indictment alleges, Philidor was not an independent company. That much Left had suspected. What was shocking was the nature of the relationship between the businesses. It was not simple channel stuffing, the indictment alleges, but theft. According to the document, Tanner would sell Davenport millions of dollars of drugs. Then Davenport would share with Tanner the incentive payments he received from Valeant, moving the money through a shell company. Meanwhile Tanner misled his Valeant colleagues into believing that a competitor wanted to buy Philidor. The ultimate goal, the indictment claims, was to inflate Philidor\u2019s value until Valeant acquired it at a huge markup, at which point the two would split the millions that Davenport would earn from the sale as Philidor\u2019s largest stakeholder. (Through a representative, Valeant said it was the victim, not the perpetrator, of the fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note the indictment involved one former employee,\u201d the company wrote, adding that it has increased R.&D. investment by 26 percent.)We rode the elevator to a silent floor, where the receptionist clocked him as he entered. \u201cHey, Andy.\u201d Desks sat empty; the morning crew was here to shoot the 9:30 spots for the New York market, but in Los Angeles the day hadn\u2019t started. A tech came out to lead us to the studio. He was a gentle man in middle age, soft-featured, wearing cargo pants and thick black sneakers, a big brown mustache, warm eyes. He knew Left from the Valeant short and liked to watch him stick it to the Wall Street bosses. All day, people came through the studio rattling off finance acronyms, Ebitda this and Gaap that. Left spoke English.The tech set Left up on a director\u2019s chair. A screen behind his head projected a slightly more outdated version of the skyline than was visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows off-camera to the left and right. Left opened his notes and put his earpiece in. A few seconds into the interview, the anchor fell into a trap. \u201cHow much do you think Express Scripts makes off rebates off a high-priced drug?\u201d he asked.The tech was looking at Left. \u201cYou\u2019re our best guest,\u201d he said. \u201cOur most controversial guest.\u201d\u201cBut not the handsomest,\u201d Left said.\u201cWe\u2019re in West Hollywood,\u201d the tech apologized. On-screen, the anchors moved on to the morning\u2019s next story, the appointment to the Trump administration of the president of Goldman Sachs. Left rode the elevator down to the lobby and slipped outside, where the blue glass tower dwarfed him.Claire Stovall, a researcher at the industry analyst Activist Shorts, told me that the situation was not necessarily to be feared. \u201cThe market is often quicker than the government at catching frauds,\u201d Stovall said. And most successful activist short campaigns produce no regulatory action anyway. But Zhao took a dimmer view. \u201cIf you create a deregulated boom not supported by fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will have a disaster. The activist short-sellers will make a fortune. But sometimes, as a member of society, you don\u2019t want to have a total collapse.\u201dIn retrospect, it is not coincidental that 2015 was the year Left became famous. His tactics matched our mood. Most of us do not care about a random pharmaceutical company meeting its debt covenants. We care about getting medicine at a price we can afford. We don\u2019t care about organic versus inorganic growth, but we worry that our kids will have no coverage if the Trump administration repeals Obamacare. Left\u2019s very timely gift is to connect our daily human concerns to the convoluted operations of the economy, wrapping financial analysis in a moral, populist language that is calibrated precisely to draw maximum attention in a media environment in which screaming is the only way to be heard.As for those being screamed at, the banks and the business schools that feed them, Left represents at best an interesting character and at worst a nuisance. American high finance is extraordinarily good at absorbing attacks on it. Just a few months ago, Left delivered a keynote speech at Harvard Business School\u2019s annual investment conference, where students who could afford the $72,000 tuition calmly imbibed Left\u2019s strategies, which were once considered fringe. He texted me a photo of himself in Harvard Yard, looking comfortable and middle-aged, smiling, his eyes closed.An article on June 11 about a short-seller referred incorrectly to Daraprim, the drug whose price was increased 56-fold by Turing Pharmaceuticals. The company bought the marketing rights, not the patent, to the drug.Advertisement"}

Montana?Alaska and Idaho are also in the top 10.How can Montana, Alaska and Idaho be among the leaders in showing interest about impeaching a Republican president? Does this mean that the impeachment movement has quietly gone mainstream, capturing the interest of die-hard Republicans living in the heart of conservative America?Nope.To understand why impeachment interest is so high in Montana and similar states, we have to broaden our understanding of the political geography of the United States.We usually divide American states politically into two groups, and since Montana, Alaska and Idaho consistently vote for Republican presidents, we categorize them as red states. But there is another interesting political division: states with higher concentrations of liberal activists and states with lower concentrations. The liberal activism divide does not neatly match up with the red-blue divide.Consider this measure of left-wing strength. Where was the highest percentage of support for Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate in 2016? Alaska and Montana rank in the top 10, beating New York and New Jersey.On a range of measures, red states in the mountain region tend to have more liberal activists, relatively speaking, than blue states in the mid-Atlantic or the Midwest. Montana has a small percentage of Democrats (although one of them is the governor and another a senator) but a large percentage of liberal activists. Illinois has a large percentage of Democrats but a small percentage of liberal activists.The comparatively high interest in impeachment in Western red states is not a sign of wide interest in impeachment. It is a sign of its narrow appeal, evidence that the desire to impeach the president hasn\u2019t spread much beyond a core of activists.There is further evidence that interest in impeaching the president may not be as high as some liberals suspect.Over the next few months, we can follow both the various investigations concerning Mr. Trump and the search patterns of his fellow Americans. We will know that the impeachment movement has gone mainstream when interest spreads beyond hard-core liberals living in Alaska, Montana and elsewhere and reaches the mainstream Democrats in Illinois, New Jersey and other blue states.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s just over for people who are producing\u201d bad stuff, he said, using a more profane term. (\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d one of his guests shouted.)Those mixing in the hotel\u2019s chic, library-like atmosphere seemed to be latching on to the message that creativity would win the day. Rather than the feeling of impending doom, one marketing executive from Bank of America said it was a thrilling time to be working in the industry, with the shifts in the way ads reach the public forcing innovation.Others echoed that sentiment. While traditional ways of reaching consumers may be changing, it is in fact the \u201cgolden age of marketing,\u201d said Scott Kauffman, chief executive of MDC Partners, which owns agencies like 72andSunny. He was also skeptical of the premise that people loathe ads, saying, \u201cAsk a Harley-Davidson aficionado if they\u2019re annoyed by Harley-Davidson ads.\u201dStill, even those whose contact with the advertising world is mainly fictional can sense the challenges the industry faces. The actor John Slattery, best known for playing the ad executive Roger Sterling in the series \u201cMad Men,\u201d emerged as a surprise guest at the event, courtesy of Ms. Rosenthal. (Mr. Essex, in his book, referred to Roger Sterling to describe his role at Droga5, though he emphasized on Wednesday that the comparison did not extend to any of the character\u2019s more salacious behavior on the show.)Mr. Slattery said he was about halfway through Mr. Essex\u2019s book. Advertising is a difficult business today, he said, with the advent of platforms like Facebook and Google.\u201cHow do you get seen in all the noise?\u201d he asked.Or, as Mr. Essex put it in his book: \u201cWhen traditional advertising was first invented, there were 16 or so waking hours in a day. That baseline hasn\u2019t changed, but the number of things frenetically competing for our attention at any given moment has, we all know, increased exponentially.\u201dReading the book has already paid off for Mr. Slattery. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about ad-blocking, period, and downloaded it,\u201d he said, marveling at the software, of which he is now a fan. When asked whether he watched TV commercials, he shook his head no.When asked whether the 30-second TV commercial was dying, Catharine Hays, who directs the Future of Advertising program at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said that was \u201cthe wrong question.\u201d The right question, she said, is \u201cWhat\u2019s better than the 30-second ad?\u201dAccording to Mr. Essex\u2019s book, airline terminals.\u201cWhat if brands looked to infrastructure as the new official canvas for their commercials?\u201d he wrote. \u201cImagine a Pfizer-branded ferry.

This was a short week since we started it off with Memorial Day and, fortunately, no tech companies were sadistic enough to drop news on us on a sacred holiday.I have no idea how this whole thing is going to turn out. All I know is that this is hardly the way Uber wanted its widely acclaimed acquisition of Otto, the self-driving trucking company started by Levandowski, to go.So, I guess, at least that headache is solved, for now?We don\u2019t know what the report will say \u2014 it could be damning, or it could soft-pedal the whole thing \u2014 but either way, Uber\u2019s moment under the media glare isn\u2019t going to end soon.Good for him, though an entirely new consumer electronics company seems like a tough sell in an age where Apple and Samsung are sucking up all the hardware profits.Honestly, the degree to which others have decided to just carve up Snapchat\u2019s product ideas is inspiring. Nothing is sacred in Silicon Valley \u2014 I guess you can thank Mark Zuckerberg and his various properties for that initial inspiration.More than anyone else in tech, Musk has made saving humanity from global catastrophe his thing. It\u2019s the central thread running through his companies \u2014 he wants Tesla to push us to a hyper-efficient, solar-powered future, and he wants SpaceX to get us to Mars, as a backup.What\u2019s interesting is that he thought he could convince Trump of the wisdom of his ideas. Musk was among many executives who\u2019d pleaded with the president not to ditch the Paris agreement. He did so at a heavy cost to his reputation \u2014 and he got nothing for it, apparently.The more cynical side of me wonders why push back on this rather than, say, the tepid and slow-moving response to the travel ban a few months back, which also disproportionately affected tech companies\u2019 work forces? Is it because they have more cover now since this decision was widely disliked? Or is it because they\u2019re realizing no amount of platitudes seem to get through to this president?And I suspect that history informed their moves here. The tech companies are rational and global in their outlook \u2014 they understand that their employees, many of their customers and essentially all of the governments they deal with around the world were going to oppose Trump\u2019s policies. So it made sense for them to push back hard. They had nothing to lose.Advertisement"}

But Mr. de Min said that few other developers were using the technology, in part because iPhone users were unaware of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can really see,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand it.\u201dApple, which declined to comment for this article, makes many updates that are popular with users, from changes to the Siri voice assistant to automatically transcribed voice mail messages.At this year\u2019s Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, Calif., the company is expected to introduce improved Mac computers and iPads, software updates for all of its hardware and a voice-activated speaker to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home.With Apple adding fewer major features in recent years, customers have been slower to upgrade their devices.App developers are also pausing in what had been a race to embrace Apple\u2019s latest innovations. Eliran Sapir, chief executive of Apptopia, an analytics firm, said that new apps were being introduced at half the rate they were a year ago.Apple TV apps are hot, he said, but developers are fleeing Apple Watch. \u201cThere is no way to monetize the watch whatsoever,\u201d he said.The slow uptake of apps for Messages and 3-D Touch is evident in the numbers.There are 5,000 regular apps and 30,000 sticker apps for Messages, according to Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Only about 3,600 of the 2.5 million apps in the iOS app store promote their compatibility with 3-D Touch.\u201cYou get your new iPhone and you don\u2019t know that 3-D Touch and apps in Messages even exist,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. Although stickers account for 97 of the top 100 Messages apps, he said, some users are so confused that they post app reviews like, \u201cI downloaded these Disney stickers. How do I use them?\u201dThat is not exactly in line with the simple \u201cit just works\u201d philosophy that Apple built its business on.Apple is not the only major technology company struggling to find the right balance between constant innovation and ease of use. Facebook has changed course several times in its approach to apps and bots within its Messenger app and regularly battles feature overload in its News Feed. Google, whose search box is a paragon of simplicity, famously retreated from an attempt to tie all of its services together with the unwieldy Google Plus social network.Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, which makes apps for companies like JetBlue Airways and Turner, said he would like to see Apple simplify and smooth out some of its current features. He said Messages apps have potential if Apple can figure out how to make it easier for people to find them.Mr. Reubenstein pointed to a feature of Google Photos as an example of the simplicity that people want. He said he backs up his iPhone photos to Google, which uses face recognition to tag people in the images. For Mother\u2019s Day, Google made it so easy to create quick movies from those photos that he made three, for his mother, his mother-in-law and his wife.\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s a discoverability issue,\u201d said Mr. Duncan, who worked part time on Apple\u2019s telephone tech-support team during college and hopes to get a design job there in the future. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know the stickers exist.\u201dHe said he had to teach his friends how to install and use Messages stickers by sending them multiple screenshots.\u201cA lot of people will think it\u2019s their fault, and it\u2019s really the designer\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want apps to be easy to use.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Fined Record $2.7 Billion in E.U. Antitrust Ruling", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byGoogle suffered a major blow on Tuesday after European antitrust officials fined the search giant a record $2.7 billion for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals.The penalty, of 2.4 billion euros, highlights the aggressive stance that European officials have taken in regulating many of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, going significantly further than their American counterparts.\u201cIn Europe, companies must compete on the merits regardless if they are European or not,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules.\u201dThe apparent focus on Silicon Valley has prompted accusations from some in the United States that the European Union is unfairly targeting American companies. Officials in the bloc vigorously deny those assertions.In targeting the activities of these digital giants, experts say, European authorities are laying down a marker for more hands-on control of how the digital world operates. And while the $2.7 billion fine announced on Tuesday is tiny compared with Google\u2019s $90 billion in annual revenue, it highlights the region\u2019s willingness to dole out sizable penalties.Shares of Google fell for a second straight day on the news. The stock declined 2.5 percent on Tuesday, a steeper decline than the broader Nasdaq.Europe\u2019s latest efforts to rein in technology companies stem from continuing unease that Silicon Valley has come to dominate how the continent\u2019s 500 million citizens interact online.\u201cEurope is setting the agenda,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like that.\u201dIn her statement on Tuesday, Ms. Vestager said that Google held a dominant position in online search, requiring the company to take extra measures to ensure that its digital services did not crowd out those of rivals.The antitrust decision related to Google\u2019s online shopping service, which the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said had received preferential treatment compared with those of rivals in specialized search results.Analysts say such so-called vertical search products \u2014 also including those for restaurant and business reviews \u2014 represent a fast-growing percentage of Google\u2019s annual revenue. The company does not break out earnings figures for this unit in its financial reports.The search company is facing two separate antitrust charges in Europe related to Android, its popular mobile software, and to some of its advertising products. Google denies the accusations.Google rebuffed the European Union\u2019s claims on Tuesday, saying that its services had helped the region\u2019s digital economy grow. It has also said that significant online competition remains in Europe, including from companies like Amazon and eBay.Despite Google\u2019s denials, the record fine \u2014 the previous high, against Intel in 2009, was \u20ac1.06 billion \u2014 represents a bloody nose for a company that holds a market share of more than 90 percent in online search in Europe.Several other antitrust complaints related to other specialized search results have been filed in Europe against Google, and Ms. Vestager said Tuesday\u2019s announcement could \u201cbe used as a framework\u201d in those investigations.That may eventually lead to further fines if European authorities find wrongdoing. The complaints include many from other American technology companies, including Oracle, News Corporation and Yelp, which have been vocal advocates of large fines against Google.Google has 90 days to respond to the European Commission\u2019s demands, or face penalties of up to 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, its parent company. European officials said on Tuesday that they would regularly monitor the company\u2019s activities to ensure that it was complying with the ruling.Under European rules, the company \u2014 and not the regulator \u2014 must come up with proposals to guarantee that it treats competitors fairly when people make online search queries. The authorities can demand that Google make further changes if they are not satisfied with the initial proposals.Analysts and many of Google\u2019s competitors have called for an independent monitor to oversee the company\u2019s digital services in Europe, which could include oversight of its search algorithms, some of Google\u2019s most important intellectual property. The company is likely to fiercely oppose such a move.Google has other options, including the removal of some of its specialized search services from Europe, or returning them to how they operated before the European Union\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.Whatever the outcome, analysts say they expect a protracted legal battle that will continue for several years as both Google and its rivals fight to define how search services are provided in Europe and elsewhere.\u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a co-founder of Foundem, a British comparison-shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google. \u201cLeft unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tech Executive\u2019s Latest Start-Up Has Cleats, Jerseys and Goals", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byKINGSTON, N.Y. \u2014 It was the most important game in the brief history of Kingston Stockade F.C. First place was on the line. So was the first real chance to draw 1,000 fans.Two hours before kickoff on a hot Saturday afternoon in early June, Dennis Crowley, the team\u2019s founder, arrived at Dietz Stadium, a high school football field covered with artificial turf.Driven by the kind of disruptive innovation he knows from the tech world, Crowley is making a bold attempt to reimagine professional soccer in the United States. It is a grand vision of hundreds of clubs and multiple divisions, of promotion and relegation that will reward investment and success and punish bad decisions and failure. That is the big picture. On a recent Saturday, however, Crowley\u2019s focus was on only one game.For the early June match, Crowley\u2019s S.U.V. was packed with the uniforms he had washed. A bag of balls. Banners. Posters for postgame autographs. Cash boxes for the ticket booth and the merchandise stand. Envelopes to pay the referees and the pizza delivery guy. Clipboards and rosters for the press box. Walkie-talkies for the volunteer staff members.He removed Tupperware containers stuffed with T-shirts \u2014 rolled by his father and the club\u2019s general manager \u2014 along with other items for sale: Stockade jerseys, Stockade caps, Stockade scarves, Stockade winter hats.\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll sell many winter hats in summer, but we\u2019ll try,\u201d he said with a chuckle.Randy Kim, the general manager, walked up and Crowley said, \u201cWould you be able to go to the CVS across the street and buy cups?\u201dWhen Kim returned, having spent $12.19 on cups and a couple of bucks on a chocolate bar, Crowley said, \u201cGood work; keep the receipt.\u201dThis is how the revolution begins: By turning your car into a rolling warehouse. By learning that water can be dispensed more efficiently from five-gallon jugs than from bottles. By keeping track of every cent spent. And by bringing a technology executive\u2019s aptitude for pioneering start-ups to soccer.Crowley\u2019s idea is that profitable and sustainable soccer teams can succeed, not only in the large markets inhabited at the top professional level by Major League Soccer, but in small communities, too, like Kingston, with a population of 23,000 in the Hudson Valley, 90 miles north of New York City.\u201cI think that\u2019s where M.L.S. is going wrong,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThey are tending to produce a standardized product across the country.\u201dCrowley envisions the obscure N.P.S.L. becoming relevant over the next five or 10 years by expanding from 100 to 500 teams, each drawing at least 1,000 fans a game and attracting at least 5,000 viewers online via live-streaming broadcasts of their matches. (M.L.S. currently has 22 teams, but is in the process of expanding to as many as 28 over the next several years.)If the N.P.S.L. can build a much larger geographic footprint than M.L.S., while attracting an audience about 25 percent the size of M.L.S.\u2019s, Crowley argues, this could lead to enhanced sponsorship deals, live-streaming rights contracts, and shared revenue among the league\u2019s teams.Crowley\u2019s plan also envisions the enticing \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 possibility of promotion and relegation, with teams moving up or down through tiers depending on their performance in a given season.The system is the standard in most of the world\u2019s leagues but anathema to American professional sports, where leagues like the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. operate \u2014 like M.L.S. \u2014 as closed systems. That arrangement was built into M.L.S. at its creation in the mid-1990s, and it most likely enticed the financing that founded and sustained the league.But a closed system also mitigates risks for potential new investors: It is unlikely that a prospective owner of an M.L.S. team would spend several hundred million dollars for a team and a stadium if it risked dropping to a lower division a year later, just as no one would buy the Yankees if they might drop to Class AAA after a single poor season. To advocates of promotion and relegation, that safety stifles innovation.That is why the prospect of advancing in soccer\u2019s pecking order is tantalizing to many fans of lower-division clubs. It is also why, instead of changing the American soccer landscape from the top, Crowley is proposing to do it from the bottom.\u201cPeople say, \u2018It\u2019s cute, you\u2019re doing this thing with soccer,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re working on a start-up and that\u2019s cute until you pose a threat to Google or Facebook and then they take you seriously. I understand the journey, the improbable rise of that. I feel like we\u2019re doing the improbable rise again.\u201dIn these online essays, Crowley has been open about strategies that have worked, and others that have failed. He has offered tips: Jerseys are reusable from one season to the next if the sponsor remains the same. It is better to start summer games at 5 p.m. instead of 2 p.m., so fans don\u2019t have to run for shade and players\u2019 feet won\u2019t blister. And if you cannot serve alcohol at a high school stadium, arrange for a beer tent across the street.Crowley also has made the provocative argument that proximity may matter as much as quality of play in drawing fans to a team.\u201cIn sum, we shouldn\u2019t focus our energy on the idea of entirely disrupting M.L.S.,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut rather on creating a world where it\u2019s possible that a critical mass of soccer fans in the USA care more about a D4 league than M.L.S.\u201dCan his plan succeed?\u201cI love the transparency, putting all the numbers down; it\u2019s really cool what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Stefan Szymanski, a professor of sports management at Michigan and the author of \u201cMoney and Soccer: A Soccernomics Guide.\u201d\u201cCertainly, M.L.S. wants to develop the lower tiers; they want to control every level of the game,\u201d Szymanski said. \u201cThe question is, if this guy develops a nice app and a nice system, would M.L.S. try to buy it up lock, stock and barrel? And would he be willing to sell?\u201dSunil Gulati, an important executive in the founding of M.L.S. and the current president of the United States Soccer Federation, said: \u201cYou never discount anyone who\u2019s proven in one aspect of their career. The idea of a community-based, ground-up effort is certainly something to be followed carefully.\u201dBecause Crowley\u2019s plan is long-term, Gulati added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to evaluate and also hard to succeed against everything else that\u2019s going on in the sport. To the extent that this is a disrupter, that\u2019s great if they\u2019re successful. But we only ever hear about the disrupters that are successful. And there\u2019s a whole lot that aren\u2019t.\u201dFor a home match against Boston City F.C. on June 10, Crowley dressed in a cap and T-shirt bearing Stockade F.C.\u2019s logo: fence posts representing the 14-foot-high stockade built by Dutch settlers to protect the original village of Kingston in the 1600s.This summer, Stockade F.C. features a mix of N.C.A.A. players from nearby Marist College and postcollegiate players eager to continue their careers. None of the players are paid. Goalkeeper Steve Skonieczny is a high school math teacher. Jamal Lis-Simmons, the team captain, is the soccer coach at a community college.Crowley\u2019s determination to be transparent with Stockade F.C., he said, stemmed from having worked at Google and feeling \u201cshut out\u201d from decisions he felt he should have included his voice.In Kingston, Stockade F.C. has been welcomed as another sign of the town\u2019s revival, alongside new brick-and-mortar stores, an enhanced dining scene and second-home purchases by New Yorkers in the wake of IBM\u2019s departure in the mid-1990s. (Crowley lives in Manhattan\u2019s East Village but also has a home near Kingston, in Marbletown, N.Y.)\u201cThe soccer team embodies the transition that is going on,\u201d said Zach Lewis, 30, a real estate developer and a member of Stockade F.C.\u2019s drum corps, known as the Dutch Guard. \u201cIt ties up with the age demographic of people who are into soccer.\u201dAgainst Boston City, Stockade F.C. took a 2-0 lead on a penalty kick and a deft shot chipped over Boston\u2019s goalkeeper from 35 yards. When the match ended at 2-1, Stockade claimed first place in the Atlantic White Division. Crowley hugged Kim, his general manager, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going streaking!\u201dThe crowd, though, topped out at 992, eight short of the 1,000 threshold that Crowley had hoped to reach.\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have grabbed random people off the street?\u201d Skonieczny, the goalkeeper, asked with a laugh.Not when a club\u2019s aim is transparency, Crowley said.\u201cIf we get 1,000, we earn 1,000,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Founder Travis Kalanick Resigns as C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byTravis Kalanick stepped down Tuesday as chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing service that he helped found in 2009 and built into a transportation colossus, after a shareholder revolt made it untenable for him to stay on at the company.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s exit came under pressure after hours of drama involving Uber\u2019s investors, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential.Earlier on Tuesday, five of Uber\u2019s major investors demanded that the chief executive resign immediately. The investors included one of Uber\u2019s biggest shareholders, the venture capital firm Benchmark, which has one of its partners, Bill Gurley, on Uber\u2019s board. The investors made their demand for Mr. Kalanick to step down in a letter delivered to the chief executive while he was in Chicago, said the people with knowledge of the situation.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.In the letter, titled \u201cMoving Uber Forward\u201d and obtained by The New York Times, the investors wrote to Mr. Kalanick that he must immediately leave and that the company needed a change in leadership. Mr. Kalanick, 40, consulted with at least one Uber board member, and after long discussions with some of the investors, he agreed to step down. He will remain on Uber\u2019s board of directors.\u201cI love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said in a statement.Uber\u2019s board said in a statement that Mr. Kalanick had \u201calways put Uber first\u201d and that his stepping down as chief executive would give the company \u201croom to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber\u2019s history.\u201d An Uber spokesman declined to comment further.But the shareholder letter indicated that his taking time off was not enough for some investors who have pumped millions of dollars into the ride-hailing company, which has seen its valuation swell to nearly $70 billion. For them, Mr. Kalanick had to go.Benchmark, Lowercase, First Round, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s resignation opens questions of who may take over Uber, especially since the company has been so molded in his image. And Mr. Kalanick will probably remain a presence there since he still retains control of a majority of Uber\u2019s voting shares.Taking a start-up chief executive to task so publicly is relatively unusual in Silicon Valley, where investors often praise entrepreneurs and their aggressiveness, especially if their companies are growing fast. It is only when those start-ups are in a precarious position or are declining that shareholders move to protect their investment.In the case of Uber \u2014 one of the most highly valued private companies in the world \u2014 investors could lose billions of dollars if the company were to be marked down in valuation.Uber, which has raised more than $14 billion from investors since its founding in 2009, has a wide base of shareholders apart from the ones who signed the letter. Uber\u2019s investors also include TPG Capital, the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.\u201cOver the next 180 days we are committed to making driving with Uber better than ever,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a long road ahead, but we won\u2019t stop until we get there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Best Way to Cool Your Space", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byThe FixSummer is nearly here, and your home will soon be heating up. But just the thought of looking for a new air-conditioner is enough to make you break out in a sweat. How do you know which one to buy, and how it will affect your energy bill? What if your apartment building doesn\u2019t allow window units? Not to worry: We\u2019ve done the research for you.The key to comfort and savings is finding the unit that fits your space. An air-conditioner that isn\u2019t powerful enough won\u2019t effectively cool your home and could end up inflating your power bill. One that is too powerful will work too quickly, shutting off before most of the humidity has been removed, leaving your place cool but clammy. And all that cycling on and off can stress the equipment and shorten its life span.With all of that in mind, here are some guidelines to help you find the right air-conditioner for your home.\u201cIt is very tricky to retrofit a building that was built without air-conditioning,\u201d said Andrew Gerringer, the managing director for new business development at the Marketing Directors, a New York development, leasing and marketing company. \u201cBuildings that have installed it\u201d \u2014 including, he noted, some apartments at 190 Riverside Drive and Manhattan House at 200 East 66th Street \u2014 \u201chave done so through great expense and aggravation.\u201dAnother consideration: Most central air systems lack room-by-room control, so if you want to cool the bedroom while you\u2019re sleeping, you\u2019ll have to cool the rest of your home, too. Still, because the ducts and mechanical components are built in, effectively hidden within the walls, floors or attic, central air is the most discreet option.Hire an installer who will work with you on a well-thought-out plan for where to put the ductwork, and be sure to insulate that ductwork. Also, budget for seasonal visits by a professional to change the filter, clean the coils and perform other maintenance to ensure that the system is working properly.Bottom line: If you have space for the ductwork, central air is a quiet, convenient and design-friendly way to cool your home.Be sure to take into account sun exposure and how the room is used. If the room is heavily shaded, for example, the Energy Star chart recommends reducing capacity by 10 percent. If more than two people regularly occupy the room, add 600 BTUs for each additional person. In the kitchen, increase capacity by 4,000 BTUs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Cyberattack \u2018the World Isn\u2019t Ready For\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byNEWARK \u2014 There have been times over the last two months when Golan Ben-Oni has felt like a voice in the wilderness.On April 29, someone hit his employer, IDT Corporation, with two cyberweapons that had been stolen from the National Security Agency. Mr. Ben-Oni, the global chief information officer at IDT, was able to fend them off, but the attack left him distraught.In 22 years of dealing with hackers of every sort, he had never seen anything like it. Who was behind it? How did they evade all of his defenses? How many others had been attacked but did not know it?Since then, Mr. Ben-Oni has been sounding alarm bells, calling anyone who will listen at the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office and the top cybersecurity companies in the country to warn them about an attack that may still be invisibly striking victims undetected around the world.And he is determined to track down whoever did it.\u201cI don\u2019t pursue every attacker, just the ones that piss me off,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni told me recently over lentils in his office, which was strewn with empty Red Bull cans. \u201cThis pissed me off and, more importantly, it pissed my wife off, which is the real litmus test.\u201dThe strike on IDT, a conglomerate with headquarters in a nondescript gray building here with views of the Manhattan skyline 15 miles away, was similar to WannaCry in one way: Hackers locked up IDT data and demanded a ransom to unlock it.But the ransom demand was just a smoke screen for a far more invasive attack that stole employee credentials. With those credentials in hand, hackers could have run free through the company\u2019s computer network, taking confidential information or destroying machines.Worse, the assault, which has never been reported before, was not spotted by some of the nation\u2019s leading cybersecurity products, the top security engineers at its biggest tech companies, government intelligence analysts or the F.B.I., which remains consumed with the WannaCry attack.Were it not for a digital black box that recorded everything on IDT\u2019s network, along with Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s tenacity, the attack might have gone unnoticed.Scans for the two hacking tools used against IDT indicate that the company is not alone. In fact, tens of thousands of computer systems all over the world have been \u201cbackdoored\u201d by the same N.S.A. weapons. Mr. Ben-Oni and other security researchers worry that many of those other infected computers are connected to transportation networks, hospitals, water treatment plants and other utilities.An attack on those systems, they warn, could put lives at risk. And Mr. Ben-Oni, fortified with adrenaline, Red Bull and the house beats of Deadmau5, the Canadian record producer, said he would not stop until the attacks had been shut down and those responsible were behind bars.\u201cThe world is burning about WannaCry, but this is a nuclear bomb compared to WannaCry,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cThis is different. It\u2019s a lot worse. It steals credentials. You can\u2019t catch it, and it\u2019s happening right under our noses.\u201dAnd, he added, \u201cThe world isn\u2019t ready for this.\u201dMr. Ben-Oni, 43, a Hasidic Jew, is a slight man with smiling eyes, a thick beard and a hacker\u2019s penchant for mischief. He grew up in the hills of Berkeley, Calif., the son of Israeli immigrants.Even as a toddler, Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s mother said, he was not interested in toys. She had to take him to the local junkyard to scour for typewriters that he would eventually dismantle on the living room floor. As a teenager, he aspired to become a rabbi but spent most of his free time hacking computers at the University of California, Berkeley, where his exploits once accidentally took down Belgium\u2019s entire phone system for 15 minutes.To his parents\u2019 horror, he dropped out of college to pursue his love of hacking full time, starting a security company to help the city of Berkeley and two nearby communities, Alameda and Novato, set up secure computer networks.He had a knack for the technical work, but not the marketing, and found it difficult to get new clients. So at age 19, he crossed the country and took a job at IDT, back when the company was a low-profile long-distance service provider.As IDT started acquiring and spinning off an eclectic list of ventures, Mr. Ben-Oni found himself responsible for securing shale oil projects in Mongolia and the Golan Heights, a \u201cStar Trek\u201d comic books company, a project to cure cancer, a yeshiva university that trains underprivileged students in cybersecurity, and a small mobile company that Verizon recently acquired for $3.1 billion.Which is to say he has encountered hundreds of thousands of hackers of every stripe, motivation and skill level. He eventually started a security business, IOSecurity, under IDT, to share some of the technical tools he had developed to keep IDT\u2019s many businesses secure. By Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s estimate, IDT experiences hundreds of attacks a day on its businesses, but perhaps only four each year give him pause.Nothing compared to the attack that struck in April. Like the WannaCry attack in May, the assault on IDT relied on cyberweapons developed by the N.S.A. that were leaked online in April by a mysterious group of hackers calling themselves the Shadow Brokers \u2014 alternately believed to be Russia-backed cybercriminals, an N.S.A. mole, or both.Both WannaCry and the IDT attack used a hacking tool the agency had code-named EternalBlue. The tool took advantage of unpatched Microsoft servers to automatically spread malware from one server to another, so that within 24 hours North Korea\u2019s hackers had spread their ransomware to more than 200,000 servers around the globe.The attack on IDT went a step further with another stolen N.S.A. cyberweapon, called DoublePulsar. The N.S.A. used DoublePulsar to penetrate computer systems without tripping security alarms. It allowed N.S.A. spies to inject their tools into the nerve center of a target\u2019s computer system, called the kernel, which manages communications between a computer\u2019s hardware and its software.In the pecking order of a computer system, the kernel is at the very top, allowing anyone with secret access to it to take full control of a machine. It is also a dangerous blind spot for most security software, allowing attackers to do what they want and go unnoticed. In IDT\u2019s case, attackers used DoublePulsar to steal an IDT contractor\u2019s credentials. Then they deployed ransomware in what appears to be a cover for their real motive: broader access to IDT\u2019s businesses.Mr. Ben-Oni learned of the attack only when a contractor, working from home, switched on her computer to find that all her data had been encrypted and that attackers were demanding a ransom to unlock it. He might have assumed that this was a simple case of ransomware.But the attack struck Mr. Ben-Oni as unique. For one thing, it was timed perfectly to the Sabbath. Attackers entered IDT\u2019s network at 6 p.m. on Saturday on the dot, two and a half hours before the Sabbath would end and when most of IDT\u2019s employees \u2014 40 percent of whom identify as Orthodox Jews \u2014 would be off the clock. For another, the attackers compromised the contractor\u2019s computer through her home modem \u2014 strange.The black box of sorts, a network recording device made by the Israeli security company Secdo, shows that the ransomware was installed after the attackers had made off with the contractor\u2019s credentials. And they managed to bypass every major security detection mechanism along the way. Finally, before they left, they encrypted her computer with ransomware, demanding $130 to unlock it, to cover up the more invasive attack on her computer.Mr. Ben-Oni estimates that he has spoken to 107 security experts and researchers about the attack, including the chief executives of nearly every major security company and the heads of threat intelligence at Google, Microsoft and Amazon.With the exception of Amazon, which found that some of its customers\u2019 computers had been scanned by the same computer that hit IDT, no one had seen any trace of the attack before Mr. Ben-Oni notified them. The New York Times confirmed Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s account via written summaries provided by Palo Alto Networks, Intel\u2019s McAfee and other security firms he used and asked to investigate the attack.\u201cI started to get the sense that we were the canary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we recorded it.\u201dSince IDT was hit, Mr. Ben-Oni has contacted everyone in his Rolodex to warn them of an attack that could still be worming its way, undetected, through victims\u2019 systems.\u201cTime is burning,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cUnderstand, this is really a war \u2014 with offense on one side, and institutions, organizations and schools on the other, defending against an unknown adversary.\u201dSince the Shadow Brokers leaked dozens of coveted attack tools in April, hospitals, schools, cities, police departments and companies around the world have largely been left to fend for themselves against weapons developed by the world\u2019s most sophisticated attacker: the N.S.A.For his part, Mr. Ben-Oni said he had rolled out Microsoft\u2019s patches as soon as they became available, but attackers still managed to get in through the IDT contractor\u2019s home modem.Six years ago, Mr. Ben-Oni had a chance meeting with an N.S.A. employee at a conference and asked him how to defend against modern-day cyberthreats. The N.S.A. employee advised him to \u201crun three of everything\u201d: three firewalls, three antivirus solutions, three intrusion detection systems. And so he did.But in this case, modern-day detection systems created by Cylance, McAfee and Microsoft and patching systems by Tanium did not catch the attack on IDT. Nor did any of the 128 publicly available threat intelligence feeds that IDT subscribes to. Even the 10 threat intelligence feeds that his organization spends a half-million dollars on annually for urgent information failed to report it. He has since threatened to return their products.\u201cOur industry likes to work on known problems,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cThis is an unknown problem. We\u2019re not ready for this.\u201dWorse still, Mr. Ben-Oni said, \u201cNo one is running point on this.\u201dLast month, he personally briefed the F.B.I. analyst in charge of investigating the WannaCry attack. He was told that the agency had been specifically tasked with WannaCry, and that even though the attack on his company was more invasive and sophisticated, it was still technically something else, and therefore the F.B.I. could not take on his case.The F.B.I. did not respond to requests for comment.So Mr. Ben-Oni has largely pursued the case himself. His team at IDT was able to trace part of the attack to a personal Android phone in Russia and has been feeding its findings to Europol, the European law enforcement agency based in The Hague.\u201cOnce DoublePulsar is on the machine, there\u2019s nothing stopping anyone else from coming along and using the back door,\u201d Mr. Dillon said.More distressing, Mr. Dillon tested all the major antivirus products against the DoublePulsar infection and a demoralizing 99 percent failed to detect it.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the same computers infected with DoublePulsar for two months and there is no telling how much malware is on those systems,\u201d Mr. Dillon said. \u201cRight now we have no idea what\u2019s gotten into these organizations.\u201dIn the worst case, Mr. Dillon said, attackers could use those back doors to unleash destructive malware into critical infrastructure, tying up rail systems, shutting down hospitals or even paralyzing electrical utilities.Could that attack be coming? The Shadow Brokers resurfaced last month, promising a fresh load of N.S.A. attack tools, even offering to supply them for monthly paying subscribers \u2014 like a wine-of-the-month club for cyberweapon enthusiasts.In a hint that the industry is taking the group\u2019s threats seriously, Microsoft issued a new set of patches to defend against such attacks. The company noted in an ominously worded message that the patches were critical, citing an \u201celevated risk for destructive cyberattacks.\u201dMr. Ben-Oni is convinced that IDT is not the only victim, and that these tools can and will be used to do far worse.\u201cI look at this as a life-or-death situation,\u201d he said. \u201cToday it\u2019s us, but tomorrow it might be someone else.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Travis Kalanick Resigns as Uber Chief", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byFive major investors had demanded in a letter to Mr. Kalanick that he resign immediately as chief executive and, after long discussions with some of the investors, Mr. Kalanick agreed.Mr. Kalanick had already said he would take a leave of absence. Day-to-day management was left to a committee of more than 10 executives, but that wasn\u2019t enough for the investors, who had pumped millions of dollars into the embattled company.The investors included some of the most prominent venture capitalists, led by Benchmark\u2019s Bill Gurley, who sits on the Uber board, as well as the mutual fund manager Fidelity Investments. The investors own more than a quarter of Uber\u2019s stock and about 40 percent of voting power because their stock gives them an outsize number of votes.The Saudis hope to offer 5 percent of the company to foreign investors, raising as much as $100 billion in what could be the biggest I.P.O. in history. The highly secretive company, which has been valued at between $400 billion to $2 trillion, has underpinned the Saudi economy for decades, but as oil prices collapsed, it became more difficult to provide financing for the government.Investment funds representing $1.6 trillion will be under heavy but informal pressure to start buying Chinese shares next year, leading to $17 billion in fresh money being pumped into the stock markets. Foreign investors own just less than 1.5 percent of Chinese stocks.Many investors measure the performance of money managers against MSCI indexes: That puts pressure on active managers to buy the shares in the index, and then add or subtract stocks to beat it. China\u2019s inclusion could make the indexes more attractive.The Chinese government has long lobbied for inclusion because it could help establish Shanghai and Shenzhen as global financial centers and could push money managers to pay more attention to corporate governance in the country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Against Terror, Is London Pride Enough?", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byThis picture has been seized upon with relief and delight because it reflects how Britons would like to see themselves in a crisis: cool, calm, priorities unchanged.\u201cLondon Pride, in a glass,\u201d said one tweeter, punning on the name of a popular brand of ale. \u201cIt\u2019s London Bridge, FFS,\u201d said another, \u201che\u2019s paid \u00a35.50 for that pint.\u201d (About $7 is considered expensive, these days.) \u201cIf beer is left behind, the terrorists win,\u201d said a third.It\u2019s the James Bond spirit writ large. Many people are defiantly hoping that while they may be shaken by the horror, London hasn\u2019t been stirred.This is true, up to a point. The radio and television shows today have been full of callers, politicians and priests claiming that the terrorists won\u2019t divide the country, that Britain stands together, that this violence cannot be blamed on mainstream Islam, that nothing will change our way of life. These are now the familiar reassurances repeated as a mantra after every atrocity.At Paddington Station this morning, in half a dozen conversations, no one admitted to fear. Charlotte Lewis, a tutor whose office is on the high street in Bermondsey where the attacks took place, scoffed at the idea that these events would affect her. She was, she said, annoyed that the disruption had made her train late. But no, she wasn\u2019t scared at all. This was the price of living in a city. She was just back from Rio, where there had been riots; much worse happened elsewhere.A bearded Hungarian tourist with his Korean girlfriend, pulling their suitcases, shrugged the threat off. No, they were not at all frightened; the chances of terror affecting them were minute. Sam, a young banker, was equally philosophical. Keep police funding up and remember that these people were a tiny minority of Muslims. John, a songwriter, said he was just pissed off. If it happened to you, it was bad luck. You were much more likely to die in a car crash. These people were bastards, but what could you do?Cultures live by myths. These create their own reality. Britons may not know much history, but they all know about the spirit of the Blitz, and many lived through the bombing campaigns of the Irish Republican Army of the 1970s and \u201980s. Many will remember that, in 1984, on the day Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and half her cabinet team were blown out of their beds in the early morning by the Brighton bomb, in which five people died, she insisted that the Conservative Party conference should still start as scheduled at 9.30 a.m.Terrorism, she said, would never cripple democracy. The country is proud of that stoicism, and on the whole, wishes to live up to it.And yet. Today, there is a ripple of unease spreading through Britain, after the third brutal and unexpected attack in three months. It is the chilling realization that whatever the antiterror strategy has been so far, it clearly hasn\u2019t worked.However many plots are being foiled, now that anyone with the access to a car or van, a kitchen knife or the internet can choose to kill, some will succeed.This is a bleak and, frankly, unbearable prospect, and it\u2019s concentrating minds. My 25-year-old son says that what terrifies him and his friends is their impotence. If this were indeed the Blitz, they could join up. If it was the \u201970s they could either fight the I.R.A. or lobby for peace talks. But here, they have no idea how to combat this, whom to talk to, how to do anything other than wait for the next atrocity to happen, and then send sympathy and hashtags in the aftermath.Others, seeing that good will and candlelit vigils have their limits, are demanding radical action. On social media and phone-ins, and in private conversations, some people are calling for the immediate internment of the 3,000 suspected radicals on the terrorist watch lists, or their deportation, or for mass aerial bombing of the Islamic States abroad.None of these will be solutions, but everyone is beginning to understand that savagery may become a regular occurrence, rather than an exceptional one \u2014 unless whoever is in government can offer a different and more successful approach.Mrs. May knows just how vulnerable she is on these issues. She is already performing unexpectedly badly in the election campaign, appearing wooden and uneasy in comparison to her Labour challenger. Normally, she and the Tories could count on scoring high for law and order, but Mrs. May is in the uncomfortable position of denouncing counterterror policies for which she herself has been responsible over the past six years (in five years as home secretary and one as prime minister).If that record is seen as lacking, the electorate may count it against her. An unsettled Britain needs something more substantial than jokes about beer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Faith and Family, in Transition", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "An evangelical minister reassesses his Brooklyn ministry when his father, also a minister, comes out as a transgender woman.Supported byJonathan Williams was three months into his ministry when his father called to say they needed to talk. Paul Williams, Jonathan\u2019s father, was prominent in the evangelical Christian world, chairman of an organization that started independent churches around the country. One of those churches was Jonathan\u2019s, Forefront Brooklyn, a new congregation that met in a performance space downtown. Paul Williams\u2019s organization, Orchard Group, had helped it raise $400,000 and assemble a staff.Paul Williams had never felt entirely comfortable with who he was. When he was very young, he thought he would someday get to choose his gender, probably before kindergarten, and at that point he would choose to be what he felt, a girl. And when the figure he thought of as the gender fairy never materialized, he soldiered on.He followed his own father into ministry, preaching as a guest in some of the country\u2019s largest evangelical churches; he married a minister\u2019s daughter, fathered three children and became a successful executive in a conservative Christian organization. From their home on Long Island, he loved to take Jonathan hiking or mountain biking. He was an alpha male, the head of a religious home. Whatever else was going on in his mind, he decided, was a secret that he would take to his grave.Then, sometime before his call to Jonathan in late 2012, he decided that he couldn\u2019t do that any longer.Jonathan, who is now 40 and favors rumpled shirts and faded jeans, came to ministry without strong positions on sexual or gender issues. He knew few openly gay people, and no transgender people. \u201cAbortion I didn\u2019t have an opinion on,\u201d he said recently at the Whole Foods Market near his home in Brooklyn. \u201cPremarital sex, same thing. My wife and I waited until we got married. It was something we valued at the time. The evangelical culture told you that that\u2019s what you do, and we did it.\u201dAt Forefront, when people asked him if his church welcomed gay congregants, his answer was always the same, he said: Yes, of course, everyone is welcome and loved. \u201cAnd then later on if they were asking, \u2018Well, are you going to hire someone who\u2019s gay?\u2019 at the time I would say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to hire someone who\u2019s gay, because we\u2019re under the Orchard Group umbrella, and they take a stance that says this.\u2019 It was an easy excuse for me, \u2019cause I wasn\u2019t sure at the time what I thought, so it was convenient. There was a line I couldn\u2019t cross, and I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to cross it, either, at that point.\u201dIn December 2012, when his father flew in from his home in Colorado to talk with him, Jonathan thought that his parents might be splitting up, or that his father had cheated on his mother. Maybe, he thought, his father was going to say he was gay.Then his father said that he wanted to live as a woman. \u201cShe said transgender,\u201d Jonathan said, inadvertently using the female pronoun, though at the time his father still used the male.\u201cI was relieved for a split second, not really knowing or understanding what it was,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cThis was before Caitlyn Jenner or \u2018Transparent.\u2019 Then within minutes, going: \u2018Oh, wait a second \u2014 wait a second. This is a way bigger deal. I would rather you be gay or be splitting up from Mom.\u2019 It was this weird wave of emotion. We had a church Christmas party that night, so I get this information and I have to go to the church Christmas party and pretend everything\u2019s O.K. I drank too much and did my best to put on a happy face, but it was pretty brutal.\u201dAt Whole Foods, he managed a wry smile at the strangeness of that day: how unprepared he was, how it set in motion events that shape his church today.His father had been his male role model and daily counselor in his ministry, as well as his entry into the evangelical world that financed his church.Now, he said: \u201cI felt betrayed, lied to. I didn\u2019t want to know my dad\u2019s new name for six, seven months after it happened. Then she said, \u2018Paula,\u2019 and I said, \u2018O.K., it\u2019s not that bad.\u2019 But I was still feeling angry.\u201dPaula Williams, 66, is 6-foot-3, with light brown ringlets, a soft voice and an affinity for phrases like, \u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d She is still married to Jonathan\u2019s mother, and they share a Christian counseling practice, but they no longer live together. \u201cOur therapist basically said, \u2018You\u2019re a lesbian and she\u2019s not,\u2019\u201d Ms. Williams said.On a warm afternoon last month, she was at the West End Collegiate Church in Manhattan for a conference of female evangelical church leaders. The conference happened to begin on her birthday, and that morning she had received a birthday email telling her that it was not too late for her to turn back to God and live as a man. She received other messages, too, that were not as mild, and some that were not mild at all.For months after she told her son about wanting to make the transition, the secret remained within the family. Paul still lived as a man within Orchard Group; Jonathan worked on establishing Forefront Brooklyn, with guidance and financial support from pastors at other conservative churches.For Jonathan, the secret threatened both his father\u2019s career and the fledgling church. People had committed their lives to making Forefront Brooklyn work, or looked to the church for moral guidance. Did he owe it to them to confide that there was a storm coming that might blow the church away?\u201cI couldn\u2019t say anything to anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cHere I am going, \u2018Let\u2019s be authentic, let\u2019s be a community that loves one another,\u2019 and I\u2019m not being authentic. I\u2019m not telling people what\u2019s going on in my life.\u201cI\u2019d be upstairs crying before church. Like, this is miserable. My dad was my hero, and my dad\u2019s not my dad any longer. I\u2019d stop crying and come down and I\u2019d preach and be really glad and say hi to everybody, and then I\u2019d get home and go to sleep. My wife would be like, \u2018You\u2019re superdepressed,\u2019 and I\u2019d go, \u2018I know, I\u2019m superdepressed, I don\u2019t know what to do about this.\u2019 I got counseling about three months after I found out. And I went to him for three, four years dealing with it.\u201dIn 2013, Paul Williams told Orchard Group that he could not live as a man any longer. He expected the board to keep him on for another two years to complete projects he had started. After all, Ms. Williams said, the Bible was mostly silent on transgender issues, except for one verse, Deuteronomy 22:5 (sometimes written, \u201cThe woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman\u2019s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God\u201d), which struck her as no more binding than biblical proscriptions against trimmed beards or long hair.Friends felt angry or betrayed, Ms. Williams said. Some prayed for her, others cut off all ties. She recalled that one young leader told her, \u201cYou were my only example of an alpha male who was gentle.\u201dThe words hit her hard. \u201cI was an alpha male and I was gentle,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cAnd I began to realize to how many of these young pastors I had been a father figure.\u201dIn Brooklyn, Jonathan Williams was still dependent on the good will of people who considered gender reassignment contrary to God\u2019s wishes. He told congregants that Forefront was a place for questions, not for answers, but many days he found himself at sea.Despite his pedigree, he had taken a circuitous route to the ministry. He stopped attending church at age 18 because it was \u201ctoo judgmental\u201d and returned six years later only because a woman said she would not date him unless he did (the two are now married, with two children). Instead of pursuing a divinity degree, he earned a master\u2019s in multicultural and urban education, and for seven years he taught fifth grade in a poor neighborhood in West Philadelphia.His parents were more supportive than he expected, he said. \u201cThey said, \u2018O.K., you\u2019re asking a lot of questions, and we feel some of the same ways you feel,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhen I look back now, I think, Was my dad going through some of his struggles with his identity, and my mom having her own struggles as well?\u201d As for his time away from church, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t miss it.\u201dWhen Paula visited for the first time in September 2013, after some hormone replacement and cosmetic surgery \u2014 she declined to discuss the details of her transition, saying it would be inconsiderate of people who cannot afford surgery \u2014 Jonathan worried that people would look at her funny or make comments. He became protective of his father, who had always protected him. But when he saw that she passed as a tastefully dressed professional woman, he found the normalcy even harder to assimilate. \u201cI\u2019m like, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. So after that I don\u2019t think I talked to her again for like another six months. Before that we talked every day, so to not talk for six months was huge.\u201d He kept his father away from his daughters, not wanting them to see their grandfather as a woman.\u201cThat was my lowest point, probably,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really depressed, not doing well, really struggling. My staff said: \u2018What\u2019s going on? You\u2019re in bad shape.\u2019\u201dStefany Fontela, 32, was an original member of Forefront Brooklyn who became close to Jonathan Williams during this period. Like him, she had also spent her early adult years estranged from the church. On a recent Sunday at the performance space Roulette, where the church meets, Ms. Fontela bounded down an aisle in a denim jacket, hugging friends from the congregation, which on this day numbered about 100, mostly in their 20s and 30s. In college in California, Ms. Fontela had been asked to leave her church and Christian sorority because she was a lesbian, and she ultimately dropped out of school.\u201cI felt that the church gave up on me,\u201d she said recently over lunch near the tech company where she works as a designer. \u201cIf anything, me not going to church forced me to develop a personal relationship with God that helped me at that moment in a way I needed it to. I was really upset. I was depressed. So I really leaned into faith. In those moments that are really dark, and you can\u2019t go to church, I could pray, I could read Scripture and try to focus.\u201cBut it was one of the darkest times of my life. The girl that I fell for abandoned me. The church abandoned me. Certain friends abandoned me because of coming out. I would sleep and listen to sad music and go to work so I could pay the rent, and that was it.\u201dWhen she got to New York and started visiting churches that described themselves as \u201cgay affirming,\u201d meaning that gay people could participate in all aspects of church life, including marrying within the church, some were too small, some not theologically rigorous enough for her. She saw an internet listing for Forefront in Manhattan, which predated the Brooklyn branch, and decided to give it a try. Though the website did not say the church was gay-affirming, there were no statements opposed to same-sex marriage, and a Google search of the pastors did not turn up any antigay remarks. At a brunch with some members, when the topic of same-sex marriage came up, Ms. Fontela waited for someone to say something that would force her to leave, she said. But everyone supported it, she said.\u201cI\u2019m sitting in this big table of Christians, and they\u2019re all completely for this thing that I\u2019ve been hiding and afraid of sharing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt got to my turn to chime in, and I could barely get the words out. I said: \u2018I don\u2019t think you guys realize how important all the things you\u2019re saying are to me right now, because I\u2019m gay and I\u2019ve been afraid to tell you guys. I feel safe.\u2019 They just embraced me even more.\u201dMs. Fontela was energetic and vivacious, eager to get more involved in the church. But Forefront was \u201cgay welcoming\u201d rather than \u201cgay inclusive\u201d or \u201cgay affirming,\u201d meaning that she could attend but not participate except from the seats. When a local blog wrote about the church \u2014 a potential boon for a new congregation seeking members \u2014 Mr. Williams and his staff did not publicize the article because Ms. Fontela talked about being a lesbian. \u201cWe could lose our support,\u201d she said.Such conflicts were making Mr. Williams increasingly restless in the church network. Ms. Fontela had become a close friend, sometimes an overnight guest, and strong in her faith. Was she really unfit to lead? What about other gay men and lesbians who might be part of the church? In summer 2014 his father visited again, and this time they had a five-hour airing of grievances \u2014 \u201cI said things like, \u2018You were a bad parent when I was 16,\u2019\u201d Mr. Williams recalled \u2014 after which he introduced his father to his two daughters, who were ages 4 and 6.\u201cI said: \u2018Girls, you\u2019re going to meet Grandpa, but it\u2019s no longer Grandpa. Grandpa is a woman. Grandpa feels she\u2019s been a woman her whole life, and now she\u2019s going to start living as a woman. So now your Grandpa\u2019s going to look different.\u2019 They walk into the house and she\u2019s there and she says hi, and after about 15 seconds my 4-year-old goes, \u2018Do you have a penis?\u2019 And we all just erupted laughing. And then it was normal.\u201dGrandpaula, they called her.On that visit, Mr. Williams remembers watching his father with the girls, holding their hands on the street. \u201cAnd that was a really big moment for me, because I was like, \u2018This is how God sees my dad,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe way my kids see my dad is the way God sees my dad. They\u2019ve got nothing but love, nothing but joy. At that point I was like, O.K., we\u2019re going to publicly talk about this now, as a church.\u201d It hurt him, he said, that his father would be a second-class member of the church. At a staff meeting in 2015, he told his core group that the church would move toward full participation for gay, lesbian and transgender members.\u201cWe took a tour of everybody who\u2019s done this in the evangelical world,\u201d seeking advice, Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt was not a big tour.\u201dDoug Pagitt in Minneapolis was one stop on the tour. Mr. Pagitt is the pastor of Solomon\u2019s Porch church and the founder of the Organizing Progressive Evangelical Network, a loose association of churches that strives for greater inclusiveness. He estimated that several dozen evangelical churches have officially affirmed gay members in recent years, with many more moving in that direction. But the path was risky, he said. Mr. Pagitt warned Mr. Williams that churches that have taken it, including EastLake Community Church near Seattle and GracePointe Church near Nashville, lost up to 70 percent of their members and large shares of their revenues. \u201cIt\u2019s not the smartest growth model,\u201d Mr. Pagitt said.\u201cIn mainline churches, clergy tend to be more progressive than their congregations,\u201d Mr. Pagitt added. \u201cIn evangelical churches, clergy tend to be more conservative than the people in the pews. And people like it that way. So when the pastor becomes more progressive, that shocks the system. Even people who are themselves O.K. with gay people in churches, something shocks them about their pastor changing. Having that conservative anchor is something they find very freeing.\u201dGo easy with the congregation, Mr. Pagitt told Mr. Williams. Make sure the people who were uncomfortable with the change did not feel indicted or unwelcome.When Mr. Williams told people that his father was transgender, reactions were divided. His childhood friends from Long Island, after their initial shock, told him that his father was happy and that he should accept that. \u201cAnd in the church world people were like, \u2018We love you, how can we support you, how can we help you,\u2019 but with an undertone of: \u2018We know your dad\u2019s wrong. We think that he should talk to so-and-so, who\u2019s a great Christian counselor.\u2019 I don\u2019t think anybody out-and-out said, \u2018Your dad is wrong.\u2019 But there was an undertone of: \u2018This isn\u2019t right. We\u2019re sorry you have to go through this thing that\u2019s not right.\u2019\u201dBecause Orchard Group is a church-planting organization and not a denomination, it provides support for a limited time, after which the churches go their own way. At Forefront Brooklyn, Mr. Williams was expected to become financially independent by 2016, four years after its start. Until then, he said, he was under the group\u2019s aegis, including restrictions against affirming gay members.Orchard Group\u2019s chief executive, Brent Storms, declined to comment for this article. Jonathan Williams emphasized that he maintained a \u201cvery strong\u201d relationship with the organization and close friendships with his associates there.But he was moving Forefront Brooklyn toward affirming gay members. He invited a gay speaker to talk about his faith and told the congregation, \u201cYou might not all agree with this, but we\u2019re not after uniformity, we\u2019re after unity, and this is the church we\u2019re going to be now.\u201d He encouraged people of divergent views to stay in the church and shape the conversations.Finally, in April 2016, Mr. Williams told his congregants that the change was official: They could now fully participate in the church whatever their sexual orientation.Ultimately, about a quarter of the congregation, 30 to 50 people, left. \u201cI had people I thought I was really good friends with leave the church,\u201d Ms. Fontela said. \u201cI had no idea they had a problem with me being gay and the church saying it was O.K. I was hurt. I know it hurt Jonathan as much as it hurt me.\u201dSarah Ngu, a new member, said she knew gay congregants who left because they thought the church was becoming too progressive, straying too far from the Bible.But new people joined the church, some referred by gay evangelical organizations. Affirming gay members distinguished Forefront from similar churches. Though finances are tight, Mr. Williams said the church has grown stronger.\u201cWe\u2019re a more transparent church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe say a lot of times that we\u2019re way more interested in asking good questions than having the answers. And I think people were able to open up with a lot of questions, not necessarily related to that. Like, I don\u2019t know if Christianity works for me, but I\u2019m still here. Or, I\u2019m battling bipolar disorder, but I\u2019m here. It opened us up to talk through our struggles.\u201dFor Paula Williams, a surprise of coming out as transgender was discovering the extent of misogyny and male privilege within the church, and the degree to which she had benefited from these in her male past. Churches that once welcomed her in the pulpit would no longer permit her to preach, not because she was transgender, but because she was female.For the family, she said, the hardest part was not having a chance to mourn Paul. He was the head of the household, and one day he was gone \u2014 not dead or estranged, but a pronoun they no longer used.Jonathan Williams said he worked to keep sexual issues from dominating Forefront\u2019s identity. He had started the church with an emphasis on service and social justice, and he wanted to maintain this.\u201cI\u2019m very clear that we\u2019re a Christian church,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere we plant our flag is in Jesus Christ. We just happen to be inclusive and affirming. But we\u2019re not the gay church. And that\u2019s something I\u2019ve said from the stage: No, we\u2019re a Jesus-believing church.\u201dOn a spring Sunday at Roulette, Ben Grace, Forefront Brooklyn\u2019s worship director, led the congregation through a light rock song welcoming \u201ca rainbow of race and gender and color\u201d and claiming \u201cfor everyone born, the right to be free.\u201d Mr. Williams in his sermon made no mention of sex or gender, hewing instead to themes of social justice.He told a story about Jesus healing lepers and restoring them to their communities, then segued to Colin Kaepernick, the pro football quarterback who was criticized for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police violence. \u201cWe struggle with people who upend social structures,\u201d Mr. Williams said, contrasting this to the \u201cneat, tidy Jesus\u201d envisioned by many Christians. \u201cNo, Jesus is crazy, he\u2019s upending social structures.\u201d\u201cThis is the Jesus that we want to follow,\u201d he added.It was not polished, and he seemed most comfortable describing his own stumbles on his way to ministry, breaking down the distinction between the minister and the congregation. But in this crowd, on this day, it did the trick. As the music came up for communion, the congregants lined both aisles.Ashley Austin Morris, a comedy writer and performer who was attending the service after some time away, said she appreciated the church\u2019s acceptance of disorder.She had left because she wanted a church that would force her to change herself, she said, but then returned because experiences at the ones she found were too painful.\u201cAt one the pastor said, \u2018I really don\u2019t know how you can be a Christian and be in entertainment,\u2019\u201d Ms. Morris said. \u201cI internalize that and say, \u2018I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m bad.\u2019 I fell apart over that. When really, you\u2019re not supposed to just hang out in a church with other Christians. You\u2019re supposed to be loving wherever you work. I really got that at Forefront. I felt more accepted there, and people didn\u2019t have answers.\u201dShe did not know if she would remain at Forefront, but she was glad to be there.\u201cI don\u2019t like when people have answers,\u201d she said, sounding a lot like Mr. Williams. \u201cI don\u2019t have answers. I have a lot of questions. And for me, that\u2019s what practicing your faith means.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with the continuation of an article about Jonathan Williams, the pastor of Forefront church in Brooklyn, whose father recently came out as a transgender woman, referred incorrectly to the man in the center of the photograph shown wearing a plaid shirt. He is a member of the congregation; he is not Mr. Williams.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Poet\u2019s Bicoastal Conjurings, From Garden State to Golden Gate", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byPoetryWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The poems of August Kleinzahler are weathered. You can interpret that in a couple of ways. There is weather in them, yes \u2014 wind in the trees, fog curling through the streets, sudden storms. Temperamentally urban, a resident of San Francisco who grew up in the part of New Jersey that\u2019s across the George Washington Bridge from Manhattan, Kleinzahler can\u2019t exactly be categorized as a nature poet, but he does have a fine-tuned sensitivity to seasonal and barometric fluctuations. Consider this passage from \u201cClosing It Down on the Palisades,\u201d one of his numerous musings on a Garden State state of mind: \u201cEarly yet for the cicadas, / their gathering rush and ebb. / Too cool, / the sun not high enough.\u201dBut Kleinzahler\u2019s work is weathered in a different way, as well: His poems bear the markings of age, of hard-won experience. Like characters in a Cassavetes film, the people who drift through his stanzas can be found looking over their shoulders at life. Bathed in fluorescent light at supermarkets and liquor stores and Chinese takeout counters, they cling to the rattle of romanticism despite the grinding passage of time and the growing abundance of evidence that the old world is collapsing around them. As Kleinzahler writes in \u201cWarm Night in February\u201d:When they do catch a whiff, though, what they often smell is industrial vapor. Kleinzahler could be the poet laureate of American pollution, singing in \u201cBefore Dawn on Bluff Road\u201d of:Nature and its opposite are stuck with each other in Kleinzahler\u2019s body of work. He\u2019s swooning over dogwood blossoms a beat or two before he\u2019s calling forth the \u201cbleak perfume / of benzene.\u201d Follow your nose. Over here you find the fragrance of eucalyptus, and a few pages away, in \u201cThe Single Gentleman\u2019s Chow Mein,\u201d you catch the scent of apartment-invading ants and the poison that\u2019s meant to halt their march: \u201cThey have a smell, of that I\u2019m certain, / a formic aroma, / that gathers around them in the heat / of their frenzy.\u201d All of it brings Kleinzahler back home \u2014 the stink of garlic in \u201cWhere Galluccio Lived,\u201d the urine and mold in \u201cDisappointment,\u201d the chlorine of a pool in \u201cThe Swimmer,\u201d whatever\u2019s pumping out of the smokestacks of those factories, \u201cthe aroma / almost comforting by now.\u201dIn fact, the concept of home could be viewed as the framing device for this captivating collection of poems, which comes packaged as two books in one. Venture in from one side and you get a series of poems set in one home, New Jersey; flip it over and you\u2019re in San Francisco, where \u201csmoke blows in from the sea, sea / smoke, ghost vapor / of lost frigates, sunken destroyers.\u201d So precise are Kleinzahler\u2019s regional descriptions that a newcomer would be able to separate the East Coast poems from the West Coast poems without being told which are which. Too many poets these days seem to be allergic to a sense of place, as though rooting their work in a region would somehow shackle it to the mundane. But that quality of being grounded in parts of the country \u2014 places where there\u2019s a specificity to the way the light hits your eyes and the air hits your nostrils \u2014 is one of the things that make Kleinzahler\u2019s poetry so appealing.Regardless of which coast he\u2019s on, Kleinzahler is wary of these new ways of being and working and thinking. He hauls around a full but cranky heart, and the finest moments in his poetry are the weathered ones, the melancholic lines in which he\u2019s peering through the fog to examine his past. In \u201cA History of Western Music: Chapter 29,\u201d he pays tribute to the memory of Thom Gunn (another poet transplanted to the Bay Area from elsewhere) by altering the lyrics of Johnny Mercer\u2019s \u201cI Thought About You\u201d (popularized by Frank Sinatra in the 1950s) into an elegy. In \u201cWatching Young Couples With an Old Girlfriend on Sunday Morning,\u201d Kleinzahler recalls \u201cthe drunkenness, beast savor, and remorse,\u201d comparing passion to \u201ca darkness that got loose, a frenzy.\u201dFor those readers who have grown skeptical of contemporary poetry that\u2019s marked by antiseptic detachment and cute-geek deadpan posturing, the beast savor of Kleinzahler\u2019s work serves as a vigorous antidote. This is the poetry of a messy and hungry and odorous life. (In a perfect world, someone would enlist Jack Nicholson \u2014 another Jersey guy who went out to California \u2014 to recite the poems for an audiobook.) Rays of tenderness break through the bluster, though, and when they do, their beauty is unmistakable. In \u201cFamily Album,\u201d Kleinzahler goes back to New Jersey, where \u201cno one is left here who knows me anymore,\u201d and by the time he reaches the closing two lines, his home might just feel like your home, everyone\u2019s home, accessible only in memory:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congressman\u2019s Shooting Likely a Spontaneous Act, F.B.I. Says", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported by\u201cHe was struggling in all kinds of different ways,\u201d Timothy R. Slater, a senior F.B.I. agent at the Washington Field Office, said during a news conference. \u201cI think he was struggling in a lot of aspects of his life.\u201dMr. Hodgkinson began firing on members of Congress and others at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Va., as they practiced for the annual congressional charity baseball game. Mr. Scalise, 51, was gravely wounded after a rifle bullet tore through his hip. Since then, he has steadily improved.Five people were shot at a morning practice about five miles from the Capitol, the police said.Two Capitol Police officers were also wounded, as were Zachary Barth, a staff member for Representative Roger Williams of Texas, and Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods and a former congressional aide.The F.B.I. said Mr. Hodgkinson, who had railed against President Trump on social media and voiced support for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, was carrying SKS 7.62-millimeter semiautomatic assault rifle and a 9-millimeter handgun. The authorities said he had legally previously purchased the rifle in 2003 and bought the handgun in November 2016, though they did not say whether he did so before or after the presidential election. The SKS had been modified to accept a detachable magazine, and the original stock was replaced with a folding one, the F.B.I. said.A factory SKS can be slow and difficult to reload. The modifications that Mr. Hodgkinson made would have allowed him to remove an empty magazine and replace it with a full one more swiftly and easily. The folding stock can help the weapon be more readily hidden.Investigators said they found shell casings from both weapons at the scene. The F.B.I. said Mr. Hodgkinson fired more than 60 shots from the third-base side of the field, about 50 from the SKS rifle.Three Capitol Police officers were at the field when the shooting started. Officers with the Alexandria Police Department also responded to the shooting and shot at Mr. Hodgkinson in trying to stop him.Mr. Hodgkinson was carrying a piece of paper with the names of six lawmakers, the F.B.I. said. But the list lacked any context, and the F.B.I. said a review of computer searches showed he had only done a cursory search of two of those members of Congress.Mr. Slater said Mr. Hodgkinson was running out of money at the time of the shooting. His marriage of 30 years was also crumbling. And he had been taking prescription medication, though Mr. Slater declined to describe it.According to the statement, the F.B.I. discovered a laptop computer, cellphone and digital camera in Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s vehicle. He had photographed Washington landmarks including the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court and the Capitol, but the F.B.I. did not believe those sites were targets.In March, Mr. Hodgkinson told a family member that he was driving to Washington but did not explain why. Authorities have said he was living out of his van near the baseball field. On April 4, he joined the neighborhood Y.M.C.A., where he would shower and spend hours a day on his laptop.Mr. Hodgkinson attended one protest in April in Washington, a rally on Tax Day calling for an overhaul of the tax system, Mr. Slater said. He also visited the office of Mr. Sanders, according to Mr. Slater.One day later, Mr. Hodgkinson rented a storage unit in Alexandria, which he visited dozens of times between April and June, the F.B.I. said. The police discovered more than 200 rounds of ammunition and additional SKS rifle components in the unit.Mr. Hodgkinson sent an email two days before the shooting that indicated he wanted to return home, a family member told the F.B.I. The day before the shooting, he canceled his membership at the Y.M.C.A., and that night, investigators also disclosed, he had done a Google map search on the route from Alexandria to his home in Belleville.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Envisioning the Car of the Future as a Living Room on Wheels", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "Supported byWheelsSwiveling seats? Movies projected across the windshield? Social media feeds on the windows? As driverless car technology develops, companies, design institutes and researchers are asking the question: What does the car of the future look like on the inside?With companies like Google, Uber and others racing ahead to develop fully autonomous vehicles, the era of the driver hunched over the steering wheel may eventually give way to a living room on wheels. But with its long development lead times, designers are already thinking about how such technology will change the interiors of cars.\u201cWhen people are in an autonomous vehicle, their expectations will shift,\u201d said Hakan Kostepen, executive director for strategy and innovation at Panasonic\u2019s automotive systems unit, a major industry supplier. \u201cThey will want their personal space to become one of smart mobility, connecting them and relevant information to act upon.\u201dWhen cars are fully autonomous, how we sit, inform and entertain ourselves will be up for grabs. If steering wheels are no longer needed, how do we best configure seating positions? What should be done with the space now occupied by a dashboard, once a vehicle handles all driving tasks and even decides when it needs to be serviced?Those are all challenges being taken up by the automotive industry and the schools that supply them with the next generation of designers.At ArtCenter College of Design in Los Angeles \u2014 one of the world\u2019s premier automotive design schools \u2014 14 students recently worked on creating new concepts for a future vehicle interior whose occupants would no longer be shackled by the need to drive.Participants were picked from multiple disciplines, including product design, transportation and graphics. To fuel their discussions, specialists in the fields of sound composition, olfactory reaction and even animal behavior were brought in. Visual strategists from NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory paid a visit as well.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.The proposals, which were reviewed by executives from the carmaker BMW, the electronics firm Nvidia and IBM\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence division, varied wildly.In one concept, social media feeds were displayed on the windows and an all-glass roof, creating what is known as an augmented reality projection, providing contextual information on passing landmarks and approaching sights. As the vehicle drove by a restaurant, reviews of the eatery would be displayed and an online reservation form would appear on the building.Video games would be integrated into the passing environment. Players could fire \u201cweapons\u201d at buildings, and then, via a projection on the glass, see the structure go up in digital flames.Another group envisioned a vehicle\u2019s interior as a constantly changing environment, using variable lighting and temperatures to fit the evolving moods and desires of each occupant, as determined through a sensor analysis of physiological and emotional states.A third proposal contemplated the use of virtual reality and motion-sensing seats to give occupants the feeling of driving a sports car, even when they were simply riding in a tame autonomous vehicle.The concepts are not wholly pie in the sky \u2014 graduates of the ArtCenter have gone on to design vehicles like BMW\u2019s i3 electric car and Tesla\u2019s Model S \u2014 but nevertheless are a step beyond what is being developed by vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, who must take cost, brand reputation and consumer acceptance into account.Panasonic is one such company, and it is considering ideas like altering a vehicle\u2019s internal lighting depending on its occupants\u2019 moods or allowing a child passenger to initiate a search to find a nearby parking spot. Like students at the ArtCenter, Panasonic is also looking at using the windshield as an overlay for additional information or advertisements. The company declined to say how much it was spending on researching vehicle interiors, but said it was a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount.BMW is experimenting with keeping instruments at a low height. When necessary, the \u201cdriver\u201d or responsible party would interact with controls through a holographic projection that would appear to hover closer to eye level in space, meaning they would not need to take their eyes off the road while adjusting the temperature or changing radio stations.To confirm that a command was registered, the driver would receive haptic feedback transmitted in space, but while it would feel as if one were touching a button on an Android smartphone, the user would not physically be touching anything.When the vehicle is in fully autonomous mode, the windshield could be turned into a wide-screen display, allowing passengers to watch a movie; theater-like seats would vibrate in sync with sound effects.Speakers embedded in each seat would also include noise-cancellation technology to ensure that only the person watching could hear the soundtrack, music or phone call in progress. When the driver has to take control of the vehicle, rear-seat passengers could be entertained using a large screen lowered from the roof.In an autonomous vehicle, \u201cwe can push technology into the background and only make it present when it\u2019s needed,\u201d said Holger Hampf, BMW\u2019s head for user experience.One thing the carmaker does not envision: swiveling, rear-facing seats. \u201cWhen you reverse the seats you can induce motion sickness,\u201d Mr. Hampf said.Panasonic and BMW are far from the only companies developing the future of automobile interiors.Valeo, a France-based automotive supplier to General Motors and other companies, has 14,000 engineers working on future vehicle projects, drawing in employees from its visibility, comfort and driving, and thermal systems groups to reimagine interiors. It spent 1.6 billion euros, or $1.75 billion, on such research and development last year alone.The company wants to use light to alert and affect passengers \u2014 a glowing orange light on the right-hand side of the vehicle would point passengers to an oncoming danger, while a blue light would combine with air-conditioning to help make the interior feel cooler.Using artificial intelligence, a vehicle would learn its passengers\u2019 preferences in terms of language, climate and entertainment and then modify itself accordingly, said Guillaume Devauchelle, Valeo\u2019s vice president for group innovation and scientific development. The car could potentially even understand that a passenger had just been to the gym and adjust the cabin temperature accordingly.Similarly, Bosch, a major German automotive supplier, believes cars will eventually be shared rather than individually owned, and so the company is working on systems that will allow vehicles to automatically personalize themselves. An eye scan, fingerprint or smartphone connection will signal who is getting into the vehicle, so that it can adjust its climate, seating position, favored radio stations and other attributes automatically.One major question, however, is already being confronted: While much is doable, should it be done?\u201cOn paper, it seems great that I can read email on my car\u2019s window, but will we actually want it?\u201d Mr. Kostepen of Panasonic said. \u201cA car has to maintain its brand DNA even when it is fully autonomous.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What You Get (and What You Don\u2019t) From a $50 Amazon Fire", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhat can $50 buy? An inexpensive pair of sneakers, maybe dinner for two in San Francisco or a couple of tickets to the ballgame. But few ever imagined that it could also buy a tablet computer capable of running apps and streaming Netflix.Amazon\u2019s tablet success stands out because sales of the devices as a whole have been shrinking. Slowing tablet sales have compelled Apple to refresh its iPads more frequently than many of its other products. In fact, Apple on Monday introduced yet another new iPad with a 10.5-inch screen and a starting price of $649.After testing Amazon\u2019s Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 for a week, here\u2019s my verdict: These cheap tablets are ideal for families with children who treat gadgets like toys that can be slammed on a table or thrown against the ground. But if you\u2019re an adult who needs to get the slightest amount of work done on a tablet, you should probably spend the extra money on a big-screen smartphone or an iPad.Here\u2019s what you need to know about what you get \u2014 and what you don\u2019t \u2014 from a $50 Amazon tablet.The best thing about the new tablets is how they feel to hold. Weighing about 10 ounces and 13 ounces, the seven-inch and eight-inch devices were designed to be easily carried in one hand. After spending hours holding the Fire with one hand to read e-books and to watch Netflix videos, my wrist did not feel strained. The compact size also makes these tablets great for children with small hands.The Fire 7 also had surprisingly long battery life for a device this inexpensive. Amazon says it gets about eight hours of juice while juggling various tasks, like browsing the web and running apps. I watched about four and a half hours of video before its battery drained. That\u2019s modest, but enough for playing a feature-length movie before tucking a child into bed. Amazon says the eight-incher has a battery life of 12 hours.While the Fires have mediocre displays with dull colors and noticeable pixelation even when reading e-books, the lower quality is acceptable at this price. I wouldn\u2019t use a Fire for reading digital comics, which usually have a wide range of colors and sharp illustrations, but the tablet is sufficient for flipping through e-books, which are just black text on white pages.For internet speeds, the Fires were reasonably fast at downloads. In my tests on a Wi-Fi network, Apple\u2019s $329 iPad had download speeds of 92 megabits a second, compared with the Fire 7, at 48 megabits a second. While the Fires were only about half as fast as the pricier iPad, 48 megabits a second was more than enough to smoothly stream video and quickly download apps and e-books.The worst part of the Fires is the overall computing power. The tablets are so slow at loading apps and processing tasks that even typing memos is painful; whenever you make a mistake, there is a lag as you backspace to type the correct letter.The sluggishness also makes the Fires terrible for scrolling through web articles. Don\u2019t buy an Amazon tablet if you plan to use it for email, web browsing or playing games with heavy graphics.Another major component lacking from Amazon\u2019s tablets is access to Google\u2019s official app store, the largest mobile software shop with more than 2.5 million apps. The tablets run a modified version of Google\u2019s Android that instead showcases Amazon\u2019s App store. While there are hundreds of thousands of apps inside Amazon\u2019s app store, I found that some of my favorite apps were missing \u2014 namely 1Password, an app for managing passwords.Perhaps the biggest design oversight of the Fire 7 is the placement of the speaker on the back of the tablet. Most other tablets feature the speakers on the bottom or sides so that blockage isn\u2019t a problem.But if you place the tablet bottom-side down on a flat surface to listen to music from the speaker, the sound will be muffled. Instead, you have to lay it screen-side down. The same problem occurs if you hold it with a protective cover on: The back flap covers the speaker. (The Fire 8 does not have this problem, because the speakers are on the side.)Lastly, if you pay the bare minimum of $50 for the seven-incher or $80 for the eight-incher, you are getting a tablet that shows ads, or what Amazon calls \u201cspecial offers.\u201d What that means is the lock screen, which is what you see when you wake up the device, will shuffle through different ads, like e-book or app promotions. You can pay an extra $15 to buy versions of the tablets without sponsored screens.With all that said, would you pay $50 for an adequate e-book reader and TV show and movie player that was easy to carry around everywhere? My guess would be yes.But perhaps the most compelling value proposition is a hidden one: keeping your child\u2019s hands off your fancy iPad.An earlier version of this article used an outdated brand reference to the Amazon Fire tablet. The tables are now simply called Fire, no longer Kindle Fire.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chicken Sandwich Hitches a Balloon Ride to the Stratosphere", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byBut its initial passenger will be a tangy fried chicken sandwich.The company said on Tuesday that the first flight of a fully equipped high-flying balloon would take off as soon as June 21, with a payload of fast food.Perhaps you\u2019ve seen the KFC television commercial where Colonel Sanders, (played by the actor Rob Lowe), riffs on John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1962 \u201cWe choose to go to the moon\u201d speech.The Zinger, a spicy fried chicken sandwich that\u2019s hand-breaded, with mayo and lettuce, isn\u2019t new, but until this spring it wasn\u2019t sold in the United States. Created in 1984 for restaurants in Trinidad and Tobago, it is now sold in more than 120 countries. George Felix, KFC\u2019s director of advertising, said the concept of the marketing campaign was the dual launch on the ground in the United States and to the stratosphere.The agency in charge of the campaign, Wieden & Kennedy, approached World View to help send the sandwich up.\u201cAs you can imagine, when we first heard about it, we laughed our heads off,\u201d said Jane Poynter, World View\u2019s chief executive. \u201cAnd when we picked ourselves off the floor, we actually thought it was really, really cool.\u201dWorld View was finishing up development of balloons it calls stratollites \u2014 a mash-up of stratosphere and satellites \u2014 and while a stratollite will not reach the 62-mile-high threshold regarded as the edge of space, it is also much cheaper than a sending a rocket to orbit.KFC signed up to take part in the demonstration flight, which will test the full complement of technologies, including solar panels to generate power and the navigational technology that will tap into prevailing winds to steer to any part of the world and then hover over a particular spot. \u201cIt\u2019s really a shakedown cruise,\u201d Ms. Poynter said.If all goes according to plan, the balloon will stay aloft for at least four days. Earlier stratollite flights, testing various components, were in the air for less than a day.Ultimately, stratollites could prove a boon to atmospheric and astronomical research, serving as platforms for long-term observations. Downward-looking radar could provide data to generate earlier and more precise storm warnings. Other stratollites could serve as internet relays over remote parts of the world.Kenneth Howard, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that although computer models that predict hurricanes and tornadoes have improved, \u201cthey\u2019re data-starved.\u201dGround-based weather radar is blocked by mountains. The curvature of the Earth limits the area that a radar station can monitor. And there is no radar coverage at all for weather over vast stretches of the oceans.Mr. Howard envisioned stratollites loitering over Tornado Alley, the slice of the Central United States where the storms strike most often. Weather models can point out two or three days in advance where storms could spawn tornadoes. A stratollite could then be sent to that location to quickly spot tornadoes as they begin to spin and perhaps give people a half-hour or more of warning to seek shelter. (Current warning times are less than 10 minutes on average, Mr. Howard said.)Mr. Howard said the agency hoped to fly several demonstrations of radar and other weather instruments on World View stratollites in the coming year.Weather forecasting and the other robotic uses of stratollites weren\u2019t part of World View\u2019s original business plan. Tourism was.Companies like Blue Origin, founded by Jeffrey P. Bezos, and Virgin Galactic, founded by Richard Branson, are promising rides all the way to space inside rocket-powered vehicles, offering a few minutes of exhilaration and weightlessness in what are essentially supersize roller coaster rides.Ms. Poynter and Mr. MacCallum, who are married, figured there could also be a market for tourism rides that might not go as high as Blue Origin\u2019s or Virgin Galactic\u2019s but that would last much longer while offering a similar view of Earth.A much larger balloon would lift a spacious cabin to the stratosphere. During a gentle flight lasting five or six hours, six passengers could walk around and gaze out the windows at the Earth below.Amenities would include a bar and a bathroom.That plan is still in progress. Although the company is not saying when it hopes trips with paying passengers would begin, World View is taking reservations at $75,000 per person. A test flight with a full-size simulator of the cabin is scheduled for later this year.Along the way, the company discovered a market beyond tourists. \u201cPeople kept calling. \u2018Could you fly this payload?\u2019\u201d Mr. MacCallum said. \u201cNASA gave us a contract to fly payloads. And then other folks called and said, \u2018Could you fly a radar? Or could you do this?\u2019 All these ideas started coming in, and we were just like, in the beginning, kind of flat-footed about this.\u201dWorld View added stratollites to its business portfolio. It plans as many as 12 stratollite flights this year.Given that it is a first flight of the full stratollite system, KFC planned, as NASA would, for what it would do in case something went wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s a real space mission,\u201d laughed Mr. Felix of KFC. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of different contingencies. We know there are a lot of things out of our control.\u201dFor Ms. Poynter, the trip will provide a way to show new, cheaper routes to space and not-quite-space.\u201cIf you fly a chicken sandwich to space, why can\u2019t you fly anything?\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re really showing how you can make space accessible to almost anyone at almost anytime for almost anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They catch them one by one, each in its own compartment, after inspecting each mosquito\u2019s wing beats to be sure it\u2019s a species that researchers want.\u201cWe were the first to have these,\u201d said Mustapha Debboun, director of mosquito control for the Harris County public health department. \u201cI saw something on the internet about them, and I said, \u2018Whoa \u2014 can I get some?\u2019\u201cThey\u2019ve been wonderful,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy would I want to collect a thousand nuisance mosquitoes if I can avoid it?\u201dThe new traps, made by Microsoft, overcome one of the most frustrating aspects of insect surveillance: There are 56 species of mosquitoes in this buggy bayou city, and conventional traps suck in nearly all of them.Entomologists want only a few disease-carrying types, including Aedes aegypti, which carries Zika and dengue, and Culex quinquefasciatus, which spreads West Nile virus.To find them, scientists must freeze whole batches caught in the usual traps and tediously hand-sort them with tweezers under a microscope.Making matters worse, most traps suck the insects through a fan and then whirl them around a mesh basket for hours.\u201cThe white scales get rubbed off, so you lose the white lyre on the back that tells you it\u2019s aegypti,\u201d said Pamela Stark, a county entomologist. \u201cJune bugs get pulled in and stomp around like cows.\u201dThe Microsoft trap, by contrast, has 64 compartments, arrayed like studio apartments in a skyscraper.If it\u2019s a species the county wants, a clear plastic door shuts \u201clike a Venus fly trap,\u201d Dr. Jackson said. The trap can catch the right species almost 90 percent of the time.Each compartment also records and uploads to a website the time, temperature, humidity and ambient light \u2014 data that records when each species hunts for blood, which is a good time to spray.The first 30 prototypes, of which Houston has 10, cost several thousand dollars each, Dr. Jackson said. But he hopes to get the price down below $300, so even poor countries where malaria and yellow fever kill thousands of victims could afford them.Selling traps is not the point, he explained. He has a far more ambitious goal: to have thousands of them around the world gathering viral DNA the way Google Street View gathers pictures \u2014 for the value of the data.He was thinking about Ebola\u2019s long migration from central Africa to Guinea, he said, when he had an idea.Animals are full of diseases that infect humans, but it\u2019s tricky to get blood samples from gorillas, migrating birds, cave-dwelling bats, poisonous snakes and so on.\u201cThen I realized that\u2019s a mosquito\u2019s full-time job,\u201d Dr. Jackson said. \u201cThere are over 3,600 species, but if we can catch the right ones and do metagenetic sequencing on all the DNA and RNA we find in them, we can see the diseases on the move.\u201dMosquitoes, he suggested, could make that go much faster \u201cby being their field biologists.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Vision of Computing\u2019s Future: An Information Appliance", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the late 1970s, Jef Raskin, a pioneering technologist who was one of Apple\u2019s earliest employees, sketched out a radical vision for the future of computing.But now, all of a sudden, Mr. Raskin\u2019s information appliance is here, sitting on my kitchen counter.But these are quibbles. The Echo Show is a remarkable machine, not just for what it is now but for the way it clarifies Amazon\u2019s vision of the future of computing. It\u2019s becoming the model for a new kind of communal, household computer \u2014 a resurrection of Mr. Raskin\u2019s idea of an information appliance, as opposed to Mr. Jobs\u2019s vision of an all-purpose PC.One measure of the power of this vision is how quickly Amazon\u2019s rivals are racing to copy it; both Apple and Google have their own takes on the Echo.It\u2019s questionable how far these rivals will get. Amazon\u2019s business model, which depends on millions of households buying millions of goods, is uniquely suited to selling Echos at low prices, because Amazon is certain it can make money on the device from extra Amazon purchases. (The lowest-priced Echo, the Dot, sells for $50; the new Show, available to the public starting Wednesday, sells for $230, but you get $100 off if you buy two.)I suspect you\u2019re scoffing. The primary knock on Mr. Raskin\u2019s information appliance was that it didn\u2019t do a whole lot. This is also the main criticism of the Echo and, now, the Echo Show. These devices can\u2019t do anything you can\u2019t do on your phone, PC or tablet.That\u2019s true, but it also kind of misses the point. You can make toast in the oven, but you have a toaster because it\u2019s designed to perform a specific task reliably and without any fuss.That\u2019s the point of the information appliance, too. There\u2019s a whole lot the Echo Show won\u2019t do. It won\u2019t do email. It won\u2019t do the web. It won\u2019t play first-person shooters. It is emphatically, purposely not a general-purpose computer. But what it does do \u2014 play music and videos, make video calls, tell you the news, tell you the time and weather, and shop at Amazon \u2014 it does with such surpassing ease that it feels like a magic trick.There are a few reasons for that. One is the Show\u2019s unusual and quietly innovative interface.Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, told me that when the company was first designing the Show, it tried to use the same interface that it used for its tablet computers. But the team soon realized this didn\u2019t work. For one thing, the Echo Show is designed to be used just with your voice \u2014 the screen adds extra information, but you have to look at it only when you specifically ask for visual information (such as when you want a video). A standard mobile operating system, which is heavily visual, just wouldn\u2019t work.Another reason a tablet interface wouldn\u2019t have worked is that it felt too much like a computer, and one overriding design goal of the Echo and the Echo Show was to hide any relationship to anything computerlike.The Show\u2019s operating system, memory, storage and other specifications are completely hidden from users. The Echo does have a version of apps, known as \u201cskills,\u201d but they aren\u2019t anything like smartphone apps. You install them just by asking Alexa to enable them, and when you want to use one, you just name it. To watch a video, you just ask for the video \u2014 you don\u2019t load up a web browser or the YouTube app and then search for it.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different mental model than the traditional computer, smartphone or tablet, where you have to think of which app you want to use and then open it and then dive in,\u201d Mr. Limp wrote in an email.The Echo Show has one other advantage over smartphones and tablets: It\u2019s always there in the same spot.Your phone and tablet move around the house. Often they are nearby, but sometimes they aren\u2019t. That uncertainty makes them less useful for the kind of ambient computing tasks the Echo is good at. When you are in the kitchen and need to look up a recipe, you could find your iPad to call it up. But the Echo Show is always there, so you and everyone else at home come to rely on it \u2014 you know that when you call out for it, it will always answer.Such communal, stationary devices are not unusual in our homes. All the appliances are stationary and communal, from the fridge to the washing machine. We also have some appliances whose sole purpose is to provide us with information and entertainment \u2014 bedside clocks and TVs, for instance. Mr. Limp said these informational appliances provided a \u201cmental model\u201d for the Show\u2019s design, which got me thinking about the expansiveness of Amazon\u2019s ambitions here.The Show has a seven-inch screen. There\u2019s no reason the screen could not be slightly bigger \u2014 an iPad-size one that clings to your bathroom mirror, for instance. Or it could be much, much bigger.In fact, let me go out on a limb: Within a couple of years, I bet Amazon will make its own TV that will work just like the Echo Show. Because if you are trying to create the perfect home appliance, there is no better target than the biggest screen in the house.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Easy Money Is Drying Up, and Markets Tremble", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byIt could be time for markets to come down from their sugar highs.After years of injecting trillions of dollars into their economies in an effort to encourage growth, central bankers have become more forthright in signaling an end to easy-money policies.What started as tremors in European government bonds after a speech on Tuesday by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, had spread to global stocks by Thursday.Mr. Draghi called for prudence in policy, and investors seemed to interpret that as a step back from the bank\u2019s commitment to buying European government bonds. Central bank officials were quick to point out that Mr. Draghi did not say that he would tighten policy immediately. But investors apparently ignored that.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, also indicated on Tuesday that an increase in rates might be in order.Those signals have prompted speculation that central bankers may be coordinating efforts to warn investors who benefited from the liquidity boom.Indeed, officials from the Federal Reserve have been saying for several weeks that financial markets were overheated.Investors are also keeping a close eye on the \u201cFaang\u201d stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which dropped briefly in early June. Those stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of market gains, and they are getting more expensive. A sustained fall could also lead to a bear market.Those jumps promised some notable benefits:\u2022 Investors get a bump in their dividends;\u2022 Executives could see their pay packages swell;\u2022 The big institutions might have more flexibility to lend, which could promote more long-term growth.Critics worry, however, that less regulatory pressure could set the stage for a return to the bad old days of enormous leverage and freewheeling.Instead, Rite Aid will sell 2,186 of its 4,600 stores to Walgreens, along with three distribution centers, for $5.18 billion. The announcement sent Rite Aid shares tumbling.The resistance was not unexpected \u2014 the companies\u2019 original $9.3 billion deal would have created a group with more outlets than CVS Health, the biggest drugstore chain by market capitalization in the United States.In spite of hopes that antitrust regulation would ease under President Trump, several deals, including in the health care sector, have been derailed this year.The British authorities have asked regulators to further examine a $15 billion bid by 21st Century Fox to take over the 61 percent of Sky, the European satellite giant, that it does not already own.Rupert Murdoch and his family will now face a review by Britain\u2019s competition authority, but they have dodged a regulatory bullet. The authorities ruled that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, even as they concluded that the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had pointed to \u201csignificant corporate failures.\u201dThe British Office of Communications, or Ofcom, did not hold back in its criticism of the scandal at Fox News, noting that 21st Century Fox was aware of multiple cases against Bill O\u2019Reilly that had led to settlements when it renewed its contract with the former host.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Weighs Leave of Absence for Chief Executive", "Date": "2017-06-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facing accusations that Uber executives turned a blind eye to sexual harassment and other corporate misbehavior, the ride-hailing service\u2019s board moved on Sunday to shake up the company\u2019s leadership, ahead of the release this week of an investigation\u2019s findings on its troubled culture.In addition, a representative for Uber\u2019s board said the directors \u201cunanimously voted\u201d to adopt all of the recommendations made in a report by the former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., who was retained to investigate the company\u2019s culture. One of the recommendations included the departure of a top lieutenant to Mr. Kalanick, Emil Michael, said the people with knowledge of the board\u2019s agenda, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential.The moves would scale back the involvement of Mr. Kalanick and strip him of an ally, a turnabout for a chief executive who had been hailed as an innovator and a role model. The changes would also further destabilize the leadership at Uber, which has upended the transportation industry worldwide, at a time when rivals are trying to capitalize on the company\u2019s woes.The discussions by the nine-member board preceded a report from Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation, scheduled to be released on Tuesday. In recent months, Uber has fired more than 20 employees for infractions including sexual harassment and discrimination.\u201cThis starts at the very top,\u201d said Micah Alpern, a principal at A. T. Kearney, a top management and consulting firm. \u201cThey need to start from scratch to create a new culture entirely.\u201dUber\u2019s current crisis stems from claims in February from a former engineer, Susan Fowler, that she had been routinely sexually harassed when she worked at the company and that the human resources department had done little to help her. An outpouring of other cases followed, and Uber retained at least two law firms \u2014 including Covington & Burling \u2014 to look into the matters.Uber has since faced other problems, including an intellectual property dispute over self-driving car technology with Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google\u2019s parent company. Uber also is dealing with a Justice Department investigation into tools that it used to evade law enforcement personnel in cities where the authorities were trying to shut down its ride-hailing service. Many executives have left the company in recent months.Even so, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s position has for months seemed secure, especially because of how the company is structured. Uber\u2019s board follows a \u201cfounder-friendly\u201d governance structure, made popular in Silicon Valley by Google and Facebook. Seven of Uber\u2019s nine board members hold so-called super-voting shares, allowing them to have a stronger say in the board room. Four director seats are empty.Because Mr. Kalanick and a few allies hold a majority of those shares, his position has been safe \u2014 and would most likely remain so, even if he took a leave.Some Uber board members have expressed support for Mr. Kalanick. Garrett Camp and Ryan Graves, who have been with Uber since its early days, have long believed that Mr. Kalanick\u2019s leadership was necessary to buck an aggressive incumbent taxi industry. Arianna Huffington, the founder of the Huffington Post who is also an Uber board member, has publicly attested to Mr. Kalanick\u2019s willingness to change.J. William Gurley and David Bonderman, two venture capitalists and independent board members who also hold super-voting shares, were worried about the company\u2019s management, the people with knowledge of the matter said. Outside investors were also nervous about the string of scandals and have called board members directly about their concerns.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s executive allies were in a trickier position. One of the recommendations in Mr. Holder\u2019s report was that Mr. Michael, Uber\u2019s senior vice president of business and a close confidant of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s, be asked to leave the company, according to the three people. The firm\u2019s recommendations also include other sweeping changes at the company.Mr. Michael has not resigned, nor has he been asked to do so, according to a person familiar with the matter, but he was evaluating his options.This year, Uber\u2019s general counsel and some board members recommended that Mr. Michael take leave from his position at the company until the results of the Holder report were delivered, according to three people familiar with the matter.Mr. Michael did not respond to a request for comment.Employees and close watchers of the company worry that even the most damning conclusions of the Holder investigation could be ignored.\u201cAny response without complete buy-in from the top is a complete waste of time,\u201d said Stephen Hirschfeld, a partner at the labor law firm Hirschfeld Kraemer who regularly investigates corporate harassment issues. \u201cIt can have an even worse impact on company morale if people already know it\u2019s a total joke.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Cannes, the Great Gusher of Content Comes With Warning Signs", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byMediatorThen, prospectors were chasing the real world currency of crude. Now, they\u2019re after the new currency of the connected world: your attention.As it was in those early days of oil discovery, there was a sense in Cannes last week that happy days were here or just around the corner. It was a week of seaside fireworks; popping magnum corks; private performances by Eddie Vedder, Solange Knowles, and Stevie Nicks; and behind-the-scenes deal making.But, similar to Texas in the early 1900s, there was also an undercurrent of lawlessness. And there was the creeping realization that no one really knows where it\u2019s all going \u2014 how the new digital media innovations will reshape politics, culture and even the world order.The great geyser of our times, of course, is the hand-held connectivity that Steve Jobs tapped with his iPhone, and that Google, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat now so powerfully refine and distribute on their social media platforms.Given that the limit is no longer the number of channels on the television dial but the daily human capacity to consume media, the rush is on to get even better at divining what you want before you even know you want it \u2014 and to make sure it\u2019s available in ample supply.\u201cIt\u2019s chaos,\u201d Shane Smith, the brash co-founder and chief executive of Vice Media, told me Thursday afternoon as he sipped wine on the rocks at his sumptuous seaside villa in Cap d\u2019Antibes, Cannes\u2019 even more exclusive neighbor. \u201cBut in the midst of the chaos there\u2019s never been more content created, more money being made. There\u2019s never been more stuff being sold, and for me on my end, there\u2019s never been more people buying content.\u201dMr. Smith was a coveted dance partner at the festival, which was founded as a celebration of quality advertising but is now overwhelmed by deal making and schmoozing. His young audience \u2014 which lives on its devices \u2014 is the one that advertisers covet.Mr. Smith is known for his promotional acumen, but others reported similar success. And so, in Cannes, you could see the frenzied activity feeding itself, pitching forward into the abyss.The message is clear. Content costs money, and marketers will continue to subsidize it if it allows them to pitch their wares effectively. But people don\u2019t want to spend time watching 30-second ads, not when information moves at the speed of Twitter.But where does that leave messaging for far more complex issues like health care \u2014 a life-or-death subject for millions of Americans \u2014 in the coming political advertising season?Though big Silicon Valley players are working to fix that, it wasn\u2019t a topic they really wanted to elaborate on as they made rounds here.He stuck to more self-congratulatory ground, saying, \u201cIf there\u2019s one word I had to choose to represent Twitter and our force of good in the world,\u201d it was \u201cthe word \u2018open.\u2019\u201dIt was too rich when I tried to approach him afterward and his press representative told me to scram. The transparency evangelist wasn\u2019t taking questions from journalists in Cannes, I was told.Yet there were some signs that our unaccountable yet increasingly powerful social media platforms are coming to terms with the real-world consequences of their algorithmic siren calls.Too often, data is being used to \u201cdistill you to your smallest self,\u201d Spotify\u2019s chief marketer, Seth Farbman, told me. \u201cIf we\u2019re leading people into discovering \u2018new,\u2019 and being comfortable with the unfamiliar, aren\u2019t we training people to be far more accepting and far more open?\u201dBut the air sure seems polluted these days.Toward the end of our meeting, Marc Pritchard, the branding chief for the world\u2019s largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, walked by and concurred. \u201cIt\u2019s fool\u2019s gold,\u201d he said.But I started this column on another commodity, oil, and I\u2019ll end on it, too.Oil fed and enabled the great advancements that came with the rise of the automobile, and made the jet age possible. But then, there were the consequences: highway blight, ozone depletion, climate change.The infoboom is taking place in a new environment \u2014 the cyber environment \u2014 where we\u2019re all spending more time. All the new opportunity it\u2019s bringing will also have consequences. Hopefully we\u2019ll head off the worst of them while we still can.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Way to Own Your Social-Media Data", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn the market for social media, by contrast, when one customer uses Facebook over Myspace, it has a direct (and positive) impact on other customers\u2019 preferences for the same social network: I want to be in the social network where my friends are. These markets naturally tend toward a monopoly.Historically, there have been two main government interventions to reduce this risk of monopoly power. The first is price regulation. When railway companies gained excessive market power in the late 1800s, the United States government created the Interstate Commerce Commission and gave it the power to set maximum prices. (In the long run, the remedy turned out to be worse than the disease, but that\u2019s another story.)The second is antitrust. When Standard Oil, in the early 1900s, controlled 90 percent of oil refinery capacity in the United States, the federal government used its antitrust power to break it up into more than 30 smaller companies. A similar breakup was imposed 70 years later on AT&T.Still, there is a problem with traditional antitrust policy when looked at through the lens of network externalities: It focuses only on consumers\u2019 benefits from competition. But consumers love Google and Facebook since they do not pay a dime for their services.What many users do not fully appreciate is that they do pay for these services, in the form of very valuable information. And those who appreciate this cost have no choice: There is no major search engine that does not store our past searches or collect information on our activities, and there is no significant social media platform that does not retain our preferences. That is the cost of using these technologies. Lack of competition also means lack of choice, which is ultimately lack of freedom. But what can be done?For a 21st-century problem, we suggest a 21st-century solution: a reallocation of property rights via legislation to provide more incentives to compete. In fact, the idea is not new. Patent law, for example, attributes the right to an invention to the company a scientist works for, to motivate companies to invest in research and development. Similarly, in the mobile industry, most countries have established that a cellphone number belongs to a customer, not the mobile phone provider. This redefinition of property rights (in jargon called \u201cnumber portability\u201d) makes it easier to switch carriers, fostering competition by other carriers and reducing prices for consumers.The same is possible in the social network space. It is sufficient to reassign to each customer the ownership of all the digital connections that she creates \u2014 what is known as a \u201csocial graph.\u201d If we owned our own social graph, we could sign into a Facebook competitor \u2014 call it MyBook \u2014 and, through that network, instantly reroute all our Facebook friends\u2019 messages to MyBook, as we reroute a phone call.If I can reach my Facebook friends through a different social network and vice versa, I am more likely to try new social networks. Knowing they can attract existing Facebook customers, new social networks will emerge, restoring the benefit of competition.Today Facebook provides developers with application-program interfaces that give them access to its customers\u2019 social graph, Facebook Connect and Graph A.P.I. Facebook controls these gates, retaining the right to cut off any developer who poses a competitive threat. Anticipating this outcome, very few developers invest seriously in creating alternatives, eliminating even the threat of competition.By guaranteeing access to new customers\u2019 data and contacts, a Social Graph Portability Act would reduce the network externality dimension of the existing digital platforms and ensure the benefits of competition.Google and Facebook will no doubt display their enormous lobbying power to kill this idea in its infancy. But they would do so at their own risk. If their monopoly is not curbed by competition, it will eventually be curbed by regulation, and experience suggests that will be worse, not only for consumers, but also for Google and Facebook themselves.As the uproar over United Airlines\u2019 treatment of a passenger it ejected from a flight has shown, people\u2019s tolerance for companies\u2019 market power is running low. A \u201csocial graph to the people\u201d revolution is in the making; Congress better be in front of it or find itself overwhelmed.Luigi Zingales and Guy Rolnik are professors at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of Harassment", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byTheir stories came out slowly, even hesitantly, at first. Then in a rush.One female entrepreneur recounted how she had been propositioned by a Silicon Valley venture capitalist while seeking a job with him, which she did not land after rebuffing him. Another showed the increasingly suggestive messages she had received from a start-up investor. And one chief executive described how she had faced numerous sexist comments from an investor while raising money for her online community website.What happened afterward was often just as disturbing, the women told The New York Times. Many times, the investors\u2019 firms and colleagues ignored or played down what had happened when the situations were brought to their attention. Saying anything, the women were warned, might lead to ostracism.Now some of these female entrepreneurs have decided to take that risk. More than two dozen women in the technology start-up industry spoke to The Times in recent days about being sexually harassed. Ten of them named the investors involved, often providing corroborating messages and emails, and pointed to high-profile venture capitalists such as Chris Sacca of Lowercase Capital and Dave McClure of 500 Startups.Most recently, the revelations about Mr. Caldbeck of Binary Capital have triggered an outcry. The investor has been accused of sexually harassing entrepreneurs while he worked at three different venture firms in the past seven years, often in meetings in which the women were presenting their companies to him.The chain of events has emboldened more women to talk publicly about the treatment they said they had endured from tech investors.The women\u2019s experiences help explain why the venture capital and start-up ecosystem \u2014 which underpins the tech industry and has spawned companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 has been so lopsided in terms of gender.Most venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are men, with female entrepreneurs receiving $1.5 billion in funding last year versus $58.2 billion for men, according to the data firm PitchBook. Many of the investors hold outsize power, since entrepreneurs need their money to turn ideas and innovations into a business. And because the venture industry operates with few disclosure requirements, people have kept silent about investors who cross the lines with entrepreneurs.Some of the entrepreneurs who spoke with The Times said they were often touched without permission by investors or advisers.At a mostly male tech gathering in Las Vegas in 2009, Susan Wu, an entrepreneur and investor, said that Mr. Sacca, an investor and former Google executive, touched her face without her consent in a way that made her uncomfortable. Ms. Wu said she was also propositioned by Mr. Caldbeck while fund-raising in 2010 and worked hard to avoid him later when they crossed paths.\u201cThere is such a massive imbalance of power that women in the industry often end up in distressing situations,\u201d Ms. Wu said.After the publication of this article, Mr. Sacca contacted The Times again to amend his original statement, adding: \u201cI dispute Susan\u2019s account from 2009.\u201dMany of the women also said they believed they had limited ability to push back against inappropriate behavior, often because they needed funding, a job or other help.In 2014, Sarah Kunst, 31, an entrepreneur, said she discussed a potential job at 500 Startups, a start-up incubator in San Francisco. During the recruiting process, Mr. McClure, a founder of 500 Startups and an investor, sent her a Facebook message that read in part, \u201cI was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.\u201dMs. Kunst, who now runs a fitness start-up, said she declined Mr. McClure\u2019s advance. When she later discussed the message with one of Mr. McClure\u2019s colleagues, she said 500 Startups ended its conversations with her.500 Startups said Mr. McClure, who did not respond to a request for comment, was no longer in charge of day-to-day operations after an internal investigation.\u201cAfter being made aware of instances of Dave having inappropriate behavior with women in the tech community, we have been making changes internally,\u201d 500 Startups said. \u201cHe recognizes he has made mistakes and has been going through counseling to work on addressing changes in his previous unacceptable behavior.\u201dThey put up with the comments, Ms. Renock said, because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine a world in which that $500,000 wasn\u2019t on the table anymore.\u201d Ms. Renock declined to name the investor. Wethos raised the $500,000 from someone else and is still fund-raising.Wendy Dent, 43, whose company Cinemmerse makes an app for smart watches, said she was sent increasingly flirtatious messages by a start-up adviser, Marc Canter, as she was trying to start her company in 2014. Mr. Canter, who had founded a software company in the 1980s that became known as Macromedia, initially agreed to help her find a co-founder. But over time, his messages became sexual in nature.In one message, reviewed by The Times, he wrote that she was a \u201csorceress casting a spell.\u201d In another, he commented on how she looked in a blue dress and added, \u201cKnow what I\u2019m thinking? Why am I sending you this \u2014 in private?\u201dMr. Canter, in an interview, said that Ms. Dent \u201ccame on strong to me, asking for help\u201d and that she had used her sexuality publicly. He said he disliked her ideas so he behaved the way he did to make her go away.Some entrepreneurs were asked to not speak about the behavior they experienced.At a start-up competition in 2014 in San Francisco, Lisa Curtis, an entrepreneur, pitched her food start-up, Kuli Kuli, and was told her idea had won the most plaudits from the audience, opening the door to possible investment. As she stepped off the stage, an investor named Jose De Dios, said, \u201cOf course you won. You\u2019re a total babe.\u201dMs. Curtis later posted on Facebook about the exchange and got a call from a different investor. He said \u201cthat if I didn\u2019t take down the post, no one in Silicon Valley would give me money again,\u201d she said. Ms. Curtis deleted the post.In a statement, Mr. De Dios said he \u201cunequivocally did not make a defamatory remark.\u201dLindsay Meyer, an entrepreneur in San Francisco, said Mr. Caldbeck put $25,000 of his own money into her fitness start-up in 2015. That gave Mr. Caldbeck reason to constantly text her; in those messages, reviewed by The Times, he asked if she was attracted to him and why she would rather be with her boyfriend than him. At times, he groped and kissed her, she said.\u201cI felt like I had to tolerate it because this is the cost of being a nonwhite female founder,\u201d said Ms. Meyer, who is Asian-American.But even after she reached out to a mentor, who alerted one of Binary\u2019s investors, Legacy Venture, to Mr. Caldbeck\u2019s actions, little changed. Legacy went on to invest in Binary\u2019s new fund.

That beefs up the bottom line, too: It\u2019s cheaper to help a student stay in school than to recruit a new one.Dramatic changes like these are essential, Chancellor Steve Wrigley told his Board of Regents in April. \u201cWe inherited a system largely conceived in the 1960s,\u201d Mr. Wrigley said. \u201cBut times, society and students have all changed dramatically.\u201dThat is not only true in Georgia. Other colleges and universities across the country are also responding (albeit sometimes slowly) to challenges threatening their traditional role in society if not their survival.Because of a dip in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds, among other reasons, for example, enrollment has been dropping for five years, meaning that there are about 300,000 fewer undergraduates to divvy up among America\u2019s campuses than there used to be.To fill seats, colleges are engaged in an arms race of discounts that they increasingly cannot afford \u2014 discounts so deep that, while their sticker prices appear to be rising ahead of the inflation rate, the schools are actually seeing their net tuition revenue decline. Many small, private nonprofit colleges are giving away a record 51 percent of their tuition income in the form of discounts, according to new figures from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.All of these pressures mean something has to give, and that includes upkeep. Colleges and universities face a combined shortfall of $30 billion for needed repairs and renovations, according to the APPA, formerly the Association of Physical Plant Administrators.But in another bid to attract students, they keep building more, spending $11.6 billion last year on new construction, the private firm Dodge Data and Analytics says. That is adding not only more space the universities will have to maintain, but billions of dollars in debt on which someone will have to pay the interest.\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental lack of understanding about the strains that higher education is under,\u201d said Susan Fitzgerald, who tracks them as a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s.James Soto Antony, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who focuses on education leadership, said that people imagine that all universities look like the one where he works. \u201cThey see this $36 billion endowment and the manicured lawns and they impute that onto all colleges and universities,\u201d Mr. Antony said. \u201cAnd most of them are not like that. They are dramatically struggling for enrollment.\u201dHere\u2019s how thin: Thanks to rising discounts, small colleges reported an average revenue increase per freshman of just two-tenths of a percent last year, which means they lost ground when inflation is accounted for.Ken Redd, director of research and policy analysis at the business officers association, said: \u201cAre there enough students out there? Is there enough money out there in a time of declining enrollment to support all of those schools. Based on what we see now, you\u2019d have to say the answer is no.\u201dChief business officers on campuses agree with him. More than four in 10 don\u2019t think their current financing models are sustainable. \u201cHearing that from the chief business officers is very telling,\u201d Mr. Redd said.So universities and colleges are getting serious about other kinds of reforms. Some, as in Georgia, are dramatic \u2014 and controversial. Several campus mergers there were announced only days before they were voted on by the Board of Regents, without enough notice for the public to sign up to comment. A similar proposal was put on the table in April by the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (which does not include the University of Connecticut) in the wake of an enrollment drop and state budget cuts, only to be protested by faculty and students.\u201cChange is not easy, particularly when you\u2019ve got institutions that have been around for 100 years\u201d said Charlie Sutlive, vice chancellor for communications and governmental affairs at the University System of Georgia.That \u201cis tied as directly as possible to institutional financial health,\u201d said George L. Mehaffy, vice president for academic leadership and change at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, which is involved in the project. \u201cIf you increase the number of students you retain and graduate, it dramatically affects your bottom line.\u201d\u201cWe know what works,\u201d said Travis Reindl, senior communications officer at the Gates Foundation, \u201cand we know there is a core set of diverse institutions with pockets of solutions and innovations going on, but they\u2019ve never been brought together like this.\u201dRichard D. Legon, president of the association, said that fixing higher education \u201crequires a collaborative partnership that benefits from some of the creativity and ingenuity board members bring to the table, working with institutional leadership to ensure that students, who are really in a customer mode, want to shop at your place.\u201dNot everyone is doing this work. \u201cThere are some colleges that are very realistic about the challenges they\u2019re facing,\u201d said Ms. Fitzgerald of Moody\u2019s. \u201cThere are others that still have their heads in the sand and think that things are going to get better.\u201dBut the activity that is underway represents \u201ca sea change,\u201d Mr. Mehaffy said. \u201cThere was an era when institutions sort of just moved on. The funds were relatively good, the students were standing in line. And today\u2019s environment is dramatically different. It is a time of enormous strains, but the good news is that it\u2019s a moment of growing action.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of a college at the University of Georgia.

{"Headline": "The Man Who Helped Turn Toronto Into a High-Tech Hotbed", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileTORONTO \u2014 As an undergraduate at Cambridge University, Geoffrey Everest Hinton thought a lot about the brain. He wanted to better understand how it worked but was frustrated that no field of study \u2014 from physiology and psychology to physics and chemistry \u2014 offered real answers.So he set about building his own computer models to mimic the brain\u2019s process.\u201cPeople just thought I was crazy,\u201d said Dr. Hinton, now 69, a Google fellow who is also a professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Toronto.He wasn\u2019t. He became one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on artificial intelligence, designing software that imitates how the brain is believed to work. At the same time, Dr. Hinton, who left academia in the United States in part as a personal protest against military funding of research, has helped make Canada a high-tech hotbed.Dictate a text on your smartphone, search for a photo on Google or, in the not too distant future, ride in a self-driving car, and you will be using technology based partly on Dr. Hinton\u2019s ideas.His impact on artificial intelligence research has been so deep that some people in the field talk about the \u201csix degrees of Geoffrey Hinton\u201d the way college students once referred to Kevin Bacon\u2019s uncanny connections to so many Hollywood movies.Dr. Hinton\u2019s students and associates are now leading lights of artificial intelligence research at Apple, Facebook, Google and Uber, and run artificial intelligence programs at the University of Montreal and OpenAI, a nonprofit research company.\u201cI sat down in 2005,\u201d said Dr. Hinton, a tall man, with uncombed silvering hair and hooded eyes the color of the North Sea.Dr. Hinton followed the family tradition by going to Cambridge in the late 1960s. But by the time he finished his undergraduate degree, he realized that no one had a clue how people think.\u201cI got fed up with academia and decided I would rather be a carpenter,\u201d he recalled with evident delight, standing at a high table in Google\u2019s white-on-white cafe here. He was 22 and lasted a year in the trade, although carpentry remains his hobby today.But the approach fell out of favor because computers were not powerful enough then to produce meaningful results. Artificial intelligence research turned instead to using logic to solve problems.As he was having second thoughts about his carpentry skills, Dr. Hinton heard about an artificial intelligence program at the University of Edinburgh and moved there in 1972 to pursue a Ph.D. His adviser favored the logic-based approach, but Dr. Hinton focused on artificial neural networks, which he thought were a better model to simulate human thought.His study didn\u2019t make him very employable in Britain, though. So, Ph.D. in hand, he turned to the United States to work as a postdoctoral researcher in San Diego with a group of cognitive psychologists who were also interested in neural networks.They were soon making significant headway.Dr. Hinton moved in 1982 to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh as a professor, where his work with the algorithm and neural networks allowed computers to produce some \u201cinteresting internal representations,\u201d as he put it.Here\u2019s an example of how the brain produces an internal representation. When you look at a cat \u2014 for some reason cats are a favorite subject of artificial intelligence research \u2014 light waves bouncing off it hit your retina, which converts the light into electrical impulses that travel along the optic nerve to the brain. Those impulses, of course, look nothing like a cat. The brain, however, reconstitutes those impulses into an internal representation of the cat, and if you close your eyes, you can see it in your mind.\u201cIn A.I., the holy grail was how do you generate internal representations,\u201d Dr. Hinton explained.Interesting as those internal representations were from an academic point of view, computers were still too slow to recreate them in a way that mimicked the brain.At that point, Dr. Hinton was becoming disillusioned with the politics of the United States in the Reagan era. He also didn\u2019t like that most artificial intelligence research was funded by the United States military.By 2012, computers had become fast enough to allow him and his researchers to create those internal representations as well as reproduce speech patterns that are part of the translation applications we all use today.The deal made Dr. Hinton a wealthy man.Now he is turning his attention to health care, thinking that artificial intelligence technology could be harnessed to scan lesions for cancer. The combination of the Vector Institute, a surrounding cluster of hospitals and government support, he added, makes Toronto \u201cone of the best places in the world to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gay Lawmaker, Leo Varadkar, Is in Line to Be Ireland\u2019s Prime Minister", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 A gay son of an Indian immigrant is now all but certain to become the next prime minister of Ireland, a country that has rapidly been leaving its conservative Roman Catholic social traditions behind.Leo Varadkar, who was chosen on Friday by the Fine Gael party to be its leader, and therefore the head of the center-right governing coalition, will be the first openly gay taoiseach (as Ireland\u2019s prime minister is called), and, at 38, the youngest. He succeeds Enda Kenny, who is stepping down.Mr. Varadkar\u2019s rapid rise to the country\u2019s highest political office, only 10 years after he entered Parliament, owes much to a willingness to speak his mind, a novelty in the normally cautious world of Irish politics.Though in some ways he is emblematic of Ireland\u2019s transition to a more liberal society, Mr. Varadkar presents himself as conservative on issues like the economy and law and order. As he was campaigning for the party leadership, he used his cabinet position as minister for social protection to start a high-profile campaign against welfare fraud, which was seen as a gesture to appeal to Fine Gael\u2019s right-wing supporters.He also surprised his liberal admirers by reaching out to the party\u2019s anti-abortion faction, saying that Fine Gael \u201cshould be a warm house for those who have socially conservative views.\u201dIn 2015, Mr. Varadkar was widely praised for bravery and honesty when he said publicly that he was gay, the first Irish government minister to do so. At the time, Irish voters were debating a proposed constitutional amendment to permit same-sex marriage, and his stand is credited with bolstering the successful \u201cyes\u201d campaign, making Ireland the first country to legalize gay marriage by popular vote.Mr. Varadkar was born in Dublin in 1979, the son of an Irish Catholic nurse from County Waterford and a Hindu doctor from Mumbai, India. His parents met in England in the 1960s and lived in India for a time before moving to Ireland.Mr. Varadkar trained as a doctor \u2014 a general practitioner \u2014 and became involved in politics while still in medical school. He developed a reputation as an intelligent, hard-working and articulate city councilor in Dublin, won a parliamentary seat in the Dublin West constituency at the age of 28, and rose swiftly in party circles.Though the Fine Gael party and its allies have the largest bloc of seats in Parliament, they do not command a majority. Even so, opposition parties are not expected to block Mr. Varadkar\u2019s formal election as prime minister by the Dail. To do so would prompt a general election, which none of the major parties want right now.Mr. Varadkar clinched the Fine Gael leadership on Friday by defeating his only rival, Simon Coveney, a fellow cabinet minister, in an internal party election. Though Mr. Coveney received more votes from rank-and-file members, Mr. Varadkar had greater support among Fine Gael\u2019s members of Parliament. Under the party\u2019s weighted voting rules, that made Mr. Varadkar the winner.A habit of speaking out on issues outside his ministerial responsibilities has sometimes embroiled Mr. Varadkar in controversy. In 2011, six months after Ireland was pressured into accepting a bailout of 85 billion euros by the European Union (about $122 billion), he claimed (incorrectly, as it turned out) that a second bailout might soon be necessary. His comment caused consternation among colleagues in the government who were trying to persuade the world that Ireland had finally stabilized itself after the banking and housing crash of 2008.Mr. Varadkar was accused of racism in 2008 after he suggested in the Dail that unemployed immigrants should be paid to leave the country. He denied the accusation and said he was talking about a voluntary program, not forced deportation.He is unlikely to enjoy a long political honeymoon. His party\u2019s chief rival, Fianna Fail \u2014 also center-right \u2014 can bring down the government and force a general election whenever it feels the moment is advantageous. It does not seem advantageous now: The two parties are running close in most opinion polls, with, if anything, a narrow lead for Fine Gael.Meanwhile, the government faces a number of serious domestic issues that could blow up into crises, including the troubled public health service; soaring rents and housing prices; anger at rising economic inequality; an interlocking nest of church-and-state questions; and slumping police morale and discipline.Threats by the Trump administration to crack down on American multinational companies that base themselves overseas for tax reasons are also a grave concern for Ireland, which uses low corporate tax rates to entice companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Twitter to process their cash flows through Dublin.By far the biggest menace on the Irish horizon, however, is Britain\u2019s looming withdrawal from the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d which threatens to stir divisions within and between the Republic of Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland, where decades of sectarian struggle largely subsided after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.Brexit will also severely disrupt Ireland\u2019s close business links with Britain, its largest trading partner, by removing Britain from the European single market and customs union while Ireland remains.During the leadership campaign. Mr. Varadkar said he did not plan to appoint a special \u201cminister for Brexit,\u201d suggesting that he intended to deal with the matter himself. If so, he is likely to be consumed by it from his first day in office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Terror Attacks, Britain Moves to Police the Web", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byLawmakers from across the political spectrum are promoting some of the widest-ranging plans anywhere in the western world to rein in the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter, setting up a likely standoff.On one side are British policy makers and law enforcement officials, who want to crack down on how extremist messaging and communication are spread across the internet. On the other are privacy and freedom of speech groups \u2014 alongside the tech giants themselves \u2014 who say that the government\u2019s proposals go too far.Similar debates are popping up around the world.Now the country\u2019s politicians want to go further.In its electoral manifesto and in speeches by senior politicians, the governing Conservative Party outlined proposals to offer security officials more ways to keep tabs on potential extremists. Theresa May, the prime minister, raised the issue at a recent Group of 7 meeting and in talks with President Emmanuel Macron of France.But if the proposals are pushed through, there will be costs.The Conservatives now rule with a minority in Parliament, and will most likely have to rely on other parties for support. That may necessitate compromise or horse trading.Part of that plan is to demand that companies such as Apple and Facebook allow Britain\u2019s national security agencies access to people\u2019s encrypted messages on services like FaceTime and WhatsApp.These services use so-called end-to-end encryption, meaning that a person\u2019s message is scrambled when it is sent from a device, so that it becomes indecipherable to anyone but its intended recipient.British officials, like their American counterparts, would like to create a digital backdoor to this technology.Yet an opening for intelligence agencies, experts warn, would also allow others, including foreign governments and hacking groups, to potentially gain access to people\u2019s digital messages.It would also most likely induce terrorist groups to move to other forms of encrypted communication, while leaving everyday Britons \u2014 and others traveling in the country \u2014 susceptible to online hacks.\u201cIf the British government asks for a special key like this, what stops other governments from asking for the same access?\u201d said Nigel Smart, a cryptology professor at the University of Bristol. \u201cYou need end-to-end encryption because it stops anyone from listening in.\u201dBritish lawmakers say law enforcement and intelligence agencies need such access to foil potential terrorist plots.But Facebook and others respond that they already provide information on people\u2019s online activities, when required, including the I.P. address \u2014 a pseudo fingerprint for digital devices \u2014 of machines from where messages are sent.And in a letter sent to British politicians in late 2015 \u2014 just as an earlier debate about tech regulation was bubbling to the surface \u2014 Apple made its views clear.\u201cI\u2019d like to see the industry go further and faster in not only removing online terrorist content, but stopping it going up in the first place,\u201d Amber Rudd, the country\u2019s home secretary, said before meeting with tech executives this year. At the time, she called on them to take further steps to counter such extremist material.The British government\u2019s stance has put tech companies in the difficult position of having to determine what should, and should not, be allowed online.Britain\u2019s freedom of expression laws are not as far-reaching as those in the United States, allowing British lawmakers to push for greater control over what is circulated across the web.In recent months, companies like Facebook and Twitter say that they have taken additional steps to remove illegal extremist material from their social networks, and are giving users ways to flag potentially offensive content.Some other European lawmakers have warned that too-strict limits on what can be shared across the web may hamper freedom of speech, a touchy subject for many people who grew up behind the Soviet-era iron curtain.\u201cFor me, freedom of expression is a basic fundamental right,\u201d Andrus Ansip, the digital chief at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said in an interview this year. \u201cNobody wants to see a Ministry of Truth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revisiting My Hong Kong, 20 Years After the British Left", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byPersonal JourneysI knocked and knocked on the door to the artist\u2019s studio, beside the plastic logo of a painter\u2019s palette. It had been so hard to find the address of this musty commercial building on Hong Kong\u2019s Wyndham Street, I was beginning to think it was time to give up on finding my old friend Ng Tak Tung there.In 1997, just a few days after my college graduation, I moved alone to this island in the South China Sea to work at a business magazine. Much had been made of the British handing over control of their colony to the Chinese, which for many marked the symbolic end of an empire and an era. I wanted a little history, a little adventure and a little excitement, and ended up with more of all three than I was prepared to handle.From the deck of a rented junk bobbing off Stanley Beach, I watched teams of men and women furiously paddle their brightly painted dragon boats, the carved wooden heads, teeth bared, jutting from the prows. I reported from a demonstration for the first time, a candlelight vigil in Victoria Park with tens of thousands of participants to honor the democracy protesters slain at Tiananmen Square eight years before.A few weeks after that, I sat in a tiny storefront bar festooned with Christmas lights and watched a television news report showing that, just before dawn, armored personnel carriers brought Chinese troops over the border from Shenzhen. That same weekend, at the red-and-white brick Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club, a giant of a man in muddy black tuxedo pants and an untucked pleated shirt head-butted me because the bar was closed and he couldn\u2019t get a drink.And I had a darts partner from the Chinese island of Hainan, a painter who spoke as little English as I did Hainanese, which is to say none. But Tak Tung and I became unlikely friends at the dive bar across from my office on Hollywood Road, the Globe. He had a knack \u2014 confounding the Britons we defeated \u2014 for missing the easy throws and then hitting the bull\u2019s-eye with improbable consistency.Since our words flew unintelligibly past each other, we communicated by drawing on napkins and beer coasters. We sketched the people we knew. We drew maps, of Hong Kong and China, of the world, of boats and airplanes and the dotted lines that described our respective journeys.The last time Tak Tung and I saw each other, he invited me back to his studio. He picked up the phone (a landline, of course) and dialed a number and handed the receiver to me. A woman was on the other end \u2014 his wife. She said she was in the hospital and that her husband was having a difficult time because of her illness. He wanted me to know it meant a lot to him to have me as a friend.Soon after, I left that part of the world. It was long before Facebook. A lot of people didn\u2019t even have email addresses yet. And when you made a broke, disorderly retreat from a city as I did, you lost touch with most of your friends half a world away.He could have moved back to the mainland, emigrated to the West or, for all I knew, passed away. As a last-ditch effort, I took out a business card and scribbled on the back that I was in town and to please call or write. That is, I added, if he even remembered me. I slid the card under the locked door to his darkened studio and left.So much had happened in the 20 years of Chinese rule \u2014 the SARS epidemic, creeping authoritarianism, the protest movement \u2014 I did not expect to recognize Hong Kong. Looking on Wikipedia before my wife, Rachel, and I left for the trip, I saw that 18 of the 20 tallest buildings in the city had been built since I departed. I could picture the modern skyscrapers as they rose, cloaked in canvas and the city\u2019s traditional bamboo scaffolding.But as we scanned Google Maps for hotels, I pointed out my old apartment on Lyndhurst Terrace, traced my finger along the path I used to take down to the ferry pier. Rachel noted that I remembered the street names from 20 years ago better, in some cases, than those in Crown Heights, where we have lived for three years.Upon our plane\u2019s descent into Hong Kong, I looked out the window onto cargo ships slowly plying through gray-green waters, the shipping containers like so many primary-colored Legos stacked on their decks and could see the dark masses of the outlying islands jutting up from the water. I found it all instantly recognizable.Despite our extreme jet lag, I goaded us into a lengthy walking tour, each memory pushing me a few more steps, and the next sight leading to another memory. I showed Rachel the incense-filled Man Mo Temple and the stone wall trees, banyans whose sprawling gray roots clung to the faces of old retaining walls like dense webs. The rank markets of raw flesh and living sea creatures still defied the advances of sterile supermarkets. And when there was no answer at Tak Tung\u2019s studio, I pushed us onward.We saw Flower Market Street\u2019s profusion of blossoms, including locally grown lilies and chrysanthemums. And we watched proud owners introduce their brightly plumed, squawking parrots at the Yuen Po Bird Garden.This was a far cry from my old routine in Hong Kong. When I first arrived in the city, I discovered that I was working semi-legally at best, dispatched by hydrofoil to the Portuguese colony of Macau (now part of China) when my tourist visa was about to expire for a new stamp upon re-entry. The only room I could afford was hardly bigger than the single wooden-framed futon I slept on; once I put it down, the tiny bed filled the entire floor. My clothes hung on a pressure rod above my head so I could stand up only by pushing my shirts and slacks aside.Instead of a shower there was a hole in the bathroom floor and a spray nozzle attached to the sink. The kitchen consisted of a single burner attached to a propane tank.I did not spend a lot of time on Flower Market Street perusing fresh blossoms. I spent most of my time at the Globe. For anyone raised on back-to-back syndicated episodes of Cheers as I was, the Globe represented an ideal: not just an after-work hangout, but a lifeline in a new city, with a built-in group of friends.One night we decided we didn\u2019t know enough jokes so we required all customers to tell one before they could order a drink. We drew up lists of countries and cities each had visited for fun. Bets were settled with a paperback Guinness book, a dictionary and a complete works of Shakespeare. The darts matches went late into the night, and even when you had to wake him up for his turn, Tak Tung still hit the bull\u2019s-eye.One of my starkest memories was from the night of the handover fireworks display. We had propped open the door to the stairwell of a nearby office tower and expected one of the best unauthorized views in the city.When the time came, we hiked the auxiliary staircase to the roof. But as the fireworks started, all we could see was a flickering halo around a dark rectangular silhouette. The hulking unlit mass of a skyscraper under construction, which had sprung up since the last fireworks display, eclipsed the light show for this political theater piece.I had no recourse or safety net but the bartenders at the Globe, who adopted me. I found myself sleeping on the sofa of a kindly barmaid and her electrician boyfriend. As my financial position deteriorated, my beers were slipped surreptitiously on to the checks of rowdy bankers who were never the wiser.By the time I visited this year, the Globe had shut down on Hollywood Road, but avid patrons had chipped in to reopen it around the corner. The old metal sign from outside had been salvaged and now hung on a wall inside. The signature painting of a map of the world presided over a nook filled with games and books. At the old Globe, meals were made \u2014 or should I say, cheese was melted \u2014 in a toaster oven. The new iteration was a full-on gastro pub with delicate fish and truffle polenta.Short for \u201cSouth of Hollywood Road,\u201d I remembered Soho as a smattering of bars and mostly quiet restaurants near the giant series of escalators that eased the steep commute from the Mid-Levels. Now throngs of young people spilled out of the many locales, a group of young women in colorful wigs even drinking as one sat on a yellow fire hydrant. We had a couple of quick Gweilo Pale Ales at the local craft beer bar 65 Peel before succumbing to jet lag.The next day, to escape the rain, we hopped one of the old trams and coasted along the busy waterfront all the way to North Point, where we watched thousands of maids from Indonesia and the Philippines picnic wherever there was shelter, under bridges and overpasses clogged with their day-off celebrations.At the western end of the subway line in up-and-coming Kennedy Town, I toasted my old bartender friend Scott Wrayton at his new restaurant, Shoreditch. Scott, a small-town English boy, recalled arriving a quarter-century before in a neon city where the clouds shrouded the tops of the skyscrapers from view and thinking he had landed in the movie \u201cBlade Runner.\u201dThe change in the city\u2019s skyline was most evident from the clamorous, ever touristier vantage of Victoria Peak. I.M. Pei\u2019s Bank of China Tower, once a dominant feature on the island with its twin masts and white triangular patterns, was now easily lost among the many Goliaths that stood shoulder to shoulder in Central.We had just finished eating egg tarts at Tai Cheong Bakery, as I puzzled over which fancy boutique had moved into the ground floor of my once-grimy old apartment house, when I received a WhatsApp message. \u201cHi Nick, I\u2019m Tak Tung! So excited to see your name card! Are you in HK now?\u201dI arrived at his studio to find the door propped open. Wooden frames were stacked against the wall, along with a few brightly painted pink and blue canvases of flowers. Ng Tak Tung had round, black-framed glasses I didn\u2019t remember and a white goatee now covered his chin. Despite the 20 years that had passed, he was instantly recognizable to me.His assistant translated for us as we spoke and occasionally had questions of her own. \u201cHow did you talk to each other when you don\u2019t speak Chinese?\u201d she asked. I explained that we would draw on whatever we could find. As she related what I had said, he flipped through the books excitedly and pointed to reproductions of his sketches on the backs of beer coasters and scraps of paper, two nude women, a fish biting a finger, a scrawny youth who looked a little familiar.I joked about how he was so good at hitting the bull\u2019s-eye and he squeezed one eye shut and mimed holding a rifle. His aim was so good because he had been a crack shot in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, including during skirmishes on the border with Vietnam.His story began to pour forth, more complicated than I ever could have guessed. He came from a family of property owners and they had a difficult time during the Cultural Revolution. After military service he went to art school at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts, where he met his wife, and followed her to Hong Kong.Was his wife sick in those days, I asked, testing my memories; in the hospital even? Yes, she was. Did she speak English? Yes, she did.As part of his artistic transformation, Ng Chung had abandoned his realist training and thrown himself into neo-Expressionism, sinking into Lan Kwai Fong\u2019s dissolute bar scene like Toulouse-Lautrec into Montmartre. \u201cHe started off from this foreign place, discerned the feeling of alienation everywhere he went, and comprehended what loneliness and helplessness meant,\u201d as one of the essays in the book put it.Like me, he had only just moved to the city at the time. More than I understood then, our friendship sprang from a shared loneliness that neither of us had been able to articulate. He changed his name, he told me, to change his luck, to start fresh. He had found success \u2014 his paintings now belonged to the collections of major museums and he lived on the Peak, the aspirational address high above the city.In the years after I left, the stories I told about this place were always fun and lighthearted, the dragon-boat races, Chinese dice games, Cantopop karaoke. Then I found an old leather-bound journal I had kept and was dumbfounded at the misery. Down and out wasn\u2019t fun, getting rocked by a financial crisis didn\u2019t feel like a roller coaster, losing your first job out of school, getting evicted and spending all your savings just to survive was romantic only in retrospect.The city was too big, too expensive and too tough for me. What made it tolerable and, through the hazy tint of memory, a wonderful time, were the friends I made. Ng Chung led me down a back staircase, to a bar where they knew him as well as they used to know us at the Globe. His assistant left and we drank happily, as before, chattering away without comprehending the words but still understanding.Nicholas Kulish is an investigative reporter for The New York Times and the author of a novel, \u201cLast One In.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Big Tech Stocks Build Market Euphoria, and Jitters", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byFacebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google.In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes \u2014 Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain \u2014 as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies.But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded.\u201cThere is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. \u201cNo one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.\u201dDespite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks.Other markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election.The stock market, however, remains the main attraction.Late in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end.According to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion \u2014 a consequence of investors\u2019 buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value.As is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment.The push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership.Through these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks \u2014 an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented.It is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market.\u201cIn terms of magnitude, we have not seen this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist.In Mr. Paulsen\u2019s view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period.So when Facebook\u2019s net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon\u2019s sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice.\u201cYou have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cSo yes, you can see how valuations would get extended.\u201dStock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today\u2019s technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era.Still, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce?For example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year \u2014 with more than half that amount from Apple, the world\u2019s richest company.Of course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business.Amazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard.Still, it is not today\u2019s earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow\u2019s, the argument goes.Surprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it.Bill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Mr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google\u2019s cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered.\u201cI have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cYet that is how the market is pricing it.\u201dAnother well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position.While skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division.\u201cAmazon is more fully valued than when we bought it,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages.\u201dAs these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns.That is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures. For a manager not to match the share of an Apple or an Amazon in a benchmark would result in an actively managed fund trailing its index and its peers.And as investors pour billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds \u2014 a record $314 billion in the last year \u2014 no active manager can afford to lag the competition for too long.So be it a mutual fund, hedge fund, sovereign wealth fund or family office, the strategy has been consistent \u2014 put aside any fears, and stay invested.\u201cIt\u2019s like you are riding a missile that you know could explode at any moment beneath you,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo. He has warned in his reports that some of these stocks have entered a stage of mania. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have no choice but to be sucked into the trade.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Trump Set to Meet Narendra Modi, Many U.S. Indians Are Hopeful", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byJERSEY CITY \u2014 With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India set to meet President Trump on Monday for the first time, many Indians in communities like this one have had high hopes for the relationship between the two leaders \u2014 both of whom swept to power as media-savvy political outsiders pledging to revive their national economies.In a string of storefronts here in \u201cLittle India\u201d that pay tribute to Hindu deities, Yogi Patel, 52, runs the Laxmi Pan Center, which is named after the goddess of wealth and sells a betel nut breath freshener. He has lived in the United States for 32 years and is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump.\u201cTrump is doing the right thing. He\u2019s doing good for U.S. citizens and America,\u201d he said, switching between English and Hindi to explain that he grew up in Gujarat, the state that Mr. Modi led as chief minister before the 2014 election. \u201cAnd I am from both countries.\u201dBut as Mr. Trump has tried to crack down on immigration and withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, singling India out as a country that has gained unfairly from the accord, the meeting of the two leaders with nationalist leanings and sizable social media followings has taken on a more complicated tone for others in the Indian diaspora.Mr. Trump is \u201ca little bit unpredictable,\u201d said Vasudev Patel, who voted for Mr. Trump and is the secretary of the Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party, USA, Mr. Modi\u2019s party. \u201cNobody knows when he will make what comment. And the next day he will say he didn\u2019t say that. He\u2019s like an Indian politician.\u201d\u201cMost immigrants who come are really trying to make a life for themselves and their families. They\u2019re really concerned about the mortgage on the house, the papers to get their green card, family back at home,\u201d said Devesh Kapur, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an author of \u201cThe Other One Percent: Indians in America.\u201d\u201cThis has now become a wake-up call that they cannot stand as aloof,\u201d he added.The diaspora in the United States sees itself as a wealthy and powerful segment of the population, with Indian-born business leaders, including Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, rising to prominence in recent years.The median income of an Indian-American household is $88,000, well above the $49,800 average for the United States as a whole, according to the Pew survey. And 38 percent of Indian-Americans have advanced degrees, compared with just 10 percent of the rest of the United States population.\u201cIndian-Americans or Indians here are politically active,\u201d said Tanvi Madan, the head of the India Project at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey are in the policy space. They have integrated in a substantial way. You see them on prime-time television show and in sports.\u201dBoth Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump have made efforts to woo the migrant community.Weeks before the election last year, Mr. Trump visited another Indian community in New Jersey, where he proclaimed that the two countries would be \u201cbest friends.\u201d Mr. Modi, once barred from the United States on allegations surrounding the deaths of hundreds of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002, held a rally for 19,000 people at Madison Square Garden on his first trip to the United States shortly after taking office.The Indian prime minister\u2019s meeting with the diaspora on Sunday in Washington was relatively low-key.Those in the crowd, like Srujal Parikh, the executive vice president at the Federation of Indian Associations, were eager to voice specific concerns before Mr. Modi\u2019s visit to the White House.Some are concerned about the relationship between the two countries after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Others want the prime minister to address the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s anti-immigrant comments and its tough stance on visas for skilled workers.\u201cI myself am an immigrant, so I always think this country is built on immigration,\u201d said Mr. Parikh, a Democrat. \u201cThese are the people that bring the country up or down.\u201d\u201cWe must be talking about the immigration issue. We must be talking about how they can make a bridge between the two countries.\u201dRai Das, 24, who works at a small Indian restaurant in Little India, talks of feeling scared lately while walking the streets of New York.\u201cThere is some sort of wave going on,\u201d said Ms. Das, who moved to the United States two years ago to study data analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but people are discriminating.\u201dYet Kiran Sethi, 52, the owner of Reema Jewelers across the street from the restaurant, was so torn by last year\u2019s vote that she did not cast a ballot, despite being a Democratic supporter in the past. She believes the new administration will do more to create jobs for her two daughters, who earned college degrees in the United States and are looking for work.\u201cWhen I see them sitting at home for six months, I feel their pain,\u201d said Ms. Sethi, adding that Indian Americans are a \u201cwell respected\u201d part of American society. \u201cDo you know how hard we work? We try our best that our kids go to school and get a good education.\u201dThis week\u2019s meeting could rest mostly on personal rapport. The two men may seem to have a lot in common, but Mr. Modi\u2019s asceticism stands in stark contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s flamboyant style.From his pan shop in Little India, Mr. Patel remained optimistic.\u201cTheir mind-set is the same,\u201d he said, batting away concerns as he took an oversize stick of sugar cane to the juicer. \u201cModi does good for India, and he\u2019s thinking of the public there. And Trump is the same here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of a member of the Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party, USA. Vasudev Patel is the secretary, not the president.Advertisement"}

He specifically asked for ideas that could help the world in the near term, a contrast to long-term personal investments he has made in for-profit companies with social impact, like Blue Origin, a space firm, and The Washington Post.Mr. Bezos wrote, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now \u2014 short term \u2014 at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact.\u201dThe prospect of someone with Mr. Bezos\u2019s wealth \u2014 he is the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a fortune of well over $80 billion \u2014 increasing his giving was greeted enthusiastically by people who work in philanthropy. His approach is unusual compared with many big philanthropists from the technology field, like Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft, whose foundation has tackled long-term global health problems like malaria, among other challenges.\u201cI would call it surprising, but welcome,\u201d said Jacob Harold, the president of Guidestar, a national database of nonprofits. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for big-dollar donors to be honest about their desire for short-term results.\u201dMr. Harold said that he \u201cwould be worried if every donor was saying this,\u201d but that Mr. Bezos\u2019s approach could have a meaningful effect.Mr. Bezos asked people to reply to his post with their ideas. A little more than five hours after his request, there were more than 3,600 such replies, including suggestions for contributing to affordable housing, veterans\u2019 organizations and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender causes.Larry Brilliant, the acting chairman of the Skoll Global Threats Fund, a philanthropy created by Jeff Skoll, one of eBay\u2019s founders, said that crowdsourcing philanthropic ideas had had mixed success in large part because of the challenge of identifying ones that have promise.\u201cThe denominator of ideas you will get in, the vast majority of ideas which are not good, not viable, will flood this process,\u201d said Mr. Brilliant, who formerly ran Google\u2019s philanthropic arm.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dissecting Marissa Mayer\u2019s $900,000-a-Week Yahoo Paycheck", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byIt will also conclude the remarkable five-year run of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who was paid nearly a quarter of a billion dollars \u2014 a generous sum even by Silicon Valley\u2019s lofty standards \u2014 while presiding over the company\u2019s continued decline.The company ended up so weakened that its board had little choice but to sell.\u201cEveryone acknowledges that it was a difficult situation to come into,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research who has studied Yahoo for years. \u201cBut the company was not run well under her tenure.\u201dSo why did Ms. Mayer receive more than $900,000 a week? The answer, like so many things about Yahoo, is surprisingly complicated. It is rooted partly in the never-lose structure of modern executive compensation packages, but also in two farsighted investments made long ago by one of Yahoo\u2019s founders, Jerry Yang.Ms. Mayer\u2019s pay was mostly in stock and stock options, and she reaped the rewards alongside the other stockholders.\u201cThe only sign you can point to when evaluating a company over a long period of time is how shareholders have done in the exchange,\u201d said David Wise, who heads North American sales at Korn Ferry Hay Group, a firm that advises companies on executive pay packages. \u201cOver the last five years, Yahoo shareholders couldn\u2019t have done a lot better than this.\u201dMore than most chief executives, Ms. Mayer was working for those shareholders.She was essentially hired by one hedge-fund manager, Daniel S. Loeb, who got her predecessor fired and won three seats on Yahoo\u2019s board in 2012. Mr. Loeb was particularly interested in finding a way to unlock the value of Yahoo\u2019s stake in Alibaba, which was already shaping up to be one of China\u2019s leading internet companies. He pushed the board to recruit a star like Ms. Mayer to get people excited about a company that had been stumbling for years.When Ms. Mayer\u2019s early efforts to turn around Yahoo\u2019s business and spin off the Alibaba shares failed to bear fruit, another hedge fund manager, Jeffrey C. Smith of Starboard Value, led a campaign to push for her ouster. Mr. Smith eventually garnered four board seats so he could keep the pressure on.Yahoo declined to comment for this article, citing this coming Thursday\u2019s shareholder vote to approve the Verizon deal. Ms. Mayer and the board chairman, Maynard Webb, who approved her pay packages, also declined interview requests. So did Mr. Smith.\u201cShe was an attractive, high-visibility C.E.O. trying to bring some excitement and glamour to Yahoo,\u201d said Martha Josephson, a senior partner at the recruiting firm Egon Zehnder, who helped Ms. Mayer find several of her top executives. \u201cAs hard as the job was, she didn\u2019t get a break. If she were an ugly man, she\u2019d be a hero.\u201dOn July 16, 2012, the day she was hired, Yahoo\u2019s share price was $15.65. On Friday, it closed at $50.60. The stock\u2019s performance has topped other venerable tech companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco Systems, and matched the gains of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Yahoo\u2019s most direct competitor.As Yahoo shareholders profited, so did Ms. Mayer. By the time the deal closes, she will have made about $239 million, based on Friday\u2019s share price, according to calculations by Equilar, a provider of executive compensation data.To lure Ms. Mayer from Google and compensate her for options she forfeited there, Yahoo\u2019s board offered her a lucrative employment agreement. She initially received restricted stock worth $35 million and stock options worth $21 million, based on 2012 stock prices for Yahoo, along with a cash salary and bonus. Although she gave up a portion of those stock grants after failing to meet performance targets, the rise in Yahoo\u2019s share price more than offset the losses. She received further stock grants in later years, adding to her overall compensation.Yet most of Ms. Mayer\u2019s paycheck ultimately came from the gains in Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments, over which she had little control. Thanks to an investment made in 2005, Yahoo had a 24 percent stake in Alibaba, which today is China\u2019s leading e-commerce company.When Alibaba first sold shares to the public in 2014, Yahoo sold 140 million shares in the offering. It hung on to 384 million shares, which are now worth about $48 billion.Yahoo also owns about 36 percent of Yahoo Japan, now worth about $9 billion, that it received as part of a deal struck in 1996, shortly after Yahoo was founded.The surging value of those investments \u2014 not any brilliant business moves by Ms. Mayer \u2014 is why Yahoo\u2019s shares went up. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone coming into an oil company, and all of a sudden oil prices go up and the stock goes up,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, the director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cWas the return based on what she did?\u201dStill, managing those investments was a key reason that Yahoo\u2019s board hired Ms. Mayer. Mr. Loeb had accused Yahoo\u2019s previous leaders of mishandling both their core business and the Alibaba relationship. When he and two allies gained seats on the board in 2012, they wanted a new chief executive who would fix both problems.Ms. Mayer delegated the Alibaba issue, hiring an experienced dealmaker, Jacqueline Reses, to be the company\u2019s principal liaison to Alibaba and its leaders, Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai. Ms. Reses helped the Chinese company navigate its initial public offering. She also renegotiated an agreement, struck just before Ms. Mayer arrived, that would have forced Yahoo to sell an additional 122 million shares in the offering. Those extra shares are now worth $15 billion.Ms. Mayer, meanwhile, focused on turning around Yahoo\u2019s internet business. It had missed the mobile revolution and was experiencing steady declines in its display and search advertising. There, her record is decidedly mixed.Yahoo had no real strategy for reaching customers on mobile devices when she arrived \u2014 a sure route to obsolescence as smartphones became the principal internet device for most people.Through a combination of acquisitions and hiring, she vastly expanded Yahoo\u2019s mobile team, which initially produced some buzzy hits like the Yahoo Weather app and Yahoo News Digest, along with more prosaic updates of core Yahoo features like fantasy sports and email. Yet Ms. Mayer largely failed in her quest to make Yahoo a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for more users in online video, search and messaging.Yahoo did acquire advertising technology and built a new ad system from scratch, but marketers never embraced it.Yahoo\u2019s board recognized Ms. Mayer\u2019s failure to meet business targets and docked her bonuses and stock awards in four of the five years she was in charge. But under terms of her original employment agreement, it also granted her new shares annually, easing the sting.Given those missteps, was Ms. Mayer overpaid?\u201cFor the existing amount of compensation, could Yahoo shareholders have done better?\u201d Mr. Wieser of Pivotal Research said. \u201cOr for the same outcome, could they have paid less? Ultimately it\u2019s a hard question to answer.\u201dPeter Monaco, who was a vice president for engineering at Yahoo for three years before leaving for Facebook last September, said Ms. Mayer does not get enough credit for transforming Yahoo\u2019s culture. \u201cShe eliminated the dead wood, drove out the politics, put in place compensation policies that rewarded high achievers and energized people to create great products again,\u201d he said.Arguably, Yahoo was unfixable. The company\u2019s DNA and technology were built around its original identity as a web portal \u2014 a powerful position in the early 2000s but increasingly outmoded in the mobile era, as apps and phone platforms like iOS and Android became the gateways to the internet.\u201cGiven the hand she was dealt, I doubt anyone could have done a better job transforming the culture and making Yahoo healthy again,\u201d Mr. Monaco said.Unlike Kilimanjaro, though, the Yahoo challenge proved insurmountable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Secret to a Great Potluck? It\u2019s Not the Food", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe most elaborate potluck I ever went to was my own wedding, to which each guest brought a dish in lieu of gifts. We feasted on truffled pea soup and caviar tea sandwiches.At the other end of the potluck spectrum was my daughter\u2019s second-grade graduation breakfast, a festive hodgepodge of child-made scones, store-bought red velvet doughnuts and boxes of hot coffee.Both parties were total successes, with a perfect mix of dishes appropriate to the occasion. That\u2019s because they had the most important potluck ingredient in common: a strong organizer.Advice for camp cooking, picnics and potlucks, along with recipes, cocktails, frozen desserts and a taste-test of the best supermarket hot dogs.The secret of a great potluck isn\u2019t good cooking. It\u2019s careful planning.A potluck host is like a choreographer whose role is to create a dance rather than a mosh pit, distributing the burden of the cooking so no one has to work too hard and giving guests a chance to shine by allowing them to show off their very best dishes. The host is also in charge of the flow of the meal, keeping track of what everyone is bringing to make sure there\u2019s an interesting selection without any duplicated dishes.Ms. Thielen grew up in northern Minnesota, where potlucks were pretty much the only parties people gave. Her strategy is to make the central meat dish, then assign the rest of the meal according to people\u2019s strengths, asking her friend with the clay oven to bring his homemade bread, the friend with the vegetable garden to bring pickled asparagus.\u201cI\u2019ve learned the hard way that a hands-off approach can result in four kinds of cucumber salad,\u201d she said.\u201cAs a host you do want to do some planning, but you don\u2019t want to give in to your inner control freak,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen your guests can see what everyone else is bringing, they\u2019ll self-edit and you won\u2019t get six platters of deviled eggs \u2014 at least you probably won\u2019t.\u201dOne thing hosts do not have to worry about is facilitating conversation among strangers. The very nature of the format gives guests an easy icebreaker: the food itself, who made what and how you got it there. Deviled eggs always have a back story.As for being a good potluck guest? Ms. Donnelly recommends that you think about logistics before signing up for your dish.Will you go to the party from home, where you can pull a warm casserole from the oven? Or will you be at work, and need to make your dish the night before? If that\u2019s the case, a grain salad or cheesecake bars hold up well when made in advance.I usually volunteer to bring a fluffy salad made with hardy greens (baby kale, mature spinach, radicchio) that can hold up well for a few hours, and I dress it right before serving. It\u2019s colorful, light and goes with almost everything. It\u2019s also one of the less glamorous things you could make, so it often gets overlooked by cooks seeking a more stunning presentation. But it\u2019s always gone when the party is over.No matter what you bring, it\u2019s best to garnish your offering in situ, especially those grain or potato salads, which can get a little dull sitting in the fridge.\u201cA squeeze of lemon, some olive oil and some fresh herbs right before serving really takes things up notch,\u201d Ms. Donnelly said.I like the two-quart Ball jars for carrying watermelon lemonade or iced tea to a party, since you can seal the tops, then use a small ladle to serve.If all goes smoothly, guests get to linger over a varied and delicious spread, and hosts are left to enjoy the fact that they are giving a party and did not have to cook everything themselves.Ms. Cyd advises hosts to reinvest all that saved prep time in the other details that make a party memorable. For her, that means picking flowers for the table. For me, I might actually get a chance to take a shower before guests arrive. Always take a moment for yourself, she said: \u201cIt will make you happy.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Holberton, a Two-Year Tech School, Emphasizes Diversity", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Like many computer science students, Max Johnson spends his days learning new programming languages, working with mentors and meeting with technology company recruiters. But that\u2019s where the similarities end between him and a student at Stanford or Caltech.Mr. Johnson, 33, is part of an experimental two-year program called the Holberton School that aims to create a diverse group of engineers and place them in the industry\u2019s top technology companies.Like many Holberton students, Mr. Johnson did not major in math or computer science in college. He attended Saint Augustine\u2019s University on a basketball scholarship and studied psychology. He is African-American in an overwhelmingly white industry and lives in his car because he cannot afford to pay rent in San Francisco. If he had to pay tuition up front, he would not be able to go to school.\u201cWe want to remove any barrier to a high-quality education,\u201d said Sylvain Kalache, one of the Holberton School founders. \u201cNo matter your age, gender, ethnicity or past professional life, you can come.\u201dWith just 103 admitted students, some of whom have only a high school degree, Holberton is still small. But it has already helped some of its students get jobs at Apple, NASA and LinkedIn, even though they have not yet graduated. And it is challenging the long-held wisdom around what types of people are best suited to work in the technology industry.Dora Korpar, 25, recently accepted a job offer from Scality, which stores data for other companies. She will work while completing her last nine months at Holberton. She declined to give her exact salary but said she\u2019d earn four times as much as she did at her last job: a checkout clerk at a Trader Joe\u2019s in Minnesota.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do after college, and then I heard about working in the tech industry from a friend,\u201d said Ms. Karpor, who graduated from Macalester College in St. Paul with a degree in biology. \u201cI thought, if he can do it, I can, too.\u201dBefore starting Holberton, Mr. Kalache and his fellow software engineer Julien Barbier noticed that they rarely encountered engineers who looked like Mr. Johnson and Ms. Korpar. They attributed the industry\u2019s struggle to find skilled programmers and its inability to build a more-diverse work force to the fact that companies recruited from a handful of elite universities. Those schools did not attract and train a particularly diverse set of computer science majors.In Silicon Valley fashion, the pair decided that they could help solve the problem by starting a company. Mr. Kalache, 28, left his job at LinkedIn, the online professional network, and Mr. Barbier, 36, resigned from Docker, a company that makes tools for software developers, to build the school in 2015.Holberton, which is named after the computer programming pioneer Betty Holberton, has raised more than $4 million from investors including Trinity Ventures, the French venture firm Daphni and the former Yahoo chief executive Jerry Yang. The pop singer Ne-Yo invested this year and joined the board of trustees, pledging to help enroll more minority students. There is no upfront payment to attend, but graduates who make more than $40,000 a year pay 17 percent of their gross salaries to Holberton for three years.Holberton\u2019s founders, both from France, attribute the diversity numbers to the school\u2019s admissions process. An online exam tests for the three qualities that the school screens for: problem-solving skills, collaborativeness and perseverance when challenges become harder.Other people have learned to code through online classes offered by schools like Coursera, based in Mountain View, Calif., and Udacity, which also had its beginnings in Silicon Valley.These alternative learning programs are gaining ground with big tech companies that had recruited primarily from schools like Stanford, Caltech and M.I.T. LinkedIn is one company that has decided to look further afield for software engineering candidates. \u201cWe got rid of the university requirement,\u201d said Shalini Agarwal, who oversees LinkedIn\u2019s Reach program, an apprenticeship for people who need to refresh their coding skills. The company also works with Holberton.Mr. Kalache and Mr. Barbier wanted to replicate a tech company workplace environment, rather than teach just one or two skills like at a boot camp. The two men decided against having traditional teachers.They structured the classroom around problems that the students would solve in small teams, like writing a piece of an operating system using a specific set of tools. They would inevitably have to research the problem and ask people for help, just as they would if they were confronted by a new problem at work.The men also asked the school\u2019s 120 volunteer mentors, professional engineers and tech executives, to help create the curriculum. Tammy Butow, a site reliability manager at Dropbox, wanted students to learn to review one another\u2019s code, a common practice at tech companies. Holberton worked that into the collaborative process of the program. She also suggested that the school break students\u2019 projects, so the students must troubleshoot and fix them.A Holberton intern at Dropbox worked on a project that made the company\u2019s storage product more reliable. Impressed by the school\u2019s results, the company has created a pilot apprentice program to help employees like the Holberton students more easily transition into the work force.\u201cThe main thing we\u2019re learning is how to learn,\u201d said Ms. Korpar.\u201cI was attracted to Holberton because my school is also about social justice and teaching populations that are frozen out of the information age, meaning people of color, women and people who are not wealthy,\u201d said Vito Ferrante, a director of educational technology at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory in San Francisco and an adjunct professor in the education department at the University of San Francisco.\u201cThere are challenges for this model in that Holberton is fighting the traditional higher education model, which will be difficult to dismantle at best,\u201d Mr. Ferrante said. \u201cBut Holberton\u2019s model, where teachers are guides, is becoming more common. More and more schools are understanding that teaching is really about teaching critical thinking, especially in the information age, which moves very quickly.\u201dThe Holberton School is in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District, not far from huge companies like LinkedIn and Google. There is a modest sitting area filled with photos of students that leads to a large, bright room with long tables and rows of computers. Men and women, spanning many ages, socio-economic groups and races, group together to discuss their projects. They mingle with guests and show the visitors what they\u2019re working on.Each day one student gives a five-minute presentation on any topic, so that he or she can become more comfortable speaking in public. Students sometimes speak at tech industry conferences and are encouraged to write at least one technical blog post a week.\u201cSoft skills are important,\u201d said Mr. Barbier. \u201cWe know engineers who haven\u2019t had great careers because they can\u2019t present their ideas well or sell their point of view or talk to their managers.\u201dAs much as they prepare students to work collaboratively and solve problems, Holberton\u2019s founders also push them to think about the culture of tech companies, which is sometimes negative. They know that the students won\u2019t be protected by the school after they graduate and enter the working world.\u201cAround the time the Uber scandals began, Julien and Sylvain pushed us to think about them,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThey wanted us to understand what can happen in a workplace.\u201dAfter Mr. Johnson graduated from college, he bounced from one low-paying job to another for about a decade. Over the past couple of years, he considered learning to code, but was financially constrained. \u201cI had limited funds,\u201d he said.He read about Holberton on a message board and finished the entire application in just a few days. \u201cIt felt like now or never.\u201d Since being accepted, he has visited Facebook, seen the Google campus and met an employee at the Department of Homeland Security.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot of humility here,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThat it\u2019s O.K. to be wrong. That it\u2019s O.K. to ask for help. And that I need to be patient with other people. All of this wouldn\u2019t have happened to me if I weren\u2019t at school.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Advertising Paradise, Reality Is Just a Conversation Away", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingCANNES, France \u2014 The top hitters in media and advertising descended on the beaches of southern France last week, lounging on yachts and sipping wine and frozen ros\u00e9 slushies as the sun sparkled on the cerulean water of the French Riviera. They networked and cut deals at parties in chic hotels \u2014 the type where rooms cost $500 a night.But even in paradise, it did not take long for conversations at the annual industry conference to inevitably turn to the frustrations of the advertising world.\u201cI\u2019m hypersensitive right now,\u201d said Kathleen Hall, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for global advertising and media. \u201cAs a marketer you always think about risk, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily the first thought. I think now you have to be much more sensitive to the idea of risk and how anything might be construed as a political statement or endorsement or issue-based support.\u201d\u201cThe answer, and I think they agree, is just to raise the bar on monetization,\u201d she said.Ms. Hall said that in today\u2019s polarized media environment, people were \u201cjudging and assuming your values are represented by your media placement.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kind of obsessed,\u201d she said, \u201cwith what\u2019s the right balance between people\u2019s freedom of choice, the media\u2019s freedom of expression and our freedom to reach.\u201dHoopla aside, several advertisers said they were taking a harder line with such platforms, though they were eager to continue working with them. Google and Facebook, in particular, are trying to assuage advertisers\u2019 concerns around objectionable content.\u201cThey\u2019ve sort of got away with trying to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re an open-source technology; it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s them,\u2019\u201d Jerry Buhlmann, the chief executive of Dentsu Aegis Network, said about objectionable content online. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting away with it anymore. They\u2019re too big, they\u2019re making too much money, they employ too many people, and it\u2019s too important politically.\u201dOthers are more concerned with creating standards for determining how effectively ads reach people online and being able to compare metrics across platforms \u2014 basically, what a Facebook video view is worth versus an ad viewed on Snapchat.\u201cWhen digital media was a small part of overall advertising, I think we were learning and developing,\u201d said Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever. \u201cBut now it\u2019s starting to become the biggest part of advertising, and I think in that context, we need to make the industry more efficient.\u201dStill, while marketers are more outspoken, the giant online advertising platforms continue to reign supreme \u2014 and attract hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing.\u201cThe duopoly continues,\u201d said Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s biggest ad group, referring to Google and Facebook. \u201cThere\u2019s been all these challenges \u2014 consumer brand safety, what I call political brand safety with terrorist-type stuff, fake news, fraud, transparency. But I don\u2019t think that anything has happened as yet that we\u2019ve seen of great significance in terms of altering the patterns of spend.\u201dWhile Mr. Sorrell likened the timing of the Publicis announcement to a dinner guest\u2019s insulting the host midway through a meal, he noted in an interview that his firm had sent 500 people to Cannes this year, down from 1,000 last year.Advertisers are eyeing ways to work with Amazon, as well as how they can take advantage of the Amazon Echo, particularly as Google and Apple follow the company\u2019s lead in selling voice-activated devices for the home.\u201cWe\u2019re working with Amazon as a retail partner \u2014 which we have a big booming business with them \u2014 and we\u2019re working with them as a media partner,\u201d said Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble. He said Procter & Gamble was moving money there.\u201cI really believe voice is going to be big,\u201d Mr. Weed said. \u201cBrands, of course, are known by their visual representation, but brands don\u2019t have a voice, and I think we\u2019re going to have to think about what is the tone of voice for different brands and how to engage with it.\u201dMs. Lemkau of JPMorgan Chase pointed to Amazon\u2019s data, the millions of verified Chase cardholders who are spending on the site, its media and content arm, its ad serving platform and the potential for marketing through packaging.\u201cI think they will be the biggest presence here potentially one day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you think of alternatives to the big two, they have a really compelling case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Save Its Cliffside Towns, Italy Revives the Art of Terracing", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byCinque Terre JournalVERNAZZA, Italy \u2014 The teenagers panted heavily as they climbed up the steep slope in the early morning, the Mediterranean sun glittering on the sea far below. Along the way, they stopped to survey the stone walls bordering the winding roads, carefully taking measurements.\u201cWhen you rebuild a wall, you dig among the rubble until you find the original corner stones, and start from there,\u201d their guide, Margherita Ermirio, instructed them. \u201cNo cranes, no cement, right?\u201d she teased them, as they laughed.After several years abroad, Ms. Ermirio, 32, has returned to her hometown, Vernazza, one of five villages that make up Cinque Terre, the stunning, vertical, gravity-defying cluster of homes that cling to the cliffs of Italy\u2019s northwestern coast.She has since become the pillar of a local battle to restore and preserve an old and essential but dying art in much of Italy: terracing.The dry stone walls she is teaching young people to build do more than form the picturesque landscape that has made Cinque Terre famous. The different-size plots \u2014 angled to dovetail harmoniously, positioned to carefully caress the contours of the hillsides and bordered by dry stone walls \u2014 prevent this unique and improbable place to live from sliding into the sea.Ms. Ermirio\u2019s daily mission, as part of a Unesco-sponsored youth program, is not only to help restore those walls but also to cement this younger generation\u2019s connection to their land, and to teach them why the walls are crucial to their life here.Cinque Terre, on the cliffs northwest of La Spezia, is famous for its vistas of pastel fishermen\u2019s homes and the blue and white wooden boats anchored in miniature harbors. But it is the terraces hugging the slopes high above the blue waters that have for centuries allowed the land to be cultivated, with vineyards and apple and lemon groves.The centuries-old, permeable dry stone walls that border those plots are vital to Cinque Terre\u2019s survival. They absorb needed water from heavy rains, while allowing the runoff to flow gently downhill, preventing the land from washing away.Since the 1960s, however, many of the farmers who once worked the land have abandoned their steep plots and moved to cities for better-paying factory jobs. The ancient walls have been largely abandoned, too, leaving them in dangerous disrepair.Today, 8 percent of the entire region of Liguria, where Cinque Terre is, is terraced. Roughly half of that area has been forsaken.Given its peculiar boot-shape peninsula, jagged coastline and manifold mountain chains, Italy is believed to have the most terraced land in Europe, with more than 100,000 miles of dry stone walls \u2014 20 times the length of the Great Wall of China.Liguria, a narrow half-moon-shaped region bordering France, has the highest concentration, and its terracing is in poor shape, leaving the villages increasingly vulnerable to landslides during heavy rains. In Vernazza, almost half of the terracing is in ruins.\u201cDuring the flood, the stone walls came down to the beach, mixed up with mud and water. The mud reached the first floor here,\u201d Ms. Ermirio said, giving a tour and recalling the infamous flood of 2011, when tons of mud invaded the village\u2019s main road, shops and homes, cutting off the area and taking three lives.Since then, Ms. Ermirio has agreed with the various landlords to take over and fix up hundreds of abandoned parcels to prevent landslides, but also to show to the younger generations that agriculture is still possible in Cinque Terre.\u201cWe always need to rebuild stone walls here, and always will,\u201d said Vittorio Ermirio, a former swimming champion and Margherita\u2019s father, addressing the students in his vineyards, where he makes Ligurian white wine for his own consumption.\u201cBut it takes so much effort,\u201d said Francesco Bertoneri, a 16-year-old student with fashionable sunglasses on. He was gasping at the end of his climb on a trail with vines on one side and an abyss on the other.\u201cThis is our land,\u201d Mr. Ermirio replied, smiling broadly.Mr. Bertoneri and his class have been studying terracing in Cinque Terre from a historical perspective, comparing 18th-century maps with Google Earth\u2019s most recent images.From the measurements taken during the field trip with Ms. Ermirio, the students will design a three-dimensional orography of the area.Her work has been done in partnership with several local and global institutions, including the Liceo Scientifico Antonio Pacinotti, the high school in the nearby city of La Spezia where the students study, as well as the international volunteer project SocialErasmus.\u201cIt is important to raise awareness at any level,\u201d said Mauro Varotto, a geographer at the University of Padua and co-founder of Italy\u2019s branch of the International Terraced Landscapes Alliance.\u201cAt present, it\u2019s an effort from the bottom, from citizens. Hopefully one day we\u2019ll have schools for dry-stone building like in France,\u201d he said.In Italy, only at the foot of the Alps, in the region of Trentino, have authorities recently created a public school for dry-stone building. So far, it has certified 15 local artisans.Other areas, lacking a proper educational path, have been rescued by Italian creativity.Along the Brenta River in the northeastern region of Veneto, local residents have been allowed to \u201cadopt\u201d a parcel, with a pledge to clean and maintain it.In some areas, including Cinque Terre, a handful of migrants is being trained to clean up the stone walls.\u201cThe dry stone walls used to be the only way to cultivate in certain territories, now we rediscover them to make our landscape more true to what it was, and lure tourists,\u201d said Iva Berardi, one of the school\u2019s creators and director of the Trentino Mountain Academy.\u201cOur goal is to spread knowledge,\u201d she added, \u201cand we do it through teaching something that before was passed from father to son.\u201dMs. Ermirio had to fight to acquire that knowledge for herself. Her father was taken up on the hill to build dry stone walls when he was a little boy, but the tradition faded away as his daughter grew up.In Cinque Terre, Anselmo Crovara, 82, has made himself the custodian of the region\u2019s history.In his attic, he keeps what is known locally as the Memory Archive \u2014 a collection of antique items from traditional Ligurian daily life \u2014 portable candle lamps, 19th-century sewing machines, cow shoes, grappling hooks used to make walls.\u201cI keep things to keep that knowledge,\u201d he said when asked why he started building up his collection.Mr. Crovara was born in his family\u2019s penthouse apartment overlooking the sea and the roofs of one of Cinque Terre\u2019s famed towns, Manarola, and plans to die there.He learned to build dry stone walls when he was a little boy, from his mother, who was one of the few women who had mastered that art.As long as he can remember, the landscape of green vineyards that follow the curve of the steep hillside has never been altered, he said.In one of Mr. Crovara\u2019s pictures from 1942, black and white vineyards border the steep slopes that end in the water.\u201cYou see, a stone is a monument,\u201d Mr. Crovara said. \u201cIt is heritage here.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the year of a flood depicted on a poster. It was 2011, not 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What I Learned at Cowboy Camp", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byLincoln, Neb. \u2014 One of the first things I did when I moved to Nebraska two years ago was find myself some cows to herd. I\u2019d moved to a state that proudly says it has more than three times as many cows as it does people in order to take a job at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, the state\u2019s capital.I learned that in what would be my first year teaching there, roughly 25 percent of the entering freshman class would be first-generation college students. I had this in common with them, but there was a key difference: Many of these first-Gen students came from rural backgrounds, from families in which work centered on cattle and corn. I\u2019d grown up in Miami, had gone to a high school whose population rivaled that of some entire Nebraskan towns. I decided that to be better at my job, I needed to see the real Nebraska, whatever that meant.I told her I didn\u2019t sunburn easily because \u2014 and here I stuttered \u2014 because I\u2019d grown up in Miami. I\u2019d lived in Nebraska about a month at that point, and in the middle of that phone conversation, it hit me that leading with the fact that I was Latina might make my hosts a little less excited to meet me. This was before an ugly presidential campaign and eventual presidency taught me to be afraid of my new neighbors.The woman laughed into the phone and said, \u201cWell! I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had someone from Miami come stay with us.\u201d And she gave me the heads up that there would be a film crew there for part of my stay. \u201cSome French folks,\u201d she said.The French folks turned out to be four guys who never bothered to clarify their names to me. They were boy-bandish in nature; I thought of them as \u201cThe Leader,\u201d \u201cThe Wanna-Be Leader\u201d (he was the main character in the documentary), \u201cThe One with The Long Hair\u201d (their camera person) and \u201cThe Other One\u201d (his presence is blurry in every picture I took).They arrived at the ranch by cab: They\u2019d flagged one down at Omaha Airport and somehow persuaded the driver to take them more than 200 miles to the ranch. Before the cabdriver left, I ran up to his window and asked him the fare. \u201cOver 500 bucks,\u201d he said. \u201cThose jerks didn\u2019t even tip.\u201dAfter a couple of days, it was my sense that the rancher in charge of us wasn\u2019t a huge fan of those guys, mostly because of the way they often rode their horses very quickly in directions that he didn\u2019t want them to take, which freaked out (and therefore scattered) the cows. I wasn\u2019t much of a fan either, in part because they were showing me the ugly side of what I was really doing there: They were there to say they\u2019d been there. I was doing the same thing, really, hiding behind the excuse that it would make me a more empathetic instructor.One morning, I tucked cookies from the previous night\u2019s dinner into my saddlebag for that day\u2019s ride. The six hours a day on a horse turned out to be a conservative estimate, and I needed snacks. Cookies were a bad choice, though, because the chocolate melted in the heat and left my hands sticky, and also because the rancher took to calling me Cookie Monster once he caught me eating one while atop my horse, yelling out, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Cookie Monster,\u201d every time I\u2019d lagged too far behind.To shake off the Cookie Monster label, I tried to be on the rancher\u2019s team when it came to dealing with the French film crew. Over dinner one night, one of the filmmakers tried to talk to us all about wine (there was no wine on the table; the rancher was strictly a spirits man, from what I could tell).The Frenchman was talking so much because during every meal, from the minute we walked in, the TV perched at the end of the dining table was on and permanently set to Fox News, volume low but audible. No one acknowledged the noise, but the Frenchman was trying to drown it out.Another thing that went unacknowledged, at least until the end of my time there: The rancher had only one thumb, the result of having swung a bad dale with a lasso. \u201cThe speed and heat from the rope take it clean off,\u201d another ranch guest \u2014 this one a regular from Colorado who came back season after season for a work-vacation \u2014 explained to me. \u201cYou see a lot of old rodeo guys without thumbs,\u201d he said.The word \u201cdale\u201d (pronounced DAH-lee) is taken from the Spanish word the Mexican cowboys \u2014 vaqueros \u2014 yelled as they tossed their lassos. It\u2019s a skill American cowboys learned from them. I looked all this up once I was back in Lincoln because hearing this Nebraskan Sandhill cowboy saying \u201cDale!\u201d as if singing along to Pitbull\u2019s latest made me think there had to be a connection.I don\u2019t know if the rancher knows the origin of this word, of how it ended up in his mouth. The connection might seem to him as strange as finding a French film crew playing cowboy on his ranch for a few days. Or as wrong as thinking that a few days on a cattle ranch can teach you all you need to know about the people in your new community.Or it might be as jarring as something I felt on my last day there: sitting atop a horse, my eyes closed, the Nebraska wind rolling over the Sandhills and thrashing miles and miles of waist-high grasses, me swearing the chaos of it sounded exactly like the crashing of the ocean back in Miami. There was no denying it. There was no drowning it out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Companies Like Uber Get Away With Bad Behavior", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorUBER has raised more money than any other tech start-up in history. It has achieved the highest valuation by far, almost $70 billion.It has also undoubtedly lost more money, in less time, than any other young tech company. In 2016, it reportedly lost $2.8 billion, excluding separate, colossal losses in China, which it exited that year. Amazon, even in its darkest, loss-accumulating early years, was a piker compared with Uber.If Uber\u2019s investors have the stomach for these losses, that would seem to be their business, not that of the rest of us. Except Silicon Valley is viewed by many people around the world as not just the hotbed of technical innovation, but also as the place to see the most highly evolved business practices, the models most worthy of emulating.Unfortunately, Uber has the unenviable distinction of being the one Valley company that should be emulated only on Opposite Day. No other company can come close to matching it in lawsuit headaches and embarrassing expos\u00e9s chronicling maltreatment of its employees, contractor drivers and competitors, and deceiving local law enforcement, tax collection and other government agencies.Her account brought so much unwanted attention to the company that the board commissioned two outside attorneys, Eric Holder, the former United States attorney general, and Tammy Albarr\u00e1n, both partners at the law firm Covington & Burling, to undertake an investigation of the company\u2019s workplace practices and offer remedies.The report was publicly released on Tuesday and it turns out to be a searing indictment of just about every way the company has managed its own employees. Its more than 40 specific recommendations go well beyond prescribing more training for everyone. It spells out concrete ways that complaints like Ms. Fowler\u2019s should be systematically recorded, tracked and addressed.For all its candor and specificity \u2014 rare qualities in corporate America \u2014 the report doesn\u2019t directly address the sources of Uber\u2019s misbehavior: its longtime chief executive, Travis Kalanick, and his chief enabler, the endlessly forgiving board of directors that is controlled by Mr. Kalanick and his cronies.The Holder-Albarr\u00e1n report recommends that the company consider eliminating its official \u201ccore values\u201d like \u201cAlways Be Hustlin\u2019,\u201d \u201cPrincipled Confrontation\u201d and \u201cLet Builders Build,\u201d principles that \u201chave been used to justify poor behavior.\u201d Students of Uber\u2019s history can easily match particular recommendations to particular scandals, such as the sections related to \u201calcohol consumption during core work hours\u201d or \u201cconsumption of nonprescription-controlled substances.\u201d It also said that workplace rules governing sexual harassment and other prohibited behavior should extend to offsite conferences and meetings. \u201cIt should not be necessary to draft separate policies for these events,\u201d it added dryly.The requested repudiation of the company\u2019s cultural values would be a repudiation of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s cultural values. The entire mess that Uber is in is, ultimately, his doing.But the report treated Mr. Kalanick with kid gloves, recommending only that a chief operating officer be appointed to take on some of his responsibilities. Also on Tuesday, Mr. Kalanick announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence, attending to mourning the recent death of his mother in a boating accident. In an email message that he sent to employees, he spoke of the need to create an \u201cUber 2.0.\u201d He went on: \u201cIf we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0.\u201dConsider all that this presumes: that he is so invaluable that he can step aside \u2014 apparently no single person will be in charge during his absence \u2014 and work on self-improvement and then, his spot at the top held for him, return. He acts like the company belongs to him.It\u2019s behavior that is, unfortunately, all too typical in Silicon Valley, encouraged by weak boards, investors who compete among themselves to be the most \u201cfounder friendly\u201d and dual-class stock structures, similar to those at Google and Facebook, that give founders\u2019 shares 10 times the voting rights as ordinary shares.It\u2019s not as though these problems were news to the board. Mitch and Freada Kapor, longtime and respected Silicon Valley investors, spoke out publicly in February about disturbing revelations like Ms. Fowler\u2019s. The Kapors, who have been investors in Uber since 2010, when it was just a speck of start-up dust, pointed out a pattern they had seen in the Valley: \u201cInvestors in high growth, financially successful companies rarely, if ever, call out inexcusable behavior from founders or C-suite executives.\u201dThe new report received by Uber may banish the phrase \u201cAlways Be Hustlin\u2019.\u201d But the person who created the hustlin\u2019 culture that has trampled the interests of so many people, that needed 40-plus separate structural reprimands from its attorneys, will be permitted to get back on his throne. The supine board has left untouched its bedrock conviction: As long as the company keeps growing, the founder can be forgiven almost anything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conglomerates Didn\u2019t Die. They Look Like Amazon.", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byDealBookThe conglomerate was supposed to be dead, a relic of a bygone era of corporate America. Investors, we have been repeatedly told, want smaller, nimbler, more focused companies.And yet there is Amazon.Amazon is just one of these new-economy conglomerates. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is another. Facebook is quickly becoming a conglomerate, too.That is very likely true of today\u2019s tech-enabled conglomerates, too, which are spending, and often losing, tens of billions of dollars annually on all sorts of projects and acquisitions that may or may not turn out to be successful. But investors are seemingly willing to give these new behemoths a free pass in the name of growth and innovation \u2014 until they aren\u2019t.If there is any lesson from the last breed of industrial conglomerates, it is that there is a natural life cycle to most of them.The model begins like this: A company that is successful in one area turns itself into a conglomerate by using its free cash flow to finance the development or acquisition of businesses in other areas \u2014 at first, ones that are similar to their current business, and later often ones that are farther afield. And then the company does this again and again.When such an economic machine works, it works extraordinarily well. But when any one of the major levers in the machine breaks or even stalls, the entire enterprise comes under pressure. Shareholders start complaining that the sum of the parts would be worth more separately than together.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cYou look at companies that got really big in the world, the record is not very good,\u201d Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway \u2014 the world\u2019s largest conglomerate \u2014 told investors several years ago.His business partner, Warren Buffett, stunned shareholders this year when he suggested that he expected shares of Berkshire to rise immediately after his death because of speculation that the company would be broken up and thus would be worth more. (He and Mr. Munger both believe that Berkshire is better off intact, but Mr. Buffett thinks investors\u2019 knee-jerk reaction will be to believe the opposite.)When it comes to Amazon (or Alphabet, or any of the new conglomerates), the question is whether there is something fundamentally different about these businesses given their grounding in digital information \u2014 especially as they expand into complex brick-and-mortar operations like upscale supermarkets.In an age of big data and artificial intelligence, are businesses that look disparate really similar? And can one company\u2019s leadership really oversee so many different businesses? When does it become too big to manage?Google\u2019s own internal list of top-10 principles seems to include an anti-conglomerate provision: \u201cIt\u2019s best to do one thing really, really well.\u201dLeaving aside the question of whether that maxim may have been more suitable to the Google of a decade ago, it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped the company from jumping into all sorts of businesses outside its flagship search and advertising business. Some of these businesses \u2014 which include Android, YouTube, Waze, Nest Labs, self-driving cars and internet distribution \u2014 have been more successful than others. Most of these were brought under the Google umbrella through acquisition, evidence of how the company has used the enormous proceeds of its advertising business to subsidize its entrance into all sorts of other enterprises.Facebook, too, is expanding its offerings through acquisition, buying Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR. And for now, there are no obvious signs that looking after a wider array of businesses is weakening the management at Alphabet, Facebook or, for that matter, Amazon.\u201cThe economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote. \u201cUnder these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational \u2014 even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.\u201dEven more provocatively, she contends that Amazon\u2019s role as both a distributor and cloud provider for many of its competitors gives it an unfair advantage. \u201cThis dual role also enables a platform to exploit information collected on companies using its services to undermine them as competitors,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote.Amazon has thus far been left alone by regulators because it has helped reduce prices of most products. It is not a natural monopoly. \u201cCan prices ever be \u2018too low\u2019?\u201d the Federal Trade Commission asks on its website. \u201cThe short answer is yes, but not very often.\u201dThat may be true. But in Amazon\u2019s case, it has the potential to become so dominant in so many areas that its impact could be more than simply lowering prices for consumers; it could put large companies out of business.Were that to happen, this new breed of Silicon Valley conglomerates may become more powerful \u2014 and resilient \u2014 than the 20th-century conglomerates of yore.If Amazon were to use its acquisition of Whole Foods, along with the profits from its other businesses, to lower prices so much that it put out of business a company like Walmart, with its 1.5 million United States employees, would that be a good outcome? Or is that just a natural part of capitalism?The view of Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is clear. The man who is assembling the 21st century\u2019s most fearsome new conglomerate once explained his view of competition this way: \u201cYour margin is my opportunity.\u201dAn earlier version of this column incorrectly included a distinction awarded to Michael C. Jensen, a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School. He is not a Nobel laureate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "10,000 New Yorkers. 2 Decades. A Data Trove About \u2018Everything.\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byYour phone, in all likelihood, knows more about you than your doctor. Your credit card company knows your likes and dislikes better than your closest friend. Google knows your thoughts, and even completes your sentences. Your telephone service provider knows where you are at all times. Facebook, for many, knows more than the rest combined.For all of Silicon Valley\u2019s cheerleading of \u201cbig data,\u201d Mr. Glimcher said it had yet to be used to effectively solve some of society\u2019s most vexing problems.This fall, Mr. Glimcher and his team will start recruiting 10,000 New Yorkers willing to open up their lives to researchers for the next two decades, if not longer.Researchers will follow every aspect of their lives, virtually all the time, to try to answer fundamental questions about why we make the decisions we make and how they affect our lives.The hope is that in the vast streams of data \u2014 around 250 gigabytes of information on each subject every year, the equivalent of a computer hard drive \u2014 patterns will emerge that will help improve public health, education and decision making.The method of following a group of people over a long period of time to study health has proved effective in the past, most notably in a study that began in 1948 by tracking 5,209 adults from Framingham, Mass., which is now in its third generation. That project was designed to study cardiovascular health, and much of what we know about heart disease and the effects of things like diet and exercise is derived from its findings.Mr. Glimcher and his team hope to collect information on subjects as varied as the genome and social interactions. They will collate some 50,000 data points, including medical records, credit card information, GPS tracking and education records. They will also conduct physical examinations, including taking blood and urine samples.But the first challenge will be getting people to sign up.One of the flaws in the current collection of big data, Mr. Glimcher said, is that it misses large swaths of the population. Simply put, it skews to the wealthier and the healthier. For instance, if one looked at Google Traffic, it might seem that the South Bronx had the best roads with the fewest problems. However, Mr. Glimcher said, that is probably not the result of fewer potholes, but rather fewer people with smartphones.\u201cSo how do we get a data set that covers everything?\u201d he asked.The researchers decided to randomly target families in 150 census blocks in New York City, and their research suggests that they will have a 40 percent success rate in getting people to participate. Even with a 10 percent success rate, Mr. Glimcher said, they will get the people they need.But unlike cellphone and social media companies, Mr. Glimcher said, the Human Project wants to be sure everyone knows exactly what he or she is signing up for.\u201cThe way the industry has gone has been an embarrassment, if not a crime,\u201d Mr. Glimcher said.For instance, he said, many of the people he and his team have spoken to have no idea that they are being geo-tracked all the time, or that when they go to a hospital they often sign forms that allow their health information to be sold to big health care companies.\u201cOur subjects have to understand what they are getting into,\u201d he said.Unfortunately, he said, to keep the sample randomized, they cannot take volunteers at this point but are considering setting up a \u201ccitizen scientist\u201d cohort in the future.So far, Mr. Glimcher said, it is not the data that comes from the phone or other technology that gives people the most pause. It is the data collected from something much more basic: feces.One of the Human Project\u2019s goals is to study the microbiome and the millions of bacteria in the gut. The best way to find information on the subject is in stool samples. But that requires some explaining.The dozens of recruiters who will fan out across the city are being trained to handle that topic and many others. They will also have to convince people that all of this information will be kept safe.In fact, a big part of the $15 million start-up budget is being spent on security.A special data center is being built at the new campus of New York University in Brooklyn, where the Human Project will be based.Mr. Glimcher said a company that had a lot of experience working with \u201cthree-letter organizations\u201d would be building the center.It will be as secure as the information kept by Chase Bank, he added.However, unlike at a bank, the data needs to be available to researchers from a variety of disciplines, so a system of security zones will be in place.In the \u201cgreen zone,\u201d all activity will be monitored, but access to secure information will be limited.To look at the actual data, people will have to enter the \u201cyellow zone\u201d using a thumbprint and a non-clonable ID card for entry. Outside researchers can request a mini-data set, which will not include any identifying information.The crown jewels will be kept in the \u201cred zone.\u201dTo enter this area, people will have to pass through what is known as a \u201cman trap,\u201d essentially an antechamber between two sets of doors. There they will have to provide a thumbprint and an ID and will be scanned via video to ensure they are alone. Finally, those seeking access will have to enter a code proving that they are not under duress.The data is also largely protected from subpoena power, Mr. Glimcher said.When the project is fully staffed, dozens of researchers will be analyzing the data. By 2020, Mr. Glimcher and his team hope to have enough data to start making some interesting findings.And as the years pass, they hope to create what will essentially become an atlas for the entire human experience.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Fires 20 Amid Investigation Into Workplace Culture", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber has fired 20 employees over harassment, discrimination and inappropriate behavior, as the ride-hailing company tries to contain the fallout from a series of toxic revelations about its workplace.Uber disclosed the terminations on Tuesday at a staff meeting at its San Francisco headquarters, according to an employee who attended the event but was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The firings, which occurred in the last few months, stem from an internal investigation into Uber\u2019s workplace, the employee said. The company did not name the people who were fired, but some were senior executives, the employee said.The firings were aimed at tackling what many at Uber say are deep-seated management and cultural issues, which have made the company a cautionary tale for what can go wrong with Silicon Valley\u2019s often freewheeling corporate culture. Uber has been a lightning rod because of its aggressive chief executive, Travis Kalanick, who has flouted rules and regulations to turn the company into a nearly $70 billion behemoth. Uber\u2019s difficulties have revived questions about how the tech industry treats women and employees in general \u2014 and whether start-ups can recover from such stumbles.\u201cYou only terminate 20 people after you\u2019ve determined after an investigation that there is something very, very wrong at the company,\u201d said Deborah Weinstein, the president of the Weinstein Firm, which deals with employment and workplace law issues. \u201cMost places don\u2019t have this level of things going wrong.\u201dAfter Ms. Fowler\u2019s claims, Uber hired Eric H. Holder Jr., former attorney general, and his law firm, Covington & Burling, to conduct an independent investigation of the claims and to assess the ride-hailing company\u2019s culture. Mr. Holder\u2019s report has been delivered to Uber\u2019s board, and the company plans to make some of it public next week, as well as to discuss the findings with employees.Bobbie Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, said the firm was focused on \u201cspecific\u201d allegations raised from a hotline that Uber set up so employees could send information in confidence. Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation is more broad and focused on Uber\u2019s overall culture.Some companies strategically choose to divide an investigation between two investigators to protect lawyer-client privilege, said Liz Rita, an employment lawyer and owner of Investigations Law Group based in Denver.In such a scenario, one investigator may handle elements involving more sensitive or higher litigation risk, and a second investigator may handle findings that may be disclosed more publicly. This is done to protect a company from inadvertently waiving lawyer-client privilege if they publicly reveal parts of an investigation without disclosing all the findings.Ms. Wilson, the partner at Perkins Coie, said the firm was tapped almost immediately after Ms. Fowler\u2019s blog post was made public. The lawyers combed through thousands of internal documents and emails, and interviewed current and former employees to corroborate claims by Ms. Fowler and others.\u201cWe were given unfettered access,\u201d Ms. Wilson said in an interview. \u201cWe did a thorough and painstaking investigation into all of Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations. We spoke to people \u2014 anybody frankly \u2014 who wanted to give us information on the company\u2019s issues.\u201dSome tips came in through the internal hotline that Uber created. Other information came through Liane Hornsey, Uber\u2019s chief human resources officer, as well as to Arianna Huffington, a member of the company\u2019s board of directors.\u201cBut this is not a systemic problem,\u201d she added.In total, Ms. Wilson said that more than 215 cases of workplace violations were investigated at Uber, of which roughly 100 resulted in no action being taken. Forty-seven of the cases were related to sexual harassment, and 54 involved some form of discrimination. Others fell under the categories of unprofessional behavior, including bullying, retaliation, physical security and other nonsexual forms of harassment.Thirty-one employees are now undergoing some form of workplace training, and seven others have been given final warnings, Uber said. There are 57 complaints still under review.\u201cIf there was something serious, we didn\u2019t wait to tell Uber,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cThe company wasn\u2019t going to wait for some future point in time to take action.\u201dShe declined to comment on who was fired and declined to be specific about the episodes for which people were let go.More recently, Uber has hired several new executives. On Monday, the company said it was bringing on Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor and management consultant, as its first senior vice president for leadership and strategy.The company confirmed another hire on Tuesday, that of Bozoma St. John, a former Apple executive, who will come aboard in the newly created position of chief brand officer.An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of an employment lawyer who is also the owner of Investigations Law Group in Denver.

{"Headline": "Tech, Fed, Trump: So Many Reasons to Worry About the Market", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseInvestors have seemingly been oblivious to claims of Russian interference in the election, the firing of a director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the appointment of a special prosecutor. As the second quarter ends this week, 2017 has so far been a banner year, with major indexes hitting records.But as the bull market rolls on, some see storm clouds on the horizon. \u201cValuations are high and it\u2019s one of the longest and largest bull markets in history,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cBull markets don\u2019t last forever. So the question is, when will the music stop?\u201dInvestors \u201care on a knife\u2019s edge,\u201d said Michael J. Kelly, global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments. With many still scarred by the financial crisis, \u201cthey see a potential disaster around every corner.\u201dThis month the so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which have led the market\u2019s rally \u2014 faced a sudden downdraft, which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times to come. Those jitters were on display Thursday, as tech shares led a sell-off that put a dent in the major indexes.And then there\u2019s Mr. Trump himself, whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential to rattle markets.So I asked some prominent investors and market analysts whether they were pulling back from stocks, and how they viewed these latest developments.There\u2019s no question that these market darlings, which together have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the market\u2019s gains, are expensive, and getting more so. Price-to-earnings ratios range from 38 (Facebook) to 184 (Amazon). Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes. They show up not only in so-called growth funds, but also in value and low-volatility funds. Should they embark on a sustained plunge, a bear market could quickly follow.The tremor in June was \u201ca warning shot across the bow,\u201d said Bill Smead, the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. The Faang stocks \u201care showing all the classic signs of being overcooked,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat magazine hasn\u2019t had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover? There\u2019s no question this can end very badly. But the market can stay irrational for a very long time. My sense is that there\u2019s one big blowout rally left in these stocks.\u201dMr. Stack noted that the Faang stocks had brief sell-offs last June and October, only to rebound. Still, he said, \u201cthe Faang stocks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due to the amount of money that flowed into them and the high expectations that have driven them higher.\u201dBut like Mr. Smead, he doesn\u2019t expect that to be imminent. \u201cWe\u2019re not buying them, but we\u2019re not necessarily saying sell,\u201d Mr. Stack said. He urged investors to rebalance portfolios that have become too heavily weighted in these stocks.Everyone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market, but that may still be years away.\u201cHistorically it\u2019s difficult to find a bear market that wasn\u2019t triggered to some extent by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as they\u2019re going to will have a significant impact. What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced to raise rates faster than everyone anticipates. The Fed has prepared investors for one more rate hike this year. That\u2019s where the potential surprise could come. If we see two or three by year\u2019s end, we\u2019re going to see definite headwinds and maybe a market top of some significance.\u201dMr. Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room to maneuver before stocks start to be affected. \u201cWe just had a once-in-70-year crisis that left very long scars. Businesses basically didn\u2019t invest for eight years. In tightening, the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate. But we\u2019re just getting to the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and we\u2019re seeing more normal economic activity.\u201dMr. Kelly said bull markets typically last another three to four years after such a point in the economic cycle, and can even go another eight or nine. \u201cBull markets die from excess, not old age,\u201d he said.Mr. Smead agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re getting closer to normal rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be difficult for the stock market when it happens. People will be less willing to be adventurous. But that\u2019s still years away.\u201dOver at InvesTech Research, \u201cwe\u2019re still quite bullish,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe\u2019re not increasing cash reserves. We are rebalancing towards more defensive and out-of-favor sectors, like consumer staples and health care.\u201d\u201cThe risks don\u2019t lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cFor political mayhem to upset the economic apple cart, it has to irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level. So far we don\u2019t see that happening. Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16-year highs, and C.E.O. confidence in April was the highest since 2004.\u201dNor have investors given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver business-friendly corporate tax reform and a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code, despite the president\u2019s troubles.At the same time, \u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t be looking to the market for vindication,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a Trump rally. He\u2019s basically riding on the Obama years. \u201cHis bottom line: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to politics, and that\u2019s been a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Two San Francisco Transplants, an Easy Transition", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byRentersWhile it\u2019s common to hear about people who made moving to New York a major life objective, many transplants end up in the city more by happenstance than intention \u2014 here thanks to a job, a graduate program or a partner, rather than a burning desire to be a New Yorker.Krijn Mossel, 44, and John Rinaldi, 49, fall in the second category, having moved to Brooklyn a few months ago from Mountain View, Calif., so that Mr. Mossel could take a job as a technical account manager at Google. But to their delight, they\u2019ve found the change of cities to be just what they hadn\u2019t known they were looking for.He added: \u201cJust living in New York, we\u2019ve doubled the amount of walking we do. We\u2019ve both increased our steps a lot \u2014 up from 2,500 to 5,000, to 5,000 to 10,000.\u201dWhen Google asked Mr. Mossel how he would feel about moving to New York, he was pleasantly surprised, but said he would have to run it by his husband. Mr. Rinaldi, a singer, actor and theater buff, was, if anything, even more thrilled by the prospect.Warned off by their friends from trying to find a place in Manhattan \u2014 \u201cthey told us it would be too expensive, too small, too crazy,\u201d Mr. Rinaldi said \u2014 the couple decided to look at Jersey City, Hoboken, Queens and Brooklyn. But even coming from the Bay Area, where housing is known to be pricey, they were surprised by how expensive and small apartments were outside of Manhattan.In Mountain View, where the two had lived after leaving behind a decrepit, if well located, apartment in San Francisco, they had had a new mother-in-law apartment of about 1,000 square feet, with polished concrete floors and high ceilings, for $2,650 a month. (The mother-in-law for whom the unit had been designed had declined to take up residence.)Mr. Mossel agreed: \u201cIt was definitely the top end.\u201d They had initially given themselves a budget of $2,500 to $3,000 a month, but reluctantly increased it to $3,500 after noticing that their options vastly improved once they went over $3,000.Their apartment has the trifecta of features that, in addition to being an easy train ride from Manhattan, included things that local friends had cautioned about expecting: air-conditioning, a dishwasher and a washer/dryer unit.Though it has been thoroughly Kondo-d, the apartment\u2019s d\u00e9cor is far from bland. Keeping only what you love means having a space that better reflects you, Mr. Rinaldi said. To wit, he has a pastel-and-pencil sketch of an owl done by his mother and 50 smoking pipes, down from 300.The men were ambivalent about living in new construction, but after looking at a handful of not-so-nice older walk-ups in Fort Greene that were just as expensive, they figured why not.One landlord, Mr. Mossel recalled, took him down to a basement with low ceilings to show him the washer and dryer, which were behind a cage. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Silence of the Lambs,\u2019\u201d the landlord remarked. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s not really a selling point,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mossel said.Unlike some circumstantial transplants, who find the quirks of living in New York more exasperating than exhilarating, the couple considers even the city\u2019s pricklier aspects charming. \u201cI love that New Yorkers speak up and don\u2019t suffer fools,\u201d Mr. Rinaldi said.He described a recent visit to the hardware store. As he was leaving, the man coming in (\u201ca pretty big-sized guy, like a construction worker\u201d) told him not to hold the door. As Mr. Rinaldi paused, perplexed, the man said: \u201cYou\u2019re too big.\u201d\u201cHe was right!\u201d Mr. Rinaldi said. \u201cWe would have had to shimmy past each other. He was sincerely explaining why he didn\u2019t want the door held.\u201dKnow a renter with an interesting story?

Rent: $3,605 a month,though by signing a 27-month lease, they got three months free, making it workout to $3,204 a month.On living in new construction:The men like that their apartment has a homier vibe than some places they looked at. One kitchen they saw in Downtown Brooklyn,for example, was all metal. \u201cIt looked like a vet\u2019s office,\u201d Mr. Rinaldi said.On moving for work: It\u2019s not the first time Mr. Mossel, a native of the Netherlands,has been game to move for a job. In 2009, he raised his hand at work to leave Amsterdam for the Bay Area,when the company he was working for opened an office there. Amenities packages: These didn\u2019t sway their decision. \u201cA lot of places were sold on the amenities outside the apartment,\u201dMr. Mossel said. \u201cWe were more interested in the apartment itself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It would be the billionaire\u2019s personal volunteer project. And he told students he would finance any projects they wanted to help make Presidio the \u201cbest school in the universe.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018You guys, are you willing to make a list?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d Mr. Benioff recounted in an interview.Mr. Benioff, for one, has committed $100 million over a decade to the San Francisco Unified School District through his company\u2019s nonprofit arm. Separately, with his adoption of Presidio Middle School, Mr. Benioff said he was trying to provide a model for younger tech executives to personally work with schools.After Mr. Benioff\u2019s announcement, Thomas Ekno, the principal of the middle school, duly polled the student body. Their wishes: personal computers, better cafeteria food and a \u201cfunner environment,\u201d Mr. Ekno said.Students worked for months with the design firm to develop ideas.Once the plans are finalized, Mr. Benioff said, he intends to pay for construction of the playground.\u201cI encourage every C.E.O. in this room to adopt a public school,\u201d Mr. Benioff said last fall to an audience at a tech industry conference. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to walk down there, meet the principal and ask one question: \u2018How can I help improve this school?\u2019\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)It was 1967, the year of the Summer of Love, and hippies were streaming into San Francisco.Substance abuse was a growing problem, and some felt the medical establishment was failing to confront it.That prompted Dr. David Smith, a young physician who worked in San Francisco\u2019s public health department, to start a clinic that would provide treatment, in a deliberately nonjudgmental way, to vulnerable patients.Right away, volunteer caregivers were treating more than 200 patients a day, said Dr. Smith \u2014 \u201cIt was like a MASH unit.\u201dBut funding was scarce. The clinic survived, barely, with the help of benefit concerts by bands like Big Brother and the Holding Company and Creedence Clearwater Revival.Later, drug-addicted veterans returning from Vietnam began to seek help, leading to an era of government support for addiction treatment services.Did Dr. Smith ever think his free clinic idea would spread so far? No, he said on Tuesday.\u201cBut you know,\u201d he added, \u201cthe spirit of the Summer of Love lives on.\u201dThe California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "How Uber and Airbnb Became Poster Children for the Disruption Economy", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byNonfictionDuring the week of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in January 2009, three young would-be entrepreneurs \u2014 Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk \u2014 crashed on air mattresses in unfurnished rooms they had rented in a rundown house in Washington. They spent some of their days at a Metro station handing out fliers that urged strangers to offer rooms for rent, and in the evenings they fielded angry email complaints from a woman who had rented space in the basement. Despite the difficulties they faced that week, the huge demand for accommodations from people who had flocked to the inauguration convinced the group that the business they were hoping to create, which they called AirBed & Breakfast, would succeed if they persisted.Also in town for the festivities were two other hustling San Francisco startup jockeys, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp. They had used a website to find more comfortable accommodations, but on Inauguration Day they couldn\u2019t get a cab and had to sprint miles in the wicked cold to get to the mall on time. Camp had been trying to convince Kalanick to join him in a startup that would allow people to summon a car with the push of a button on an iPhone. The cab problems they had in Washington, which were similar to what they experienced in Paris a few months earlier, helped persuade him that the company, then called UberCab, had potential.At certain moments in history, a confluence of technological and social advances creates the opportunity for a new field of innovation. That was happening at the beginning of 2009. A few months earlier, a reluctant Steve Jobs had been persuaded by his colleagues to allow other companies to develop apps for the iPhone. That happened just as Google Maps and GPS and other tools were enabling more wondrous mobile-based services. In addition, cloud services such as Amazon\u2019s allowed startups to store and process large amounts of data without building their own infrastructure. The explosive growth of Facebook had encouraged people to create trusted identities and share things online. And as the 2008 financial crisis receded, the overcaffeinated venture capitalists of Silicon Valley became frenzied in the pursuit of new potential unicorns.The result was the blossoming of a type of economic activity with many kludgy labels \u2014 the \u201csharing\u201d or \u201cgig\u201d or \u201con-demand\u201d economy \u2014 that do not quite capture its disruptive and transformative nature. What companies such as Airbnb and Uber have done in the past decade is take the peer-to-peer sharing of digital content that flourished online, through sites like Napster and YouTube and Facebook, and apply it to our physical world, including cars and rooms and scores of other goods, tasks and services.Three new fast-paced narrative books written by seasoned business journalists (all of whom I have known since my days in the magazine world) detail the personal, financial and social aspects of the rise of these companies. \u201cWild Ride,\u201d by Adam Lashinsky, executive editor of Fortune, is a crisp and lively look at both the good and bad aspects of the rise of Uber and its C.E.O., Kalanick. His Fortune colleague Leigh Gallagher has similarly produced a colorful account of Airbnb and its C.E.O., Brian Chesky, \u201cThe Airbnb Story.\u201d And Brad Stone of Bloomberg News has intertwined the two tales in \u201cThe Upstarts,\u201d a richly researched and highly readable narrative that provides additional layers of insight by weaving in contrasting stories of competing companies that failed.As happens on all of history\u2019s uncharted frontiers, the pioneers of the sharing economy have displayed an energizing mix of idealism and recklessness. Airbnb\u2019s founders came from a background of arts and design, rather than coding and engineering, which offered, contrary to the preaching of STEM education apostles, an advantage in a new economy built on connecting humans to other humans. As a child, Chesky used to visit the Norman Rockwell Museum near his home and spent hours sketching . \u201cOn a family trip to Florence one year,\u201d Gallagher reports, \u201che stood in front of the statue of David for eight hours, meticulously drawing it.\u201d Gebbia studied the violin, played jazz piano and originally planned to be a painter. They met at the Rhode Island School of Design, and they started their company when a big design conference came to San Francisco and there was a shortage of hotel rooms.Both managed sports teams while at R.I.S.D., and their tale illustrates the importance of team formation in innovation. Each brought different skills to their collaboration: Chesky evolved into a manager and chief executive, and Gebbia focused on product design. To complete the team, they brought in Gebbia\u2019s friend Blecharczyk, a computer science geek from Harvard who had started a software company when he was an undergraduate. \u201cNo one of us alone could have done this,\u201d Gebbia said. \u201cTwo of us alone couldn\u2019t have done this. But the combination of what Nate brings, what Brian brings, what I bring, put that together, and I think that\u2019s how we\u2019ve persevered through all the challenges.\u201dThat perseverance \u2014 indeed an insane persistence \u2014 was another component of their success. Having come up with a wacky marketing idea of repackaging breakfast cereal during the 2008 conventions in boxes featuring Obama or John McCain, they lived on the leftover cereal during the subsequent lean year of struggling to keep the company going. They used their scarce resources to fly to New York on weekends to watch how the early adopters were using Airbnb and offering to photograph for free the apartments that were listed on their site.In the case of Uber, both co-founders were already somewhat successful serial entrepreneurs. The idea for an on-demand car service originated with Camp, but Kalanick shaped it. He was a maestro of collaborative brainstorming. Like Steve Jobs, he firmly believed that collaboration happened best when people got together in the flesh, and he turned his San Francisco apartment into a gathering place he called the Jam Pad. \u201cIt was a kind of entrepreneurial safe house, a place where like-minded obsessives could gather in front of a whiteboard and debate the intricacies of building internet companies,\u201d Stone writes.At first neither he nor Camp wanted to run Uber, so they set out to add a manager to their team. Kalanick sent out a tweet, \u201clooking 4 entrepreneurial product mgr.\u201d A 27-year-old midlevel product manager for General Electric in Chicago sent back the most lucrative Twitter reply in history: \u201cemail me :) graves.ryan@gmail.com.\u201d Graves was hired, and the stock he got is now worth more than $1.5 billion.Collaboration, however, can only go so far. It is also necessary to have an intense, driven leader with the visionary brilliance and obstinacy of a Steve Jobs. After finally signing up full-time as C.E.O. in 2010 and edging Ryan Graves down a notch, Kalanick became that.Kalanick focused on beating back regulators, from San Francisco to Paris, who insisted that if Uber cars were going to function like taxis they had to adhere to the rules and licensing requirements that cabbies faced. He fought with a righteousness mixed with self-interest that caused most city officials to think of him as arrogant (or another word that begins with \u201ca\u201d). It was a classic case of technological disruption where there is merit to both sides: It was unfair to medallion taxi owners to allow a competitor that did not have to play by the same rules, and yet for years city officials had become so beholden to and intimidated by the taxi industry that the medallion and licensing system had become a way to protect the interests of the owners rather than of passengers.With his scorched-earth approach to rules, Kalanick not only won battles for Uber but also for a techno-libertarianism that was contemptuous of most government attempts to regulate disruptive innovation. \u201cUber\u2019s lawyers and lobbyists, who had begged him, unsuccessfully, to seek compromise and testify with humility, began to whisper in reverent tones about a new political dictate that contravened all their old assumptions. Travis\u2019s Law,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cIt went something like this: Our product is so superior to the status quo that if we give people the opportunity to see it or try it, in any place in the world where government has to be at least somewhat responsive to the people, they will demand it and defend its right to exist.\u201d He was right.Only once did Kalanick show caution. In 2012, Uber was still using only professional drivers, mainly in town cars. A competitor started a service named Lyft that allowed drivers to use their personal cars, sometimes festooned with a playful pink mustache. Kalanick, uncharacteristically, argued to regulators that this should be illegal. But when he saw Lyft gaining traction, he reversed himself and responded with a ride-sharing service called UberX that quickly became dominant.A good litmus test to determine a person\u2019s basic ideological outlook is to ask about Uber\u2019s use of surge pricing. To some, it is a sensible way to match supply and demand by encouraging more drivers to come out and some consumers to find other transportation during periods of peak demand. Hotels and airlines use variable pricing all the time. To others it smacked of gouging, especially when there were huge spikes in prices during Superstorm Sandy and a hostage crisis in Sydney. Some of the problems could have been avoided with a bit more sensitivity \u2014 Uber would have been wise to kick in its own financial incentives for drivers during a major crisis \u2014 but that was not an instinct that came naturally to Kalanick. \u201cAnyone who whined about surge pricing, in his eyes, was too thick to understand the laws of supply and demand,\u201d Lashinsky writes. The hard-driving testosterone-fueled culture of Uber eventually caused problems. Earlier this month, the board approved top management changes, which included having Kalanick take an indefinite leave of absence, after an independent investigation found a culture of sexism and disrespect pervaded the company.Chesky has been more sensitive to public concerns, but the complex issues raised by Airbnb are as challenging, especially in places where the service is dominated not by easygoing millennials renting out a spare bedroom but instead by developers who buy up multiple houses and apartments to convert into short-term rentals. That can destroy residential neighborhoods and decimate the supply of affordable housing. To his credit, Chesky has tried to deal with these issues as well as the problem of racial discrimination that had infected the service. I watched in admiration earlier this year as Airbnb and my hometown, New Orleans, painstakingly negotiated a complex agreement, with enforcement and taxing mechanisms, specifying the number of days per year each type of place could be rented on Airbnb, with distinctions made by neighborhood and by whether a place was owner-occupied.The benefits that Airbnb and Uber pioneered go beyond convenience. They allow people to make human connections in an era that has become much more institutionalized in the decades since family-run bed-and-breakfasts began being replaced by standardized hotel chains. Stepping into someone\u2019s personal car or apartment forges a bond of trust and, in Gallagher\u2019s words, \u201cyields a little vote of confidence in our fellow humanity.\u201d A disconnected society becomes slightly more connected, not just digitally but also physically.Stone saw this firsthand while covering Chesky on a visit to Paris in November 2015 when the terrorist attack that killed 130 people occurred. \u201cI Ubered home that night to my Airbnb, near the Cath\u00e9drale Notre Dame de Paris,\u201d he writes. \u201cOnce back, I received a frantic phone call from my worried host, Ivan, whom I had never met in person (he was out of town and had left me the keys) but who wanted to make sure I was O.K. The next morning, he emailed: \u2018I was relieved to hear you yesterday on the phone. I hope you are well today despite the critical times in Paris.\u2019 He invited me to stay for as long as necessary until the travel situation in the city returned to normal.\u201dUber and Airbnb, as embodied by their young billionaire leaders, represent, to their supporters, a radical expansion of freedom and a liberating empowerment of individuals to supply services as they please, without government interference. They have provided workers with added flexibility and sources of income, and they have created a new economy based on trust and earned reputations. Consumers rate their drivers and hosts, and they in turn rate us. When it works well it encourages all involved to be a bit nicer and restores the bonds of trust that have been fraying in our society.But as Stone points out, \u201cUber and Airbnb have also come to represent, at least to some, the overweening hubris of the techno-elite. Critics blame them for everything from destroying the basic rules of employment, exacerbating traffic and ruining peaceful neighborhoods to bringing unrestrained capitalism into liberal cities.\u201d On a deeper level, this new economy is disrupting not only old industries but also the entire concept of work. Instead of having \u201ca job,\u201d a growing number of people will, by desire or necessity, support themselves by juggling on-demand gigs. That presents an issue that goes well beyond the need for new regulations; it will require whole new ways to think about pensions, health care, benefits, sick leave, disability and retirement savings.A review on the cover this weekend about four books on the rise of Uber and other transformative start-ups includes outdated information about Travis Kalanick, one of Uber\u2019s founders. After the section had gone to press, Mr. Kalanick resigned as the company\u2019s chief executive; he is no longer merely on an indefinite leave of absence from that position. In addition, an accompanying picture caption also includes the outdated reference.Advertisement"}

You might say Ms. Fader struck a nerve. \u201cIf you\u2019re a human being living in 2017 and you\u2019re not anxious,\u201d she said on the telephone, \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong with you.\u201dWhile to epidemiologists both disorders are medical conditions, anxiety is starting to seem like a sociological condition, too: a shared cultural experience that feeds on alarmist CNN graphics and metastasizes through social media. As depression was to the 1990s \u2014 summoned forth by Kurt Cobain, \u201cListening to Prozac,\u201d Seattle fog and Temple of the Dog dirges on MTV, viewed from under a flannel blanket \u2014 so it seems we have entered a new Age of Anxiety. Monitoring our heart rates. Swiping ceaselessly at our iPhones. Filling meditation studios in an effort to calm our racing thoughts.But the Cube was fundamentally a cerebral, calm pursuit, perfect for the latchkey children of the 1980s to while away their lonely, Xbox-free hours. The fidget spinner is nothing but nervous energy rendered in plastic and steel, a perfect metaphor for the overscheduled, overstimulated children of today as they search for a way to unplug between jujitsu lessons, clarinet practice and Advanced Placement tutoring.For \u201cOn Edge,\u201d Ms. Petersen, a longtime reporter for The Wall Street Journal, traveled back to her alma mater, the University of Michigan, to talk to students about stress. One student, who has A.D.H.D., anxiety and depression, said the pressure began building in middle school when she realized she had to be at the top of her class to get into high school honors classes, which she needed to get into Advanced Placement classes, which she needed to get into college.\u201cIn sixth grade,\u201d she said, \u201ckids were freaking out.\u201dThis was not the stereotypical experience of Generation X.Sexual hedonism no longer offers escape; it\u2019s now filtered through the stress of Tinder. \u201cIf someone rejects you, there\u2019s no, \u2018Well, maybe there just wasn\u2019t chemistry \u2026,\u2019\u201d Jacob Geers, a 22-year-old in New York who works in digital sales, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re afraid that through the app you\u2019ll finally look into the mirror and realize that you\u2019re butt ugly,\u201d he added.If anxiety is the melody of the moment, President Trump is a fitting maestro. Unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, a low-key ironist from the mellow shores of Oahu, the incumbent is a fast-talking agitator from New York, a city of 8.5 million people and, seemingly, three million shrinks.\u201cIn addition to the normal chaos of being a human being, there is what almost feels like weaponized uncertainty thrown at us on a daily basis,\u201d said Kat Kinsman, the \u201cHi, Anxiety\u201d author. \u201cIt\u2019s coming so quickly and messily, some of it straight from the president\u2019s own fingers.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Trump is the first politician in world history whose preferred mode of communication is the 3 a.m. tweet \u2014 evidence of a sleepless body, a restless mind, a worrier.Some have suggested Twitter is a sort of crowdsourced poetry, but how many millions of miles is it from Auden: a cacophony of voices, endlessly shouting over each other, splintering what\u2019s left of a \u201cnational discussion\u201d into millions of tiny shards.The political mess has been \u201ca topic of conversation and a source of anxiety in nearly every clinical case that I have worked with since the presidential election,\u201d said Robert Duff, a psychologist in California. He wrote a 2014 book, \u201cHardcore Self-Help,\u201d whose subtitle proposes to conquer anxiety in the coarse language that has also defined a generation.And television was, as Marshall McLuhan famously wrote, a cool medium. Our devices are literally hot, warming our laps and our palms.\u201cIn our always-on culture, checking your phone is the last thing you do before you go to sleep, and the first thing you do if you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cJust today, I got an alert on my phone about the collapsing Arctic ice shelf. That\u2019s scary as hell.\u201dAnd let\u2019s remember that we survived previous heydays of anxiety without a 24-hour digital support system. Weren\u2019t the Woody Allen \u201970s the height of neurosis, with their five-days-a-week analysis sessions and encounter groups? What about the 1950s, with their duck-and-cover songs and backyard bomb shelters?That era \u201cwas the high-water mark of Freudian psychoanalysis, and any symptom or personality trait was attributed to an anxiety neurosis,\u201d said Peter D. Kramer, the Brown University psychiatrist who wrote the landmark 1990s best-seller, \u201cListening to Prozac.\u201d \u201cAnd then there were substantial social spurs to anxiety: the World Wars, the atom bomb. If you weren\u2019t anxious, you were scarcely normal.\u201dScott Stossel, editor of The Atlantic, whose \u201cMy Age of Anxiety\u201d helped kick off the anxiety memoir boom three years ago, urged people to pause, not for deep cleansing breaths, but for historical perspective.\u201cEvery generation, going back to Periclean Greece, to second century Rome, to the Enlightenment, to the Georgians and to the Victorians, believes itself to be the most anxious age ever,\u201d Mr. Stossel said.That said, the Americans of 2017 can make a pretty strong case that they are gold medalists in the Anxiety Olympics.\u201cThere is widespread inequality of wealth and status, general confusion over gender roles and identities, and of course the fear, dormant for several decades, that ICBMs will rain nuclear fire on American cities,\u201d Mr. Stossel said. \u201cThe silver lining for those with nervous disorders is that we can welcome our previously non-neurotic fellow citizens into the anxious fold.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Said to Face $1.2 Billion Antitrust Fine, but Battle With Europe Looms", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byEuropean Union officials are expected to issue a record fine of at least 1.1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, against Google as soon as Tuesday for breaking the region\u2019s tough competition rules.Yet the hefty penalty and its timing, which were confirmed by two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity, are likely to be quickly overshadowed by a more complex problem: How should Google comply with the decision to rein in its power?That dilemma will now take center stage as the tech giant fights doggedly to protect its crown jewel \u2014 its closely guarded search algorithm \u2014 from the prying eyes of regulators and, possibly, its competitors.Potentially heavy-handed intervention may raise the hackles of Google and other companies in the American tech world, which could claim that, once again, Europe is unfairly targeting companies from the United States. The region\u2019s officials deny such accusations.No matter the final outcome, analysts warn that jockeying for greater regulatory control over Google\u2019s services in Europe will drag on for months, if not years, as the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, tries to turn its expected antitrust decision against Google into a reality.\u201cThe issue they\u2019re facing is, how does the European Commission solve the underlying problem\u201d of Google\u2019s suspected antitrust abuse, said Christian Bergqvist, an associate professor of competition law at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. \u201cIt will be very difficult to structure any remedy.\u201dHow Google responds to these demands will be left to the company, which must provide the region\u2019s authorities with potential technical solutions to counter its perceived antitrust abuse. Officials can ask for more changes if they are not satisfied with Google\u2019s initial proposals.Experts and some of the company\u2019s competitors claim that any changes would most likely require greater oversight of Google\u2019s products, including a potential independent monitor over its search services (and, potentially, its algorithms) in Europe to guarantee that it continues to comply with the antitrust ruling.A spokeswoman for the European Commission declined to comment on the potential announcement.\u201cWe believe strongly that our innovations in online shopping have been good for shoppers, retailers and competition,\u201d Al Verney, a company spokesman, said in a statement.The coming announcement against Google represents a watershed moment for the search giant, which holds more than 90 percent of the market in online search across Europe. Still, the potential fine represents a mere fraction of the company\u2019s $90.3 billion in revenue in 2016.Other American tech companies, including Apple, Facebook and Amazon, also remain under investigation by European officials for a variety of antitrust, tax and privacy reasons. And while the companies deny any wrongdoing, the continued focus, and potential hefty fines, have given European authorities an increasingly large say over how much of the internet is regulated. That position comes despite European tech companies mostly failing to keep pace with their American counterparts.\u201cEurope has been more aggressive in enforcement against monopolies than the U.S.,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIn Europe, we\u2019re more threatened by the dominance of big companies.\u201dAs Google and its foes prepare for battle over how the search giant should comply with Europe\u2019s upcoming antitrust decision, much attention will focus on lessons from a previous failed attempt to settle the online shopping case in 2014.Analysts and Google\u2019s rivals stressed that any new proposal must go further than these previous efforts, which included placing competitors\u2019 ads online alongside Google\u2019s own digital advertising.To ensure the company complies, one remedy may include the regular monitoring of Google\u2019s action by an outside group. The company, however, also has the option of removing some of its specialized search results altogether, or returning them to what they looked like before Europe\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.\u201cAll that the complainants are asking for is that Google restores the level playing field,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a founder of Foundem, a British comparison shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google.For Michael Weber, director of Hot Maps, a German digital mapping company, the conclusion to Europe\u2019s antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s online shopping service cannot come soon enough.\u201cI can\u2019t image life without being a complainant against Google, it\u2019s been going on for such a long time,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who first filed his claim in 2011. \u201cIt has become something like a marriage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then add the genuinely difficult geography of this trading junction \u2014 possibly named for \u201cthe camp of a woman with a large navel\u201d \u2014 baking in the midst of the Sahel Desert and tucked away from the convenient range of 19th-century European explorers. Finish with the pedigree of having been an urban locus of the vanished Songhay empire, which once commanded a region twice the size of Texas.But great billing concealed a scenic letdown. Most adventurers who cheated bandits, guards and thirst to enter this African El Dorado found it dusty and dismal, \u201cnothing but a mass of ill-looking houses, built of earth,\u201d in the verdict of Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9, who sneaked into the city in 1828 disguised as an Egyptian peasant.For what it may have lacked in appearance, Timbuktu earned a kind of redemption through its libraries, which brimmed with thousands of documents from a golden age of African civilization that put the lie to Western disparagements of a continent free of any non-oral history. Charlie English\u2019s \u201cThe Storied City: The Quest for Timbuktu and the Fantastic Mission to Save Its Past\u201d tells the story of the greatest threat this cultural treasure has faced in seven centuries: the city\u2019s occupation in 2012 by a band of Al Qaeda-backed rebels with a sacred charge to eliminate all historical memory of any Islam that did not conform to their austere variety of Wahhabism.The enterprising librarian Abdel Kader Haidara emerges as the central hero in a band of conspirators who sought to prevent an auto-da-f\u00e9 by smuggling the manuscripts out of Timbuktu in pushcarts and donkey carts, concealed under cases of soda pop and vegetables \u2014 by any means necessary to keep the treasures away from the fundamentalist torch. Overseas allies helped his cause by raising money from deep-pocketed donors like the Ford Foundation and frantically trying to keep the unfolding librarians-versus-vandals story temporarily out of the media. Jihadists, after all, know how to use Google.Charlie English, a former international editor of The Guardian with a movie-perfect foreign correspondent name, tells this story of contemporary Timbuktu combined with alternating chapters about the mania among 19th-century European Orientalists to be the first to \u201cdiscover\u201d the lost city. The result is a classic nonfiction braid that reinforces his central point: that Haidara\u2019s Indiana Jones-style work to save the hippocampus of the Songhay kingdom is just one more incredible tale in the continuum of Timbuktu.The incredible story \u2014 also told recently in Joshua Hammer\u2019s \u201cThe Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu\u201d \u2014 has a few gaps in this rendition. English spends almost no time describing the contents of the manuscripts themselves. Nor does he give a full explanation of the differences in Islamic theology that make the rebel army so hostile to the parchment. His clean prose style is occasionally marred by the journalistic tic of following up a declarative sentence with a supporting quote that says exactly the same thing.English also throws the reader a surprise punch in the last chapter, which casts doubt on Haidara\u2019s motives as well as the veracity of what had been presented to the reader as the unchallenged facts. But English deals with the inconsistencies in a transparent way \u2014 even if a bit late in the game \u2014 and, curiously, it even fits perfectly into the ongoing narrative of Timbuktu, a place where the magnificence of the tale can occlude the plain facts of what\u2019s there.Tom Zoellner is the author of \u201cThe Heartless Stone: A Journey Through the World of Diamonds, Deceit, and Desire.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wake Me Up", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byWordplayTHURSDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Today we welcome a new constructor to The New York Times. Rich Proulx is an example of someone who had happily solved The New York Times Crossword for years, until he woke up one day and said something to the effect of, \u201cHey! I wonder if I could do that!\u201dThat\u2019s how a lot of careers and hobbies are born. And while some mamas (I see both spellings for the 9D song on Google, but prefer this one) might not want their babies to grow up to be crossword constructors \u2014 unless there is a sudden change in the order of the universe and the occupation becomes financially feasible \u2014 I am of the opinion that learning new things both from solving and from learning to make your own puzzles is a spiffy way to keep life exciting and enjoyable.Even if you never make a puzzle of your own, I say you\u2019re a better person for the experience if you complete a puzzle and can walk away saying that you learned just one thing from it.It\u2019s all a matter of attitude, really; your mileage may vary, and people will always object to things they don\u2019t know in puzzles. I\u2019m not talking about unfair crossings here, but about general knowledge.My point is, you just can\u2019t get an education like that for these prices anywhere else. Also, thank goodness for Google.Mr. Proulx offers us a set of familiar phrases where part of the phrase has been replaced by a country name to make a pun. For example, the phrase \u201cCan you give me a hand?\u201d gets the treatment by appearing here as KENYA GIVE ME A HAND, clued as \u201cRequest for aid in East Africa?\u201d Similarly, BRAINWASH becomes BAHRAIN WASH, clued as \u201cCall for cleanup in the Persian Gulf?\u201dSo, is that a dealbreaker? Apparently not, if the editors feel that the puns are fresh and funny. In today\u2019s puzzle, the editors were trying to strike a balance between \u201cthe rules of construction\u201d and entertainment value.Were they successful, in your opinion? As a constructor, these things catch my eye, but I always wonder whether they make a difference to people who solve but don\u2019t make puzzles themselves.\u25a0 15A: Whenever I see a clue like \u201cPlants cultivated for their sap,\u201d I always want the answer to be MAPLE, but that\u2019s wrong: While maples are tapped for their sap, they are much more likely to be clued as trees than plants. The entry is also five letters and calls for a plural, so I knew it couldn\u2019t be MAPLE. In today\u2019s puzzle, the answer is ALOES.\u25a0 24A: Tricky because there is no French in the clue, with the exception of the hint that the answer refers to Paris\u2019s Notre-Dame. The figure on top is an angel, or ANGE in French.\u25a0 34A: Possibly tricky for some, but I am a film history geek, so I knew that one of the first moving pictures was Louis Le Prince\u2019s 1888 \u201cTraffic Crossing LEEDS Bridge\u201d:\u25a0 55A: I understand that staples can go in the corner of a stack of papers, but am not really connecting with the clue \u201cHaving a corner piece?\u201d for STAPLED. Maybe I need a few more days off, but if anyone feels like parsing that in the comments, I\u2019d be much obliged.It is a humbling honor to make my debut today. For the last 15 years, I\u2019ve been regularly traveling to Long Island to visit my in-laws. The mornings always begin with delicious bagels and a copy of The New York Times puzzle for everyone. It\u2019s not a competitive affair ... but let\u2019s just say you don\u2019t want to be the last person to complete the puzzle.I came home after Thanksgiving a couple of years ago and decided to give constructing a try. My mother-in-law remains one of my indispensable test solvers of new puzzles. The inspiration for this puzzle came from a playdate my son was having. I overheard, \u201cJamaica me crazy!\u201d which started me wondering.I printed out a list of countries and capitals and put on my pun hat. I came up with more than could fit in this puzzle, such as \u201cDO A ONE HAITI,\u201d \u201cACOUSTIC QATAR\u201d and \u201cNORWAY JOSE,\u201d clued as \u201cSuggestion for a Mexican who can\u2019t stand the heat?\u201dI still have the list of countries, and pull it out on long drives to quiz my kids on international geography. I\u2019m sure by now I\u2019ve completely squelched any desire they may have had to see the world. One area I need to work on is gauging puzzle difficulty. I was surprised to see this puzzle pegged for a Thursday. When it was, I was expecting my clues to be made more difficult. Instead, they were made clearer/easier. For example, specific geographic hints were added to the themed clues (e.g. The original clue was \u201cRequest for clean up in the Gulf.\u201d) Obscure allusions to the actual name of the \u201cTheme from Rocky\u201d and Henny Youngman\u2019s trademark one-liner were replaced with universally understood references. Clearly, I owe flowers and a note of apology to my mother-in-law.And before we go-go, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re awake for the Friday puzzle:Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

Some excerpts:Q. What goes into preparing for a climb like this?But the mental side is the bigger unknown. That\u2019s the part where you just imagine the whole experience and process it for a long time and then wait until you\u2019re ready.Were there any doubts going into it?Not so much. A couple years ago when I looked at the wall it was more fear than anything. I\u2019d look at it and be like, \u201cOh my God that seems daunting.\u201d But because of all the preparation and all the time I\u2019ve spent visualizing and imagining, by yesterday I was like, \u201cThis is going to be awesome.\u201dRegular people see this as insane. Do you worry about dying young?I do worry about dying young, which is why I spent a year or two preparing. I climbed El Cap without falling as early as 2008 or 2009. So physically I\u2019ve been able to free solo this for eight or nine years. But it\u2019s taken me a long time to feel safe enough on it that I want to do it.What did your mother say?She said \u201ccongratulations\u201d of course. Then she said, \u201cThanks for not telling me ahead of time.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know?No. You don\u2019t want to tell a lot of people because then obviously they are worried and then they project that on to you and then you start to worry.

{"Headline": "Alibaba Predicts Strong Sales in a Sign of Strength From China", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byThe Alibaba Group signaled on Thursday that for all the global worries about China\u2019s rising debt and bloated state industries, its economy still enjoys a strong pillar of support: online shoppers.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said Thursday during an investor conference that it expected revenue for its current fiscal year to grow at a much higher rate than analysts had forecast. It cited expectations for growing sales volumes on its online marketplaces and, even more strongly, surging demand by merchants for its digital ad space.China\u2019s digital growth will not last forever, though, and even Alibaba\u2019s numbers show that China\u2019s online world cannot counter the laws of diminishing returns. Still, the ranks of China\u2019s online shoppers grew nearly 13 percent last year to a considerable 467 million, according to official statistics, showing the already vast market is still growing.During a speech at the conference, Alibaba\u2019s chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said that the company expected revenue for the year that will end next March to grow between 45 percent and 49 percent. That is slightly down from the 56 percent growth the company registered in fiscal year 2017, which ended in March. Still, it nonetheless shows the company is expecting to keep growing at a fast pace in the coming year.Although Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, it does not directly sell the goods on its websites. Instead, it provides marketplaces where anyone from small village dwellers to big global brands can set up online shops and sell to Chinese customers. To reach those customers, Alibaba also offers online advertising space.That space is looking increasingly valuable.During her speech, Ms. Wu said the company got about 60 percent of its revenue from its Alimama advertising platform, which works as an auction site on which Alibaba\u2019s many vendors can bid for advertising space on its sites. On that platform the price for ads has been rising as a result of market forces, Ms. Wu said.At times in the past, Alibaba\u2019s merchants, many of which are small businesses that duke it out with other small sellers on the company\u2019s Taobao marketplace, have complained about increases in what the company would charge for promotions. Such criticism even led to several protests at the company\u2019s offices.Still, the pricing of online ad space in China has long lagged behind what it can cost in more developed markets in Europe and the United States. Alibaba\u2019s high revenue growth target shows that gap may be starting to close, which is good news for a company that is in essence an advertising company.\u201cWe\u2019re not holding a gun to merchants\u2019 heads to make revenue grow,\u201d Ms. Wu said.\u201cIt\u2019s all determined by merchants,\u201d she said. \u201cThey bid for every single click.\u201dThe big revenue growth target is important because investors have been concerned about the slowdown in the total value of the merchandise Alibaba sells on its online platforms. That figure, which Alibaba calls gross merchandise value, grew 22 percent in 2017, a figure smaller than what the company had posted in recent years.Advertisement"}

Yet Jeff Bezos\u2019 company won\u2019t walk away with all the spoils. Customers are worried about being locked in, and that will keep competitors in business.Companies have come to realize it is simpler, cheaper and more convenient to store data and run applications on servers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsofts. Uncertainty over the cost implications is receding rapidly, according to surveys conducted by Bain and Morgan Stanley and highlighted by Kleiner Perkins\u2019s Mary Meeker in her annual \u201cInternet Trends\u201d presentation last week.The providers of cloud services have grown rapidly as a result. First-quarter revenue at Amazon Web Services was about 3.5 times as big as in the same period three years ago. At $3.7 billion for the period, it accounted for more than 10 percent of Amazon\u2019s total sales, and it was by far the most profitable slice. The operating margin for Amazon Web Services has nearly doubled over the last two years to around 25 percent.Not coincidentally, information technology managers have started to worry about the difficulty of switching cloud suppliers \u2014 a particular problem if one outfit, like Amazon Web Services, comes to dominate. This concern rocketed between 2012 and 2015, according to Ms. Meeker, with the proportion of respondents bothered by it surging from 7 percent to 22 percent.As in other sectors including, for instance, finance, companies will often ensure that at least two suppliers of each service stay in business, to retain the option of shifting between the two and maintain price competition. This doesn\u2019t always happen in technology. Alphabet\u2019s Google will, for example, claim 78 percent of United States search revenue this year, eMarketer estimated.For all the market sway enjoyed by Amazon Web Services, that means enterprises will want Microsoft and Alphabet to stay in the game.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Women Don\u2019t See Themselves as Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewFor many Americans, starting their own business is the manifestation of the American dream: Take a risk, work hard, get rich. So why don\u2019t more women do it?\u201cWomen are just outside of those established networks, and if you\u2019re outside the networks, you don\u2019t get the knowledge, you don\u2019t get the opportunities, you don\u2019t get the contacts and you don\u2019t get the funding,\u201d said Susan Coleman, a business professor at the University of Hartford and co-author of the Third Way report. She wrote it with Alicia Robb, a research fellow at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the founder of Next Wave Ventures, for female angel investors.Women are also left out of financing networks, which are predominantly male and often operate through referrals from friends. They are more likely to invest their own money instead of outside capital in their businesses, and when they seek investors, they ask for less.Networks are important for another reason: emotional support. \u201cLaunching an entrepreneurial venture is a lonely and sometimes scary undertaking, and you need to have people to talk to,\u201d Ms. Coleman said.Incubators \u2014 physical spaces where people start businesses and meet other entrepreneurs as well as lawyers, accountants and investors \u2014 don\u2019t help. In a study of 18,000 firms started in incubators, only 6 percent were by women.Jennifer Dionisio said she had no female role models when she started her company, Three Sisters Farm and Dairy, last year. She sells goat milk and beef, and she hopes to start a cheese shop and farm-to-table restaurant.Living in a small town, Pueblo, Colo., made it easier, she said, because she knows the local lawyer and bankers. \u201cI would be apprehensive if I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. Even so, she says, people at the local feed store assume she can\u2019t load bags of feed or drive tractors, and others come to the farm and ask for her boss.She said she was trying to be a role model for her three daughters. She named the farm after them and hopes they will take over someday. \u201cThen they can work for themselves, be independent and still make a living,\u201d she said. \u201cEven my 7-year-old daughter can run a Bobcat\u201d tractor now.Silicon Valley is even more of a bubble than the rest of small-business America.They wanted to find out whether the problem was not enough women with the education, training or desire to start companies, or whether it was factors like bias or closed-off networks.They concluded there were plenty of qualified women. Women earn 40 percent to 50 percent of degrees in science and engineering, and they represent 30 percent of the software industry work force. But they are less likely to have information about how to become an entrepreneur, to see female role models and to know venture capitalists.Female venture capitalists are more likely to invest in female entrepreneurs, Mr. Gompers has found. Yet 91 percent of venture capitalists are male. Eighty-six percent are white, and 11 percent are Asian. Most worked in investment banking, private equity or consulting, and went to Harvard, Stanford or the University of Pennsylvania.Unsurprisingly, the backgrounds of venture-backed entrepreneurs are pretty much the same. Ninety-one percent are men, 80 percent are white and 16 percent are Asian. Most have degrees from a similar set of colleges and have worked at big tech companies like Google or Microsoft.\u201cThe problem when you have five white men who all went to the same business school and worked in the same firms is their networks overlap, so they don\u2019t draw from a very wide source of entrepreneurial deal flow,\u201d Mr. Gompers said.Sheila Lirio Marcelo, the founder of Care.com, a service for helping families find caregivers, was surprised to see that insularity after growing up in the Philippines, where both her parents started businesses. She said one of the most important things she did was seek out male role models and mentors, not just women.\u201cClosing the gender gap in business is often a conversation that women have with other women,\u201d she said. \u201cWe absolutely need to provide a supportive community for each other, but if we\u2019re truly going to level the playing field, men have to be part of the equation.\u201dShe also advised women to develop thicker skin. \u201cMen tend to shake off rejection more quickly than women,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s absolutely true that entrepreneurs are made or broken by how they bounce back from adversity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: White House Looks to Defang Financial Watchdog", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byThe Trump administration has offered its most detailed plans to date for the unraveling of financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.In a report issued on Monday, the Treasury said that the president should be able to remove the bureau\u2019s director and recommended greater exemptions from the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d which bans banks from trading for their own gain.The report also called for relief from regulatory scrutiny, such as stress tests for community banks.The plan sets up a clash between President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was her brainchild.According to the Treasury report, \u201cThe C.F.P.B. was created to pursue an important mission, but its unaccountable structure and unduly broad regulatory powers have led to predictable regulatory abuses and excesses.\u201d\u201cThe C.F.P.B.\u2019s approach to rule making and enforcement has hindered consumer access to credit, limited innovation and imposed unduly high compliance burdens, particularly on small institutions,\u201d the report added.Critics argue that the plan would put the economy at risk.\u201cWe need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.Chief executives say they\u2019re optimistic about the economy and about the prospect of lower regulation and lower tax.And investors have bid up the stock market.Usually, when corporate leaders are confident, they do deals.But that has not happened since Mr. Trump was elected. In fact, the number of mergers have fallen off a cliff.Bellwether companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google led a two-day sell-off, after a relentless three-year ascent.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dUBS published a research report noting the heavy influence of these stocks on investor portfolios. Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far the stocks had run. Two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple.Hedge funds could be bailing out, too.The question now is whether retail investors will stick with them.The group of Uber executives that formed the inner circle around Travis Kalanick, the chief executive, is fraying.The A-Team, as it was informally known, shared Mr. Kalanick\u2019s aggressive approach and helped him barrel into new markets around the world.\u2022 Emil Michael, Uber\u2019s senior vice president for business and its second in command, left the company.\u2022 Eric Alexander, a top executive in Asia, was fired for mishandling the rape case of an Uber passenger in India.\u2022 Thuan Pham, Uber\u2019s chief technology officer, is under scrutiny for what many see as his shortcomings in listening to employee complaints.Uber staff members who sell even part of their stock back to the company under a repurchase program must give the voting rights associated with all their shares to Mr. Kalanick, according to a copy of the buyback agreement obtained by The New York Times.That voting power is crucial as the ride-hailing service wrestles with its issues and as the board considers whether Mr. Kalanick should take a three-month leave of absence.Even if he took time off, his ability to influence the direction of the company would appear to be secure, thanks to his \u201csuper-voting shares.\u201dAnd employees must follow the \u201cinstructions of Travis Kalanick,\u201d according to the buyback agreement, \u201cwith respect to any and all matters\u201d that are submitted to a shareholder vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Increasing Voter Turnout for 2018 and Beyond", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byFixesAt the moment, given the rocky start experienced by President Trump, 2018 seems like a promising year for Democrats. Still, to win in the next congressional elections, Democrats will need to increase turnout. Last year, city dwellers, young people, Latinos and Asians all supported Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly. But those groups voted underwhelmingly.Even in presidential elections, when turnout is highest, the electorate does not reflect America. In primaries and local elections, turnout can dip into single digits. This has proved catastrophic for both major parties in our political system, often favoring extreme candidates and ensuring that most incumbents have no real contest.Raising turnout presents two distinct challenges: How does our campaign win the next election? And how does our political system raise voter turnout for the long term?The first challenge is easier. One way for campaigns to get their voters to the polls is to recruit a good candidate who can inspire voters and run a competitive race.Then there\u2019s painstaking fieldwork. All campaigns do it, but Donald P. Green, a professor at Columbia, said that many do it wrong. With Alan S. Gerber, Green wrote \u201cGet Out the Vote,\u201d which collected evidence from randomized controlled trials about what gets candidates\u2019 supporters to the polls. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong consensus that one of the few things that actually does increase turnout is contact, preferably in person,\u201d said Green. \u201cShoe leather really works.\u201d Especially when it\u2019s a neighbor doing the door knocking.Voter anger is another turnout boost; hence the dominance of negative ads (which, of course, increase polarization and dysfunction).Among Democrats this year, serious people are already signing up to run in 2018, even against incumbents formerly considered safe. That\u2019s partly because President Trump\u2019s initiatives have been resisted with an extraordinary wave of post-November activism \u2014 which can also supply door knockers. And voter anger? More like voter apoplexy.But there\u2019s no guarantee that the enthusiasm will last \u2014 or that any increase in turnout will, in the long term. Barack Obama\u2019s first election, in 2008, was a high turnout year. Just six years later, in 2014, turnout was the lowest it had been since 1942, when a lot of American voters were occupied defending democracy in other ways. Even in 2018, pro-turnout factors will be undercut by numerous structural barriers \u2014 long-term obstacles intended to preserve the dominance of rich, white, older people by suppressing the votes of poorer, younger minorities.Nevertheless, in the last few years, many states and cities have begun institutional reforms that make voting easier.Denver is a leader. Coloradans have long been among the nation\u2019s most enthusiastic voters, and last November, Denver set a personal best: 72 percent of those registered voted \u2014 much more than in most major cities. (The percentage was 67 in 2008, and 63 in 2012.)\u201cFor us, this is a customer service issue,\u201d said Amber McReynolds, Denver\u2019s director of elections. \u201cWhatever we can do to better serve our voters, we\u2019re going to do.\u201dDenver mailed a ballot to every registered voter. Voters could fill it out at home and then mail it in or bring it to a drop box. Mailed ballots could be tracked with bar codes.There were other modernizations: People could register and vote on the same day. Those who moved had their voter registration changed automatically when they updated their driver\u2019s license.We hear a lot about voter suppression. It is true that in many states and cities, Republican officials make it harder to vote, placing obstacles aimed especially at minorities. This has rightly drawn attention and condemnation \u2014 and some reversals in court.But the counter-trend is growing. The Illinois legislature, for example, just adopted automatic registration, by unanimous votes in both houses. If the governor signs it, then citizens who have contact with state agencies, including the motor vehicles department, will be automatically registered unless they decline.Republicans approve of automatic registration because researchers believe it is truly nonpartisan. It\u2019s so new that we have only one test case: Oregon this year. The state saw higher turnout among people who were young, poorer and less urban. While young people and poor minorities tend to skew Democratic, rural people and poor whites tend to vote Republican.It\u2019s also the right thing to do. \u201cNot everybody\u2019s trying to suppress votes,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cSome people want the system to work better.\u201dThese are all important. But can it raise turnout? By itself, probably not. In concert with other reforms, maybe.One reason turnout is dismal is that the United States is one of very few democracies that places the burden of registration on the voter. Does it seem normal to have to register to vote? It isn\u2019t. In nearly every other advanced democracy, citizens are automatically registered.And nearly every other democracy holds elections on weekends, or makes Election Day a holiday. (In some countries, people dress up to go vote!) Voting on a workday isn\u2019t usually a burden for old people, or people powerful enough to set their own hours. For wage workers, however, it\u2019s daunting.\u201cIt is very hard to get voters\u2019 attention,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, the director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe squeeze our Election Day into the middle of everything else Americans are doing. We never say, \u2018Stop, think about your country and vote.\u2019 \u201d\u201cChanging election administration, reforms around convenience voting \u2014 the literature is pretty conclusive that none of these have any significant long-term effect.\u201dNot everyone agrees. Some researchers point to election-day registration, for example, as something that works. Fifteen states let voters register when they vote. It makes sense that election-day registration could increase turnout. In some states, registration closes a month or more before Election Day. Are you finally ready to pay attention to the election? Too late!In their 2013 book \u201cWho Votes Now?\u201d Jan E. Leighley and Jonathan Nagler found that in such states, election-day registration would raise turnout by 6.6 percentage points. (Becker, however, thinks the evidence linking election-day registration to better turnout is weak.)Other strategies could focus on helping young people identify as prospective voters and make voting a habit once they\u2019re eligible. Eric Marshall, director of the liberal Funders\u2019 Committee for Civic Participation, argues for expanding registration drives in high schools, to register high schoolers before they reach their 18th birthdays, and before they scatter.Election officials could try to help people feel more competent at understanding the issues and candidates. People don\u2019t enjoy doing things they\u2019re bad at. Becker suggests changing the typical small-type voters\u2019 handout about the candidates, written in government-ese, and experimenting with more appealing messages.Flaxman\u2019s goal is to bring voting information and inspiration into the channels people already use. His organization supplied the data to Google and Facebook to answer \u201cwhere do I vote?\u201d \u2014 a question people asked 123 million times last year. Colleges offer the TurboVote app alongside class registration. And Starbucks featured TurboVote on the side of millions of coffee cups.\u201cEach thing by itself has only a marginal impact,\u201d Flaxman said. \u201cBut all those different 2 to 3 percent increases \u2014 we\u2019re hoping it adds up to 20 percent.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of cups on which Starbucks featured TurboVote. The number is millions, not 35 million, a number that cannot be verified.Advertisement"}

We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that\u2019s good for our planet and makes good business sense as well.AmazonAmazon continues to support the Paris climate agreement and action on climate change. We believe that robust clean energy and climate policies can support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. We remain committed to putting our scale and inventive culture to work in ways that are good for the environment and our customers.Murray EnergyThe Ohio-based company, one of the largest coal-producing companies in the country and a prominent supporter of Mr. Trump, praised the decision. The chief executive, Robert E. Murray, said in a statement:We applaud President Trump\u2019s steadfast leadership and his delivery on this important campaign commitment. Indeed, complete withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord is an integral part of President Trump\u2019s energy agenda.In following through on his promise, President Trump is supporting America\u2019s uncompromising values, saving coal jobs, and promoting low-cost, reliable electricity for Americans and the rest of the world.UberToday\u2019s announcement from President Trump that the United States will not honor the agreement is a huge disappointment. Addressing rising temperatures is vital to ensuring the continued health and prosperity of populations across the globe.Uber will continue to do our part and we implore the President of the United States to not work against us, but rather join us. Let\u2019s drive change.IBMClimate change is an international problem that requires an international solution, and we believe it is important for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore IBM supported \u2014 and still supports \u2014 U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement. This agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country. IBM believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it.ShellPeabody Energy The company, a multinational coal-mining giant based in St. Louis, said in a statement:We believe that abiding by the accord, without significant changes, would have substantially impacted the U.S. economy, increased electricity costs and required the power sector to rely on less diverse and more intermittent energy. Peabody continues to advocate for greater use of technology to meet the world\u2019s need for energy security, economic growth and energy solutions through high efficiency low emissions coal-fueled power plants and research and development funding for carbon capture.CargillIt is extremely disappointing. Exiting international accords like the Paris Agreement will negatively impact trade, economic vitality, the state of our environment, and relationships amongst the world community. And it positions the U.S. as an outlier on this important issue. It would have resulted in U.S. economic growth and job creation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ponzi Scheme Meets Ransomware for a Doubly Malicious Attack", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The first message to pop up on the computer screen let the victims know they had been hacked. The second message gave them a way out.The victim had a choice: Pay the hackers a ransom of one bitcoin, a digital currency worth roughly $2,365, in exchange for regaining access to the computer, or try to infect two new people on behalf of the attackers. If someone the victim knew fell for the bait and became infected, the attackers would consider the ransom paid and cede control of the infected computer.The attack late last year was, according to the cybersecurity researchers who discovered what they now call the Popcorn Time ransomware, the first Ponzi scheme for one of the internet\u2019s oldest types of cyberattacks.Ransomware, a type of malicious software that infects a system and then holds it hostage, demanding a ransom for its release, is one of the most popular and lucrative ways to attack computers.The scheme has become more successful as more of what we do goes online, from business client lists to family photos. With the click of a button, an entire system can be infected. With another click, criminals can wipe information from a computer or expose it to the public. It all depends on what commands a bigger ransom: losing information or exposing it.Security researchers warn that WannaCry, which exploited a wide-ranging vulnerability in Windows systems and then used a clever mechanism to to spread itself across new systems, is just the tip of the iceberg. They are tracking new schemes dreamed up by criminals who have quickly realized that people are willing to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in ransom.\u201cThis is a growing business because it works,\u201d said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, a security firm based in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cAnd the attacks are becoming more creative and effective.\u201dMr. Hypponen, whose team found and first reported on the Popcorn malware, said it was an outlier in the world of ransomware. It was the first attempt to combine a Ponzi, or pyramid scheme, in which one person entraps another, with malware that holds a computer hostage for payment. If it proved successful, he added, a number of criminal networks were likely to copy the model. Researchers are still monitoring the scheme to see if it works.\u201cThese networks all watch each other and learn. When a new model works, it quickly grows as others build on it,\u201d Mr. Hypponen said.Asaf Cidon, a vice president at the security company Barracuda Networks who studies ransomware, said that criminals had become more sophisticated in the last year, especially in how they choose their victims.\u201cAttackers will go after a specific department at a company, for instance human resources, where they know emails and links are more likely to get opened,\u201d Mr. Cidon said. Networks will choose a company to target and then comb LinkedIn to draw a map of people employed by that company, he said.They might then use that map to impersonate various people or leverage their way into the company\u2019s social network, ultimately using whatever means necessary to make sure that the system becomes infected with the ransomware.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen them impersonate people within the company, or impersonate airlines sending ticketing information or vendors and customers of the company sending files,\u201d Mr. Cidon said, adding that all businesses, from mom-and-pop shops to giant Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google, were getting hit by ransomware attacks.\u201cThere is a lot of money at stake here, so criminals are always going to be interested,\u201d said Mr. Hypponen, whose company is still tracking the fallout from last month\u2019s WannaCry virus.Though the speed and effectiveness through which that particular attack spread caused it to make headlines, Mr. Hypponen said it was, in ransomware terms, unsuccessful.He also said it was an innovative idea, as the attackers combined ransomware with malware that acted like an old internet scourge known as a \u201cworm,\u201d essentially spreading itself across systems as it infected them.While the first worm was created in 1988 by a Cornell graduate student named Robert Morris, who appeared to be more motivated by curiosity than malice, computer worms quickly became one of the most popular and destructive forms of cyberattacks.\u201cThis was a good idea, to combine the two processes together,\u201d Mr. Hypponen said. \u201cOther groups are watching this, and we are going to see other versions of this, better versions, soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flint Holds a Glittering Prom, Far From Flint", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "\nThe seniors of Flint Northwestern High School were in agreement. The prom could be anywhere but Flint.\u201cWe wanted to be somewhere different, see something different,\u201d said Treveyon Allen, 19, who huddled with other students months ago to choose a spot.So on a balmy Friday evening in May, 90 students boarded charter buses for a ride to  Detroit, one hour away. They sang songs, snapped selfies and held hands with their dates. Some were so eager to arrive that they opened Google Maps on their phones, watching the blue dot as it crawled closer to their destination, a quadruple-decker riverboat.\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Detroit,\u201d said Treveyon, who was crowned prom king that night.\u201cMost of us haven\u2019t been on a boat at all. That was a beautiful experience, to just get on a boat and say, \u2018We\u2019ve been here.\u2019\u201dFor students at Northwestern High, this prom was a chance to set aside anxieties about the city\u2019s three-year-old water crisis, its poverty and its gun violence.It also invited transformations. For the first time as a group, the senior class got dressed up in carefully chosen gowns, suits and glittering necklaces.One female student used the prom as a chance to abandon an old grievance with an estranged family member, asking her to come over and help her get dressed before the evening. One senior said that as he walked onto the riverboat that night, he observed a change in his classmates. Maybe it was the formalwear, he thought, but everybody around him seemed to be acting older, more assured.The night began, appropriately enough, with a promenade.In Flint, it is known as \u201cthe catwalk.\u201dIn the late afternoon, prom-going students gather outside their high school on Flint\u2019s North Side, a mostly African-American section of this city of 99,000. With family and friends in attendance, the promenade, a tradition with roots in 19th-century debutante balls, begins.This school has had ups and downs. In April, administrators announced that Northwestern would lose its stand-alone athletic program next fall and merge with another school across town. But it has also had proud moments:  Barack Obama chose the school as a perch to deliver a speech in the waning days of his presidency.So many people show up for the catwalk each spring that police unfurl tape to separate the audience from the students.\u201cIt\u2019s like a fashion show,\u201d said Leilani Clay, 17, a senior who is planning to attend Eastern Michigan University and hopes to open a dance studio someday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of yelling and screaming. You walk, you stop, and everybody wants to take your picture.\u201dPreparations for prom begin early. Some students at Northwestern High said they arranged their dates more than six months in advance. The most important next step is figuring out what to wear: Most couples choose a color theme and coordinate their ensembles.The boys tend to favor vibrant, bright suits rather than traditional black-and-white tuxedos. Some girls, in the quest for perfection, get their dresses tailor-made.\u201cI feel like you can never be overdressed for prom,\u201d said Destiny Lanehart, 18.On the day of the prom, Corey Edwards, 18, had a nonstop schedule.Pick up his freshly pressed suit from the dry cleaner. Stop by his great-grandfather\u2019s house to borrow cufflinks, a set made of silver with a diamond in the center. Buy a corsage for his date, Ebony Wagner. Get a haircut.Throughout the day, he sipped bottled water.\u201cIt\u2019s just part of life,\u201d said Corey, whose family keeps extra bottled water in the backyard shed for washing hair, brushing teeth, boiling hot dogs for lunch. \u201cWe never even think of using the sink water.\u201dHe is hoping to leave Flint\u2019s problems behind him after the prom and graduation, when he can go off to college. First he plans to enroll in a college in Georgia, near Atlanta, and later, work in sports broadcasting.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to leave Flint, ever since I got older and saw killings on the news,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way my mom raised me, she didn\u2019t want me to be like those kids.\u201dStudents at Northwestern say they have shrugged off old gender traditions surrounding prom. Girls routinely ask boys, for one example. Corey was asked to the prom by Ebony, an on-and-off girlfriend.It was Ebony who decided on their colors, silver and pink. But Corey kept one element of his outfit a surprise until she arrived.\u201cShe was very happy about my shoes,\u201d he said.LaTisha Edwards, Corey\u2019s mother, was there to see her son off, posing for selfies and inspecting his outfit.She has given Corey her blessing to go away to college, though she is apprehensive about him leaving Michigan.\u201cI told her, I\u2019m going to leave, and when I\u2019m successful, I\u2019m going to give back,\u201d Corey said. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight just like we\u2019re fighting now for our water.\u201dAt the prom, Corey said that from the time he stepped onto the riverboat, he felt a change in his classmates.Other than in church on Sundays, he had never seen people dressed up together. They slow-danced with their dates and ate roasted chicken and fettuccine Alfredo from the buffet.His friends, so boisterous in their regular lives, \u201chad kind of a professional attitude\u201d at the prom.\u201cThat\u2019s the crazy thing about it \u2013 everybody was acting different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually was nice. It was like we should just do it every day.\u201dNy Stovall, 18, had every part of her prom experience planned, down to the smallest detail.A dressmaker who works from her home sewed the gown by hand. \u201cWhen I was younger, I always knew what kind of dress I wanted to wear \u2013 a big, poufy, Cinderella kind of dress,\u201d she said.Ny\u2019s cousin, Cameo Paschal, came over to help her get ready for the prom. They had been locked in a silent feud for close to a year, when Ny rebelled at what she called maternal meddling on Cameo\u2019s part.\u201cI told her how I felt and why I hadn\u2019t talked to her,\u201d Ny said. \u201cShe said she understood, and she forgives me.\u201dIn retrospect, Ny admits, she might have needed a little more parenting. She has spent a few stints in juvenile detention for repeatedly running away from home and violating the terms of her probation.Now that she is on the cusp of adulthood, she and her family have become closer. They have accepted the fact that she is in a relationship with a woman, Christal Bowers-Ingram, her date for prom.\u201cI warned everybody ahead of time, if you don\u2019t want to see me with a girl, then don\u2019t come, because I don\u2019t want the negative energy,\u201d Ny said. \u201cThey understand and they don\u2019t necessarily agree with it but they accept it. And they love me for who I am.\u201dNy is determined to leave Flint. Her teachers at Northwestern have helped, encouraging students to go to college in the fall.The prom lived up to her expectations.\u201cThe best part of high school for me was probably prom,\u201d said Ny. \u201cIt\u2019s like a milestone. You know you\u2019re close to being done with high school. Everybody dreams of going to prom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The G.E. Puzzle, and the Pieces a New Chief Will Have to Make Fit", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byJohn Flannery, the new leader at General Electric, has some breathing room. He told G.E. employees on Monday that he would \u201ctake a fresh look at the company\u201d and do so with \u201ca sense of urgency.\u201dMr. Flannery, who will become chief executive on Aug. 1, told Wall Street analysts that his review would be completed by fall.Many investors and analysts are pushing for a smaller, simpler company, which they say would lift earnings and G.E.\u2019s underperforming stock. In a report on Monday, Scott Davis, an analyst at Barclays, declared that \u201cG.E. needs an \u2018AT&T-style\u2019 breakup.\u201dBut as Mr. Flannery examines G.E.\u2019s collection of businesses, he must confront several questions. What is the corporate core? What is less so? What is sure to go? What are unknowns?Here is a look at how the pieces stack up.These are the G.E. heartland operations \u2014 machines representing the most advanced application of the touchstone technologies of the 125-year-old company: materials science and physics.They also exploit what Jeffrey R. Immelt, the departing C.E.O., has termed the emerging \u201cthird pillar\u201d of G.E. technology in the future \u2014 data and smart software.Sensors on a new jet engine, for example, stream data on temperature, fuel consumption, vibration and other measurements so the engine, in its own way, signals that it needs preventive maintenance.Jet engines and power turbines reflect the most lucrative business model for G.E.: an equipment sale that ensures years of revenue from services. The services revenue over the lifetime of a G.E. jet engine, which can be 30 years or more, is eight times the value of the initial engine sale, analysts estimate. That stream of revenue carries high profit margins.The two products use similar technology. A new gas-fired generator for an electrical utility fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit and weighs 950,000 pounds \u2014 and it is essentially a giant, stationary jet engine.Depressed oil prices contributed considerably to the pressure Mr. Immelt felt from shareholders unhappy with G.E.\u2019s profit performance. The price slump battered demand for its oil-field equipment, and operating income in its oil and gas business fell 43 percent last year.Mr. Immelt continued to invest in that business despite the downturn. In October, G.E. announced its plan to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes. It will create a new publicly traded company, and G.E. will pay Baker Hughes shareholders $7.4 billion in a special dividend. The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division approved the deal on Monday, and the European Union gave its O.K. last month.Though in a down cycle, the oil and gas business has characteristics in common with jet engines and power generators. It is heavy equipment that brings in a lot of services revenue, and it lends itself to efficiency gains using sensor data and software.The Baker Hughes deal, analysts say, gives the combined entity a strong lineup of onshore and offshore equipment and services offerings, making it a more attractive property.\u201cIt allows G.E. to make a staged exit from the oil and gas business in the future, if they choose to do so, much as it did with NBCUniversal,\u201d said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, referring to the sale of the media company to Comcast in two steps, in 2011 and 2013.Transportation \u2014 mainly locomotives \u2014 is another heavy-equipment business with solid service revenue. It is not a big business for G.E., but it is a solid one.The health care business combines medical imaging equipment, like CT scanners, and a life sciences business with technologies for use in the fast-growing fields of molecular and precision medicine.That business, analysts say, could be spun out in a few years as a free-standing entity with its own stock, which, if successful, could be valuable not only to shareholders but also as a recruiting tool for luring researchers and a currency for acquisitions.The light bulb is a storied product in G.E. history, but its moment seems to have passed. The company is looking to sell that unit, The Wall Street Journal reported in April, talking to investment banks and seeking a sale of about $500 million.G.E. wants to sell its business in consumer light bulbs and residential LED lighting, but would hold onto a separate business, Current, which supplies commercial LED light and services to cities and companies. That business involves higher-end technology and the sale of energy-management services.Mr. Flannery fully backed Mr. Immelt\u2019s strategy of investing heavily to build up G.E.\u2019s software and data-analysis capability.The future for G.E., Mr. Immelt insisted, is to become a \u201cdigital-industrial company,\u201d with sensor data and software a \u201cthread\u201d for delivering greater efficiency in its factories, products and services.GE Digital, begun in 2011, has been set up as its own unit and employs more than 1,400 people at its headquarters in San Ramon, Calif., east of San Francisco.\u201cJeff Immelt has done a lot at G.E. that he\u2019s not getting credit for now, including the digital strategy,\u201d said Robert Atchinson, a founder and managing director of Adage Capital Management, a fund that holds G.E. shares.\u201cBut we won\u2019t know for two years or so whether these new initiatives pay for themselves.\u201dMr. Davis of Barclays sees the digital strategy as sound but recommends a less costly, less risky approach. A joint venture, he said, \u201cwith someone like Microsoft or Google makes the most sense.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not All Attacks Are Created Equal", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 There is a sickeningly familiar routine to terrorist attacks in Pakistan. If one happens in your city, you get a text message or a phone call asking if you are O.K. What happened? you ask. From that, the caller concludes that you are O.K.. Then you turn on the TV and watch the screen zoom in on a Google map or an animated blast before cameras reach the scene and start beaming images of bloodied slippers.Last Saturday, I went through the same routine during a stay in London. It was a friend in Pakistan who alerted me by text message about the attacks here. As I looked for the TV remote, I got another message from him. \u201cDid you ever think you\u2019d hear about London from Pakistan?\u201dI found the observation slightly upsetting. I wanted to write back: \u201cYou are sitting peacefully in your home in Islamabad. This is not the time to be ironic. There is no irony in carnage.\u201d I didn\u2019t reply, and instead got busy trying to track down my son, who happened to be in the area near where the attack happened. Last year, I sent him off to university in London, calculating this was a safer place than home in Karachi.After I found out that my son was all right, I had time for ironic reflection.I read many stories about loss and valor in Britain, but saw hardly any bloodied Iraqi slippers. Instead of the names and faces of the slain in Kabul, we mostly got tiny bits of security analysis.What gets covered and what gets left behind? I spent too much time when I was at the BBC a decade ago debating with colleagues whether when an attack killed 40 people we should highlight that two of them were British. But it\u2019s the same problem everywhere. When a bomb goes off in Parachinar, in northern Pakistan, it barely gets a couple of minutes on national television.Karachi ignores Kabul\u2019s suffering. Kabul forsakes Kandahar. Kandahar can\u2019t be expected to worry about Mosul. If a terrorist attack happens in London or Paris, we want human interest stories. In the ice cream parlors of Baghdad or the bazaars of Kabul? Statistics will do.Is there a hierarchy of grief? Or is there just too much horror in the world to fit into the news?There are those who trot out solutions. Sure, shut down the mosques, if that would make one iota of difference. Go ahead and close the pubs. While you\u2019re at it, ban hip-hop music and gin and tonics, and take away beards and hijabs. If that\u2019ll make a difference.Some embarrassing conversations, or at least thoughts, already happen within ourselves. Iraqis are relieved that it was a man with connections to Libya who blew up more than 20 people in Manchester. The hearts of Pakistanis sink when they hear that one of the London attackers was born in Pakistan. At least, thank God, he was a British citizen. And thank God my own son is O.K.Then there are the embarrassing conversations we\u2019re not having, or not enough. Like the one about billion-dollar arms deals with Saudi Arabia. Or the one about how while we want to mourn our own dead with dignity, we tend to drown other people\u2019s sorrow in numbers.Mohammed Hanif is the author of the novels \u201cA Case of Exploding Mangoes\u201d and \u201cOur Lady of Alice Bhatti,\u201d and the librettist for the opera \u201cBhutto.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Green described how Lyft instead plans to be involved in multiple partnerships, whether with self-driving software developers like nuTonomy, or with automakers like General Motors, a major Lyft investor.\u201cWe see ourselves as a kind of Switzerland,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think there will be a single player that will win the whole autonomous vehicle game.\u201dFounded in 2013, nuTonomy was spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, last year, raised $16 million in venture capital. NuTonomy has been testing its self-driving software with riders on public roads in Singapore for about a year, and it will begin its pilot program with Lyft in the Boston area, where nuTonomy\u2019s headquarters are, in the coming months.Karl Iagnemma, chief executive of nuTonomy, said he looked forward to working with Lyft, as \u201cboth companies care immensely about solving urban transportation issues and the future of our cities.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their stories risk going untold.\u201cThe purpose is to spread the word about the Stonewall uprising and the progress we have made as well as the distance we have to go,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cAnd it sends a great message to Washington, especially in these times: We celebrate our diversity and cherish it, we don\u2019t shrink from it and we don\u2019t fear it.\u201dOn the night of June 28, 1969, Martin Boyce was at the Stonewall Inn on the gay haven of Christopher Street. Mr. Boyce and other patrons fought back when police arrived for one of their near-nightly stops at the bar, lining up customers and arresting several for what seemed like arbitrary reasons.\u201cThe only place we had to go was Christopher Street,\u201d said Mr. Boyce, now 69 and a chef living in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan. \u201cChristopher Street was the one place you didn\u2019t have to look behind you, it was all your people. Here was the one spot we had \u2014 now raided and ruined.\u201d When the police told a group to disperse, he remembers, that night they advanced instead. \u201cPeople who didn\u2019t even want to do this, they just wanted to be free,\u201d he said.The idea for the project came from William Floyd, Google\u2019s head of external affairs for New York, who lives with his husband in Chelsea and walks past the Stonewall Inn when he takes his young son to school. Unlike some other national monuments, Stonewall commemorates a struggle that continues to evolve, he said.\u201cThis is a living, breathing, active thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Mount Rushmore or a physical natural thing of beauty, it\u2019s civil rights. We thought it was really important that we could provide money and technology to capture those voices and help amplify them.\u201dOne of the voices will probably come from Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt. As a teenager in the \u201960s, he had run away from home in Linden, N.J. Stonewall was a refuge, he said, explaining how he ended up as one of the self-described \u201cstreet kids\u201d who joined the fray that night.\u201cIt happened spontaneously, and it happened mostly because of the civil rights movement in the \u201960s that broke ground before it, and the women\u2019s movement,\u201d said Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt, now 69 and an artist. \u201cThey created a mentality that\u2019s about freedom and being a full person. When we were in the street that night, that exchange of ideas had built up to that point. Everyone became a fighter pretty quick.\u201dThe Stonewall project will join a group of similar initiatives by Google to preserve oral history. In conjunction with the Equal Justice Initiative, a group working to end mass incarceration, Google has funded a project that documents stories of lynching through the descendants of those who were murdered.Though the $1 million donation is significant, the West Village\u2019s gay center still needs to raise money to pay for components of a monument like an informational kiosk in the park. The goal is $2 million, which the Park Foundation is raising. Mr. Floyd said Google\u2019s donation would cover things like the oral history component, a social media platform for visitors to share their stories, and educational aspects, which Google is best suited to support.\u201cMy hope is that we transform the scale and the reach of the Stonewall National Monument from a physical location to really a shared experience,\u201d said Glennda Testone, the executive director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center. \u201cWhat we want to do is make sure that that inspiration and that touchstone is available to everybody, wherever they may live in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But shortly after its article was published, the Justice Department said that the F.B.I. had arrested Ms. Winner at her house in Augusta, Ga., on Saturday. It also said she had confessed to an agent that she had printed out a May 5 intelligence file and mailed it to an online news outlet.The F.B.I. affidavit said reporters for the news outlet, which it also did not name, had approached the N.S.A. with questions for their story and, in the course of that dialogue, provided a copy of the document in their possession. An analysis of the file showed it was a scan of a copy that had been creased or folded, the affidavit said, \u201csuggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space.\u201dThe N.S.A.\u2019s auditing system showed that six people had printed out the report, including Ms. Winner. Investigators examined the computers of those six people and found that Ms. Winner had been in email contact with the news outlet, but the other five had not. In a statement, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, praised the operation.\u201cReleasing classified material without authorization threatens our nation\u2019s security and undermines public faith in government,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are trusted with classified information and pledge to protect it must be held accountable when they violate that obligation.\u201dEspionage Act charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, although conventional leak cases have typically resulted in prison terms of one to three years.Reality Leigh Winner, an intelligence contractor, was charged with sending a classified report about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election to the news media, the Justice Department announced Monday, the first criminal leak case under President Trump.Once rare, leak cases have become far more common in the 21st century, in part because of electronic trails that make it easier for investigators to determine who both had access to a leaked document and was in contact with a reporter. Depending on how they are counted, the Obama administration brought nine or 10 leak-related prosecutions \u2014 about twice as many as were brought under all previous presidencies combined.Both attacks described in the report relied on so-called spear phishing, a tactic that uses spoof emails to trick users into clicking links or opening attachments that then install malicious software on their computers. The G.R.U. sent the emails from two free American web-based email providers, Google\u2019s Gmail and Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com, it said.The first attack, on Aug. 24, involved an attack on an American company \u201cevidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions.\u201dThat attack was most likely successful. The report said the G.R.U. used data most likely obtained from it to conduct the second set of attacks, a \u201cvoter registration themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations.\u201dSpecifically, it said, in late October or early November, the G.R.U. sent to 122 local elections officials emails designed to look as if they were from that company and containing attachments designed to look like an updated system manual and checklist. Opening the attachment would download malicious software from a remote server, the report said.VR Systems\u2019 website said its products were used by jurisdictions in California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. In a statement, VR acknowledged that there had been a problem, while stressing that none of its products dealt with vote marking or tabulation.\u201cWhen a customer alerted us to an obviously fraudulent email purporting to come from VR Systems, we immediately notified all our customers and advised them not to click on the attachment,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are only aware of a handful of our customers who actually received the fraudulent email and of those, we have no indication that any of them clicked on the attachment or were compromised as a result.\u201dThe headline on an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the charge that Reality Leigh Winner is facing.

The Diridon station plan does not immediately address this problem: It calls for office space for 15,000 to 20,000 workers and only 2,500 units of housing, according to the mayor.But through a web of public transportation it could connect Silicon Valley to more affordable areas.By 2025, Diridon station would host Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains and, if fierce opposition by the state\u2019s Republican Congressional delegation is overcome, a high-speed rail line already under construction in the central valley, which would allow someone to live in Fresno and get to San Jose in less than an hour.Diridon station, named after Rod Diridon, a tireless advocate of public transport for the Bay Area and already a hub for Amtrak, Caltrain and San Jose\u2019s light-rail system, will be the \u201clargest intermodal transit hub in the West,\u201d according to the mayor.\u201cThis is very early on,\u201d Mr. Liccardo said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even started dating yet and folks are already talking about the size of the ring.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Stretching across a bend in the Sacramento River, the Tower Bridge serves as the western portal to the city\u2019s downtown.Shelley Green, a reader from Vacaville, shared a photo she captured of the bridge lit up against the night sky.The vertical lift bridge was erected during the Great Depression to relieve transportation pressure in the fast-growing city.Built in the Streamline Moderne architectural style, it became a beacon of civic optimism.Gov.

{"Headline": "G.M. Wants to Drive the Future of Cars That Drive Themselves", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 The chief executive of General Motors, an automaker synonymous with Detroit, saw the future of driving not in the Motor City but on the streets of San Francisco.Mary T. Barra, a G.M. lifer who had worked her way from engineer to the top, was in the back seat of a prototype self-driving electric car as it wound its way through the city\u2019s downtown a year ago.She wanted to see for herself whether automation was ready to take over from a driver \u2014 safely, and on a mass scale. How would it react, for example, when it reached an intersection as a light turned yellow?Driving in a situation like that, \u201cyou have to make a decision,\u201d she recalled in a recent interview. \u201cGenerally if you decide to go, you decide to speed up. Or you stop.\u201d If the technology works, she said, it will make the right decision: \u201cThe car knows.\u201dAfter that drive, Ms. Barra made her own decision to speed up, convinced that such cars were worth betting the company on. Within six months after what she called her \u201caha! moment\u201d in San Francisco, a fleet of self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, the company\u2019s new electric car, was being built at a G.M. assembly plant in Michigan, the pace accelerated at the direction of Ms. Barra and her senior management team.It was a first for any major car company, and the first leg of a race she is determined to win. The question now is whether a company identified with the industry\u2019s bygone glory days can be a trendsetter in 21st-century transportation \u2014 and beat out Silicon Valley rivals like Google, Tesla and Uber with no legacy business to encumber them.\u201cThe auto industry is on the cusp of significant change, and G.M. has to prove that a longtime established player can be up to the task,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst with the car-shopping site Autotrader, who has followed the company since the 1980s. \u201cIf you look at their past performance, their record has been spotty at best.\u201dGeneral Motors is making a big wager that it can succeed, shedding overseas operations while investing $600 million this year in self-driving cars and other advanced technologies. It spent $1 billion on Cruise Automation, a Silicon Valley start-up that developed the driverless technology powering Ms. Barra\u2019s ride in San Francisco.But G.M. is making a case that it can be a leader in the auto industry of both today and tomorrow. \u201cWe are very, very serious and intent on putting something on the road,\u201d Ms. Barra said of the company\u2019s automated vehicles. \u201cWe definitely want to be first.\u201dIn shaping its future, G.M. is betting on products that have yet to gain a foothold in the marketplace and could take years to develop fully.The company is also fending off a campaign by a dissident investor to create two classes of stock, aimed at increasing G.M.\u2019s value to shareholders. One class would pay a steady dividend, while the other would appreciate based on the company\u2019s growth. The fight will culminate on Tuesday at the annual shareholder meeting.In a letter to investors last week, the hedge fund that floated the dual-class proposal, Greenlight Capital, called G.M.\u2019s board \u2014 including Ms. Barra, its chairwoman \u2014 \u201cuninspired\u201d for opposing its proposal. \u201cAfter seven years of a flat stock price, how much longer must shareholders wait?\u201d the letter said.While she agrees the company is undervalued, Ms. Barra insists that G.M.\u2019s performance will ultimately pay off in better returns. \u201cDoes it frustrate me?\u201d she said of the stock price. \u201cYes, but I want to do the right things over the long term to improve the business.\u201dIn beginning to assemble fully automated Bolts in January, G.M. was a step ahead of Google and Uber, which are converting mass-market minivans and sedans into driverless models. It went beyond what Tesla has achieved with autonomous controls on its own models. And it reflected the feverish competition underway.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cWe don\u2019t go in to compete,\u201d Ms. Barra said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go in to have an entry. With every new product we\u2019re doing, we are going in to win.\u201dFor Ms. Barra, 55, who took the helm at G.M. in 2014 as the first female chief executive of a major automaker, it is the latest chapter in the company\u2019s long comeback.Under Ms. Barra, the company weathered that crisis and is moving to become leaner and stronger. It is selling off its money-losing European division and unwinding its operations in other international markets like Australia, India and Russia. It has cut unprofitable sales of vehicles to rental fleets and reduced shifts and workers at some American factories that make slow-selling cars.\u201cG.M. used to constantly talk about where we were going to spend more money,\u201d said Mark L. Reuss, the company\u2019s executive vice president for product development. \u201cWhat we were doing was robbing our good businesses to fix the broken ones.\u201dAs G.M. streamlines operations in the United States and elsewhere, it is redirecting energy and capital to its self-driving initiative.\u201cI do believe General Motors is a tech company,\u201d Ms. Barra said. \u201cWe put these products on the road that integrate 30,000 parts and have hundreds of millions of lines of code in them already. And we have to make them durable and work in all environments.\u201dIts commitment is on display at a sprawling plant in Orion Township, Mich., about a 45-minute drive northwest of Detroit, where the company builds conventional subcompact cars as well as Bolts.One area of the factory is dedicated to a small-scale assembly line where workers customize Bolts with self-driving equipment, including a large computer in the trunk and modules packed with sensors on the roof and fenders.\u201cWe\u2019re on the cutting edge here,\u201d said Bill Rock, a 22-year G.M. veteran who works on the autonomous vehicle line. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated process, but it\u2019s the direction the company needs to go.\u201dG.M. has built about 140 autonomous Bolts to be used for testing in Arizona, California and Michigan by Cruise Automation, now a subsidiary. Kyle Vogt, a founder of Cruise, said G.M. had given its engineers a distinct advantage by building a state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle, rather than retrofitting a conventional car.\u201cThese vehicles coming off the assembly line have been built from the ground up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real car, and not a mash-up of off-the-shelf parts that need to be integrated into the system.\u201dMs. Barra\u2019s view of what G.M. can accomplish was forged in her years as one of its first female plant managers. And she believes G.M. can lead the self-driving revolution without additional acquisitions or partners. \u201cWe have everything we need,\u201d she said.Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a business professor at Yale and a leadership expert who has known most of Ms. Barra\u2019s predecessors dating back decades, is convinced of her resolve. \u201cMary is the right person at the right time, and she does it without an ounce of showmanship,\u201d he said.Ms. Barra methodically directed the company to fix the defective parts, revamp its safety procedures, compensate accident victims and their families and negotiate settlements and fines with regulators and the Justice Department.She says the episode informed her approach to self-driving cars, which she believes herald a new era of road safety, and left her impatient for results. And she says she is determined for G.M. to lead the technological revolution changing the industry.\u201cIf anyone can,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t we be the ones to do it?\u201dAdvertisement"}

But even without Mr. Trump\u2019s support, Silicon Valley is already advancing that agenda \u2014 thanks largely to the marketing prowess of Code.org, an industry-backed nonprofit group.In our tech-driven world, Hadi Partovi argues, computer science has become as essential for students as reading, writing and math. \u201cEncryption is at least as foundational as photosynthesis,\u201d he said.Computer science is also essential to American tech companies, which have become heavily reliant on foreign engineers. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to limit immigration make Code.org\u2019s teach-Americans-to-code agenda even more attractive to the industry.Along the way, Code.org has emerged as a new prototype for Silicon Valley education reform: a social-media-savvy entity that pushes for education policy changes, develops curriculums, offers online coding lessons and trains teachers \u2014 touching nearly every facet of the education supply chain.Mr. Partovi, 44, said he simply wanted to give students the opportunity to develop the same skills that helped him and his backers succeed. He immigrated as a child to the United States from Iran with his family, went on to study computer science at Harvard, and later sold a voice-recognition start-up he had co-founded to Microsoft for a reported $800 million.\u201cThat dream is much less accessible if you are in one of America\u2019s schools where they don\u2019t even tell you you could go into that field,\u201d Mr. Partovi said.Even so, he acknowledged some industry self-interest. \u201cIf you are running a tech company,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s extremely hard to hire and retain engineers.\u201dCode.org is now one of the largest providers of free online coding lessons and more comprehensive computer science curriculums. It has also provided training workshops to more than 57,000 teachers, Mr. Partovi said.The rise of Code.org coincides with a larger tech-industry push to remake American primary and secondary schools with computers and learning apps, a market estimated to reach $21 billion by 2020.Then Mr. Partovi came along with the idea of using a viral video to spark mass demand for the courses.He began by persuading Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, to appear in a short film promoting coding to students. In its first week on YouTube, the video, called \u201cWhat Most Schools Don\u2019t Teach,\u201d racked up roughly nine million views. Within two weeks, Mr. Partovi said, about 20,000 teachers contacted him.Mr. Partovi compared Code.org\u2019s approach to those of start-ups like Airbnb and Uber. \u201cAirbnb is disrupting the travel space, but they don\u2019t own the hotels,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are in a similar model, disrupting education. But we are not running the school and we don\u2019t hire the teachers.\u201dMr. Partovi\u2019s elite connections didn\u2019t hurt.Mr. Partovi, for his part, was hoping to go viral with a message that coding could improve students\u2019 job prospects. Teaching skills that may lead to higher-paying jobs \u201cseems like the kind of idea that everyone in the country can get behind,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi promptly invited Mr. Smith over to preview his celebrity coders video.\u201cWe think computer science is to the 21st century what physics was to the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Smith said.But the movement has also supported legislation that could give companies enormous sway in public schools, starting with kindergarten, with little public awareness.\u201cIt gets very problematic when industry is deciding the content and direction of public education,\u201d said Jane Margolis, a senior researcher at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.The Idaho bill read, in part, \u201cIt is essential that efforts to increase computer science instruction, kindergarten through career, be driven by the needs of industry and be developed in partnership with industry.\u201dWhen a reporter apprised him of the bill\u2019s language, Mr. Smith of Microsoft seemed taken aback, saying he had not endorsed it. \u201cBroad public education should not be grounded first and foremost in the needs of any particular industry \u2014 or in the needs of industry as a whole,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi noted that Code.org had opposed a \u201cmore extreme\u201d coding bill in Florida that would have required students to obtain industry certification. It has also opposed bills that would allow coding courses to count toward foreign-language credits in high schools, he said. Still, Mr. Partovi added, \u201cWe do think that tech companies have a role to play.\u201dThe clout behind computer science has all but obviated a wider debate about whether, to better prepare students, schools might introduce an array of new subjects. It has also overshadowed discussion about whether students would be better off if schools modified traditional math classes to increase the emphasis on fields like statistics.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said that tech companies and philanthropists were simply trying to give voice to an overlooked subject. \u201cWhat we really need is a national conversation about the broad array of intellectual disciplines that will be fundamental to the future of American students,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a broad array, not a single subject.\u201dMr. Partovi concurred. \u201cWe have a lot of debate in this country about how to teach,\u201d he said, \u201cand not enough debate about what to teach.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Whole Foods, Bezos Gets a Sustainably Sourced Guinea Pig", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "State of the ArtBy purchasing the upscale chain, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief, has a chance to tinker with how people buy groceries \u2014 and map the future of the physical store.Supported byWhen big tech companies make big moves, it\u2019s natural to see the news in earthshaking terms.Sure, all of this seems plausible at some point in the future. In particular, an Amazon presence in groceries might transform it from a company you shop at every once in a while to one you think about several times a week. This is not a novel idea: It was the key reason Walmart got into the grocery business in the 1980s, a move that accelerated its shift from a regional chain into the world\u2019s largest physical retailer.Yet if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, after years of watching Amazon, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time predicting future possibilities. He is instead consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer\u2019s eyes. The other thing to know about Mr. Bezos is that he is a committed experimentalist. His main way of deciding what Amazon should do next is to try stuff out, see what works, and do more of that.So the best way to think of this deal is to look at Whole Foods as a kind of guinea pig for Amazon \u2014 a pricey, organically sourced one, perhaps, but a guinea pig all the same.Amazon almost certainly doesn\u2019t know yet how exactly Whole Foods will fit into its long-term plans. You can expect it to make few dramatic changes to Whole Foods in the near future. Instead, Mr. Bezos and his team will most likely spend years meticulously analyzing and tinkering with how Whole Foods works. They will begin lots of experiments. When something works, they will do more of that, then more, and then even more. They may take over the world all the same \u2014 and, in the process, probably usher in big changes to large swaths of the economy, affecting everything from labor to urban planning \u2014 but they\u2019ll do it in ways we won\u2019t be able to predict now.\u201cI think they look at this as an opportunity to learn,\u201d said Venky Harinarayan, an early Amazon executive who later worked at Walmart, and who also ran a venture capital firm in which Mr. Bezos was a big investor. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for everyone \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone has figured out yet how to use a store to service online customers at massive scale. That\u2019s the experimental piece.\u201dIn this light, I suspect that the Whole Foods deal starts less with a strategic end-goal and more with this insight: Shopping for food is broken. Both the in-store experience and the many attempts at online delivery \u2014 from Webvan to Instacart to Amazon\u2019s own service, Amazon Fresh \u2014 have failed to create the sort of seamless buying experience we enjoy with nonfood e-commerce.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.But online grocery delivery also isn\u2019t so great. Delivery services tend to be far more expensive than in-store shopping, and it\u2019s still not quite painless: You have to order ahead of time, you often have to deal with last-minute substitutions, and the whole process is still quite labor-intensive and wasteful. (Ask me about the many pounds of ice-filled plastic bags I have to dispose of every time I shop at Amazon Fresh.)But wait a second, isn\u2019t $13.4 billion a lot for an experiment? Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u201cNo doubt it\u2019s a big deal; it\u2019s a large amount of money,\u201d Mr. Harinarayan said. But he also noted that Amazon is flying high.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Fails E.U. Standard on Removing Hate Speech Online", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byTwitter has failed to meet European standards for removing hate speech online, figures to be published Thursday show, as pressure mounts, particularly on the Continent, for tech companies to do more to tackle such harmful material.The battle between European policy makers and tech companies over what should be permitted online has pitted freedom of speech campaigners against those who say hate speech \u2014 in whatever form \u2014 has no place on the internet.In this standoff, European officials have called on Silicon Valley companies to take down at least 50 percent of the hate speech from their services once they are notified, and they signed up the likes of Twitter, Facebook and Google to a voluntary code of conduct last year to combat the rising tide of harmful content online.But findings to be published by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, show that Twitter removed hate speech from its network less than 40 percent of the time after such content had been flagged to the company.While the social network failed to meet the European standard, it has improved significantly from a study published late last year, which found that it removed a mere 19 percent of hate speech when notified.Google and Facebook, by contrast, now comply with the region\u2019s demands to take down at least 50 percent of hate speech, upon notification, according to the study.\u201cWe embarked in this process together, determined to bring about real changes for people who suffer from hatred and violence online,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European commissioner of justice, consumers and gender equality, said in a statement on Wednesday before the report\u2019s publication. \u201cThe code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online has delivered significant progress.\u201dIn response, Twitter said it had invested in new reporting procedures to allow individuals to flag probable hate speech, and it was striving to balance people\u2019s right to freedom of expression with the need to police material on its network.\u201cOur work will never be \u2018done,\u2019\u201d Karen White, Twitter\u2019s head of public policy in Europe, said in a statement.Google and Facebook also said they had made it easier for organizations and individuals to report hate speech and they were continuing to invest to tackle such material across the region and elsewhere.The European findings were based on about 2,500 potential instances of hate speech recorded by 34 nongovernmental organizations in 24 of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states. These groups notified the tech companies of the possible abuse and recorded how the companies responded.

Just over 50 percent of the notifications were assessed by tech companies within the first 24 hours.While the Pan-European findings were greeted with praise by Ms. Jourova, policy makers in several countries have said that they will take more action against Silicon Valley companies if they do not go further in tackling hate speech online.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whole Foods Deal Shows Amazon\u2019s Prodigious Tolerance for Risk", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byUnlike almost any other chief executive, Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, has built his company by embracing risk, ignoring obvious moves and imagining what customers want next \u2014 even before they know it.Key to that strategy is his approach to failure. While other companies dread making colossal mistakes, Mr. Bezos seems just not to care. Losing millions of dollars for some reason doesn\u2019t sting. Only success counts. That breeds a fiercely experimental culture that is disrupting entertainment, technology and, especially, retail.Mr. Bezos is one of the few chief executives who joke about how much money they\u2019ve lost.\u201cI\u2019ve made billions of dollars of failures,\u201d Mr. Bezos said at a 2014 conference, adding that it would be like \u201ca root canal with no anesthesia\u201d if he listed them.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take bold bets, they\u2019re going to be experiments,\u201d Mr. Bezos explained. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re experiments, you don\u2019t know ahead of time if they\u2019re going to work. Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure. But a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn\u2019t work.\u201dIt is an approach baked into the company since the beginning \u2014 and one that is difficult, if not impossible, for competitors to emulate. Consider how Amazon Web Services began as a small internal cloud computing project to help Amazon\u2019s core business. Then the company started selling excess cloud capacity to other companies.If the cloud computing business just grew, Amazon Prime was a bold bet from the beginning, the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet for shoppers: Pay an annual fee and all shipping costs for the year are covered. Amazon\u2019s shipping expenses ballooned, but revenue soared so much that no one minded.\u201cWhen you have such a long-term perspective that you think in decades instead of quarters, it allows you to do things and take risks that other companies believe would not be in their best interests,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, an analyst with the investment firm Robert W. Baird & Company.Amazon began, for those too young to remember, as a discount internet bookseller in 1995. In the headiness of the late-1990s dot-com boom, it became the symbol of how this new invention called the World Wide Web was going to change everything. Then, like many of the leading dot-com companies, it blew up. The world wasn\u2019t quite ready for Amazon. It came very close to going under.One thing the retailer did not do was make much money. In its two decades as a public company, Amazon has had a cumulative profit of $5.7 billion. For a company with a market value of nearly $500 billion, this is negligible. Walmart, which has a market value half that of Amazon, made a profit of $14 billion in 2016 alone.But the tens of millions of customers do not care whether Amazon is hugely profitable. They care if it is making their lives easier or better.\u201cJeff Bezos is making shopping great,\u201d said Chris Kubica, an e-book consultant and software developer who watches Amazon closely. \u201cHe\u2019s made me come to expect better from every checkout counter. Oh, I can scan my entire shopping cart full of groceries in one go, without stopping, as I roll into the parking lot? Yes, please. Where do I park?\u201dAs Amazon pushes on with its ceaseless experimenting, however, it risks being seen as less of a cute disrupter of the old and as more of a menace. It has hired many workers for its warehouses, but it is also betting heavily on automation. Amazon Go, after all, is an attempt to drain the labor out of shopping.\u201cAmazon runs the risk of becoming too big,\u201d Mr. Kekre said.Some Amazon critics would like the Whole Foods deal to be the trigger for reining in the company. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent foe of Amazon, noted that the company is \u201crapidly monopolizing online retail\u201d and that both Prime and Echo \u201care strategies for locking in consumers and ensuring they don\u2019t shop anywhere else.\u201d Amazon declined to comment for this article.Where will it all end? Mr. Kubica has thought about this. Amazon can be understood as a decades-long effort to shorten the time between \u201cI want it\u201d and \u201cI have it\u201d into as brief a period as possible. The logical end of this would be the something Mr. Kubica jestingly called Amazon Imp, short for \u201cimplant\u201d and also \u201cimpulse,\u201d Mr. Kubica said. It would be a chip inserted under the skin.\u201cThe imp would sense your impulses and desires,\u201d Mr. Kubica wrote in an email, \u201cand then either virtually fulfill them by stimulating your brain (for a modest payment to Amazon, of course) or it would make a box full of goodies for you appear on your doorstep (for a larger fee, of course).\u201dEvery desire fulfilled. \u201cI am sure that Amazon even now is building it,\u201d Mr. Kubica said.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Google Will No Longer Scan Gmail for Ad Targeting", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google plans to abandon its longstanding practice of scanning user email in its Gmail service to serve targeted advertising.Google said it plans to carry out the changes to the Gmail ad policy \u201clater this year.\u201d It will continue to scan Gmail to screen for potential spam or phishing attacks as well as offering suggestions for automated replies to email.The company will continue to serve ads in Gmail, which has more than 1.2 billion users, but it will target those ads based on information it has already gathered from other Google services like search or YouTube, instead of the content of email.\u201cThis decision brings Gmail ads in line with how we personalize ads for other Google products,\u201d Diane Greene, Google\u2019s senior vice president in charge of Google Cloud, wrote in the post.Google introduced Gmail in 2004, and it quickly gained popularity because it offered improved search options and more storage, eliminating the inconvenience of deleting email to stay within capacity limits. Gmail is now the most widely used web email service.But the service has been criticized by privacy advocates for scanning email to generate contextually aware ads. The ads in email bothered users more than other targeted advertising found across the web, because users are more touchy about the privacy of email versus, for example, browsing history.\u201cThis action was driven by concerns from business users \u2014 not regular individuals,\u201d said Seth Schoen, a senior staff technologist from the Electronics Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \u201cSome of the regular people who use Google services disliked the way their email contents were being used to target ads way back in 2004. Yet their concerns couldn\u2019t get much traction until Google became aware 13 years later that some current or prospective paying enterprise customers were uncomfortable with this practice.\u201dThe decision to stop combing email to distribute specific ads in Gmail is a sign of Google\u2019s seriousness in winning over corporate customers to use its internet infrastructure and services. Ads still represent a vast majority of Google\u2019s revenue, but the company sees Google Cloud as a growth area.Google had said its policy was not to target ads in Gmail based on personal information, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial data, and that information extracted from a user\u2019s email will only be used for ads in Gmail. Users may now opt out of receiving personalized ads in Gmail, but they may not opt out of email scanning.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Choosing a Baseball Team for My Baby Daughter", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byOn SportsIn January, my wife gave birth to a fat baby girl, and once the initial panic subsided and I stopped gasping at the sight of any suffocation hazard, I started the earnest yet ultimately doomed process of picking a sports team for the two of us to root for. New fatherhood had triggered a variety of symptoms in me, but none quite as unexpected as a rising thirst for some tradition to share. Because I\u2019m an immigrant short on hallowed rituals, I decided that fandom would be our foundational bond, the thing we could talk about in the idle or tense times to come. This might sound a bit cavemannish, sure, but I was raised in a house with a jock sister who wore gym shorts year round and was better than me at everything. Our father had been an accomplished rock climber back in Korea, and after my sister took to it at a young age, they shared in the enthusiastic technical lingo of pitches, falls and gear that makes climbers such tedious company. Sports talk is the only father-daughter bonding technique I know.The problem was that I didn\u2019t really have a team. When I watch sports these days, I pull for underdogs. But I used to be a Boston sports fan. My indoctrination came at John M. Tobin Elementary School in Cambridge, Mass., and lasted at least through 2004, when Jason Varitek jumped into Keith Foulke\u2019s arms and the Red Sox stormed the field as World Series champions for the first time since 1918. That night I ran out of my studio apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and into the streets. Outside a bar on Broadway, some Columbia students in Red Sox hats were singing \u2018\u2018Sweet Caroline.\u2019\u2019 I joined in and chanted \u2018\u2018Yankees suck\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but the long-awaited catharsis never followed.I\u2019m not fully sure why, but I suspect it had to do with the fact that I don\u2019t really look like a Red Sox fan. This wasn\u2019t a problem during childhood, but once I got to college in Maine, I began to realize that I was a curiosity among the prep-school kids with their very specific assumptions about where Red Sox fans come from. Over the next decade, my hesitation gave way to resentment, and I now loathe Boston fandom for its parochialism, the blathering on about history and the deep-seated belief that rooting for Tom Brady through all the team\u2019s scandals counts as an act of civil disobedience equal to that of those Massachusetts forebears who threw crates of tea into Boston Harbor.I want my daughter to live without that sort of angst. So even before she was big enough to fit into anything but a swaddling cloth, I bought her a onesie with the New York Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard\u2019s name and number on the back and decided, somewhat haphazardly, that we would root for the Mets. The reasoning was pretty simple: We live in New York, and I wanted her to feel the sense of belonging to a place that fandom can bring. I limited my search to baseball because it\u2019s the major sport that feels most local, but also because I have no lingering nostalgia for my early days as a Patriots and Celtics fan. And I wanted her to suffer through losing and disaster, because those things, when leavened with perspective, can be funny. When Syndergaard went on the disabled list just days after the onesie arrived in the mail, I thought we were off to a great start.But a couple of weeks later, I began to wonder why I was letting geography circumscribe my choices. Streaming video would enable my daughter to watch any team\u2019s games whenever she wanted, and online fan communities could provide a moderated alternative to the neighborhood bar. I was remembering how, a few years ago, a friend and Arsenal fan tried to find an English Premier League team for me to support. Because I have no opinions about England or even soccer, really, I told him that I would simply root for the club with the most diverse fan base. When he told me this was definitely Arsenal, though, I balked \u2014 everyone I know who roots for a soccer team roots for Arsenal.So I settled on the place I would most like to visit. Swansea City in Wales has a small surf scene with gentle waves for a kook like me, and a hasty, perhaps misleading Google search suggested to me that there were fewer incidents of racism among its fan base than those of other clubs. That is how I became a Swansea supporter for a very pleasant year, until I stopped caring about European soccer altogether. The idea of Swansea fandom was too abstract: I hold no real animus toward Cardiff City, Swansea\u2019s Welsh rival; my father did not sing Swansea supporter anthems with his father. Self-interest and politics haven\u2019t been enough to make me care.My parents came to this country as immigrants with a vision of assimilation; our trips to Fenway to see the Red Sox were meant to make me comfortable in Ameri\u00adcan settings where we might be the only ones like us there \u2014 and also to normalize the sight of a Korean immigrant and his son cheering on the home team. Since then, I\u2019ve always been drawn to any subculture in which acceptance seems to require no more than buying a T-shirt (hence my Phish and Grateful Dead phases), and while much of my adulthood has been spent questioning my family\u2019s blind optimism about acculturation, I still believe sports are best enjoyed without too much thought.Choosing the Dodgers felt too considered and preachy. When my daughter is confronted by some future date, boss or stranger with the question \u2018\u2018Why are you a Dodgers fan?\u2019\u2019 I didn\u2019t want her answer to be: \u2018\u2018Well, take a look at this census report. As you can see, more than 100,000 Koreans live in Los Angeles.\u2019\u2019 The only answers likely to make sense \u2014 especially if she ends up not caring about sports deeply and wants to quickly move the conversation onto another topic \u2014 are \u2018\u2018I was born there\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018My family is from there.\u2019\u2019 My wife is from Newport, R.I., which meant that the only two baseball options for us were the Mets and the Red Sox.So, at least as long as these things are under my influence, my daughter will be a Red Sox fan as her mother and her feckless father once were. A lapsed tradition that goes back to the mid-1980s \u2014 my first memory, as it happens: Paul Molitor, then of the Milwaukee Brewers, hitting a leadoff home run in Fenway Park as my father and I walked to our seats \u2014 will be revived and passed along to my daughter. Of course, fandom, like any inheritance, does not have to be accepted or embraced. I can imagine any number of happy accidents or family relocations that might lead to her rooting for the Cubs, Yankees, Mariners or whomever. If that happens, I\u2019ll follow her lead, because my own roots, both in fandom and in the country, are shallow. My own hang-ups have made it difficult for me to fully invest in a place and a culture, and I\u2019m excited about not really knowing where she may take our family. Should she reject the Red Sox and become inspired by the United States women\u2019s national soccer team or the New York Liberty, or even if her interest in sports never goes beyond her own play, and I spend my afternoons driving her from practice to practice, her choices will become our family traditions, and, by extension, her birthright.Jay Caspian Kang is a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Lesson: Silicon Valley\u2019s Start-Up Machine Needs Fixing", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtWhat happened at Uber is an indictment of everyone who enabled Mr. Kalanick\u2019s worst tendencies and practices, which is just about everyone in a position of power at the ride-hailing company and its funders. In other words, this was systemic. Top to bottom, Uber was a failure of Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up machine.And if we want Silicon Valley to create better start-ups \u2014 which we should, for everyone\u2019s sake \u2014 the Valley would be wise to now examine Uber\u2019s entrails and find another way.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.But there was a crowd standing behind him, too.First, this was a clear failure of oversight \u2014 of investors, boards of directors, partners and anyone else who could have altered Uber\u2019s course and clearly failed to do so. Overlearning the lesson of Steve Jobs\u2019s first fall at Apple \u2014 and of founder-led hyper-successes at Google and Facebook \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s investors created a culture where founders are given carte blanche, their pronouncements and tactics elevated to the level of divine infallibility.A convenient excuse. And, in retrospect, a bad strategy. If Uber had been forced to go public sooner \u2014 if it couldn\u2019t raise billions at the drop of a hat from the likes of Saudi Arabia \u2014 it would have opened itself up to much-needed scrutiny and potential reform. Staying private created a hothouse that reinforced its worst side, and allowed it to delay building a sustainable culture with a focus on long-term interests.How might Uber have created such a culture? First, by admitting that founders are not infallible, and recognizing that the most successful ones do best when their impulses are hemmed in by trusted lieutenants, mentors and firm boards of directors.Fun fact: Mr. Jobs didn\u2019t want to create a Windows-compatible version of the iPod or an app store for the iPhone; it was his lieutenants who pushed him to do it. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and the Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were guided by strong, experienced and extremely sober operators \u2014 Sheryl Sandberg and Eric Schmidt, respectively. Mr. Kalanick, meanwhile, was allowed to operate more or less solo, to micromanage a company that grew to enormous scale, and was left alone even when the firm\u2019s problems became plain to see.Finally, this was a failure driven by plain greed, of ends justifying means.Over the next few days you may hear a revisionist defense of Uber and Mr. Kalanick that will go like this: Uber was fighting an entrenched and monopolistic cabal \u2014 taxi companies and their captured regulators \u2014 so it had to act more like a wolf than a sheep. Related to that, you will hear this: Uber is good for the world. If it wins, it will reduce car ownership, drive up fuel efficiency, reduce traffic, lower the cost of transportation, probably reduce accidents, almost certainly save lives.In every Uber story I write, I get to a paragraph that aims to succinctly note all the recent scandals at the company. What\u2019s notable about this paragraph is how many different kinds of problems there are to put down.It didn\u2019t have to be like this. Yes, business ain\u2019t beanbag; yes, fighting the incumbent businesses requires a strong stomach. But there were so many different problems at Uber that you\u2019d have to be comically na\u00efve to conclude they all stemmed from an intransigent rival.No, there was something much more deeply amiss here \u2014 and everyone put in their money anyway, because, hey, Uber was growing very quickly, so why not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raising of Spirits", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "Supported byWordplayWEDNESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Upon my word, I had fun figuring out today\u2019s puzzle. By midweek, there\u2019s an expectation that either the theme or the fill entries or both will be a bit harder than the early week puzzles, and while there are things that I suspect some solvers will struggle with all across the age spectrum, it\u2019s ultimately very doable.And goodness gracious, the payoff in Mr. Zhou\u2019s revealer is terrific.Mr. Zhou offers us a set of five works of art as theme entries that have something in common: They are all BY someone named GEORGE, which is wrapped up nicely in his revealer as the exclamation \u201cBY GEORGE.\u201dFor example, the \u201c1977 Lucas film\u201d is \u201cSTAR WARS,\u201d by GEORGE Lucas, and the \u201c2010 Bush autobiography\u201d is \u201cDECISION POINTS,\u201d by former President GEORGE W. Bush. As Mr. Zhou notes, I also enjoyed the fact that he was able to get a female GEORGE in there: Mary Ann Evans\u2019s nom de plume was GEORGE Eliot, and she was the author of the novel \u201cMIDDLEMARCH.\u201d\u25a0 30A: Another GEORGE (Gershwin) wrote one of my favorite Jazz Age pieces, \u201cRHAPSODY IN BLUE.\u201d\u25a0 1D: Clues in brackets are unvoiced exclamations. \u201c[Warning, explicit content]\u201d is an unvoiced synonym for N.S.F.W., or \u201cNot Safe For Work.\u201dI only hope that the quaint, slightly out-of-the-Ark feel of the revealer elicits a chuckle. With the theme juxtaposed against some rather fresh fill, like NSFW, CHABAD, FRITO PIE, BOOYA and GOOGLE IT, the puzzle seems to me to approach a nice balance between classic and trendy. Yes, there are some choices in short fill I wouldn\u2019t normally make, but the slew of newish-feeling entries, given the straightforwardness of the theme, seemed worth it.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

We are on the verge of a weekend of nail-biting anticipation, at least among a certain crowd. This coming Monday evening is the Council of Fashion Designers of America\u2019s annual awards, a.k.a. the Oscars of the U.S. fashion industry. Did you even know it was happening? Get ready: It may have more of an impact on you than you might think.Over the last few years, the CFDA has been gradually upping the celeb-and-promotional factor of the awards, which (let\u2019s be honest) have in the past had a tendency to feel a bit like a high school prom, only with better clothes. The same designers tend to get nominated for the same awards: For example, this year, four of the five names on the list for homecoming king \u2014 sorry, women\u2019s wear designer of the year \u2014 have already won, sometimes more than once, and the fifth won the international designer of the year award when he was at another house. Every year I can\u2019t help but think: Get a little imagination, people.Well, be careful what you wish for. While the same fashion names may be on the roster next week, they are dressed up (pardon the pun) with a lot of big-tent, boldface-name glam, picked to appeal to a pretty broad demographic, including those who may not think that much about designers, but know a lot about movies, politics and late-night TV. Which might possibly include you.Nicole Kidman will be handing out an award; ditto Kerry Washington, Paris Jackson (whose fashion rise is kind of a fascinating story unto itself \u2014 give her an award for strategy!) and Jon Bon Jovi. Seth Meyers, who has a strangely codependent relationship with the industry (Google \u201cAnna Wintour on \u2018Late Night\u2019\u201d), is the host. Gloria Steinem, Cecile Richards and Janelle Monae are getting a special tribute. You see what I mean.Expect photos coming soon to a people page near you. Which may in turn inspire a sudden fluency during your next dinner party with such nominated names as Raf Simons, the savior of Calvin Klein, and Virgil Abloh, founder of Off/White and Kanye West\u2019s creative director, among others. It\u2019s the trickle-down effect in action.To prepare, here are some classic Times pieces on the nominees and why they matter. Though if you\u2019ve had quite enough of all that, there\u2019s lots more, from an inside look at the Gucci cruise show in Florence to a post-mortem on the demise of Bleecker Street. Happy reading!Raf SimonsMary-Kate and Ashley OlsenIrene NeuwirthRick OwensGabriela HearstMonseThe reason I list all those women, however, is that I think they all wear their pearls in different ways: Mrs. Obama wears hers with a bit of postmodern irony and fun; Ivanka Trump wears hers as symbols of great primness and propriety; Mrs. Clinton and Ms. May wear theirs as badges of femininity. What their examples demonstrate is it\u2019s all in the combination \u2014 not the age. To make a traditional strand of pearls seem less staid, wear them with a less traditional outfit: a trouser suit, for example, or even a T-shirt, as opposed to a simple cocktail frock. Maybe a shirt or a dress with a vivid, digitized pattern, to add some modernity to the look. Oversize costume pearls can add attitude to a classic LBD. And so on. The point is: Don\u2019t think retirement. Think reframing. With pearls, as with life these days. \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMANAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: \u2018The End of Advertising\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "Supported byQ. and A.Andrew Essex believes that \u201cthe end of advertising as we know it\u201d is \u201csomewhere between five minutes and five years\u201d away. That\u2019s what this former chief executive of the influential creative agency Droga5 writes in \u201cThe End of Advertising: Why It Had to Die, and the Creative Resurrection to Come\u201d (Spiegel & Grau).\u201cLife is better without bad ads,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s simply irrefutable.\u201d Consumers have increasingly effective ways to avoid ads, and an entire generation has been raised with a different expectation of how \u2014 and how often \u2014 it will have its viewing, reading or listening interrupted. Yet brands still spend vast amounts of money in diverse ways to promote their products, and entire industries (like journalism) are struggling with how to replace traditional ad revenue. (In fact, in the past Essex has done consulting work for The New York Times Company.) These sea changes are the subject of Essex\u2019s highly opinionated treatise. Below, he talks about how this era of television has inspired him, the origin stories of aspirin and heroin, and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?I got the idea after spending a summer making compost. I had left my previous job after 10 years to recharge my batteries: driving kids to camp, making compost and trying to write a book. It just seemed that it was time to reflect on the state of advertising. It was around the time \u201cMad Men\u201d went off the air and ad blocking started to enter into the public discourse.What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?That history repeats itself. We had invented the \u201ccorrect way\u201d to advertise, then took a 50-year detour pursuing a model that, in retrospect, seems kind of insane. For the past 50 years, we\u2019ve essentially pursued a model called \u201ccommand and control,\u201d which is to interrupt people in the rudest possible way with something they didn\u2019t ask to see, which is most exemplified by interrupting a TV program at a moment of great interest to show you a 30-second toilet-paper spot.But that model of adjacency is irrelevant and increasingly superfluous in a world in which there is so much content. Years ago, brands were making the thing. Not the thing that interrupts the thing. The old model was General Electric Theater; the new model is \u201cThe Lego Movie,\u201d and that\u2019s the same thing \u2014 making things people want to see, and adding value to their lives, as opposed to making something they actively don\u2019t want to see.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I wanted to write a book about the untold story of the dual origin story of aspirin and heroin. The company Bayer is famous for inventing aspirin in 1898, which is arguably one of the world\u2019s most beloved brands, and for good reason. But I was surprised to learn that just two weeks earlier, the same three guys who gave the world aspirin also created Bayer\u2019s other big brand, heroin, which was marketed for about eight years as the world\u2019s best cough medicine. This is a true story, and that seemed to me a perfect metaphor for advertising\u2019s ongoing tension between authenticity and artifice. But all the protagonists are dead, and Bayer won\u2019t talk about it.It was originally a book about unintended consequences and origin stories. So that theme never really changed. But the news kept staying ahead of the book, which had the unintended consequence of making it even more relevant than I intended. Fake news came along, and that seemed relevant to this rapidly shifting role of advertising in the culture. Google and Safari added ad-blocking software. Advertisers found out that YouTube videos with racist and terrorist content were adjacent to prominent A-list advertisers, in a context that the advertisers didn\u2019t want.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read the book in less than 50 words.It\u2019s the only place where you can learn about the origins of heroin and Ivory soap and the future of the internet in one tight little 200-page package. And also, hardcover is the new black.This interview has been condensed and edited.Advertisement"}

It was a very different message from the one the president delivered hours earlier at the White House, where he warned that the international climate pact would cost the American economy too much.\u201cTo some, Pittsburgh is still the 1975 Pittsburgh, a steel mill town based on heavy industry, still struggling through the post-Depression,\u201d said Mr. Peduto, a Democrat, when asked why he thought the president had singled out his city (particularly in light of its reliably liberal politics). \u201cI also think it\u2019s the first city they thought of that started with a \u2018P\u2019.\u201dEnding the day at Cappy\u2019s Cafe, a tavern he frequents in the city\u2019s Shadyside neighborhood, Mr. Peduto said he was angry enough when he heard about the president\u2019s plans to withdraw from the climate agreement. When he heard that the president had mentioned Pittsburgh, he said, he was \u201clivid.\u201dBy citing the city, Mr. Trump seemed to be reaching for a stereotype of a coarse industry town where workers would cheer the return of coal (and where they might also scoff at the comparison to Paris). But many are no longer waiting for old industry to return. And Pittsburgh has joined with international cities, Paris included, to commit to reducing its own emissions.If anything, the city today stands to be affected more by Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to repeal the Affordable Care Act than by his promises to revive the steel and coal industries.\u201cThe economy looks more like Boston than it does Gary, Ind.,\u201d said George Fechter, who was chief executive of the McGowan Center for Artificial Organ Development at the University of Pittsburgh. He called the president\u2019s comments \u201cabsolutely outrageous,\u201d adding \u201che doesn\u2019t represent the people of Pittsburgh.\u201dPittsburgh\u2019s transformation from a steel town to a center of \u201ceds and meds\u201d has been visible even on the city\u2019s streets.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I watched soot come off the buildings \u2014 the buildings turned from black to beige while I lived there,\u201d said Richard Florida, an urban economist who has championed the emerging knowledge economy in cities like Pittsburgh. He taught at Carnegie Mellon and lived in the city from the late 1980s through the early 2000s. \u201cIt\u2019s not the typical down-in-the-dumps Rust Belt town. It\u2019s still in the midst of a transformation, but it looks like it has turned a corner.\u201dPerhaps no place has come to represent Pittsburgh\u2019s shift from heavy industry to high tech more starkly than the East Liberty neighborhood, which has seen almost unrelenting redevelopment. The neighborhood now has a Whole Foods; Pittsburgh Google moved its office here from Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s campus in 2010; and the Ace Hotel opened in an old Y.M.C.A. building in 2015.Shashank Laxminarayan Suresh, 28, a native of India who works in the data science department at the health care provider Highmark, said he had found Pittsburgh friendly and welcoming. He lives in the city\u2019s Squirrel Hill neighborhood.\u201cThere is so much opportunity in the technology fields here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to help you here, and I have never had anyone who was unkind to me because I am an immigrant.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s a very happening place!\u201dHadley Pratt, 26, works at BoXZY, a 3D printing company housed in a former Westinghouse building, once a mainstay of Pittsburgh\u2019s heavy industry. While meeting a friend for a drink at the Ace Hotel, she said Trump\u2019s picture of Pittsburgh was incomplete.\u201cTo me it was a big slap in the face,\u201d she said. \u201cPittsburgh is still industrial, but there\u2019s a lot of innovation here. None of it was done through Trump-type policies.\u201d If she were to give Trump a tour of the \u201creal\u201d Pittsburgh, Pratt said she\u2019d take him to \u201cindustrial areas revitalized through progressive organizations; we have that all over Pittsburgh.\u201dState Representative Dan B. Frankel, a Democrat who represents part of the city, used Facebook to post an old photograph of a smog-laden daytime Pittsburgh.\u201cTrump apparently wants to take Pittsburgh back to this,\u201d Mr. Frankel wrote. \u201cWe won\u2019t go back.\u201dThe city\u2019s concerns about pollution become a powerful political force around the time of the 1940 photograph that Mr. Frankel posted. In the 1940s, Mayor David L. Lawrence used an inaugural address to declare that he was \u201cconvinced that our people want clean air.\u201d An air quality ordinance was approved in 1949.But even with Pittsburgh widely viewed as a place on the rise today, residents still find themselves trying to distance and disentangle their city\u2019s reputation from its past.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since the steel industry collapsed,\u201d said Sam Williamson, a labor organizer who is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. \u201cPittsburghers have for a very long time \u2014 probably because of our early 20th-century history, which sticks in people\u2019s minds \u2014 taken very seriously the challenges of maintaining a strong economy while not destroying our environment at the same time. Those two things are not irreconcilable.\u201dMr. Williamson allowed that Mr. Trump\u2019s comment could have been \u201ca case of careless alliteration,\u201d but he also questioned the president\u2019s approach to environmental and economic policy.Michael Huber, a driver for Uber in the city, voted for Mr. Trump. If he had the president in his car, he said, he\u2019d drive him through the Fort Pitt Tunnel to catch the view of the city, and show him around Oakland where the universities are.\u201cDiversity in Pittsburgh is enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a coal town. We were, and we were great at it. But we\u2019re not anymore.\u201dKim Lyons reported from Pittsburgh, Emily Badger from San Francisco and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Decline of the Baronial C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Corporate giants once had all-powerful chiefs with domains to match. But activist investors and technological change are remaking the executive suite.Supported byFAIRFIELD, Conn. \u2014 They bestrode the business world, or at least the suburban corporate campus, like a colossus.Sitting behind burnished wooden desks, in glass-walled corner offices like the one Jeffrey R. Immelt occupied at General Electric\u2019s former headquarters here, a select group of American chief executives were once more akin to statesmen than businessmen.G.E. moved out of this sprawling Skidmore, Owings & Merrill-designed emblem of 1970s corporate modernism in favor of smaller, humbler digs in downtown Boston last year. And last week, Mr. Immelt unexpectedly announced plans to retire after 16 years in the top job, amid a sagging stock price and pressure from activist investors.General Electric is just the latest storied name in corporate America to show its leader the door. Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, had been in the job for less than three years when he was fired in late May. Two weeks earlier, Mario Longhi of U.S. Steel abruptly stepped down.With these departures, the American era of the baronial chief executive, sitting atop an industrial dominion with all the attendant privileges, is drawing to a close.It is one consequence of a transformed economic landscape in which many of the mega-corporations that defined 20th-century commercial life are confronting a host of new business and technological challenges. These changes \u2014 in corporate leadership, on boards and across Wall Street \u2014 are recasting the very idea of industry in America.\u201cThe C.E.O. with a big office, a tenure of 10 or 20 years, in a suit and tie, is becoming a thing of the past,\u201d said Vijay Govindarajan, who served as G.E.\u2019s chief innovation consultant in 2008 and 2009 and now teaches at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business.Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit from G.E. is particularly telling, given the company\u2019s reputation as a training ground for the future chief executives of other companies. He tried to change G.E., yet couldn\u2019t react quickly enough to the forces affecting companies like his.These include the rising power of activist investors, who buy up stakes in companies and then demand changes. Activists are now hunting much bigger game, demanding double-digit annual earnings growth in a stagnant economy. Or else.That deal also shows how the digital age has upended the competitive landscape, pitting companies in vastly different industries against one another.\u201cWho ever thought Ford would be competing with Google?\u201d said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who has studied corporate leadership for decades. \u201cBut they are, and Mark Fields wasn\u2019t moving fast enough.\u201dBoards, too, have changed, evolving from country-club-like collections of the same familiar faces into a much more diverse and demanding constituency.To be sure, the money is better than ever. And pockets of unbridled ambition and occasional excess remain, especially in Silicon Valley, where Apple\u2019s new $5 billion spaceshiplike headquarters opened in April.But for most of the Fortune 500, the unquestioned power and perks, the imperviousness to criticism from the likes of shareholders, and the outsize public profile that once automatically came with the corner office have gone the way of the typewriter and the Dictaphone.\u201cThese people were bigger than life, and I saw it up close,\u201d said Kevin Sharer, a former chief executive of Amgen who worked as a top aide to Mr. Immelt\u2019s legendary predecessor at G.E., Jack Welch. \u201cThey were a combination of chief executive, statesman and rock star. They were unassailable.\u201dA Naval Academy graduate, then an officer, before joining G.E. in 1984, Mr. Sharer said the only place that evoked a feeling of power comparable to the long hallways and corner offices of Fairfield in its prime was aboard the fast attack nuclear submarines where he once served as chief engineer.\u201cWe had the confidence, the swagger, and we felt like we had unlimited industrial potential,\u201d he said. \u201cCould we buy RCA or NBC? Of course we could. I\u2019m not complaining, but this is absolutely not the case today.\u201dAs Amgen\u2019s chief executive in the spring of 2009, Mr. Sharer visited the White House repeatedly to meet with Obama administration officials as they designed what would become the Affordable Care Act. He also played a key role in getting fellow pharmaceutical industry chiefs to support the legislation.Now retired and teaching at Harvard Business School, Mr. Sharer said he would never do that today, as wading into bitterly partisan public debates offers little upside for corporate leaders, and risks damage to their company\u2019s reputation.As a result, while companies in many ways have more economic and political power than ever, \u201cchief executives now shy away from weighing in on the policy level or broader societal issues,\u201d Mr. Sharer said. \u201cThey\u2019re more focused on running their companies.\u201dThere are exceptions. Besides Mr. Immelt\u2019s outspokenness on the climate issue, last year Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck called out \u201cbad actors\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry for exorbitant price increases. Timothy D. Cook of Apple challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed immigration restrictions in January.Still, Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit leaves a void at the intersection of business and public policy, along with the retirement this year of Douglas R. Oberhelman, the Caterpillar chief who led both the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers.\u201cIf you start fooling around in Washington with the Business Roundtable or writing op-eds, activist investors will ask what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Useem said.\u201cI don\u2019t see him stepping into that role,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep his head down and focus on the numbers.\u201dAt Exxon Mobil, it\u2019s referred to as the God Pod. On the 11th floor of Procter & Gamble\u2019s headquarters in Cincinnati, there was Mahogany Row. And while the official name of the executive wing at G.E.\u2019s Fairfield headquarters was E3, inside the company it was known as Carpet Land.And no wonder. From the Persian rugs that lined the hallways to the plush wool floor covering in Mr. Immelt\u2019s office and private conference room, the carpets created the hushed atmosphere of a monastery or library.\u201cIt was so quiet, you could feel the energy drain out of you,\u201d said Ann Klee, the G.E. executive who oversaw the move to Boston and the development of its new headquarters there.What these executive aeries all shared was an Olympus-like sense of remoteness, authority and defined hierarchy.At G.E., even in Carpet Land, office size grew in lock step with rank, and the biggest corner space was reserved for the chief executive. Not only did Mr. Immelt have his own bathroom, but his two administrative assistants had a private bathroom and a pantry.The abundant perks \u2014 in G.E.\u2019s case, two helicopter pads, a shoeshine station and an executive dining room linked to the kitchen below by dumbwaiters \u2014 fed the sense of exalted status. At the same time, faster economic growth and rising earnings camouflaged the cost of these indulgences.With G.E.\u2019s profits and shares soaring in the 1980s, Mr. Welch oversaw the construction of a private 28-room hotel known as the Guest House to serve visiting executives and others, with no expense spared on the parquet floors, wood-burning fireplaces and a Steinway piano, which was left behind when the company moved out.\u201cNothing was off-the-shelf,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Brien, a 19-year G.E. veteran who helped supervise the Fairfield facility. \u201cWith Jack Welch, everything was custom and the operation was five star, spot on.\u201dAlmost 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001 and Mr. Immelt took over, G.E. shares have never regained their 2000 peak. So while Mr. Immelt successfully steered the company through a near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis, refocused it on its industrial roots and shed its ancillary businesses, it became a natural target for activist investors.One of those was Nelson Peltz, a onetime corporate raider who relied on Michael R. Milken\u2019s junk bonds for financing back when Mr. Welch was building his Guest House. Mr. Peltz has come a long way since then, having scored big wins forcing laggards like Heinz and Wendy\u2019s to improve their performance, and he acquired a $2 billion stake in G.E. in 2015.G.E.\u2019s chief communications officer, Deirdre Latour, denied that activist pressure was a factor in Mr. Immelt\u2019s decision to retire. \u201cSixteen years is a long time,\u201d she said.But at 61, Mr. Immelt is four years younger than Mr. Welch when he stepped down, and joins a long list of otherwise respected executives whose stately succession plans were seemingly interrupted by impatient investors.\u201cC.E.O. tenure is down from the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, and the G.E. situation is a reflection of that,\u201d said Jason D. Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201cWithout this outside pressure, it\u2019s likely Jeff Immelt would have served out his term and retired at 64 or 65.\u201dNow other chief executives are feeling the same pressure, including Mary T. Barra of General Motors. \u201cShe\u2019s being pulled in different directions,\u201d Mr. Schloetzer said, noting that G.M.\u2019s shares have barely budged in the last two years, even as the broader stock market has soared.If Ms. Barra can\u2019t turn things around in 12 to 18 months, Mr. Schloetzer said, she could share a fate similar to that of Mr. Fields at Ford.Indeed, Mr. Fields\u2019s defenestration was more shocking in many ways than Mr. Immelt\u2019s slow-motion fade, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management.\u201cHe\u2019s the poster child for what\u2019s happened to the C.E.O. job,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cUntil last month, people thought dynastic family capital like the Ford family was the solution to rampant short-termism. I\u2019m sorry Ford forgot that recipe.\u201dHow did activist investors acquire such outsize power over publicly traded companies?\u201cWith fewer public companies out there, any one of them is more likely to become a target of interest for one hedge fund or another,\u201d Mr. Slaughter said.At the same time, activists are getting more, well, active. More than 300 American companies were targeted by these investors in 2015, up from just over 100 in 2010, according to Mr. Useem of Wharton. They\u2019re also becoming more successful at winning board seats, as fewer companies stagger their board elections over three-year cycles.What\u2019s more, chief executives have less internal latitude. In 2001, more than half of new C.E.O.s also assumed the position of chairman when they took over. By 2016, only 10 percent occupied both roles, according to an analysis by Strategy&, the strategy and consulting arm of PwC.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the C.E.O. running the board too,\u201d said Gary L. Neilson, a principal with Strategy&. \u201cNow the C.E.O. has a boss.\u201dBoards themselves have changed, Mr. Sonnenfeld added. A few decades ago, a Pittsburgh-based giant like U.S. Steel would draw board members from a local pool of business and community leaders.\u201cThere was a downside in terms of cronyism, mutual back-scratching and a hesitance to criticize,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positive was that they were anchored in their communities and they invested in them. Now, for C.E.O.s, all the constituencies have changed.\u201dSo while boards are still willing to dole out huge golden parachutes to C.E.O.\u2019s, even if they fail, they\u2019ve become much more generous with money than they are with additional time.The glaring exception to the trends outlined by Mr. Sonnenfeld is in the technology sector. But in many ways, these firms are the exception that proves the rule, because they play by different rules.Facebook also has a multi-class stock structure that effectively guarantees that the founder Mark Zuckerberg will retain control even as he sells shares. And on this point, the company offers no apologies.The staggering profitability of the tech giants provides their leaders with more than a little of the swagger the industrial executives once possessed.In 1990, the revenues of Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers totaled $250 billion while they employed 1.2 million people, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.Silicon Valley\u2019s top three companies in 2014 had almost the same revenues before adjusting for inflation \u2014 $247 billion \u2014 but with 137,000 employees, they required a work force just one-tenth the size.That kind of efficiency adds up to huge profits, soaring stock prices and few complaints from investors. Or as Brooks C. Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown, put it, \u201cIf your stock is doing well, your job is safe.\u201dIf the old quarters for G.E.\u2019s top brass were akin to a pedestal, the new ones are more like a fishbowl. At G.E.\u2019s interim headquarters in Boston, and in the permanent one set to open next year, the offices for top leaders have glass walls that enable them to see out and, in turn, let employees see in.They are also much smaller. In Fairfield, a handful of senior G.E. leaders and their assistants occupied 44,000 square feet in the executive wing. Now the same group shares a total of just 7,800 square feet, less space than in the big mansions many C.E.O.s inhabit in places like Greenwich, Conn., or the Bay Area.\u201cIt has a much more collaborative feel, and the glass replicates the transparency of working together,\u201d said Ms. Klee, the G.E. executive. \u201cThe Fairfield campus was beautiful, but it lacked the spark you feel here. It\u2019s a different time, and we like the power and energy and creativity that comes from mixing people together.\u201dG.E.\u2019s 66-acre Fairfield campus was purchased for $31.5 million last fall by Sacred Heart University, according to Michael J. Kinney, the school\u2019s senior vice president for finance and administration.\u201cThere\u2019s not as big a need for corporate headquarters like this any more,\u201d said Mr. Kinney, who as a Kraft executive once worked in a similarly spectacular setting in the Taj Mahal-like General Foods building in Rye Brook, N.Y. \u201cThose were the days.\u201dMr. Kinney has big plans to convert the old offices into classrooms, a business incubator space and a computer engineering center, among other things. Students will be trained in hospitality at the former Guest House.As a result, the university has kept the campus in pristine condition since the last G.E. executives left. \u201cThe only things missing are the Persian rugs and the artwork,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who now serves as Sacred Heart\u2019s director of facilities.\u201cIt\u2019s such a different vibe with the kids all here,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who added that he\u2019s still getting used to people strolling around the manicured grounds rather than quietly shuttling between hushed offices.Walking around the pub in the Guest House Mr. Welch built, Mr. O\u2019Brien confessed to a little nostalgia for G.E.\u2019s glory days in Fairfield. \u201cCan\u2019t you see just see Jack running the world from here in \u201987 or \u201988?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Verizon to Lay Off 2,100 Employees After Finalizing Yahoo Deal", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Verizon plans to lay off 2,100 people once it completes its acquisition of Yahoo\u2019s internet business on Tuesday.The sting will be soothed a bit for some of the Yahoo employees who lose their jobs: A 10 percent surge in the company\u2019s share price on Thursday enhanced the value of their accumulated stock compensation.The layoffs, which were described by a person briefed on Verizon\u2019s plans, represent about 15 percent of the work force at Yahoo and AOL, the Verizon unit with which it is to be combined.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Yahoo\u2019s share price rose by $5.16 after the vote on Thursday, to close at $55.71. That will raise the payouts to Yahoo employees who are terminated.Other senior Yahoo executives who are laid off will also get big severance packages, including up to two years of pay and accelerated vesting of all stock compensation. For example, Lisa Utzschneider, the chief revenue officer, will receive about $22 million, and Ken Goldman, the chief financial officer, will get about $12 million, based on the current stock price and securities filings by the company.Lower-level Yahoo employees will also receive enhanced severance benefits that were established before the Verizon deal was struck last summer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Young Tony Nominee of \u2018Dear Evan Hansen\u2019 Gets Ready for His Big Day", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byEncounters\u201cWe\u2019re just constantly tired,\u201d Mr. Faist said of the eight cast members, seven of whom have been with the show since its out-of-town tryout in Washington in 2015. \u201cWe try to live like nuns as much as possible and save our energy for the show.\u201dSo around 4:45 p.m., Mr. Faist quickly changed out of his onstage outfit of a zippered hoodie, skinny jeans and a well-worn pair of combat boots and into a baggy, Japanese-made T-shirt, a different pair of skinny jeans and a well-worn pair of Merrell boots. He then tied his shaggy, shoulder-length hair into a ponytail, tucked it under a hat and put on his sunglasses. \u201cMy disguise,\u201d he said, explaining that he hoped to get out of the theater without being recognized by any fans waiting by the stage door. He needed to get downtown fast, to make sure he would be back in time for the 8 p.m. performance.But first an obstacle course of sorts had to be navigated. Down a couple of floors was Hugh Jackman, eager to meet the show\u2019s stars. \u201cIt\u2019s my second time here and I plan on coming back again with my daughter,\u201d he tells Mr. Faist. \u201cI\u2019m turning into a stalker.\u201d (The show has seen a constant stream of celebrity visitors, including Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep, since it opened this fall. The cast is still hoping for Hillary Clinton to show up.)A few minutes later, Mr. Faist was out on the street and headed toward the W train, for his trip down to SoHo. But there was a surprise fellow passenger sitting in the subway car: Michael Greif, the director of \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d (and a fellow Tony nominee), coming from another show. The two laughed at the chance encounter before Mr. Greif hopped out at 14th Street and Mr. Faist continued on to Prince Street.Exiting the car, it became clear the disguise hadn\u2019t worked. A young Japanese girl, surprised at spotting him on the platform, shouted, \u201cOmigod, what!??\u201d before bursting into tears. Mr. Faist walked over and gave her a hug while her mother took a picture. As the scene unfolded another commuter, a middle-aged man in business suit, asked who Mr. Faist was.\u201cHe\u2019s an actor in \u2018Dear Evan Hansen,\u2019\u201d one person with Mr. Faist said.The man looked puzzled.\u201cThe Broadway musical,\u201d the person added\u201cOh, I don\u2019t do musicals,\u201d the man said dismissively, then walked away\u201cI think when it\u2019s your first major red carpet, you want to feel really comfortable in the clothes,\u201d Megan Maguire Steele, the owner of the agency, said.As Simon Jacobs, the Turnbull & Asser tailor, pinned back the pants, to give them a slimmer look on the actor\u2019s six-foot frame, he asked Mr. Faist if he wanted \u201ca flush or a break\u201d finish to the hem?\u201cI don\u2019t know, what do you think?\u201d Mr. Faist said, adding, \u201cActually, what\u2019s the difference between the two?\u201dThey went with a break, just skimming the top of the black Billy Reid monk strap shoes he had also chosen for the evening.Easier said than done.Turnbull & Asser had no ties like that in its line, and at first, the label\u2019s representatives suggested an ascot in its place.\u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Ascot? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mr. Faist recounted.So, they spent some time on Wednesday looking at larger and larger bow ties, to see if one would work with the smoking jacket, before Mr. Faist realized it was almost 6 p.m.\u201cI\u2019ve got to go eat,\u201d he said. The tie issue would have to be resolved another day.A few minutes later, he was sitting in the bar of the Crosby Hotel, ordering a chicken Cobb wrap and a glass of tap water. \u201cWater is the best friend to an actor; you have to stay hydrated,\u201d Mr. Faist said, adding that he drinks four liters a day.He talked of how he learned about his Tony nomination. \u201cI was grocery shopping,\u201d he said, having tried to sleep through the early morning announcements but after being awakened by a blinding sun through his bedroom window, decided he had to get out of the apartment.He has been on a wild ride these past few months, with television shows to appear on, parties to attend and magazine interviews to give. He has even done fashion shoots for both Interview and Vogue, the latter with Gigi Hadid (\u201cI didn\u2019t know who she was; I had to Google her\u201d), wearing Alexander McQueen and shot by the photographer Patrick Demarchelier.\u201cI was really nervous about meeting Patrick,\u201d Mr. Faist said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very famous French photographer and he was probably like\u201d \u2014 Mr. Faist switched to a caricature of a French accent \u2014 \u201c\u2018Oh this actor, he knows nothing. He is pathetic. Why did you bring me this piece of garbage?\u2019\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthey all ended up being so lovely.\u201dThough Mr. Faist is only on stage for about 20 or 25 minutes of the show\u2019s running time of two and a half hours, his character is the catalyst for much of the musical\u2019s plot and, in some ways, is always on the minds of the audience.Getting cast in the show went surprisingly smoothly. \u201cI auditioned once,\u201d he said. \u201cI read two scenes, sang 16 bars of \u2018Yesterday,\u2019 the Beatles song, and then left. Then, about 10 minutes later, I got a call from my agent, who said, \u2018Yeah, they want you to do it.\u2019\u201dMr. Faist said the burden of accurately playing this troubled, complex teenager wore on him early in the show\u2019s run.\u201cI tried several different things to start the show off in the right place,\u201d he said. \u201cI would lock myself in my dressing room and listen to the Smiths or Chet Baker. I would stay by myself, alone. It was starting to take a toll.\u201dHe said that after he finished his first big scene in the first act, \u201cI would run up to my room, and just collapse. I remember not being able to get up. I was drained, I was exhausted, I was destroyed. And then I start thinking, \u2018Maybe this isn\u2019t helping anything.\u2019\u201dThen, he said, he realized that \u201cjust trusting the text\u201d was a more practical way to get through the show. \u201cIt\u2019s all there,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as I am committed to the text and I am present in the moment, that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201dHe also said that working on the physical aspects of his character helped him define the role more clearly. \u201cThere is this line in the show, \u2018Nice coat, Connor. Very school-shooter chic,\u2019\u201d Mr. Faist said. \u201cSo, I thought: \u2018Let\u2019s commit. This is what this kid looks like, He\u2019s either got a buzz cut or extremely long hair.\u2019\u201dHe added, \u201cSo, I grew my hair out for the role; I did these nails for the role,\u201d looking down at his chipped nails, with the black polish he applied two weeks ago all but worn away. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me. This isn\u2019t Mike.\u201dAnd that brings him back to that disguise and that, when he walks out into the street after a show, people often expect to meet Connor Murphy and not Mike Faist.\u201cI really don\u2019t like doing the autograph line because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that they are expecting something, or someone, that they just saw. And that isn\u2019t me.\u201dHe acknowledged that some of the young fans want to share their own stories with him or Ben Platt, who plays the title character, seeing the two as kindred spirits. \u201cAll we can say is, really: \u2018Listen, we are not mental health experts. Obviously.\u2019 But the more important thing is just to let them know, \u2018I see you. I\u2019m listening to you, and I hear you.\u2019 That\u2019s all that they are really looking for \u2014 someone to see them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what happened with the girl in the subway station,\u201d he added. \u201cShe just wanted me to see her.\u201dWith that, and a glance at the time, Mr. Faist realized he had to go. The hat and sunglasses went back on, and he headed out the door and toward the subway.There was another show to do.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "Supported byOpinionBEIJING \u2014 What worries you about the coming world of artificial intelligence?Too often the answer to this question resembles the plot of a sci-fi thriller. People worry that developments in A.I. will bring about the \u201csingularity\u201d \u2014 that point in history when A.I. surpasses human intelligence, leading to an unimaginable revolution in human affairs. Or they wonder whether instead of our controlling artificial intelligence, it will control us, turning us, in effect, into cyborgs.These are interesting issues to contemplate, but they are not pressing. They concern situations that may not arise for hundreds of years, if ever. At the moment, there is no known path from our best A.I. tools (like the Google computer program that recently beat the world\u2019s best player of the game of Go) to \u201cgeneral\u201d A.I. \u2014 self-aware computer programs that can engage in common-sense reasoning, attain knowledge in multiple domains, feel, express and understand emotions and so on.This doesn\u2019t mean we have nothing to worry about. On the contrary, the A.I. products that now exist are improving faster than most people realize and promise to radically transform our world, not always for the better. They are only tools, not a competing form of intelligence. But they will reshape what work means and how wealth is created, leading to unprecedented economic inequalities and even altering the global balance of power.It is imperative that we turn our attention to these imminent challenges.What is artificial intelligence today? Roughly speaking, it\u2019s technology that takes in huge amounts of information from a specific domain (say, loan repayment histories) and uses it to make a decision in a specific case (whether to give an individual a loan) in the service of a specified goal (maximizing profits for the lender). Think of a spreadsheet on steroids, trained on big data. These tools can outperform human beings at a given task.This kind of A.I. is spreading to thousands of domains (not just loans), and as it does, it will eliminate many jobs. Bank tellers, customer service representatives, telemarketers, stock and bond traders, even paralegals and radiologists will gradually be replaced by such software. Over time this technology will come to control semiautonomous and autonomous hardware like self-driving cars and robots, displacing factory workers, construction workers, drivers, delivery workers and many others.Unlike the Industrial Revolution and the computer revolution, the A.I. revolution is not taking certain jobs (artisans, personal assistants who use paper and typewriters) and replacing them with other jobs (assembly-line workers, personal assistants conversant with computers). Instead, it is poised to bring about a wide-scale decimation of jobs \u2014 mostly lower-paying jobs, but some higher-paying ones, too.This transformation will result in enormous profits for the companies that develop A.I., as well as for the companies that adopt it. Imagine how much money a company like Uber would make if it used only robot drivers. Imagine the profits if Apple could manufacture its products without human labor. Imagine the gains to a loan company that could issue 30 million loans a year with virtually no human involvement. (As it happens, my venture capital firm has invested in just such a loan company.)We are thus facing two developments that do not sit easily together: enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands and enormous numbers of people out of work. What is to be done?Part of the answer will involve educating or retraining people in tasks A.I. tools aren\u2019t good at. Artificial intelligence is poorly suited for jobs involving creativity, planning and \u201ccross-domain\u201d thinking \u2014 for example, the work of a trial lawyer. But these skills are typically required by high-paying jobs that may be hard to retrain displaced workers to do. More promising are lower-paying jobs involving the \u201cpeople skills\u201d that A.I. lacks: social workers, bartenders, concierges \u2014 professions requiring nuanced human interaction. But here, too, there is a problem: How many bartenders does a society really need?The solution to the problem of mass unemployment, I suspect, will involve \u201cservice jobs of love.\u201d These are jobs that A.I. cannot do, that society needs and that give people a sense of purpose. Examples include accompanying an older person to visit a doctor, mentoring at an orphanage and serving as a sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 or, potentially soon, Virtual Reality Anonymous (for those addicted to their parallel lives in computer-generated simulations). The volunteer service jobs of today, in other words, may turn into the real jobs of the future.Other volunteer jobs may be higher-paying and professional, such as compassionate medical service providers who serve as the \u201chuman interface\u201d for A.I. programs that diagnose cancer. In all cases, people will be able to choose to work fewer hours than they do now.Who will pay for these jobs? Here is where the enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands comes in. It strikes me as unavoidable that large chunks of the money created by A.I. will have to be transferred to those whose jobs have been displaced. This seems feasible only through Keynesian policies of increased government spending, presumably raised through taxation on wealthy companies.As for what form that social welfare would take, I would argue for a conditional universal basic income: welfare offered to those who have a financial need, on the condition they either show an effort to receive training that would make them employable or commit to a certain number of hours of \u201cservice of love\u201d voluntarism.To fund this, tax rates will have to be high. The government will not only have to subsidize most people\u2019s lives and work; it will also have to compensate for the loss of individual tax revenue previously collected from employed individuals.This leads to the final and perhaps most consequential challenge of A.I. The Keynesian approach I have sketched out may be feasible in the United States and China, which will have enough successful A.I. businesses to fund welfare initiatives via taxes. But what about other countries?They face two insurmountable problems. First, most of the money being made from artificial intelligence will go to the United States and China. A.I. is an industry in which strength begets strength: The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product. It\u2019s a virtuous circle, and the United States and China have already amassed the talent, market share and data to set it in motion.For example, the Chinese speech-recognition company iFlytek and several Chinese face-recognition companies such as Megvii and SenseTime have become industry leaders, as measured by market capitalization. The United States is spearheading the development of autonomous vehicles, led by companies like Google, Tesla and Uber. As for the consumer internet market, seven American or Chinese companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are making extensive use of A.I. and expanding operations to other countries, essentially owning those A.I. markets. It seems American businesses will dominate in developed markets and some developing markets, while Chinese companies will win in most developing markets.The other challenge for many countries that are not China or the United States is that their populations are increasing, especially in the developing world. While a large, growing population can be an economic asset (as in China and India in recent decades), in the age of A.I. it will be an economic liability because it will comprise mostly displaced workers, not productive ones.So if most countries will not be able to tax ultra-profitable A.I. companies to subsidize their workers, what options will they have? I foresee only one: Unless they wish to plunge their people into poverty, they will be forced to negotiate with whichever country supplies most of their A.I. software \u2014 China or the United States \u2014 to essentially become that country\u2019s economic dependent, taking in welfare subsidies in exchange for letting the \u201cparent\u201d nation\u2019s A.I. companies continue to profit from the dependent country\u2019s users. Such economic arrangements would reshape today\u2019s geopolitical alliances.One way or another, we are going to have to start thinking about how to minimize the looming A.I.-fueled gap between the haves and the have-nots, both within and between nations. Or to put the matter more optimistically: A.I. is presenting us with an opportunity to rethink economic inequality on a global scale. These challenges are too far-ranging in their effects for any nation to isolate itself from the rest of the world.Kai-Fu Lee is the chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm, and the president of its Artificial Intelligence Institute.Advertisement"}

Such videos were already not allowed to include advertising, but they were not restricted in any other way.Google said it would rely on the specialized knowledge of groups with experts on issues like hate speech, self-harm and terrorism. The company also said it planned to work with counter-extremist groups to help identify content aimed at radicalizing or recruiting extremists.By allowing anyone to upload videos to YouTube, Google has created a thriving video platform that appeals to people with a wide range of interests. But it has also become a magnet for extremist groups that can reach a wide audience for their racist or intolerant views. Google has long wrestled with how to curb that type of content while not inhibiting the freedom that makes YouTube popular.Part of the challenge is the sheer volume of videos uploaded to YouTube. The company has said that more than 400 hours of video content is uploaded to the site every minute, and YouTube has been unable to police that content in real time. Users flag offensive videos for review, while the company\u2019s algorithms comb the site for potential problems. Videos with nudity, graphic violence or copyrighted material are usually taken down quickly.In the aftermath of terror attacks in Manchester and London, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain criticized large internet companies for providing the \u201csafe space\u201d that allows radical ideologies to spread. According to news media reports, friends and relatives of Khuram Shazad Butt, identified as one of the three knife-wielding attackers on London Bridge, were worried about the influence of YouTube videos of sermons by Ahmad Musa Jibril, an Islamic cleric from Dearborn, Mich.A spokesman for YouTube said the new policies were not the result of any single violent episode, but part of an effort to improve its service. Google did not respond to a question about whether Mr. Jibril\u2019s videos would fall under Google\u2019s guidelines for videos containing inflammatory language but not violating its policies. Mr. Jibril still has videos on YouTube, but without ads.In its blog post, Google acknowledged that \u201cmore needs to be done\u201d to remove terrorism-related content from its service. YouTube said it would do more in \u201ccounter-radicalization\u201d efforts, including targeting potential Islamic State recruits with videos that could change their minds about joining the organization. Google said that in previous counter-radicalization attempts, users clicked on ads at an \u201cunusually high rate\u201d to watch videos that debunk terrorism recruitment messages.Google also announced a series of measures aimed at identifying extremist videos more quickly, an effort that the company started this year as YouTube tries to assure advertisers that its platform is safe for their marketing dollars.Brands such as AT&T and Enterprise Rent-A-Car pulled ads from YouTube. Google responded by changing the types of videos that can carry advertising, blocking ads on videos with hate speech or discriminatory content. Google also created a system to allow advertisers to exclude specific sites and channels in YouTube and Google\u2019s display network.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Photograph Fireworks Like a Pro", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byA day off from work, food on the grill and a great fireworks show: These are the traditions we look forward to on the Fourth of July. But there is one tradition many of us unsuccessfully try to avoid year after year: taking awful photos of those fireworks.But we are here to help.Below is advice from photographers whose work has appeared regularly in The Times on how to nail the perfect shot, whether you are shooting with serious equipment or taking a quick snap on your phone.Securing the closest possible viewing spot is great for watching fireworks, but that is rarely going to be the best location for photographing them. \u201cThis is where the creative part comes in,\u201d said Fred Conrad, a former New York Times staff photographer. \u201cJust taking a picture of explosives bursting in the air doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s the things other than the fireworks that actually make the picture interesting.\u201dLook for locations that put interesting landmarks like iconic statues, soaring skylines or historic bridges between yourself and the fireworks display. This gives your images context, letting viewers know whether you were in Brooklyn, New York, or Sydney, Australia.When choosing a location to shoot his Fourth of July image, Mr. Conrad used his knowledge of the city\u2019s waterfront, which led him to a quarter mile-long dock along the New Jersey shoreline. \u201cIt\u2019s like somebody built me a road to the middle of the harbor,\u201d he said, explaining the unique vantage point of the Statue of Liberty surrounded by exploding fireworks.Do not be afraid to think outside of the box. For Lam Yik Fei, a Hong Kong-based photographer, that meant purposefully avoiding the most obvious foreground choice, incorporating spectators into the scene instead. \u201cWe have seen an abundance of images with fireworks above Hong Kong\u2019s skyline,\u201d Mr. Lam wrote in an email. \u201cI wanted to try something different. Fireworks attract lots of photographers so I decided to move back a bit and include them in my shot.\u201dYou can create a fresh perspective by shooting from an elevated location. The photographer Dave Sanders\u2019s memorable Coney Island shot came about after he gained access to the rooftop of a local bar, whose manager he met years before on a previous assignment. Arriving well before dark, Mr. Sanders shared the roof with some of the Coney Island Circus Sideshow performers while considering exposure choices and how to frame the shot. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anything would be brighter than the rides,\u201d he wrote in an email, so he exposed for the existing scene and let the fireworks fill the sky.You do not need expensive equipment to shoot fireworks. Any camera, no matter how dated, that allows you to manually adjust focus and exposure will do just fine. But you will need a tripod.\u201cIt\u2019s important to shoot fireworks using manual mode, otherwise the changing light levels during the show will confuse the camera\u2019s metering system,\u201d Mr. Sanders wrote. And because you\u2019ll be shooting in the dark, he also recommends switching to manual focus mode. This prevents the camera from hunting for focus every time you press the shutter button, potentially missing or outright ruining the shot. Focus the lens on a distant object in the general vicinity of where the fireworks will go off. Arriving at your location while there is still a bit of daylight makes this manual prefocus much easier. You will want to set a narrow aperture somewhere between f/8 and f/16 to keep elements in both the foreground and the background in sharp focus.Determining just how slow your shutter speed should be can require a bit of trial and error. But an attentive eye at the start of the fireworks show can help. \u201cWhen you have one of the fireworks going up, it generally has a trail,\u201d Mr. Conrad said. \u201cYou can see it stream up. In a good fireworks picture you want to see the trail streaming up and see the explosion at the top.\u201d Counting the seconds from the ascent of the flare until its explosion will give you a solid starting point for shutter speed.Once you have started shooting, take a moment to review your first few shots and then dial in the shutter speed as necessary. To see longer trails of light exploding into starburst patterns, add a second or two to your shutter speed. If the fireworks are blending together into an undefined mass, reduce the shutter speed. The beauty of using manual focus and exposure is that once you have found the right formula, you just set it and forget. Every shot that follows will be identical in those regards.Keep in mind that these exposure rules are not set in stone. To capture his image, Mr. Sanders was forced to use a faster shutter speed than he normally would. \u201cThe lights and lettering on the parachute jump were in constant rotation and a slower shutter speed would have blurred them,\u201d he wrote.Sign up here to get the Smarter Living newsletter, a weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.Advertisement"}

Amazon\u2019s booming cloud services business has become a contractor to the government. The Amazon founder also emphasized the need to retrain workers and said it was \u201cimpossible to overstate\u201d the importance of artificial intelligence.Peter Thiel, an early Trump supporter and tech investor, praised the president.\u201cYour administration is doing very well,\u201d he said.Two people who were briefed on the tech meeting later said Mr. Trump also voiced support for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration reform, a term that was used during the Obama administration to generally describe a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States.The president made the promise, the two people said, after being told by Mr. Cook that tech employees may worry they are being targeted amid confusion over the administration\u2019s immigration policy. It was unclear exactly what the president meant, or if he was using the term to mean something else.

{"Headline": "How Bots Are Inflating Instagram Egos", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byI posted a picture in March of the New York Times headquarters looking serene before a snowstorm to my Instagram account. The photo attracted 11 comments, all from strangers. \u201cVery nice!\u201d a monthly cocktail delivery company in San Francisco wrote. A cosmetic tattoo artist in Vancouver, British Columbia, posted three fire symbol emojis, and a vintage furniture seller in San Jose, Calif., left an emoji of a heart with a bow around it.I like to leave my apartment for cocktails, I don\u2019t have any tattoos and I\u2019ve never been to San Jose. So, what was up?The answer, as with so many things online, came down to marketing. Many people with public accounts on Instagram may not realize that when random users follow them or like or comment on their posts, it is often the work of a cottage industry of websites that, for as little as $10 a month, send their clients\u2019 accounts on automated liking, following and commenting sprees. It\u2019s a rogue marketing tactic meant to catch the attention of other Instagram users in hopes that they will follow or like the automated accounts in return.The fake activity has long violated Instagram\u2019s rules but has proliferated nonetheless. In the last seven weeks, however, Instagram, the Facebook-owned app with 700 million users per month, has been cracking down on such businesses. It\u2019s led to the shuttering of anonymously run sites with names like Instagress, PeerBoost, InstaPlus, Mass Planner and Fan Harvest, though others remain.Racking up followers and likes on photos gives a sheen of legitimacy to small businesses or aspiring social-media influencers. If 10,000 people are following them, someone quickly scanning through Instagram might think, \u201cMaybe I should start paying attention to them, too.\u201d And popular accounts also tend to attract advertisers.But marketers have started to wake up to how the system can be gamed.\u201cThe follower count is really completely meaningless,\u201d said Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company in Cincinnati. \u201cIt\u2019s untrustworthy for the true following, and it\u2019s certainly untrustworthy for the quality of the creative work.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a photographer trying to build a following or anyone trying to get your work out there and meet new people, when you get a genuine interaction, that feels good,\u201d Mr. Wilson said in an interview. \u201cWhen you have Instagress coming in there and leaving fake comments like \u2018stunning photo\u2019 and \u2018stunning gallery\u2019 and there\u2019s no one behind it and then the likes \u2014 it\u2019s as if they hijacked that personal neuropathway in your brain.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense what we\u2019re doing for these numbers,\u201d Ms. Melotti, 29, said. She decided to reveal the tactics and stop using them, she said, because the focus on so-called Instafame stopped rewarding original work and seemed to be having a toxic effect on other artists\u2019 self-esteem and perception of reality.These discussions have not been lost on marketers, which spent more than $570 million on influencer marketing on Instagram last year, according to estimates from eMarketer.Mr. Gilbreath of Ahalogy recently introduced a service for agencies and brands to verify quality, traffic and other metrics around influencer marketing campaigns. He recommended identifying powerful creative work through such users and paying Instagram to promote sponsored posts from them, rather than relying on endorsements to their accounts based on their numbers.Closing such businesses is like playing Whac-a-Mole, in part because they are working directly through individual accounts, avoiding any approval process with Instagram, said Alex Taub, the co-founder of SocialRank, which helps marketers find and analyze followers on Twitter and Instagram.\u201cThis is a little extreme, but I think the way you stop this is you start banning all the accounts that use it,\u201d Mr. Taub said. He is skeptical about the types of followers the services attract anyway and pointed out the strangeness of accounts using bots to engage with other accounts using bots.Mr. Wilson said he was questioning how many of his new fans on the @canon_bw account were real. The top five cities that his followers on his personal account came from were all in the United States, while on the experimental one, four of the five top cities \u2014 including Istanbul; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Mexico City \u2014 were outside the country.\u201cPeople use this stuff because it makes your life a little easier short term because your audience is growing,\u201d Mr. Taub said. \u201cBut your audience is probably growing by bots, and it\u2019s probably bots talking to bots.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like hot air,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not real.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Delphi, the Auto Parts Supplier, Embarks on a High-Tech Overhaul", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byBitsTROY, Mich. \u2014 As automakers rush to catch up to Silicon Valley in the race to create the superintelligent, self-driving cars of the future, one old-line parts manufacturer is hoping to win by switching sides.Delphi Automotive has a corporate background that is as greasy and grimy as the steering gears it once produced.It began as the parts arm of General Motors, and years ago operated dozens of unionized plants that churned out the type of mechanical auto components that put venture capitalists to sleep: air-conditioners, brakes, heaters and radios.Its complicated corporate history includes years of downsizing and a long, messy reorganization in bankruptcy court.Cars produced today include dozens of computer chips along with cameras, radar, millions of lines of software and wireless communications links. Future vehicles will have all that and more, said Kevin P. Clark, Delphi\u2019s chief executive.Delphi, he added, hopes to be the supplier of networking components \u2014 like wiring, software and intelligent connectors \u2014 that link all those complex systems and enable them to work together under the hood.\u201cIt\u2019s the intelligent architecture that allows all the advanced safety systems, all the autonomous driving software, all the infotainment software to operate effectively,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Cisco \u201cis a pretty good analogy for us,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner who tracks the development of connected and self-driving cars, said Delphi is attempting the most extensive transformation by an old-line automotive company that he has run across. \u201cThey are the standard-bearer for this,\u201d he said.Its success is by no means assured. Technology shifts quickly, and the company has far more experience in the slower-paced, low-risk approach of the traditional auto industry, where innovations are engineered and tested for years before they are introduced. And Delphi\u2019s investments in start-ups may not pan out.Delphi hopes to create a new business that can gather vast amounts of data from vehicles \u2014 about how and where they go, how they\u2019re driven and how they\u2019re running. The company then envisions selling insights drawn from the data trove to automakers, insurance companies and possibly even advertisers.A driver who frequently drives to Starbucks locations, for example, could be targeted with Starbucks coupons via email or text. Someone whose data shows a pattern of gentle driving could be offered lower insurance rates, said David Ploucha, the president and co-founder of Control-Tec, a start-up Delphi acquired for $124 million as part of this data business strategy.It\u2019s a business model unlike anything the auto industry has ever seen. It\u2019s similar to what Google does by targeting ads to users based on terms they have searched, or how Facebook tailors ads and news posts based on what a member has \u201cliked\u201d on the social networking site.\u201cThe idea is to influence how people spend money in relation to their vehicle,\u201d Mr. Ploucha said.Mr. Clark said he was convinced such data services will evolve into a multibillion-dollar industry, though it may be years before this vision is confirmed.The boldness of Delphi\u2019s plan underscores how dramatic technological changes are loosening the dominant role traditional carmakers have in the auto industry, while opening opportunities for new players.Already, Tesla has jumped ahead in battery-powered cars, and in distributing software updates to its cars over the air, the same way iPhones receive new operating systems. Both Tesla and Google are ahead of many, if not most, automakers in self-driving technology. Uber, the ride-hailing company, is trying to press ahead in autonomous cars, too.Danny Shapiro, a senior executive at Nvidia, a chip maker that provides some of the powerful processors used by Tesla, Audi and many other automakers, said he would not be surprised to see some reordering of the auto industry in the next five to 10 years. \u201cI do believe there will be a rise and fall for some players,\u201d he said.Tesla, thanks to its rising stock, recently passed both Ford and G.M. in terms of market value.Mr. Clark, the Delphi chief executive, hopes his company will be one of the rising stars. For most of the last 20 years, it has been in a slow decline. Delphi was created to take over all the parts businesses G.M. no longer wanted in-house.It was spun off as a stand-alone company in 1999. Six years later, it filed for bankruptcy, slammed by high labor costs and the razor-thin margins of making low-tech commodity parts.Its Chapter 11 reorganization lasted four years, and resulted in plant closings and the elimination of tens of thousands of factory jobs. The company\u2019s steering systems business was sold to a Chinese investor. The remaining company kept operations in automotive electronics and engine technologies such as fuel injectors and diesel components.Over the last few years, as autonomous driving technology began developing rapidly, Mr. Clark saw an opportunity to take Delphi in a new direction.To preserve Control-Tec\u2019s freewheeling start-up culture, Delphi is allowing it to operate largely as an independent company. That includes one lounge where its engineers build Lego cars and occasionally play board games, and another where they share homemade beers.\u201cThe worst thing we could do is stifle the creativity, the energy they have,\u201d Mr. Clark said.This year, Delphi went further, acquiring a start-up with technology for wirelessly transferring data and software to and from vehicles, and investing $15 million in another Israeli company, Otonomo, which specializes in organizing masses of data into forms that automakers and others will pay for. These two investments, along with Control-Tec, make up the foundation of the data business Mr. Clark thinks Delphi can create.Then in May, Mr. Clark announced a final break with the traditional automotive industry. Delphi\u2019s powertrain business, which makes fuel injectors and diesel technology, will be spun off as a separate company by the first quarter of next year.The split will leave behind a new high-tech Delphi, known inside the company for now as \u201cRemain Co.\u201d \u201cHow we get there from here, we\u2019re all doing a lot to figure that out,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated when Delphi will spin off its powertrain business into a separate company. It will be by the first quarter of next year, not the end of this year.Advertisement"}

Its uncensored portions did not say whether the challenge was brought by a telecommunications provider like AT&T that is part of the program\u2019s \u201cupstream\u201d system or by a Silicon Valley internet company like Google that is part of the program\u2019s \u201cPrism\u201d system.It also did not say what the \u201cexpansion\u201d was or what legal arguments the company had made about it.Still, the disclosure was significant. Although several users and privacy groups have tried to sue to block spying under the FISA Amendments Act, the 2008 law that legalized a form of the Bush administration\u2019s post-Sept. 11 warrantless surveillance program, the 2014 fight is the first time that a communications company that works with the N.S.A. is known to have challenged it.\u201cThe anonymous tech company that brought this challenge should be commended for defending its users\u2019 privacy, and other companies must do the same by fighting for critical reforms in the courts and in Congress,\u201d said Ashley Gorski, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union.The ruling, focusing on the 2014 fight over the FISA Amendments Act, came to light because of separate but overlapping Freedom of Information Act lawsuits by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the A.C.L.U.The dispute traces back to Stellarwind, the secret post-Sept. 11 program through which the N.S.A. collected international phone calls and emails linked to terrorism suspects from American telecommunications providers without the warrants required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.After Stellarwind was exposed and prompted legal controversy, Congress responded by enacting the short-lived Protect America Act in 2007, and then the FISA Amendments Act the next year.Mark Rumold, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the details of the legal fight over the further expansion in 2014, whatever it was, should be part of the public debate as Congress deliberates extending the FISA Amendments Act.\u201cThe primary argument the provider used to challenge the directive is almost entirely redacted,\u201d Mr. Rumold said of the ruling. \u201cIf it was substantial enough for a company to raise it before the intelligence court, then it\u2019s substantial enough for Congress to look into it and to make it public during the FISA Amendments Act reauthorization debate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also lies within the line of totality for America\u2019s next total solar eclipse, on April 8, 2024.Mr. Baer has played a central role in preparing the university for its moment under no sun. \u201cMy main pitch was, \u2018This isn\u2019t a choice,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a dot on a map and a crossroads on a map, so everybody\u2019s looking at us. They\u2019re going to come here no matter what.\u201dCoordinating public outreach for one of the most popular astronomical events of the century would be a major undertaking for any university. But for one without an astronomy department, it appeared particularly daunting.From $25 seats in the stadium, which holds 15,000 people, attendees will watch a NASA eclipse pregame show on the scoreboard. The university will also participate in a countrywide experiment to film totality coast to coast.\u201cThe biggest challenge has been trying to get people to understand how big this could be,\u201d said Gary Williams, city manager of Carbondale.NASA has told local officials to expect about 50,000 people, but Mr. Williams and others have warned that the community could be swarmed with many more.\u201cThere\u2019s no game plan, no playbook for this,\u201d said Steven Mitchell, the city\u2019s economic development director. \u201cWe\u2019re completely flying blind and making up the rules as we go.\u201dSome rooms went for $499 a night with a three-night minimum, she said. People have called from Europe, Japan, Panama and Brazil seeking to snag a spot for what the city\u2019s brochures call the \u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heartland.\u201dBut much depends on the weather. If forecasts show cloudy skies in Carbondale, the crowds may not come. Alternatively, if things look dismal everywhere else nearby, then even more people might flock here.Some businesses are skeptical, while others have caught full-on eclipse fever.\u201cWhen people ask what\u2019s the big deal, I say \u2018Google it,\u2019\u201d said Randy Johnson, a managing partner of the bookstore. \u201cFor the eclipse groupies, this is Mecca.\u201dAlready he has sold more than 600 T-shirts and has stocked up on eclipse hats, coffee mugs and beer koozies.\u201cEvery time I see something I think, \u2018Wow, maybe we can put an eclipse logo on it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Johnson said.As an eclipse reaches totality, the sun\u2019s wispy outer atmosphere, known as the corona, appears to spill out from behind the moon. The ethereal crown has long puzzled astronomers: It blazes at more than a million degrees Celsius, yet the sun\u2019s surface burns at around a mere 5,500 degrees Celsius.That\u2019s counterintuitive \u2014 like getting warmer the farther away you walk from a campfire.Normally the corona is invisible from Earth. But it appears when the moon blocks the much brighter solar disk. Totality offers scientists their best opportunity to uncover its scorching secrets.From Saluki Stadium, Dr. Yanamandra-Fisher will investigate how light is scattered in the inner part of the corona, a property known as its polarization. The information could provide insight into how electrons inside the corona are arranged, which could help researchers understand the source of the atmosphere\u2019s intense heat.During her scouting trip, Dr. Yanamandra-Fisher searched for the best place to set up her equipment. She considered the university\u2019s \u201cdark site,\u201d a location established away from people and bright lights. Its 10 concrete pads were designed as vibration-free platforms for telescopes, but scientists who work at the more rugged site will probably need to camp beside their equipment.So she selected the stadium, which offers an unobstructed view of the sky while being closer to the heart of Carbondale.\u201cI\u2019m projecting that the sun will be approximately there when totality hits,\u201d she said, etching an imaginary rectangle with her finger. \u201cIf I can fit three suns across in a field of view, that would be pretty nice.\u201d\u201cYou have to go through your procedure over and over,\u201d she said, \u201cso you don\u2019t make mistakes.\u201dThe sun goes through an 11-year cycle, during which its activity changes from being more mellow to becoming more turbulent. This year\u2019s eclipse is happening while activity is decreasing, but the one in 2024 will occur as it is ramping up, so sunspots and solar flares are expected to be more apparent then.\u201cI\u2019m really excited for the way the sky is going to look,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m nervous too, because this is probably the most complicated thing I have ever done in my life.\u201dThe stadium will also have several high-powered telescopes capable of providing unparalleled views of the partial phases of the eclipse.Dr. Mayo predicts coverage of the eclipse could reach a billion people. But for the millions lucky enough to witness totality in person, like those venturing to Carbondale, he said the experience could be transformative.\u201cPeople remember where they were when Kennedy was shot; people remember the moon landing,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will remember this eclipse.\u201dWhether their efforts will draw students to the spectacle is another question. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a stadium with someone explaining the sky to me,\u201d said Kelechi Agwuncha, 19, a junior filmmaker at the university. \u201cI\u2019d rather take it in myself.\u201dBut some see the eclipse as an important opportunity for their school and city.\u201cA lot of students couldn\u2019t care less. Because it\u2019s Carbondale, they think it can\u2019t be something that big,\u201d said Diamond Trusty, 20, a senior who is a volunteer with the campus marketing team for the eclipse events.But she plans to change those sentiments. \u201cI want to let them know this is a landmark historical moment that we have to be a part of.\u201dSam Beard, 23, a philosophy major, agreed. \u201cIt offers a chance to prove to the outside that this place is magical, it\u2019s a gem, and it\u2019s not flyover country,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Charter, Comcast and Sprint?", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byThe cable companies are considering taking a stake in Sprint to invest in its network. In exchange, they would get favorable terms to offer wireless services.There is also a possibility that the cable companies will buy Sprint (although The Wall Street Journal said that was much less likely).A deal with Sprint could help them retain customers by adding mobile phone services to their bundles.We\u2019ve seen them bend the knees of even the biggest corporate titans in the United States. Now, activist investors may be looking to throw their weight around overseas.Other notable examples:\u2022 Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners pushed for changes at Danone, the French multinational that owns Evian and various yogurt brands.What\u2019s the attraction?There is plenty of competition in the United States, and European countries sometimes lack the sort of defenses that American companies can use against activists.For example, Swiss corporate law could help Mr. Loeb get someone on the board at Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 in Switzerland, shareholders elect each member of the board individually, so if Mr. Loeb chose to nominate a new member and they received a majority of the vote, that candidate would be added without contest.Still, American activists have mixed records abroad.And then there is the tricky issue of other shareholders being suspicious of what they might see as American interlopers. Many companies in Europe and Asia have one large shareholder that is either a family or the government.Still, Nestl\u00e9 investors seemed to like Mr. Loeb\u2019s effort \u2014 his letter sent shares up on Monday.On a call with analysts in April, Mr. Schneider said that he had been encouraged by support in investor meetings, but noted, \u201cWe do understand from these meetings that you want to see meaningful steps toward improved combinations of growth rates and margins.\u201dAnd any changes that Mr. Schneider makes would have to pass muster with Paul Bulcke, his predecessor and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chairman. A new, external chairman would make it easier to make the changes that Mr. Loeb\u2019s hedge fund has called for.Big investors like to tout their credentials when it comes to environmental, social and governance issues, telling companies that they need to show their responsible stewardship in those categories to gain their favor.But many on Wall Street remain skeptical about the value of such policies.So a new study that aims to quantify and correlate stock performance with so-called E.S.G. factors is generating chatter among the investor class.The good news: Investors who look at these metrics are less likely to buy shares in companies with volatile stocks or that are headed toward bankruptcy.But E.S.G. considerations are not enough to help a stock outperform its peers.In fact, \u201cE.S.G. was generally a weak signal of future returns,\u201d according to the study. Companies that rated the best on E.S.G. issues performed better, on average, but the study said that \u201cthis performance was not consistent, and was very similar to the performance of large versus small companies.\u201dIt seems it will take more evidence \u2014 and perhaps more time \u2014 to prove itself as an investment thesis.Advertisement"}
