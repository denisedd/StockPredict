{"Headline": "How Battling Brands Online Has Gained Urgency, and Impact", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtUntil last week, Travis Kalanick, a founder of Uber and its chief executive, ruled his company absolutely. That was the Silicon Valley way; ever since Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple in the 1980s, tech founders have demanded, and been awarded, enormous deference by investors and corporate boards. So even as successive waves of scandal have hit Uber, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s position looked safe.It is the swiftness of the fall that\u2019s interesting here. In another time, Mr. Kalanick might have been able to hang on. But we live in an era dominated by the unyielding influence of social feeds. Every new Uber revelation ignited a massive campaign against the company on Twitter and Facebook. A swirl of negative branding took on a life of its own \u2014 and ultimately could not be ignored.But the effects of these campaigns go beyond business. In a nation where politics have grown pitched and sclerotic, fighting brands online suddenly feels like the most effective political action many of us can take. Posting a hashtag \u2014 #deleteUber, for instance, or #grabyourwallet \u2014 and threatening to back it up by withholding dollars can bring about a much quicker, more visible change in the world than, say, calling your representative.Yet the mechanics of social media suggest it will be the cultural and political left, more than the right, that might win the upper hand with this tactic \u2014 especially when harnessing the power of brands to fight larger battles for racial and gender equality, as in the Uber and Fox News cases.To see why, we must first understand why brands are suddenly more vulnerable to consumer sentiment than they once were. It all comes down to one thing: Social media is the new TV.In the era when television shaped mainstream consumer sentiment, companies enjoyed enormous power to alter their image through advertising. Then came the internet, which didn\u2019t kill advertising, but did dilute its power. Brands now have little say over how their messages get chewed up through our social feeds.Yes, they can run ads on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and everyplace else. But social media elevates consumers over corporate marketing; suddenly what matters isn\u2019t what an ad says about a company, but what your friends think about that company.It\u2019s this loss of power that explains why brands have become so jumpy and reactive. Take the production of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d that opened last week in Central Park as part of Shakespeare in the Park. In the play, a Caesar who is styled to look like Mr. Trump is graphically assassinated on stage, which many on the right took as disparaging the president.But none of that matters in 2017, when Twitter shapes the news. On social media, there\u2019s no room for nuanced portrayals of complex artistic treatments. There are only quick snatches of graphic imagery in your scrolling feed \u2014 and the sight of a Trump-styled Caesar getting assassinated proved too much for powerless brands to stomach.\u201cI think it\u2019s ultimately healthy and positive even when I don\u2019t agree with it \u2014 it\u2019s healthy and positive that consumers are making themselves heard,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s only in the last 15 years that women became aware of their own consumer power,\u201d Ms. Coulter said. \u201cAnd now, online, they can show that they\u2019re willing to flex it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Needs to Reinvent Itself. It Just Might Be Doing So.", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 One of Apple\u2019s greatest strengths is timing. The company that\u2019s hailed for innovation does not often invent things first \u2014 it didn\u2019t create the first personal computer, the first digital music player or the first smartphone. Instead, Apple reinvents, slipping in and producing something more original than what we used to use.Apple\u2019s version ticks all the Apple-y boxes: It\u2019s very pretty; it\u2019s about twice the price of the Echo; and it has much better sound, including the ability to create a kind of surround sound customized to your room.Yet the reinvention that matters here isn\u2019t about a single device \u2014 it\u2019s larger: The success of HomePod will really depend on whether Apple can reinvent itself.HomePod will be a test of how Apple responds to these difficulties. That\u2019s because for Apple to outdo Amazon in the home assistant game, it will need to prioritize skills that have long been on its back burner \u2014 cloud services and A.I., for instance.But here\u2019s the surprising thing: Apple seems to be up for such reinvention. If you read between the lines at its keynote address on Monday, you would have noticed something. Again and again, like shamans calling on some new and powerful magic, Apple executives invoked the buzzwords of modern computing: \u201cmachine learning,\u201d \u201cdeep learning\u201d and \u201ccomputer vision.\u201dSubtly but unmistakably, they were suggesting a shift. Apple seems to be transforming itself into a new kind of company, one that prioritizes the nerdy technical stuff that will become the foundation of tomorrow\u2019s intelligent machines \u2014 whereas in the past, the company tended to hide this stuff, even if it recognized its importance.In broad strokes, the device seems to do much of what its rivals can. Say, \u201cHey Siri, play me some Carly Rae Jepsen,\u201d and it will belt out perfect Canadian pop. It will also answer questions about the music it\u2019s playing, and, just like the Echo, it can perform a wide variety of other functions \u2014 setting timers, telling you the weather and controlling your smart lights and other home devices.Yet many of these are omissions that you\u2019d expect in a new device, and Apple will most likely add improvements in updates. What will matter most, at first, is how reliably HomePod can perform the basics.If you\u2019re a longtime Siri user, your skepticism is warranted. The best thing about Amazon\u2019s speaker is its reliability: Say something from far away, even in a noisy room, and most of the time it will at least recognize what you asked it. Once you get an idea of the kinds of requests it can handle, Alexa begins to seem like a completely natural interface to computers. It responds so quickly that it starts to seem like a helpful member of the family rather than a computer in a can.Can Siri in HomePod do that? I can\u2019t tell you yet for certain. I got a chance to listen to HomePod \u2014 but not use any of its voice-activated features \u2014 after Apple\u2019s keynote. As the company promised, it does sound much deeper and richer than a Sonos Play 3 or an Amazon Echo, closer to what you might hear in a high-end home stereo system. But the true test for such a device is how it works in real-world conditions, handling the multiplicity of requests that you might think up during a day \u2014 and for now, we have no idea how that might work.Yet I am cautiously optimistic, mainly on the basis of the many other computationally difficult features that Apple showed off on Monday. Many of them are versions of features that rivals like Google have spent years perfecting.For example, Siri will now translate languages for you. Like a true assistant, Siri is also now more predictive \u2014 it aims to spot common computing problems and offer to help. (If it notices that you\u2019ve been chatting about a coming appointment, for instance, it will offer to add it to your calendar.)Best of all, Siri is finally a single unified personality that sits across all of your devices. In the past, Siri on your iPad was different from Siri on your Mac \u2014 one would learn that you\u2019re traveling to Iceland, and the other might never know. Now, similar to other assistants, Siri knows you and can anticipate your interests on whatever device you use.There was more, too. Apple is letting developers create apps that can perform machine learning tasks on its devices. It\u2019s also diving heavily into computer vision. Developers can now create augmented reality features, meaning they can add virtual objects overlaid on images from the real world.If you follow the tech industry you know these are all hot topics that other companies are investing in heavily. Apple is still a laggard, and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to beat Google in an A.I. contest anytime soon.But it doesn\u2019t need to. All Apple has to do is stay competitive \u2014 it\u2019s got to invest just enough in the A.I.-driven future to keep its devices compelling. There\u2019s no mistake, now, that it\u2019s doing so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Top Uber Executive Departs, Fraying the Company\u2019s \u2018A-Team\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, had his own personal \u201cA-Team\u201d at the ride-hailing company.The name referred to a coterie of Uber\u2019s top executives who were among some of the company\u2019s early employees and had some of the same aggressive sensibilities as Mr. Kalanick. The A-Team included Emil Michael, senior vice president for business, and Eric Alexander, a top executive in Asia, as well as Thuan Pham, Uber\u2019s chief technology officer.Together, these executives formed Mr. Kalanick\u2019s inner circle. They helped Uber barrel into new markets, raise funding and advance the company\u2019s technology and systems. Based on their work, Uber soared to a nearly $70 billion valuation, reordering the transportation industry across the world along the way.Now the original A-Team is being dismantled, signaling that the era of the boys\u2019 club at the top is all but over at Uber.An email sent by Emil Michael, Uber\u2019s second in command, who left the company on Monday.\u201cThe board is clearly seeking to significantly change the optics for Uber,\u201d said Jeremy Robinson-Leon, principal at Group Gordon, a corporate public relations management firm. \u201cThis sends a signal to stakeholders that change is coming, in some form or fashion.\u201dMr. Michael\u2019s exit and the fraying of the A-Team is just the tip of more changes to come. Uber\u2019s board held a nearly seven-hour meeting on Sunday in Los Angeles to discuss other personnel matters, including the planned addition of a new board member, Wan Ling Martello, an executive at Nestl\u00e9. Mr. Kalanick has not made a final decision about whether to take a leave of absence, said three people close to him.The board discussions also preceded the public release, scheduled for Tuesday, of some portions of Mr. Holder\u2019s report on Uber. The report\u2019s findings and recommendations are expected to spur another wave of changes at the company; on Sunday night, the board issued a statement saying that it had \u201cunanimously voted to adopt all the recommendations of the Holder report.\u201dUber declined to comment. Through a spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.The A-Team unofficially began forming at Uber in 2010, the year after Mr. Kalanick and his co-founder Garrett Camp started the ride-hailing service. That year, the two hired Ryan Graves, an engineer who responded to Uber\u2019s call for help on Twitter.Soon, others became part of that circle, including Mr. Pham, a former VMware vice president who joined Uber in 2013, and Mr. Michael, who worked at a start-up called Klout before joining Uber that same year. Other A-Team members included lower-profile executives like Jeff Holden, who works on Uber\u2019s product, and operations managers like Rachel Holt, Andrew MacDonald and Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty.It is unclear how the A-Team name came about, but the moniker was used by members internally, and employees widely understood the reference as pertaining to many executives who reported directly to Mr. Kalanick.Many A-Team members became fast friends with Mr. Kalanick, traveling with him around the world to help spread Uber\u2019s business. Some, like Mr. Alexander, were close confidants of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s despite not reporting directly to him. All shared a mission-driven desire to disrupt entrenched transportation systems and replace the status quo with ride hailing.Their aggressiveness paid off, with Uber taking off not only in the United States but also in Brazil and many other countries. Investors clamored to give Uber billions of dollars in funding. Established taxi companies began to lose business to Uber.Those victories gave the A-Team something of an air of invincibility, said three people familiar with the matter, and that ultimately led some to make missteps.Mr. Michael was perhaps the highest-profile member of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s A-Team. A Harvard graduate, he was the chief executive\u2019s right hand, helping Uber raise billions of dollars from major investors.Mr. Michael\u2019s name came up again when The Information, a technology news website, reported this year that he and Mr. Kalanick had visited an escort bar in South Korea several years ago as part of a business trip. The visit made some co-workers uncomfortable and led to a complaint to human resources.Ultimately, that history caught up with Mr. Michael, whose last day at Uber was Sunday. It was not clear whether Mr. Michael resigned or was fired. Uber confirmed his departure but declined to comment further. David Richter, a business development executive at Uber, will take over Mr. Michael\u2019s position as senior vice president for business.\u201cUber has a long way to go to achieve all that it can, and I am looking forward to seeing what you accomplish in the years ahead,\u201d Mr. Michael said in his departure note to employees.Uber is now bringing in new top executives. Liane Hornsey came aboard several months ago as Uber\u2019s new head of human resources. More recently, the company hired Bozoma St. John, a former Apple executive, in the newly created position of chief brand officer. And Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor and management consultant, was appointed Uber\u2019s first senior vice president for leadership and strategy.Uber is still in search of a new general counsel, a chief operating officer and a chief financial officer with \u201cpublic company experience.\u201dWith all the changes, the A-Team \u2014 at least as originally conceived \u2014 is unlikely to come together again.\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying now is that they\u2019ve gotten the message and that management wants Uber to be around for a very long time,\u201d Andrew Gilman, chief executive of the crisis communications firm CommCore, said of Uber\u2019s board. \u201cThey\u2019re finally taking corrective action.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of an Uber operations manager. He is Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, not Gore-Cotie.Advertisement"}

We have the entire 39th floor, with floor-to-ceiling windows and offices on two sides that overlook Bryant Park.An architect friend who was visiting said, \u201cThis is the view that everyone who has never been to New York thinks that everyone in New York has.\u201dThe d\u00e9cor is stark white throughout. It looks like everyone moved in six months ago, but the company has been here almost 20 years.Microsoft computers didn\u2019t come in white back then, so our chairman, Jay Sugarman, bought Apples and had them reconfigured with the Microsoft operating system.1.

{"Headline": "HomePod Speaker and New iMacs: What We Saw at Apple\u2019s WWDC", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "Supported by\u2022 Apple gave a sneak peek of HomePod, a speaker, to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home. It\u2019s the first brand-new hardware product for Apple since the Apple Watch.\u2022 The company also showed new iPads at its annual developer conference, which typically focuses on software instead of hardware.\u2022 Also unveiled: a new iMac Pro, upgraded iMacs and MacBooks, and updates to its operating systems.Amazon, with the Echo, pioneered a device that lets you play music, look up basic information and control your lighting and other home accessories. Now Apple\u2019s answer to the Echo \u2014 the HomePod \u2014 is here, kind of. Apple showed off HomePod on Monday, and it will be available in December.So how will Apple compete? In a very Apple-like manner: The speaker, powered by the Siri voice assistant, looks spiffier than either Amazon\u2019s or Google\u2019s version \u2014 it is a seven-inch-tall canister wrapped in a shiny mesh speaker. The company also said it had prioritized the speaker\u2019s sound, which can be lackluster on rival devices. HomePod has an array of speakers to create virtual surround sound.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know what any of that is; just know that it sounds incredible,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s marketing chief, who added that HomePod would be priced at $349.Although Apple appears to be trying to make up ground on Amazon and Google, the primary casualty may be Sonos. That company offers a wireless multispeaker system that allows users to listen to music throughout the home, similar to HomePod\u2019s ability to chain together speakers.The big question, though, is whether the intelligence inside Apple\u2019s speaker is good for anything beyond music. Apple was early to the voice game with Siri on the iPhone, but rivals have since lapped it \u2014 their voice-command devices are faster, they know more, and they are less annoying to use. Apple promises the new Siri is better, but the improvements it showed were only minor.Apple\u2019s developer conference typically showcases software improvements. In a departure from that routine, Apple showed a lot of new hardware this time.That included updated versions of the iPad, which has been declining in sales. Apple showed that it was continuing to bet on the tablets by unveiling an iPad upgrade that the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said was pushing the device \u201cfurther than it ever has before.\u201dThe new version of the iPad Pro has a 10.5-inch display, 20 percent larger than the previous 9.7-inch model, and it will start at $649. Apple said the size made it perfect for displaying a virtual keyboard comparable to a full-size physical keyboard. The company also highlighted a feature called ProMotion that increases the refresh rate and makes motion smoother in video content.After Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad in 2010, tablets exploded in popularity, but iPad sales have slumped for more than a year now. So Apple, under increasing pressure from investors to strengthen its revenue, has upgraded iPads more frequently than many of its other products. The company introduced a cheaper version of the 9.7-inch iPad, priced at $329, in March and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compatible with an Apple stylus and keyboard, in 2015.Apple\u2019s predicament seems to be that for existing iPad customers, their tablets are still quite capable and running strong, giving them little reason to upgrade. For new customers, the iPad may be overkill for basic tasks, especially if you can just pay $50 for a media tablet from Amazon.One of Apple\u2019s splashiest hardware debuts was a brand new iMac Pro that will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega. Translation: It is Apple\u2019s all-in-one desktop on steroids.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the most powerful Mac we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d said John Ternus, Apple\u2019s vice president for hardware engineering.The new iMac Pro may help compensate for Apple\u2019s previous professional desktop, the Mac Pro, which was widely panned by critics and customers. The iMac Pro will start at $5,000 and ship in December.With this device, Apple is broadly catering to members of the professional community, like filmmakers and hard-core coders. For years, these users have felt left behind as Apple has focused on consumer-oriented products like the iPhone, shifting away from high-performance equipment for professionals.The company also announced upgrades of its 27-inch and 21.5-inch iMacs, its desktop computers, which will start at $1,099, with additional models at $1,299 and $1,799. And Apple lowered some prices for its MacBooks and said the MacBook Air, its entry-level lightweight laptop, would get a speed increase. The 21.5-inch model with 4K high resolution will start at about $1,300, with a new 13-inch MacBook Pro starting at $1,300.Every year, Apple updates the underlying operating systems that power its devices. The changes are geeky \u2014 remember, they are aimed at software developers \u2014 but they eventually trickle down to how we use iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches.The most important update was to iOS, the operating system that underpins Apple\u2019s biggest seller, iPhones, as well as iPads. Apple introduced iOS 11, with improved camera software; upgrades for Siri; an expansion of its mobile payment system, Apple Pay; and a new version of Apple Maps, with indoor mapping and features to prevent distracted driving.Because the show is about giving new tools to developers, Apple also focused on emerging technologies. Specifically, Apple highlighted augmented reality, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras.Apple demonstrated changes to the operating system for the Apple Watch including a new watch face that uses Siri to suggest directions, show calendar items and generally predict what you will want to see. The most substantive changes focused on fitness, including the ability to track new types of high-intensity workouts.Advertisement"}

She knew how much leverage she had to force change in Apple Music and Spotify, and she\u2019s used her catalog to do so. Perhaps coming back to Spotify now isn\u2019t a concession, more a victory lap.That said, do we have any proof that these meetings make any difference whatsoever in changing their opinions? Travis Kalanick, Bob Iger, Elon Musk \u2014 all left the president\u2019s economic council after they felt they were getting nowhere.

Or Taylor?Anyway, at first glance I thought it was a bit silly for Apple to ask people to pay $150 more for a glorified Sonos, which starts at $200. But some folks informed me that way of thinking was slightly off. For one, this most likely competes with Sonos\u2019s $300 to $500 offerings, which are rather decent and nice-sounding speakers.Will I buy one? Probably not, but I have issues.

As has been the case for years now, these technology giants sit on trillions of dollars in cash, are growing at a breakneck pace and, compared with companies in earlier tech frenzies, do not have absurd valuations.Yet it has been this lack of an identifiable cause \u2014 a disappointing earnings result or a major investor\u2019s unloading stock, for example \u2014 that has been worrying some market specialists.\u201cThere was no real catalyst; I just think there has been a psychological change,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock market strategist with UBS Securities in New York. \u201cEven though the long-term earnings picture with these stocks is favorable, there is discomfort with the disproportionate gains in these stocks.\u201dOn Monday, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was also slightly lower, off 0.1 percent.Netflix helped lead the way, declining 4.2 percent. Apple ended the day down 2.4 percent, with its shares recovering slightly from a 4 percent drop in earlier trading.In the last two trading days, Netflix has lost 8.9 percent while Apple has lost 6.3 percent.The declines for Google and Amazon have been less pronounced. On Monday, Google fell 0.9 percent and Amazon 1.4 percent.To the broader point, UBS published a research report late last week noting that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google were responsible for one-third of the S.&P. 500\u2019s return of more than 8 percent this year.The bell does not ring at a stock market peak, the note explained, but there have been periods in recent history when investors, after riding a small group of stocks up to unexpected highs, have abandoned them en masse. The reasons for doing so, however, were less than obvious at the time.UBS was not the only major investment firm weighing in late last week about the heavy influence of these stocks in investor portfolios.Goldman Sachs released an analysis that raised concerns about how far these stocks had run, and two investment banks marked down their ratings for Apple, citing worries about slowing iPhone sales.While traders have said hedge funds could be bailing out on these stocks, the larger question is the extent to which retail investors \u2014 given how vulnerable they can be to mood shifts in the market \u2014 will stick with them.According to FactSet, a data collection company, 82 percent of today\u2019s combined investor exposure to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is in the hands of large mutual fund companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity and the Capital Group.Hedge funds as an investor class, according to FactSet, hold just $58 billion in these stocks, which are collectively known by the acronym Faang. (Some analysts prefer \u201cFaamg,\u201d substituting larger Microsoft for Netflix.)Compared with the $688 billion held in traditional mutual funds and their faster-growing cousins \u2014 exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade on stock exchanges \u2014 that is a very small figure.To a large degree, the ascendance of these companies is a result of their ability to grow and achieve startling success in a sluggish economy.In the last week, however, a number of analysts have argued that the disconnect between Faang (or Faamg) stocks and other sectors tied more directly to the economy, such as financial and energy stocks, has become too significant to ignore.Credit Suisse, in a trading alert on Monday, recommended that clients ditch QQQ, a $50 billion exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index, in favor of XLF, a $22 billion E.T.F. that follows large financial companies.In the last week, QQQ has declined by 3.3 percent and XLF has increased by about the same amount as investors large and small have started to make this change.Advertisement"}

They rendered their crash-test dummy (in this case a nervous reporter) powerless over his vehicle and disabling his transmission in the middle of a highway.\u201cCar hacking makes great headlines, but remember: No one has ever had their car hacked by a bad guy,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter last Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s only ever been performed by researchers.\u201dStill, the research by Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek came at a steep price for Jeep\u2019s manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler, which was forced to recall 1.4 million of its vehicles as a result of the hacking experiment.It is no wonder that Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, called cybersecurity her company\u2019s top priority last year. Now the skills of researchers and so-called white hat hackers are in high demand among automakers and tech companies pushing ahead with driverless car projects.Uber, Tesla, Apple and Didi in China have been actively recruiting white hat hackers like Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek from one another as well as from traditional cybersecurity firms and academia.Last year, Tesla poached Aaron Sigel, Apple\u2019s manager of security for its iOS operating system. Uber poached Chris Gates, formerly a white hat hacker at Facebook. Didi poached Mr. Miller from Uber, where he had gone to work after the Jeep hack. And security firms have seen dozens of engineers leave their ranks for autonomous-car projects.Mr. Miller said he left Uber for Didi, in part, because his new Chinese employer has given him more freedom to discuss his work.\u201cCarmakers seem to be taking the threat of cyberattack more seriously, but I\u2019d still like to see more transparency from them,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter on Saturday.Like a number of big tech companies, Tesla and Fiat Chrysler started paying out rewards to hackers who turn over flaws the hackers discover in their systems. GM has done something similar, though critics say GM\u2019s program is limited when compared with the ones offered by tech companies, and so far no rewards have been paid out.Granted, they had to be in the Jeep to make all that happen. But it was evidence of what is possible.Security researchers have also had their way with Tesla\u2019s software-heavy Model S car. In 2015, Mr. Rogers, together with Kevin Mahaffey, the chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company Lookout, found a way to control various Tesla functions from their physically connected laptop.One year later, a team of Chinese researchers at Tencent took their research a step further, hacking a moving Tesla Model S and controlling its brakes from 12 miles away. Unlike Chrysler, Tesla was able to dispatch a remote patch to fix the security holes that made the hacks possible.In all the cases, the car hacks were the work of well meaning, white hat security researchers. But the lesson for all automakers was clear.The motivations to hack vehicles are limitless. When it learned of Mr. Rogers\u2019s and Mr. Mahaffey\u2019s investigation into Tesla\u2019s Model S, a Chinese app-maker asked Mr. Rogers if he would be interested in sharing, or possibly selling, his discovery, he said. (The app maker was looking for a backdoor to secretly install its app on Tesla\u2019s dashboard.)Criminals have not yet shown they have found back doors into connected vehicles, though for years, they have been actively developing, trading and deploying tools that can intercept car key communications.But as more driverless and semiautonomous cars hit the open roads, they will become a more worthy target. Security experts warn that driverless cars present a far more complex, intriguing and vulnerable \u201cattack surface\u201d for hackers. Each new \u201cconnected\u201d car feature introduces greater complexity, and with complexity inevitably comes vulnerability.Twenty years ago, cars had, on average, one million lines of code. The General Motors 2010 Chevrolet Volt had about 10 million lines of code \u2014 more than an F-35 fighter jet.Today, an average car has more than 100 million lines of code. Automakers predict it won\u2019t be long before they have 200 million. When you stop to consider that, on average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of software code, the potentially exploitable weaknesses add up quickly.The only difference between computer code and driverless car code is that, \u201cUnlike data center enterprise security \u2014 where the biggest threat is loss of data \u2014 in automotive security, it\u2019s loss of life,\u201d said David Barzilai, a co-founder of Karamba Security, an Israeli start-up that is working on addressing automotive security.To truly secure autonomous vehicles, security experts say, automakers will have to address the inevitable vulnerabilities that pop up in new sensors and car computers, address inherent vulnerabilities in the base car itself and, perhaps most challenging of all, bridge the cultural divide between automakers and software companies.\u201cThe genie is out of the bottle, and to solve this problem will require a major cultural shift,\u201d said Mr. Mahaffey of the cybersecurity company Lookout. \u201cAnd an automaker that truly values cybersecurity will treat security vulnerabilities the same they would an airbag recall. We have not seen that industrywide shift yet.\u201dThere will be winners and losers, Mr. Mahaffey added: \u201cAutomakers that transform themselves into software companies will win. Others will get left behind.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q&A: What Apple Announced at WWDC", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementApple shared very few details about HomePod, its new smart speaker. But here\u2019s what we know about how the device works: 1. Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant, will primarily work with Apple Music.2. The device will also play audio that is streamed over Wi-Fi from an iPhone using AirPlay, which means you can stream music from third-party apps like Spotify or Pandora to the speaker as long as you have an iPhone. It\u2019s highly unlikely that you will need an iPhone to use HomePod, but you will probably need at least an Apple Music account if you lack an iPhone. Regarding an SDK, Apple did not announce one for HomePod this week. But it\u2019s reasonable to expect one in the future.As for whether HomePod will be successful, we will have to wait and see. The device\u2019s $329 price tag is exceptionally higher than Amazon\u2019s $180 Echo and Google\u2019s $129 Home. But HomePod\u2019s price is on par with the $299 Sonos Play:3. The Sonos products -- multispeaker systems designed to be spread throughout various rooms in the house -- are the most similar to HomePod, and the people who are willing to spend so much on Sonos products may be willing to splurge on HomePod.Are there any proposed upgrades to the iPad Mini, which is the entry-level and smallest iPad?There were no updates for the iPad Mini at Monday\u2019s event. In March, Apple refreshed its iPad Mini 4, which was released in 2015, with larger storage capacity (128 gigabytes). Apple has said its larger 9.7-inch iPad tablet has been its hottest seller, so you can expect Apple to minimize updates for the smaller model in the future.Adding a trackpad to the iPad would practically turn it into a PC. Apple continues to distinguish its Mac and iPad products with user interfaces that rely on different ways to control them. Its Macs are controlled with a mouse and physical keyboard, and its iPads are primarily controlled with a touchscreen. However, to your point, the iPad is increasingly resembling the Mac, especially now that a physical keyboard is practically a must-buy if you get an iPad Pro. In addition, there is now a virtual trackpad mode in iPad: touch two fingers down on the keyboard to bring up a digital trackpad on the screen.What is the scoop on the iPhone 8? Are there any advancements and are they significant? The past few models appear to represent a plateau in the phone\u2019s development. There have been some software upgrades but besides the camera nothing big. What do you think?According to multiple sources, the next iPhone will reduce the borders, or bezel, surrounding the screen \u2014 so you will get a larger display in a compact body. This is the current design trend in the smartphone industry. The LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8, which were released this year, also featured thinner bezels.I have been debating whether or not an iPad Pro is a worthy investment ever since I acquired my MacBook Pro about a year ago. With iOS 11, would you argue that the iPad Pro can adequately perform as a 'substitute' laptop for those days when lugging a MacBook around isn't as appealing? Could you briefly recap what iOS 11 means for the iPad Pro world in terms of its functionality as an everyday work device?The iPad\u2019s operating system is increasingly resembling that of a Mac. Most significantly, iOS 11 will include a file directory that lets you manage files similar to the Finder system on Mac. In addition, iOS 11 includes the ability to drag and drop items between multiple app screens, similar to the desktop interface of interacting with apps inside multiple windows. As for whether or not the iPad Pro replaces an everyday work computer, the jury is still out. We will have to wait and see when iOS 11 is officially released in fall, as well as what apps are available for iPad. Other than software, personally what makes me gravitate toward a laptop for work is simply what the word implies: it can sit on top of my lap more comfortably. Apple offers a detachable keyboard for iPad Pro, but a laptop\u2019s attached keyboard is always going to feel more solid and stable.Will there come a time when iPad Pro can run Photoshop?Is there any hope that Apple will move to support its professional users, perhaps by totally rethinking the design and upgradability of the Mac towers?Hi, Brian. I was looking at the MacBook Pro and when I saw the charger, only one question came to mind: What would Steve Jobs say, especially considering the commercials (Hi, I'm a Mac / I'm a PC) featured a PC in a wheelchair after being injured when someone tripped on the cord and pulled him off the desk?You are referring to Apple\u2019s shift to USB-C, the modern standard for USB, and away from its proprietary magnetic charging port called MagSafe. Among many complaints, this was one of the most controversial changes about the new MacBook Pros. Based on conversations with employees, my understanding is that Apple made this decision for a number of reasons: 1. The MacBook Pro batteries last so long now, so how often are you sitting around with the cord plugged into the computer anyway? 2. The laptops keep getting lighter and lighter, and at some point tripping over the cord might still pull the computer off the desk even if it\u2019s connected with a magnet; 3. The accessories industry is slowly transitioning into using USB-C for video, audio and power, so might as well go all in on this port now. (Personally, I will miss MagSafe as well and I still prefer the MacBook Air in part because of that charging port.)Anything on the Mac Mini?It\u2019s easy to forget about the Mac Mini \u2014 the tiny box-shaped desktop computer -- which has not been upgraded since 2014. There were no updates for the mini computer announced at Monday\u2019s event, but in recent press interviews, Apple said the Mac Mini remains part of its portfolio, and it did not announce any plans to discontinue the device. In other words, there might be improvements made to the computer eventually, but it\u2019s tough to say when.Can I get some iMac advice? I\u2019m trying to gauge when to replace my current iMac, but unsure whom to trust.The new standard iMacs ship this week and the next Mac operating system comes out this fall. It would be perfectly fine for you to get the new iMac now and download the next Mac system, a free update called High Sierra, when it arrives this fall. However, be wary that brand-new operating systems often have bugs, so I would advise you to wait a few months after High Sierra\u2019s release to make sure the coast is clear. And as always, make sure to back up your data before you upgrade to the next operating system.I need a new laptop. Should I wait?If you are considering an Apple laptop, now is the time to get one. Apple refreshed each of its laptops: The MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro all got updates this week with improvements like speed increases. We probably will not see another update to the MacBook line for at least another year. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pandora, Faded Star of Online Music, Gets Cash Infusion From Sirius XM", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byPandora was early to the online music business, introducing a free internet radio service just a few years after Apple started iTunes and enjoying a successful debut as a public company.It was nice while it lasted.Any first-mover advantage Pandora once had has long since dwindled, as rivals including Spotify and Apple Music have become the dominant forces in an industry where consumer habits change faster than the Billboard charts.Now, in a bid to buy time, Pandora has found a partner that can give it some much-needed cash \u2014 and, perhaps down the line, become its new owner.\u201cWith this investment, we have the backing of one of the media industry\u2019s most successful investors and significant capital to accelerate growth,\u201d Tim Leiweke, a Pandora director, said in a statement.Or, as Mark Mulligan, a music technology analyst with Midia Research, put it: \u201cThis gives Pandora a fighting chance of making a proper go at competing.\u201dPandora lost $343 million last year, nearly triple what it lost in 2015. And its active monthly listener base shrank to a two-year low in this year\u2019s first quarter, to 76.7 million.Amazon, Apple and Google also have streaming music offerings, and all face the same fundamental challenge: Paying for music rights and marketing has proved an expensive proposition.Pandora was particularly slow to adapt.Its radio business is supported by advertising that generated a respectable $1 billion in revenue last year.\u201cPandora\u2019s done something sensible,\u201d Mr. Mulligan said, \u201cbut sensible doesn\u2019t always get enough credit.\u201dInternet radio ads, however, are not enough to compete with the likes of Apple and Spotify.Too little, too late, analysts said, suggesting that the expense of the new product would weigh down a company that has never reported an annual profit.Enter Sirius XM.The investment came as little surprise to Wall Street. Sirius XM has flirted with doing a deal for Pandora for some time, with its chairman, Gregory B. Maffei, saying publicly that he could be interested in a transaction, but only at what he considered the right price.The deal announced on Friday includes an agreement for the two companies to work together on internet streaming on mobile devices and in cars. It also gives Sirius XM an edge in any possible takeover of Pandora, with the satellite radio provider taking not only a 19 percent stake but also three board seats, including chairman.All that gives it a formidable advantage over any other potential rival who would seek to buy Pandora, although Sirius XM agreed not to make any such move for 18 months.\u201cLonger term, this makes it more likely that they will end up together,\u201d said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie.For Sirius XM \u2014 part of the constellation of companies controlled by Liberty Media \u2014 the new stake in Pandora will give it an important toehold in a number of businesses, including ad-supported radio and particularly internet radio. Despite Sirius XM\u2019s traditional strength in cars, its new partner has an attractive presence in the wider world of internet and mobile music outside cars.\u201cThis strategic investment in Pandora represents a unique opportunity for Sirius XM to create value for its stockholders by investing in the leader in the ad-supported digital radio business, a space where Sirius XM does not play today,\u201d James E. Meyer, Sirius XM\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The agreement on Friday means Sirius XM will replace KKR, the giant investment firm, as Pandora\u2019s major financial backer. Just last month, KKR agreed to invest $150 million in the internet radio service.Pandora, already reeling, will be penalized for swapping partners so quickly: As part of Friday\u2019s complex series of deals, it agreed to pay KKR a $22.5 million termination fee for what amounts to a month of work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "FeatureAndrew Left sniffs out corporate fraud \u2014 and gets rich doing it.Supported byIn the finance world, Left, 46, is what is known as an \u201cactivist\u201d short-seller. After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company\u2019s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries \u2014 Tesla, Valeant, GoPro \u2014 and though he makes mistakes, he has an unusually high success rate.For a year he had been assembling a file on Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefits manager with $100 billion in revenue. Pharmacy-benefits managers occupy an eye-glazingly complex netherworld in the prescription-drug supply chain, serving as intermediaries between drug makers and insurers. Express Scripts ostensibly exists to keep drug prices low, by negotiating with drug makers on behalf of insurers, but Left believed that the company was actually inflating them, because higher prices meant larger rebates from the drug makers, which meant more profit. He believed that this was true of all pharmacy-benefits managers, but especially of Express Scripts, the most powerful. Its second-largest customer was the Department of Defense; downward pressure on drug pricing from the government could seriously threaten its bottom line.By rights, then, Trump\u2019s threat in the interview should have tanked Express Scripts\u2019 stock. That the price remained unchanged indicated to Left that many people on Wall Street had no clue what a pharmacy-benefits manager does. Trump, he thought as he pulled out of the Madison Club, had given his stale, year-old story a fresh hook. (A spokesman for Express Scripts denied Left\u2019s claims, noting that \u201croughly 90 percent of rebates go directly to our clients.\u201d)Fifteen minutes later, Left was driving west on Interstate 10 in his black Bentley Continental GT. From the car, he placed a call to a hedge-fund manager, a man who was already short Express Scripts and therefore had a stake in providing Left with information. Express Scripts, this man reminded Left, did not disclose the amount it made in rebates, while some of its operating metrics exceeded those of Apple; something seemed wrong.Left heard \u201crebates\u201d and thought \u201ckickbacks.\u201d Express Scripts was, in Left\u2019s mind, \u201cthe man behind the man\u201d; it was \u201cthe mob.\u201d If he went public with a short position tomorrow, he wagered, he could sour Wall Street\u2019s perception of the company, transforming it from a sure thing into a noisy, chaotic mess. That attention might in turn attract regulators, further driving down the share price. He called his web designer, Mike Leznik, and told him that he wanted to buy a domain name to host his research on Express Scripts. An hour later the road snaked above Studio City, and he arrived at Mulholland Estates, his gated community in Beverly Hills.The next morning, Left stood in his home office and put CNBC on the television. The anchors were discussing the \u201cTrump bump,\u201d as the recent stock rally was being called. \u201cThey sit around all day long without ever knowing anything,\u201d Left said. \u201cIt\u2019s so annoying to watch them.\u201d Seated beneath the TV was Leznik, a sweet-natured Angeleno in jeans and blue-suede sneakers. Leznik lacked the macho swagger that made Left, with his money and filthy mouth, the center of a room. Nowhere was this truer than in his office. A giant desk dominated the back half. On the credenza sat cigar boxes from Enron and Madoff Securities \u2014 a short-seller\u2019s version of trophy antlers.\u201cWhat should I register the domain name as?\u201d Leznik asked.\u201cYour mother is a whore dot com?\u201d Left said.\u201cThe real story of \u2014 \u201d Leznik suggested.\u201cThe real story of your mother being a whore?\u201d Left said.Leznik settled on TheRealExpressScripts.com, then asked Left for his credit card to buy the URL.\u201cWhat are you, my wife?\u201d Left said.There were several obvious comebacks to this \u2014 \u201cYou wish\u201d being the absolute minimum \u2014 but none occurred to Leznik, who after fumbling for a moment said, \u201cI could be, if you had enough room.\u201d A whiff. The room was silenced.At 10 a.m., having placed his bet against the stock the night before, Left put out his first tweet, which he misspelled and deleted four times. Such is his mystique in the world of finance, however, that one of his followers assumed that the misspellings and deletions were part of a premeditated scheme to exploit Twitter\u2019s visibility algorithms. Finally the corrected version of the tweet came out from Left\u2019s handle, @CitronResearch, followed moments later by another: \u201cWhen @RealDonaldTrump goes after $ESRX,\u201d it read, using the ticker symbol for Express Scripts, \u201cheads will roll.\u201d We sat back and waited, eyes on CNBC. Twenty minutes passed. Suddenly a news flash interrupted the show. \u201cExpress Scripts shares are falling sharply on a spike in volume,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cCitron Research, run by Andrew Left, tweeted about the stock. They\u2019re now down by 9 or 10 percent, about 9.2 million shares so far.\u201d Left\u2019s tweet appeared in the corner of the screen. In the office, the atmosphere went taut.We watched as the stock came down, dollar after dollar, from 75 to 74 to 73; 72, 71, 70. Left wrote two more tweets, including a promise to appear on television with further revelations. Soon, the phone started ringing \u2014 reporters calling. Linette Lopez from Business Insider texted for quotes. CNBC booked him for 2 p.m. that day. \u201cThe question is,\u201d Left told a journalist from Bloomberg, \u201cis the new administration serious? He\u2019s going to rein in drug pricing. O.K., Mr. Trump, here\u2019s my advice: I know the industry. Go after Express Scripts.\u201d\u201cDo you have a short position?\u201d the reporter from Bloomberg asked.\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Left said.\u201cExpress Scripts, as we\u2019re talking, continues to drop,\u201d the anchor on CNBC said.In 15 minutes, $6 billion of market capitalization vanished. (Five months later, the stock price is still down 13 percent.) Left considered the circus around him. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201csome guys know this stuff better than me. But I know how to put it in [expletive] tweets.\u201dAt any given moment, someone, somewhere, has a short position in whatever stock you can think of \u2014 99 percent of all stocks in the world, by some estimates. Blue-chip stocks like Apple and Google are being shorted. Shake Shack is being shorted to an unhealthy degree: Almost half its shares are borrowed. As you read this, people are short on The New York Times. Almost uniquely among Wall Street maneuvers, short-selling entails what traders call infinite downside. While potential profit is constrained by the distance between the current share price and zero, the potential loss is not, because the shares, once borrowed, can rise in price indefinitely, which means the cost of returning them can, too. It\u2019s unsurprising that short-sellers tend to be aggressive men who are convinced that they see what other people miss and are comfortable with \u2014 or addicted to \u2014 risk.For many years that risk was taken on in secret: Short-sellers would make their bets and passively wait for the market to move in their direction. The figure of the activist, who goes public with his positions, emerged into prominence in recent years. One crucial event in Wall Street history provided the foundation. In 2001, James Chanos, a hedge-fund manager, discovered an accounting scandal at Enron, then a little-known energy company in Texas, and shared his information with journalists from Fortune. The journalists got a best seller, Chanos got his money and Jeffrey Skilling, Enron\u2019s chief executive, got 24 years at the Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Ala.Short-sellers of Left\u2019s generation are following this example but cutting out the middleman. You don\u2019t need an office in a flashy building in the Battery, they have realized, or the validation of the press. If you build enough of a reputation, all you need are some Twitter followers and a website. Left has emerged at the forefront of this new guard. Unlike Chanos, who managed billions of dollars of other people\u2019s money, Left invests his own, which exempts him from disclosing his holdings to the public. And now that his work has brought him national attention, he has found that others are willing to make it easier, by leaking documents to him and passing tips. In many cases, Left\u2019s dossiers against his targets are not wholly his own but built using information from a confidential source. He is, in this sense, a bit like a journalist.He also makes it look easy. One result of Left\u2019s fame is that today\u2019s younger traders believe that they, too, could be him. Wuyang Zhao, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who wrote his dissertation on activist short-selling, told me: \u201cPeople read Andrew Left, and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, my God, it\u2019s not impossibly difficult. It\u2019s not a lot of work, and you can bring down a big company.\u2019\u2009\u201d One of Left\u2019s friends recalled a visit Left made to a university to give a lecture. In the hallways afterward, the students swarmed him. \u201cIt was like he was Mick Jagger,\u201d the friend said.From 2006 to 2015, the number of activist short campaigns rose by 1,300 percent, to 1,289. In the past three years, the number of activist short-sellers working globally has nearly doubled, to 72 from 39. Very few have a positive track record. Left does. On average, the value of companies he writes about drop 10 percent in a year, and some drop as much as 95 percent.One morning last spring, Left and I stood in his lush backyard while he smoked a Marlboro Light. Beyond the swimming pool, the land fell sharply into the valley, and Los Angeles lay prone in the heat. We could see DJ Khaled\u2019s recently purchased house over the fence to our left. Tan and unshaven in loafers, Left possessed the vaguely louche charisma of a club promoter, which is what you might mistake him for were it not for his eyes \u2014 green, wet, melancholy eyes, which, because they cannot but project sincerity, are his greatest tools on television. His eyes are the reason he could stand in his million-dollar lawn and say to me, without irony, \u201cI\u2019m an investigative journalist who trades on his information.\u201dI observed that most investigative journalists could not count DJ Khaled as a neighbor.\u201cThe difference between this and journalism is you can make millions of dollars,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut you can lose millions of dollars, too.\u201dWhen I found him at the airport, he was wearing distressed jeans and a golf shirt, barking into an iPhone. He had just flown back from a vacation in Florida. During the 45-minute drive to his house, Left, never hanging up, floated and discarded a variety of plans. They were: exposing a jewelry chain as a subprime lender in disguise; shorting a maybe-fraudulent media company in Canada; and withdrawing a million-dollar cashier\u2019s check from his bank, made out to a pharmaceutical company, to be offered as a donation to the charity of its choice if it could prove to him the efficacy of a drug for multiple sclerosis, still in trials, which Left had on authority from the \u201crabbi of M.S.\u201d didn\u2019t work.The man on the other end of the line was a hedge-fund manager, this one a very close associate of Left\u2019s, at the center of his circle of sources. His relationship with Left was completely informal. His role was to trade ideas back and forth, sometimes shorting the companies they discussed. In exchange for sharing his insight and institutional muscle, Left\u2019s source avoided the legal liability that came from going public with a position. (A short campaign based on faulty information leaves you open to accusations of market manipulation, something Left has never been charged with in the United States.) Left has a number of sources on Wall Street, and during the months I spent reporting on him, he took care to keep their names from me, lest he burn them.Left also got tips as many journalists do, in large quantities, most of them useless. Business-school wannabes emailed him to get noticed. E-Trade cowboys offered schemes \u201cfor your eyes only.\u201d Hedge funds sent him research and ideas, most often because they wanted him to catalyze a short position they already held, by taking it public. What many of these people failed to grasp was that a bad company wasn\u2019t necessarily a good story. One morning, I watched him read his emails. \u201cGildan T-shirts,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThat idea does nothing for me. Who gives a [expletive] about Gildan?\u201dThen there was a third set of sources he used: tips of no discernible origin. In March 2012, for instance, a package without a return address landed on his doorstep. Inside were 68 pages of research claiming that a Chinese real estate company, Evergrande, was perpetrating an accounting fraud and would collapse. An odd tone pervaded, as if a very strait-laced stock analyst were trying to loosen up and channel Left\u2019s combative voice (\u201cChairman Hui\u2019s pet projects are comically off-strategy ... the endgame is nearing ... a maze of Ponzi-esque debt\u201d). Left hired a fact-checker, became convinced that the claims were accurate, updated some figures and published. The stock instantly dropped 7 percent. He covered a portion of his position two hours later, taking $280,000 in profit.But the profit was only the beginning of the story. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission sued Left for \u201cfalse and misleading claims,\u201d a failure to adequately support his accusations with evidence. The judge found him guilty and barred him from trading on the Chinese markets for five years. (Left objects to the decision on free-speech grounds and is appealing the ruling.) He refused to give up the name of his fact-checker. As to the identity of the anonymous sender, there was nothing to give up: Left had no idea who it was, except someone who almost certainly had a short position in Evergrande and made a fortune off the publication without the hassle of appearing in court. That was the point of using physical paper. Courts can subpoena your emails, but good luck tracing the mail backward from your gated community in Beverly Hills.As careful as Left must be to fact-check, hesitation hurts, too. If you\u2019re slow, other shorts can scoop you, which is exactly what happened with the online postage seller: A competitor had published a version of Left\u2019s thesis on a finance blog, and the stock\u2019s price had fallen too far to short. Back at his home office, Left tried to work, but the atmosphere was lazy, diffuse. He called a source. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he said, asking about the postage stock. \u201cWill it bounce?\u201d The source replied that it would not.Left squinted at CNBC. Then he roared. It began as a self-mocking \u201cWhy me?\u201d exasperation but expanded into something more unhindered, a primal American shriek. \u201cUugghHHAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH\u200bHHHHHHHHHH.\u201dWhen he was through, he said, almost to himself, \u201cThere has got to be an easier way to make money.\u201dRecognizing his ability to dazzle an audience at a young age, Black wanted her son to become a lawyer or a rabbi. Instead, he was accepted at Northeastern and chose political science. Boston confronted him for the first time with people who had always had money. They knew that Beverly Hills was an actual place in California, not a made-up city on TV. They wore black. They didn\u2019t drink Bartles & Jaymes.After graduating in 1993, Left responded to a newspaper ad from an outfit called the Universal Commodity Corporation, offering $100,000 a year for work in what the advertiser knew not to call a boiler room. Boiler rooms are cold-call centers for stocks, where men in bare-walled offices put the screws on unsophisticated marks. (As in: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Mrs. Jones. I\u2019d hate to see your husband miss out.\u201d) Roberta Karmel, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regulator who policed the Long Island boiler rooms in the 1980s, described to me a typical employee. \u201cHe tended to go to lesser schools for college,\u201d she said. \u201cOr not go to college at all. And a lot of them were kind of scrappy personalities who thought: Well, I\u2019m just as smart as the people at the white-shoe firms. I can make a lot of money, too.\u201dMaybe \u2014 if you\u2019re good at it. Left was not. He would meander off script and lose the sale. He quit after nine months, ejecting himself into the mid-\u201990s froth, where there was very little oversight and, almost everywhere you looked, a thick layer of scumminess. These were the years when the future \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d author Jordan Belfort ran a brokerage firm on Long Island, taking small companies public. Left started flipping penny-stock I.P.O.s, including Belfort\u2019s \u2014 he would call up the \u201cbucket shops,\u201d or storefront stock exchanges, ask for shares before a company went public and then sell them later at a profit.At the time, the Long Island bucket shops were pumping obscure stocks to whoever would buy them. The typical scam involved inflating the price by lying to your customers, then selling your own shares as close to the peak as possible before those customers got wiped out. (In 1999, a judge sentenced Belfort to four years for fraud. He served 22 months.) In the back of Left\u2019s mind, a realization glimmered. With the money he had saved from a few successful trades, he started shorting Belfort and the others, covering his positions after the price bottomed out \u2014 in effect profiting from their fraud. He was just getting the hang of it when the market crashed. He moved to California.In the mid-\u201990s, traders were just beginning to publish their theses online. An idea occurred to Left: Take the short positions he wielded against the Long Island companies and aim them up at big companies, the more elite the better, using the internet to disseminate the research. Instead of writing in the mode of a traditional stock analyst, he would distill his arguments down to internet-friendly length. The word \u201cblog\u201d was just starting to enter the lexicon. Left registered a domain name. He decided to stay in California. He would come to talk about frauds the way surfers talk about waves.To its fans on Wall Street, Valeant represented a brand-new model for the drug business. It didn\u2019t spend money on research and development, as most drug companies did. Instead, it bought valuable patents for drugs that others had developed, then jacked up the prices. To critics, Valeant was an abusive acquisition machine that produced nothing of value and would choke on its own debt. Senator Bernie Sanders lambasted it. Shares traded above $200.On Sept. 28, 2015, Left released his first report on the company. \u201cThis article is not for you hedge-fund managers who think that this quarter\u2019s profit is more important than human decency,\u201d it read. \u201cThis article is for the millions of Americans who together can mandate change.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhile the whole country is in an uproar about Turing Pharmaceuticals, a one-drug start-up pharma company attempting to raise prices on a single AIDS drug, the real issue is a $100 billion monster only Wall Street could love \u2014 an extremely leveraged company that set the standard for this type of abuse, while being cheered on by a cadre of Wall Street high-rollers too wealthy to fret over their own personal health care costs, and its posse of hedge-fund operators.\u201d A second report followed, demanding that Congress subpoena Valeant\u2019s executives.Pearson called the comparison \u201cerroneous\u201d and asked the S.E.C. to investigate Left. But as any public-relations agent knows, if you\u2019re denying, you\u2019re already on the back foot. By the time the company announced an emergency news conference the following morning, the stock was down 40 percent. \u201cAndrew erased the idea that buying Valeant was a smart strategy,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI just thought it was a good story. Andrew knew it was a ball of gasoline-soaked rags. He threw a match on it.\u201dAmong those who smelled smoke was the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. In November 2016, he indicted two men on charges of wire fraud and kickbacks: Gary Tanner, a senior executive at Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, the chief executive of Philidor. For all intents and purposes, the indictment alleges, Philidor was not an independent company. That much Left had suspected. What was shocking was the nature of the relationship between the businesses. It was not simple channel stuffing, the indictment alleges, but theft. According to the document, Tanner would sell Davenport millions of dollars of drugs. Then Davenport would share with Tanner the incentive payments he received from Valeant, moving the money through a shell company. Meanwhile Tanner misled his Valeant colleagues into believing that a competitor wanted to buy Philidor. The ultimate goal, the indictment claims, was to inflate Philidor\u2019s value until Valeant acquired it at a huge markup, at which point the two would split the millions that Davenport would earn from the sale as Philidor\u2019s largest stakeholder. (Through a representative, Valeant said it was the victim, not the perpetrator, of the fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note the indictment involved one former employee,\u201d the company wrote, adding that it has increased R.&D. investment by 26 percent.)We rode the elevator to a silent floor, where the receptionist clocked him as he entered. \u201cHey, Andy.\u201d Desks sat empty; the morning crew was here to shoot the 9:30 spots for the New York market, but in Los Angeles the day hadn\u2019t started. A tech came out to lead us to the studio. He was a gentle man in middle age, soft-featured, wearing cargo pants and thick black sneakers, a big brown mustache, warm eyes. He knew Left from the Valeant short and liked to watch him stick it to the Wall Street bosses. All day, people came through the studio rattling off finance acronyms, Ebitda this and Gaap that. Left spoke English.The tech set Left up on a director\u2019s chair. A screen behind his head projected a slightly more outdated version of the skyline than was visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows off-camera to the left and right. Left opened his notes and put his earpiece in. A few seconds into the interview, the anchor fell into a trap. \u201cHow much do you think Express Scripts makes off rebates off a high-priced drug?\u201d he asked.The tech was looking at Left. \u201cYou\u2019re our best guest,\u201d he said. \u201cOur most controversial guest.\u201d\u201cBut not the handsomest,\u201d Left said.\u201cWe\u2019re in West Hollywood,\u201d the tech apologized. On-screen, the anchors moved on to the morning\u2019s next story, the appointment to the Trump administration of the president of Goldman Sachs. Left rode the elevator down to the lobby and slipped outside, where the blue glass tower dwarfed him.Claire Stovall, a researcher at the industry analyst Activist Shorts, told me that the situation was not necessarily to be feared. \u201cThe market is often quicker than the government at catching frauds,\u201d Stovall said. And most successful activist short campaigns produce no regulatory action anyway. But Zhao took a dimmer view. \u201cIf you create a deregulated boom not supported by fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will have a disaster. The activist short-sellers will make a fortune. But sometimes, as a member of society, you don\u2019t want to have a total collapse.\u201dIn retrospect, it is not coincidental that 2015 was the year Left became famous. His tactics matched our mood. Most of us do not care about a random pharmaceutical company meeting its debt covenants. We care about getting medicine at a price we can afford. We don\u2019t care about organic versus inorganic growth, but we worry that our kids will have no coverage if the Trump administration repeals Obamacare. Left\u2019s very timely gift is to connect our daily human concerns to the convoluted operations of the economy, wrapping financial analysis in a moral, populist language that is calibrated precisely to draw maximum attention in a media environment in which screaming is the only way to be heard.As for those being screamed at, the banks and the business schools that feed them, Left represents at best an interesting character and at worst a nuisance. American high finance is extraordinarily good at absorbing attacks on it. Just a few months ago, Left delivered a keynote speech at Harvard Business School\u2019s annual investment conference, where students who could afford the $72,000 tuition calmly imbibed Left\u2019s strategies, which were once considered fringe. He texted me a photo of himself in Harvard Yard, looking comfortable and middle-aged, smiling, his eyes closed.An article on June 11 about a short-seller referred incorrectly to Daraprim, the drug whose price was increased 56-fold by Turing Pharmaceuticals. The company bought the marketing rights, not the patent, to the drug.Advertisement"}

In March, the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group, reported that in 2016 streaming services generated $3.9 billion in sales in the United States, representing 51 percent of revenues.Ms. Swift\u2019s music is returning to all major streaming services, including Spotify, Amazon and Google Play, and will be on both free and paid levels of Spotify. (Her music is already on Apple Music, which has also financed a concert film for her and put her in commercials.)On Twitter, some listeners also nursed a darker intention to Ms. Swift\u2019s timing: Tonight is also when Katy Perry, her biggest pop rival, is releasing a new album.Advertisement"}

This was a short week since we started it off with Memorial Day and, fortunately, no tech companies were sadistic enough to drop news on us on a sacred holiday.I have no idea how this whole thing is going to turn out. All I know is that this is hardly the way Uber wanted its widely acclaimed acquisition of Otto, the self-driving trucking company started by Levandowski, to go.So, I guess, at least that headache is solved, for now?We don\u2019t know what the report will say \u2014 it could be damning, or it could soft-pedal the whole thing \u2014 but either way, Uber\u2019s moment under the media glare isn\u2019t going to end soon.Good for him, though an entirely new consumer electronics company seems like a tough sell in an age where Apple and Samsung are sucking up all the hardware profits.Honestly, the degree to which others have decided to just carve up Snapchat\u2019s product ideas is inspiring. Nothing is sacred in Silicon Valley \u2014 I guess you can thank Mark Zuckerberg and his various properties for that initial inspiration.More than anyone else in tech, Musk has made saving humanity from global catastrophe his thing. It\u2019s the central thread running through his companies \u2014 he wants Tesla to push us to a hyper-efficient, solar-powered future, and he wants SpaceX to get us to Mars, as a backup.What\u2019s interesting is that he thought he could convince Trump of the wisdom of his ideas. Musk was among many executives who\u2019d pleaded with the president not to ditch the Paris agreement. He did so at a heavy cost to his reputation \u2014 and he got nothing for it, apparently.The more cynical side of me wonders why push back on this rather than, say, the tepid and slow-moving response to the travel ban a few months back, which also disproportionately affected tech companies\u2019 work forces? Is it because they have more cover now since this decision was widely disliked? Or is it because they\u2019re realizing no amount of platitudes seem to get through to this president?And I suspect that history informed their moves here. The tech companies are rational and global in their outlook \u2014 they understand that their employees, many of their customers and essentially all of the governments they deal with around the world were going to oppose Trump\u2019s policies. So it made sense for them to push back hard. They had nothing to lose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turmoil Continues at Pandora Media as Its Chief Executive Resigns", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byA year ago, Pandora Media was full of ambition.But on Tuesday, Mr. Westergren left the company after only 15 months at the helm, and over the last few weeks many of the company\u2019s boldest plans have been jettisoned or cast into doubt.Roger Faxon, a Pandora board member, said in a statement that the recent moves were meant to \u201crefocus and reinforce\u201d the company, and that Pandora was still committed to its new subscription platforms.Yet as many analysts see it, Mr. Westergren\u2019s departure was an inevitable result of the investment from Sirius XM, the satellite radio giant controlled by Liberty Media. Executives at those companies, particularly Gregory B. Maffei, Liberty\u2019s chief, have made it clear that they admire Pandora\u2019s core advertising business but have little interest in the rest.\u201cThis is the door being opened wide for the Liberty-Sirius XM team to come in with a new agenda for Pandora,\u201d said Barton Crockett, a media analyst with FBR Capital Markets.The exit of Mr. Westergren, a former musician who has been internet radio\u2019s most enthusiastic evangelist, is the most dramatic development in a tumultuous year for the company, full of management departures, a falling stock price and continual pressure from Wall Street to sell.Mr. Westergren, who also left his position on the board, did not respond to messages seeking comment. But in a statement issued by Pandora, he said he was \u201cincredibly proud of the company we have built.\u201d\u201cWe invented a whole new way of enjoying and discovering music,\u201d Mr. Westergren added, \u201cand in doing so, forever changed the listening experience for millions.\u201dMr. Westergren was one of the founders of the company in 2000, when it was called Savage Beast Technologies and sold music recommendation services to businesses like Best Buy. He was chief executive of Savage Beast from 2002 to 2004.Renamed Pandora Media in 2005, the company became by far the most popular internet radio service, using a proprietary music genome technology that analyzed the characteristics of songs its users liked, and fed them others like it.One of the few digital music brands to become a household name, Pandora amassed 80 million regular users and built a substantial advertising business, generating more than $1 billion in sales last year.But the company antagonized the music industry along the way, and was slow to adapt to the challenges posed by Spotify and Apple.After taking over as chief executive in March 2016, Mr. Westergren tried to remake the service, striking licensing deals with record companies for a new subscription service, Pandora Premium, that let users listen to any song for $10 a month.Investors were skeptical of those plans, and worried about all the cash Pandora was burning through.In the third quarter of last year, for example, Pandora\u2019s new music deals contributed to a $93 million jump in its licensing costs, and by the end of 2016, the company logged a $343 million net loss, double its loss from the year before, according to filings.The sale of Ticketfly was another bruising experience. Pandora bought the company, a fast-growing ticket provider for clubs and theaters, in late 2015 for $335 million, and this month sold it to Eventbrite, another ticketing start-up, for just $200 million.When he took over last year, Mr. Westergren said repeatedly that Pandora was not for sale, despite strong pressure from activist investors and a sagging stock price; since the beginning of the year, its shares are down by a third. But a deal of some kind seemed inevitable.Since Sirius XM\u2019s investment was announced on June 9, Pandora\u2019s board has faced a conflict between Mr. Westergren\u2019s expansive plans for the company and the wishes of its incoming directors. Recruiting a strong new chief executive would have been problematic with Mr. Westergren still on the board.\u201cTim stepped in to be C.E.O. at a critical time for the company,\u201d Timothy J. Leiweke, another board member, said in a statement, \u201cand was quickly able to reset relations with the major labels, launch our on-demand service, reconstitute the management team and refortify our balance sheet by securing an investment from Sirius XM.\u201dOver the last year, there has been continual turnover among Pandora\u2019s executive ranks. Sara Clemens, the chief operating officer and a driving force behind its acquisition strategy, resigned in December. In April, just weeks after the company released Pandora Premium, its chief technology officer left.On Tuesday, Pandora announced that Michael S. Herring, its president and former chief financial officer, and Nick Bartle, who had joined the company only nine months ago as chief marketing officer, were also leaving.A Pandora spokeswoman also confirmed that the company would soon be exiting Australia and New Zealand, the only countries where it operated outside the United States.With these changes, Pandora will have undergone a nearly complete overhaul of its management in a little more than a year. More moves are expected, although analysts are hoping that the latest changes, and some level of control from Sirius XM, will steady the company.\u201cThis is the calm after the storm,\u201d said Amy Yong, a media analyst at Macquarie Securities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Piles On the Features, and Users Say, \u2018Enough!\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Apple prepares to show off new features for the iPhone and other devices at its developer conference on Monday, the company is grappling with an uncomfortable issue: Many of its existing features are already too complicated for many users to figure out.But the process of finding and installing other apps in Messages is so tricky that most users have no idea they can even do it, developers and analysts say.\u201cWhile we didn\u2019t end up moving forward with it, we\u2019re excited about other ways we\u2019re making delivery faster and more efficient,\u201d Andy Fang, a founder of DoorDash and the company\u2019s chief technology officer, said in a statement.Velapp has just released a video recording app that uses 3-D Touch to help users select the best parts of a video while recording it. But Mr. de Min said that few other developers were using the technology, in part because iPhone users were unaware of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can really see,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand it.\u201dApple, which declined to comment for this article, makes many updates that are popular with users, from changes to the Siri voice assistant to automatically transcribed voice mail messages.At this year\u2019s Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, Calif., the company is expected to introduce improved Mac computers and iPads, software updates for all of its hardware and a voice-activated speaker to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home.With Apple adding fewer major features in recent years, customers have been slower to upgrade their devices.App developers are also pausing in what had been a race to embrace Apple\u2019s latest innovations. Eliran Sapir, chief executive of Apptopia, an analytics firm, said that new apps were being introduced at half the rate they were a year ago.Apple TV apps are hot, he said, but developers are fleeing Apple Watch. \u201cThere is no way to monetize the watch whatsoever,\u201d he said.The slow uptake of apps for Messages and 3-D Touch is evident in the numbers.There are 5,000 regular apps and 30,000 sticker apps for Messages, according to Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Only about 3,600 of the 2.5 million apps in the iOS app store promote their compatibility with 3-D Touch.\u201cYou get your new iPhone and you don\u2019t know that 3-D Touch and apps in Messages even exist,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. Although stickers account for 97 of the top 100 Messages apps, he said, some users are so confused that they post app reviews like, \u201cI downloaded these Disney stickers. How do I use them?\u201dThat is not exactly in line with the simple \u201cit just works\u201d philosophy that Apple built its business on.Apple is not the only major technology company struggling to find the right balance between constant innovation and ease of use. Facebook has changed course several times in its approach to apps and bots within its Messenger app and regularly battles feature overload in its News Feed. Google, whose search box is a paragon of simplicity, famously retreated from an attempt to tie all of its services together with the unwieldy Google Plus social network.Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, which makes apps for companies like JetBlue Airways and Turner, said he would like to see Apple simplify and smooth out some of its current features. He said Messages apps have potential if Apple can figure out how to make it easier for people to find them.Mr. Reubenstein pointed to a feature of Google Photos as an example of the simplicity that people want. He said he backs up his iPhone photos to Google, which uses face recognition to tag people in the images. For Mother\u2019s Day, Google made it so easy to create quick movies from those photos that he made three, for his mother, his mother-in-law and his wife.\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s a discoverability issue,\u201d said Mr. Duncan, who worked part time on Apple\u2019s telephone tech-support team during college and hopes to get a design job there in the future. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know the stickers exist.\u201dHe said he had to teach his friends how to install and use Messages stickers by sending them multiple screenshots.\u201cA lot of people will think it\u2019s their fault, and it\u2019s really the designer\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want apps to be easy to use.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Fined Record $2.7 Billion in E.U. Antitrust Ruling", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byGoogle suffered a major blow on Tuesday after European antitrust officials fined the search giant a record $2.7 billion for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals.The penalty, of 2.4 billion euros, highlights the aggressive stance that European officials have taken in regulating many of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, going significantly further than their American counterparts.\u201cIn Europe, companies must compete on the merits regardless if they are European or not,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules.\u201dThe apparent focus on Silicon Valley has prompted accusations from some in the United States that the European Union is unfairly targeting American companies. Officials in the bloc vigorously deny those assertions.In targeting the activities of these digital giants, experts say, European authorities are laying down a marker for more hands-on control of how the digital world operates. And while the $2.7 billion fine announced on Tuesday is tiny compared with Google\u2019s $90 billion in annual revenue, it highlights the region\u2019s willingness to dole out sizable penalties.Shares of Google fell for a second straight day on the news. The stock declined 2.5 percent on Tuesday, a steeper decline than the broader Nasdaq.Europe\u2019s latest efforts to rein in technology companies stem from continuing unease that Silicon Valley has come to dominate how the continent\u2019s 500 million citizens interact online.\u201cEurope is setting the agenda,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like that.\u201dIn her statement on Tuesday, Ms. Vestager said that Google held a dominant position in online search, requiring the company to take extra measures to ensure that its digital services did not crowd out those of rivals.The antitrust decision related to Google\u2019s online shopping service, which the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said had received preferential treatment compared with those of rivals in specialized search results.Analysts say such so-called vertical search products \u2014 also including those for restaurant and business reviews \u2014 represent a fast-growing percentage of Google\u2019s annual revenue. The company does not break out earnings figures for this unit in its financial reports.The search company is facing two separate antitrust charges in Europe related to Android, its popular mobile software, and to some of its advertising products. Google denies the accusations.Google rebuffed the European Union\u2019s claims on Tuesday, saying that its services had helped the region\u2019s digital economy grow. It has also said that significant online competition remains in Europe, including from companies like Amazon and eBay.Despite Google\u2019s denials, the record fine \u2014 the previous high, against Intel in 2009, was \u20ac1.06 billion \u2014 represents a bloody nose for a company that holds a market share of more than 90 percent in online search in Europe.Several other antitrust complaints related to other specialized search results have been filed in Europe against Google, and Ms. Vestager said Tuesday\u2019s announcement could \u201cbe used as a framework\u201d in those investigations.That may eventually lead to further fines if European authorities find wrongdoing. The complaints include many from other American technology companies, including Oracle, News Corporation and Yelp, which have been vocal advocates of large fines against Google.Google has 90 days to respond to the European Commission\u2019s demands, or face penalties of up to 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, its parent company. European officials said on Tuesday that they would regularly monitor the company\u2019s activities to ensure that it was complying with the ruling.Under European rules, the company \u2014 and not the regulator \u2014 must come up with proposals to guarantee that it treats competitors fairly when people make online search queries. The authorities can demand that Google make further changes if they are not satisfied with the initial proposals.Analysts and many of Google\u2019s competitors have called for an independent monitor to oversee the company\u2019s digital services in Europe, which could include oversight of its search algorithms, some of Google\u2019s most important intellectual property. The company is likely to fiercely oppose such a move.Google has other options, including the removal of some of its specialized search services from Europe, or returning them to how they operated before the European Union\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.Whatever the outcome, analysts say they expect a protracted legal battle that will continue for several years as both Google and its rivals fight to define how search services are provided in Europe and elsewhere.\u201cGoogle\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a co-founder of Foundem, a British comparison-shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google. \u201cLeft unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New iPad Pro Inches Toward Replacing PC, but Falls Short", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byTech FixThat situation is unlikely to change with Apple\u2019s newest iPad Pro, which will be released this week. The professional tablet, which comes in two screen sizes \u2014 10.5 or 12.9 diagonal inches \u2014 is incrementally improved from previous models. It is faster, with a brighter display and a higher refresh rate that makes motion look buttery smooth. In addition, the screen on the smaller iPad Pro has been enlarged slightly from 9.7 inches.But after about a week of testing the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, I concluded that Apple\u2019s professional tablet still suffers from some of the same problems when compared with a laptop. Most important, keyboard typing is not comfortable, and some tasks are better done with a mouse than with a touch screen. In the end, I would still recommend a traditional laptop for most professionals.What Has ImprovedThe most significant improvement to the iPad Pro is speed. The new tablet is notably faster: In speed tests run with the app Geekbench, the new iPad Pro was roughly 50 percent faster than its predecessor.That means if you upgrade from an iPad older than last year\u2019s model, you will get a tremendous speed increase. The speed boost makes the new iPad Pro better at intense tasks like juggling multiple apps, editing high-resolution photos and playing graphics-heavy games.The new iPad Pros also include a higher screen refresh rate. That makes motion look smoother, which is noticeable when opening or closing apps and scrolling through documents or websites. It is also supposed to make some games look better, but as of this writing, game developers had yet to update their apps to support the higher refresh rate.The other notable change is the increased screen size of the smaller iPad Pro. Apple slimmed down the bezel \u2014 or the border surrounding the screen \u2014 to make more room for the display; the tablet\u2019s body is also slightly larger and heavier. Over all, this is a better size for the smaller iPad Pro, partly because the increased size also gave room for Apple to make a slightly larger version of its physical keyboard, called Smart Keyboard.What Falls ShortEnlarging the smaller iPad Pro was an effort to address the tablet\u2019s greatest weakness: typing. The Smart Keyboard is essentially a protective cover for the screen with a keyboard and magnet built into it. When you open it, the tablet rests on top of the keyboard, held in place by the magnet.Here\u2019s the problem: The Smart Keyboard is thin and the keys do not click well or feel as satisfying to type on as the keyboards on a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air; after a long period of typing, the Smart Keyboard felt flimsy. The keyboard for the 10.5-inch model is still small and cramped compared with a MacBook keyboard.The other issue is ergonomics. Using the touch screen in combination with the Apple keyboard can be a pain on the wrist.Say, for example, you are using the keyboard to scroll through an email or website: If you want to open a link, you have to lift your hand away from the keyboard and tap the link. Or say you want to adjust the screen brightness or hit pause on a music track while typing: Both actions require reaching up and touching the screen. These keyboard-to-touch-screen reps get tiring.In my experience, using a keyboard and trackpad on a laptop feels like a more comfortable combination for crunching through a busy day of emails, messages, documents, spreadsheets and calendar entries.The other issues with the iPad are related to software and may be resolved this year. For example, you can have two apps open side by side with the iPad Pro. You can use each app independently, but the two apps cannot interact with each other easily: You cannot drag and drop a photo or file from one app to the other, for example. Fortunately, Apple is set to release a drag-and-drop feature this fall in iOS 11, its next mobile operating system. The operating system will also add the ability to display up to three apps at the same time and introduce a file system, which could make juggling tasks between applications easier.Who should buy one?In its current state, the iPad Pro is in an awkward position among Apple\u2019s product lineup. A small set of professionals who do not do much typing \u2014 like artists and illustrators \u2014 could probably get away with using an iPad Pro with a stylus as a stand-alone computer. But most professionals would probably benefit from using a personal computer combined with a smartphone and tablet.As for me, I must confess: I used the iPad Pro in research and outlining for this review. But when it came to writing it while reviewing notes simultaneously, I switched back to my MacBook Air, largely because the keyboard felt better to type on and it was easier to multitask with several apps.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What You Get (and What You Don\u2019t) From a $50 Amazon Fire", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhat can $50 buy? An inexpensive pair of sneakers, maybe dinner for two in San Francisco or a couple of tickets to the ballgame. But few ever imagined that it could also buy a tablet computer capable of running apps and streaming Netflix.Amazon\u2019s tablet success stands out because sales of the devices as a whole have been shrinking. Slowing tablet sales have compelled Apple to refresh its iPads more frequently than many of its other products. In fact, Apple on Monday introduced yet another new iPad with a 10.5-inch screen and a starting price of $649.After testing Amazon\u2019s Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 for a week, here\u2019s my verdict: These cheap tablets are ideal for families with children who treat gadgets like toys that can be slammed on a table or thrown against the ground. But if you\u2019re an adult who needs to get the slightest amount of work done on a tablet, you should probably spend the extra money on a big-screen smartphone or an iPad.Here\u2019s what you need to know about what you get \u2014 and what you don\u2019t \u2014 from a $50 Amazon tablet.The best thing about the new tablets is how they feel to hold. Weighing about 10 ounces and 13 ounces, the seven-inch and eight-inch devices were designed to be easily carried in one hand. After spending hours holding the Fire with one hand to read e-books and to watch Netflix videos, my wrist did not feel strained. The compact size also makes these tablets great for children with small hands.The Fire 7 also had surprisingly long battery life for a device this inexpensive. Amazon says it gets about eight hours of juice while juggling various tasks, like browsing the web and running apps. I watched about four and a half hours of video before its battery drained. That\u2019s modest, but enough for playing a feature-length movie before tucking a child into bed. Amazon says the eight-incher has a battery life of 12 hours.While the Fires have mediocre displays with dull colors and noticeable pixelation even when reading e-books, the lower quality is acceptable at this price. I wouldn\u2019t use a Fire for reading digital comics, which usually have a wide range of colors and sharp illustrations, but the tablet is sufficient for flipping through e-books, which are just black text on white pages.For internet speeds, the Fires were reasonably fast at downloads. In my tests on a Wi-Fi network, Apple\u2019s $329 iPad had download speeds of 92 megabits a second, compared with the Fire 7, at 48 megabits a second. While the Fires were only about half as fast as the pricier iPad, 48 megabits a second was more than enough to smoothly stream video and quickly download apps and e-books.The worst part of the Fires is the overall computing power. The tablets are so slow at loading apps and processing tasks that even typing memos is painful; whenever you make a mistake, there is a lag as you backspace to type the correct letter.The sluggishness also makes the Fires terrible for scrolling through web articles. Don\u2019t buy an Amazon tablet if you plan to use it for email, web browsing or playing games with heavy graphics.Another major component lacking from Amazon\u2019s tablets is access to Google\u2019s official app store, the largest mobile software shop with more than 2.5 million apps. The tablets run a modified version of Google\u2019s Android that instead showcases Amazon\u2019s App store. While there are hundreds of thousands of apps inside Amazon\u2019s app store, I found that some of my favorite apps were missing \u2014 namely 1Password, an app for managing passwords.Perhaps the biggest design oversight of the Fire 7 is the placement of the speaker on the back of the tablet. Most other tablets feature the speakers on the bottom or sides so that blockage isn\u2019t a problem.But if you place the tablet bottom-side down on a flat surface to listen to music from the speaker, the sound will be muffled. Instead, you have to lay it screen-side down. The same problem occurs if you hold it with a protective cover on: The back flap covers the speaker. (The Fire 8 does not have this problem, because the speakers are on the side.)Lastly, if you pay the bare minimum of $50 for the seven-incher or $80 for the eight-incher, you are getting a tablet that shows ads, or what Amazon calls \u201cspecial offers.\u201d What that means is the lock screen, which is what you see when you wake up the device, will shuffle through different ads, like e-book or app promotions. You can pay an extra $15 to buy versions of the tablets without sponsored screens.With all that said, would you pay $50 for an adequate e-book reader and TV show and movie player that was easy to carry around everywhere? My guess would be yes.But perhaps the most compelling value proposition is a hidden one: keeping your child\u2019s hands off your fancy iPad.An earlier version of this article used an outdated brand reference to the Amazon Fire tablet. The tables are now simply called Fire, no longer Kindle Fire.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Customer Data in China Was Sold Illegally, Police Say", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "Supported byTo Apple\u2019s mounting problems in China, add official scrutiny over privacy.The Chinese police said this week that they had arrested 22 people suspected of selling the personal data of an unspecified number of Apple customers. The police, in Cangnan County in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the thieves had reaped 50 million renminbi, or about $7.3 million, over an unspecified period.Many of the details were unclear, including the identities of those involved and the severity of the breach.In a statement on Wednesday, the Cangnan police said they found that Apple employees had illegally acquired personal data, then later in the same statement said 20 of the 22 people worked for companies that sell Apple products or are Apple contractors. The police did not disclose information about the other two people. In China, Apple\u2019s products are sold broadly, in electronics chain stores and small booths in shopping malls in addition to the company\u2019s official Apple Stores.The Cangnan police also said the data included the names, Apple identification numbers and phone numbers of Apple users. They did not say whether passwords or financial information like credit card numbers were involved, which would suggest the thieves had access to internal Apple data and would make the breach more serious.The arrests are part of a set of broader difficulties in China for Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif. Sales of iPhones, still a sign of middle-class aspiration in China, have slowed, according to analysts, as the public waits for new models and as Chinese manufacturers of cheaper phones step up their quality and marketing.Still, Apple may simply be caught up in a wider rising of concern over privacy in China.Between widespread malware campaigns and a large number of new internet users, China has become a playground for internet fraudsters. Last year, China tried 361 criminal cases involving violation of personal data, up from 176 in 2015, said Xie Yongjiang, associate director for the Institute of Internet Governance and Law at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.\u201cIt is very common. Every one of us can feel it,\u201d Mr. Xie said. \u201cFor example, after your child is born at a hospital, someone will phone you and ask if you need baby products. When your child turns 3, someone will phone you and ask if your child would go to their nursery school. When your child reaches primary school age, someone will phone you to ask if you need training services.\u201d\u201cYou have no idea who exposed your personal data,\u201d he added.The problem is not new. In one incident reported in the Chinese news media just this week, an employee of a Shanghai delivery company was recently arrested on suspicion of selling clients\u2019 personal data.The problem is not even new to Apple. Last year, 10 employees of an Apple contractor in China were also found with data from more than 80,000 users.Cao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Vision of Computing\u2019s Future: An Information Appliance", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn the late 1970s, Jef Raskin, a pioneering technologist who was one of Apple\u2019s earliest employees, sketched out a radical vision for the future of computing.But now, all of a sudden, Mr. Raskin\u2019s information appliance is here, sitting on my kitchen counter.But these are quibbles. The Echo Show is a remarkable machine, not just for what it is now but for the way it clarifies Amazon\u2019s vision of the future of computing. It\u2019s becoming the model for a new kind of communal, household computer \u2014 a resurrection of Mr. Raskin\u2019s idea of an information appliance, as opposed to Mr. Jobs\u2019s vision of an all-purpose PC.One measure of the power of this vision is how quickly Amazon\u2019s rivals are racing to copy it; both Apple and Google have their own takes on the Echo.It\u2019s questionable how far these rivals will get. Amazon\u2019s business model, which depends on millions of households buying millions of goods, is uniquely suited to selling Echos at low prices, because Amazon is certain it can make money on the device from extra Amazon purchases. (The lowest-priced Echo, the Dot, sells for $50; the new Show, available to the public starting Wednesday, sells for $230, but you get $100 off if you buy two.)I suspect you\u2019re scoffing. The primary knock on Mr. Raskin\u2019s information appliance was that it didn\u2019t do a whole lot. This is also the main criticism of the Echo and, now, the Echo Show. These devices can\u2019t do anything you can\u2019t do on your phone, PC or tablet.That\u2019s true, but it also kind of misses the point. You can make toast in the oven, but you have a toaster because it\u2019s designed to perform a specific task reliably and without any fuss.That\u2019s the point of the information appliance, too. There\u2019s a whole lot the Echo Show won\u2019t do. It won\u2019t do email. It won\u2019t do the web. It won\u2019t play first-person shooters. It is emphatically, purposely not a general-purpose computer. But what it does do \u2014 play music and videos, make video calls, tell you the news, tell you the time and weather, and shop at Amazon \u2014 it does with such surpassing ease that it feels like a magic trick.There are a few reasons for that. One is the Show\u2019s unusual and quietly innovative interface.Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, told me that when the company was first designing the Show, it tried to use the same interface that it used for its tablet computers. But the team soon realized this didn\u2019t work. For one thing, the Echo Show is designed to be used just with your voice \u2014 the screen adds extra information, but you have to look at it only when you specifically ask for visual information (such as when you want a video). A standard mobile operating system, which is heavily visual, just wouldn\u2019t work.Another reason a tablet interface wouldn\u2019t have worked is that it felt too much like a computer, and one overriding design goal of the Echo and the Echo Show was to hide any relationship to anything computerlike.The Show\u2019s operating system, memory, storage and other specifications are completely hidden from users. The Echo does have a version of apps, known as \u201cskills,\u201d but they aren\u2019t anything like smartphone apps. You install them just by asking Alexa to enable them, and when you want to use one, you just name it. To watch a video, you just ask for the video \u2014 you don\u2019t load up a web browser or the YouTube app and then search for it.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different mental model than the traditional computer, smartphone or tablet, where you have to think of which app you want to use and then open it and then dive in,\u201d Mr. Limp wrote in an email.The Echo Show has one other advantage over smartphones and tablets: It\u2019s always there in the same spot.Your phone and tablet move around the house. Often they are nearby, but sometimes they aren\u2019t. That uncertainty makes them less useful for the kind of ambient computing tasks the Echo is good at. When you are in the kitchen and need to look up a recipe, you could find your iPad to call it up. But the Echo Show is always there, so you and everyone else at home come to rely on it \u2014 you know that when you call out for it, it will always answer.Such communal, stationary devices are not unusual in our homes. All the appliances are stationary and communal, from the fridge to the washing machine. We also have some appliances whose sole purpose is to provide us with information and entertainment \u2014 bedside clocks and TVs, for instance. Mr. Limp said these informational appliances provided a \u201cmental model\u201d for the Show\u2019s design, which got me thinking about the expansiveness of Amazon\u2019s ambitions here.The Show has a seven-inch screen. There\u2019s no reason the screen could not be slightly bigger \u2014 an iPad-size one that clings to your bathroom mirror, for instance. Or it could be much, much bigger.In fact, let me go out on a limb: Within a couple of years, I bet Amazon will make its own TV that will work just like the Echo Show. Because if you are trying to create the perfect home appliance, there is no better target than the biggest screen in the house.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Uber Leaders Step Aside, Arianna Huffington\u2019s Influence Grows", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In April, Wan Ling Martello, the head of Nestl\u00e9 in Asia, found herself seated across from Arianna Huffington, an Uber director and a founder of The Huffington Post, at the Union Square Cafe in Manhattan.Less than two months later, Ms. Martello had joined the board.\u201cI did not expect to be asked about Uber at that dinner, and I don\u2019t think it was on Arianna\u2019s agenda,\u201d she said. It was only their second meeting. \u201cThe whole meeting was casual: Let\u2019s just hang out.\u2019\u201dOthers praised her effectiveness. \u201cShe sows the seeds of trust and makes you feel her interests are aligned with yours,\u201d said Fred Harman, a partner at Oak Investment Partners, which invested in The Huffington Post. \u201cWhen you get down to making decisions, you can focus on how persuasive she is.\u201dA series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.In an interview, Ms. Huffington, 66, said: \u201cKnowing how to deal with crises without being overwhelmed \u2014 keeping one\u2019s head while people all around are losing theirs \u2014 is the most important leadership quality. In times of crisis, people often overreact and move into very dark places where they have a hard time seeing their way out.\u201dUber declined to comment for this article.Ms. Huffington\u2019s rise at Uber is the latest chapter in a life marked by dramatic career shifts that included political pundit, media mogul and corporate fixer. Born Ariadne-Anna Stasinopoulous, she grew up in modest circumstances in Greece and England, attended Cambridge University on a scholarship and became the first foreigner to be president of the Cambridge Union debating society.She moved to New York City in 1980 and wrote best-selling biographies of Pablo Picasso and Maria Callas. In 1986, she married the oil scion Michael Huffington, whom she helped vault into national politics. Ann Getty, the socialite who had introduced the Huffingtons, was the matron of honor. The publisher Mort Zuckerman, her former boyfriend, was an usher.After divorcing Mr. Huffington in 1997, Ms. Huffington became known for switching allegiances from Newt Gingrich and the Republican Party to the world of left-wing satire. She became a household name in 2005 with the founding of The Huffington Post, an online publication, with the venture capitalist Kenneth Lerer and Jonah Peretti, who later went on to create BuzzFeed.Even though Ms. Huffington did not have a traditional media background, Mr. Peretti said, her ability to bring together politicians, businesspeople and celebrities was crucial. \u201cWe wanted to bring those worlds online, and she was the perfect person to do it,\u201d he said.Some Huffington Post board members wanted to take the company public, but Ms. Huffington was \u201cpersuasive in convincing the board that a bird in the hand at a compelling valuation was the better path,\u201d said Mr. Harman, who was on the board.She was soon advising Mr. Kalanick. When Uber announced last year that Ms. Huffington had joined the board, it released a video that featured a softer side of Mr. Kalanick and a warm, maternal voice-over from Ms. Huffington.\u201cHer guidance has been invaluable to me personally over the years, and I know that in this new role she\u2019ll help take Uber to the next level,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said in the announcement.They have sometimes disagreed, as they did when Ms. Huffington backed the board\u2019s desire to put Emil Michael on leave, according to two people with knowledge of that discussion. Through a spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined to comment for this article.More recently, Ms. Huffington has been steadfast in supporting Mr. Kalanick even as other allegiances have frayed \u2014 notably his relationship with Mr. Bonderman, who had grown more concerned about Uber\u2019s management quality, according to one person familiar with the board\u2019s conversations. TPG declined to comment.At an Uber staff meeting on Tuesday, Ms. Huffington spoke about how having one woman on a board often led to more women joining.\u201cActually, what it shows is that it\u2019s much more likely to be more talking,\u201d Mr. Bonderman responded.Ms. Huffington declined to discuss board dynamics but said Mr. Bonderman\u2019s resignation, just hours after the gaffe, was \u201ca huge statement about how willing the company is to live by new cultural values.\u201dMs. Huffington has been particularly effective in bringing more women into Uber\u2019s leadership, including Ms. Martello.In March, Ms. Huffington broached the topic of Uber to Ms. Saint John. Mr. Kalanick, she said, was on a journey of self-improvement. As they talked about how to tell a different, more human story about what Uber had to offer, Ms. Huffington had an epiphany. \u201cShe said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you tell Travis these things yourself?\u2019\u201d Ms. Saint John said.Ms. Huffington arranged for the two to meet in April at her home in Brentwood, Calif., where they spoke for nearly eight hours. After Ms. Saint John left Apple last month, she knew there was only one place she wanted to work. She joined Uber in the newly created role of chief brand officer.\u201cArianna gave me all of the problems at Uber straight, no chaser,\u201d Ms. Saint John said. \u201cIt\u2019s the magic of what makes her so believable.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Street Fight Among Grocers to Deliver Your Milk, Eggs, Bananas", "Date": "2017-06-24", "News": "Supported byEvery couple of days, Sinclair Browne fights through traffic in Times Square, squeezes his delivery truck into a parking spot, walks up four flights of stairs and delivers groceries to a guy whose order he knows by heart.\u201cI\u2019m fast,\u201d said Mr. Browne, slicing his hands in the air, ninja style. \u201cIn and out, in and out.\u201dDelivering food requires military precision: Bananas can\u2019t get cold. Produce can\u2019t get warm. Eggs, of course, must not get broken. And people expect their food to arrive at specific times.Mr. Browne, 40, is a driver for the online grocery business Peapod. He plays the most important role in solving the biggest problem vexing the online grocery industry: moving food, undamaged and unspoiled, from the warehouse to the customer\u2019s house. It\u2019s known as the last-mile problem.Delivering perishables is much trickier than delivering T-shirts, books or pretty much anything else people can buy online. The biggest challenge is that groceries must stay cold for hours at a time. But there are myriad other complications, too. Bananas and apples give off fumes that can hurt loose leaf lettuce, so they can\u2019t be stored too close. Tomatoes lose flavor when they cool to below 55 degrees. Milk always has to be packaged upright.All the complexity adds costs in an industry where profit margins are already thin. Few businesses have attempted these kinds of gastronomic acrobatics on a large scale, and numerous start-ups have failed trying, making groceries the last frontier of online shopping.Even Amazon, which built a multi-billion-dollar business by perfecting its delivery logistics, hasn\u2019t quite mastered the art of profitably delivering perishable food in big metropolitan areas. But it just made a big bet, purchasing Whole Foods in a $13.4 billion deal that will give it access to more than 400 stores concentrated around major population centers \u2014 places that may have walk-up apartments, aggressive taxi drivers and other urban obstacles that Mr. Browne navigates five days a week.Amazon\u2019s deal sets up a face-off with Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest grocery store. Walmart itself is struggling to become as dominant in the virtual world as it is in the physical one.As the competition heats up, Amazon and others will be relying on drivers like Mr. Browne, who makes $13 an hour, plus tips, to handle the biggest challenges of succeeding in the online grocery business.\u201cWhat\u2019s up, boss?\u201d Mr. Browne greets the doorman at his first building, who tells him he\u2019ll need to take his cart to the service entrance. He takes the elevator down one flight, but it\u2019s the wrong entrance.He tries another floor. No go.When he asks for directions, the man working at the service entrance yells at him: \u201cYou don\u2019t know, you should tell me you don\u2019t know!\u201dBut rudeness, Mr. Browne says, is just one of the things he has to deal with. He\u2019s still got to get in and out, in and out. Nineteen stops to go.Every second counts. Grocery delivery companies like Peapod have to calculate exactly how long each individual order will take, and monitor traffic patterns and car accidents for any disruptions. Mr. Browne gets alerts on his phone; on Sunday, he\u2019ll have to avoid crossing Fifth Avenue, because of the Pride parade.Today, some of his orders are allotted 10 minutes, others 12. Urban areas tend to take longer per stop: 12 to 20 minutes on average, compared with eight to 14 minutes in the suburbs, where Mr. Browne can pull right up to people\u2019s homes.For all 20 of his orders on this day, Peapod has allotted nine hours and 20 minutes. Mr. Browne thinks he can do them all in eight.\u201cThe first guy slowed me up by having to go through the loading dock. I never really went through there before,\u201d Mr. Browne says as he drives to the next stop. \u201cUsually I\u2019d be in and out of that building.\u201dHis truck was loaded at Peapod\u2019s warehouse in Jersey City, a massive 400,000-square-foot facility that services New York and New Jersey. About 425 people bustle in and out of the meat room, the produce room, a rotisserie room filled with dozens of rotating chickens. Workers wearing thick freezer suits retrieve frozen foods from the coldest room, loading items into bright green temperature-controlled bins that workers refer to as \u201ctotes.\u201dAnyone who has shopped for groceries online has probably thought to themselves something like, \u201cWho will be squeezing my tomatoes, and will I get the good ones this time, or not?\u201d That\u2019s why, despite the vastness of the industrial automation here \u2014 there are about 7 miles of conveyor belts in Peapod\u2019s warehouse \u2014 people like Amal Afifi are important. As she loads the totes, Ms. Afifi personally inspects some of the 14 million bananas Peapod sells each year.Her guidelines are relatively simple: Trust your gut. Literally.\u201cI shop for customers like I shop for myself,\u201d Ms. Afifi said, pointing to a box of unappetizing-looking, reject bananas. They may get donated to a local zoo, where the animals are less picky than people are about bruised fruit and smushed bread.Once perishable items make it into the tote, the clock starts ticking. Keeping food cold until it gets to customers is the single most difficult and important thing about delivering groceries. There are many opportunities for things to go wrong.For all the impersonal convenience that online shopping brings \u2014 no crowds, or lines, or chatty cashiers \u2014 no company has figured out how to automate away the care that a live human like Mr. Browne needs to show toward the food.Carrying a box of sodas and two bags of cold food, he walks into the lobby of a building about halfway through his shift. The doorman tells him to leave the order, but he refuses. What if the doorman forgets about it, and the fruit stays out for hours?Peapod has 19 to 21 hours to get totes to customers, and everything has to stay at the right temperature that whole time. If you break the cold chain on the way to a customer\u2019s refrigerator, Mr. Stallone said, even the healthiest-looking berries could rot too quickly.That potentially undermines one of the main selling points of delivery: the convenience. \u201cIf you have a bad apple or a spoiled gallon of milk or broken eggs, we suddenly become inconvenient,\u201d he said.Mr. Browne goes around to the service entrance instead, where two maintenance men tell him that he can\u2019t use the elevator because they\u2019re doing repairs.\u201cI can\u2019t leave it with just anybody,\u201d he says, and doesn\u2019t agree to leave until one of the men offers to bring it up to the customer.\u201cYou\u2019ll do it right now?\u201d he asks. \u201cO.K.\u201dNot every item needs to be cold. In fact, a temperature below 58 degrees will destroy the bananas that Ms. Afifi picked out.FreshDirect, one of Peapod\u2019s competitors, wraps its bananas in little sleeves to keep them warm. (FreshDirect cools its entire trucks, while Peapod relies on dry ice, gel packs and other methods of controlling the temperature in each individual tote.)\u201cWhen it leaves the store, when it leaves the warehouse to get to you, that\u2019s the issue,\u201d said Phil Lempert, a grocery retailing expert. \u201cThey can estimate within seconds of how long it takes to get from the truck to your house for a delivery.\u201dMr. Browne knows which doormen will let him use the bathroom, which customers tip well and which buildings will force him to use the service entrance, even if he\u2019s only carrying a couple of bags.Delivering perishable groceries is still largely an urban business, where logistics can be a nightmare. There are fewer places to park, more steps to climb and more garage doors to accidentally block. Mail carriers have offered some lessons for Peapod\u2019s competition; FreshDirect, for example, copies the UPS model of parking in one spot all day, and using multiple people to make multiple deliveries at a time.On his way into one building, Mr. Browne passes a cart full of FreshDirect groceries on the sidewalk.Unlike FreshDirect deliverymen, Mr. Browne works alone in his truck, and he has to move it for each delivery. Parking tickets are a cost of doing business, and Peapod even has a line item on the budget for fines and tolls. But moving around in a dense urban area has other challenges.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of traffic, real tight spaces, a lot of people, people will just cross right in front of the truck sometimes,\u201d Mr. Browne says. \u201cWorking in the city is very difficult, that\u2019s why they say it\u2019s not for everyone.\u201dAs he drives, Mr. Browne scans the road for buses, cabs, pedestrians and even horses. Peapod drivers get a couple of hours of defensive driving training, and Mr. Browne keeps an eye on a camera that shows what\u2019s happening directly behind him. That helps him spot skateboarders who sometimes try to catch a free ride by grabbing his bumper.\u201cThat\u2019s dangerous, because if I turn,\u201d he said, \u201cthat guy is basically dead.\u201dOnce he makes it through Times Square, things get a little easier. Today he\u2019s mostly going to residential buildings with elevators, where people tend to tip better, inexplicably, than people who live in walk-ups.\u201cYou have some customers where they have an elevator, they have a doorman, and they could have three bags, give you $20,\u201d says Mr. Browne, who has been working overtime to save up for a birthday party for one of his three children. \u201cI say, \u2018Thank you, this goes to my daughter\u2019s sweet 16.\u2019\u201dMr. Browne likes interacting with customers. He has families, college students, older people who he feels he\u2019s helping, because they can\u2019t easily shop for themselves. There\u2019s the woman who lives directly above a grocery store, but still orders online. There\u2019s the man who orders Froot Loops or cold cuts every couple of days, the woman who tips $20 every time.Today, he\u2019ll deliver to a couple of college students who must meet the truck outside. For security reasons, their dorm won\u2019t let delivery drivers upstairs.Younger people are especially important to grocery delivery companies. Millennials and Generation Y make up about a quarter of Peapod\u2019s customers, but in a few years those young people will likely begin spending more money on food; maybe they\u2019ll have families, or get a pet, or start making a little more money.They have grown up in an environment where everything is available online, and digital grocers want to get them hooked early. Peapod, for example, has added more organic, international and bulk items to its offerings, because those products tend to be popular among its younger customers.Generation X makes up about half of Peapod\u2019s customers, and the remaining 25 percent are older. In total, Peapod\u2019s customers are fairly evenly divided between the city and the suburbs, where Mr. Browne prefers to work. There are no horses or walk-ups, and he doesn\u2019t need to walk past the garbage at a service entrance.Though the distances are longer, non-metro areas tend to be cheaper places for Peapod to work, according to Ken Fanaro, the company\u2019s senior director of transportation planning and development. Fuel efficiency is better, and there are fewer parking tickets and tolls. But because customers are farther away and more widely spaced, drivers can do fewer orders per shift. (Tips, however, tend to be better outside the most densely populated areas, Mr. Browne says. One time he went to Staten Island \u2014 part of New York City, but largely suburban in layout \u2014 and made $200 over two days.)\u201cEvery day, you\u2019re coming home with money,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a job like that before.\u201dAbout half of Mr. Browne\u2019s customers today chose to tip him online when they placed their orders. Some will tip him in cash. Some, like the college students, won\u2019t tip at all. Today, the man in the fourth-floor walk-up who orders every couple of days tips Mr. Browne for the first time, giving him $3.\u201cWhat\u2019s up, boss?\u201d Mr. Browne says to the man at the top of the stairs, slightly out of breath.Mr. Browne has lost 15 pounds since he started this job about a year and a half ago. Today he is carrying a gallon of milk, laundry detergent and a couple of bags with his left arm, and holds a carton of eggs in his right hand. He tries to do everything in one trip, if he can.He opens the carton to show the eggs aren\u2019t broken \u2014 eggs must always be presented to the customer \u2014 and heads back downstairs. In and out.\u201cWhat\u2019s up, buddy?\u201d he says to a woman\u2019s cat, for whom he\u2019s carrying two big containers of litter. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d He chats with the cat\u2019s owner for a minute as he carries the bags into her apartment, but the small talk can\u2019t take extra time.Being late isn\u2019t as often a problem for Mr. Browne as is being early. Because the city is so unpredictable, the company frequently allots him more time than he needs. He is one of the fastest drivers who works out of Peapod\u2019s Jersey City warehouse, but he thinks he could do more deliveries.When he shows up early, he can\u2019t contact the customers directly. Instead, he has to call someone back at the office, who then calls the customer, to see if he can drop off the order ahead of time. If not, he has to wait.When the opposite happens \u2014 when people aren\u2019t home \u2014 Mr. Browne can wait only 15 minutes. The other day he had to wait for a woman in a fourth-floor walk-up, carrying three bags in each hand.\u201cSeven minutes, I could have done another delivery,\u201d he says.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Man Who Helped Turn Toronto Into a High-Tech Hotbed", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileTORONTO \u2014 As an undergraduate at Cambridge University, Geoffrey Everest Hinton thought a lot about the brain. He wanted to better understand how it worked but was frustrated that no field of study \u2014 from physiology and psychology to physics and chemistry \u2014 offered real answers.So he set about building his own computer models to mimic the brain\u2019s process.\u201cPeople just thought I was crazy,\u201d said Dr. Hinton, now 69, a Google fellow who is also a professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Toronto.He wasn\u2019t. He became one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on artificial intelligence, designing software that imitates how the brain is believed to work. At the same time, Dr. Hinton, who left academia in the United States in part as a personal protest against military funding of research, has helped make Canada a high-tech hotbed.Dictate a text on your smartphone, search for a photo on Google or, in the not too distant future, ride in a self-driving car, and you will be using technology based partly on Dr. Hinton\u2019s ideas.His impact on artificial intelligence research has been so deep that some people in the field talk about the \u201csix degrees of Geoffrey Hinton\u201d the way college students once referred to Kevin Bacon\u2019s uncanny connections to so many Hollywood movies.Dr. Hinton\u2019s students and associates are now leading lights of artificial intelligence research at Apple, Facebook, Google and Uber, and run artificial intelligence programs at the University of Montreal and OpenAI, a nonprofit research company.\u201cI sat down in 2005,\u201d said Dr. Hinton, a tall man, with uncombed silvering hair and hooded eyes the color of the North Sea.Dr. Hinton followed the family tradition by going to Cambridge in the late 1960s. But by the time he finished his undergraduate degree, he realized that no one had a clue how people think.\u201cI got fed up with academia and decided I would rather be a carpenter,\u201d he recalled with evident delight, standing at a high table in Google\u2019s white-on-white cafe here. He was 22 and lasted a year in the trade, although carpentry remains his hobby today.But the approach fell out of favor because computers were not powerful enough then to produce meaningful results. Artificial intelligence research turned instead to using logic to solve problems.As he was having second thoughts about his carpentry skills, Dr. Hinton heard about an artificial intelligence program at the University of Edinburgh and moved there in 1972 to pursue a Ph.D. His adviser favored the logic-based approach, but Dr. Hinton focused on artificial neural networks, which he thought were a better model to simulate human thought.His study didn\u2019t make him very employable in Britain, though. So, Ph.D. in hand, he turned to the United States to work as a postdoctoral researcher in San Diego with a group of cognitive psychologists who were also interested in neural networks.They were soon making significant headway.Dr. Hinton moved in 1982 to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh as a professor, where his work with the algorithm and neural networks allowed computers to produce some \u201cinteresting internal representations,\u201d as he put it.Here\u2019s an example of how the brain produces an internal representation. When you look at a cat \u2014 for some reason cats are a favorite subject of artificial intelligence research \u2014 light waves bouncing off it hit your retina, which converts the light into electrical impulses that travel along the optic nerve to the brain. Those impulses, of course, look nothing like a cat. The brain, however, reconstitutes those impulses into an internal representation of the cat, and if you close your eyes, you can see it in your mind.\u201cIn A.I., the holy grail was how do you generate internal representations,\u201d Dr. Hinton explained.Interesting as those internal representations were from an academic point of view, computers were still too slow to recreate them in a way that mimicked the brain.At that point, Dr. Hinton was becoming disillusioned with the politics of the United States in the Reagan era. He also didn\u2019t like that most artificial intelligence research was funded by the United States military.By 2012, computers had become fast enough to allow him and his researchers to create those internal representations as well as reproduce speech patterns that are part of the translation applications we all use today.The deal made Dr. Hinton a wealthy man.Now he is turning his attention to health care, thinking that artificial intelligence technology could be harnessed to scan lesions for cancer. The combination of the Vector Institute, a surrounding cluster of hospitals and government support, he added, makes Toronto \u201cone of the best places in the world to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How G.O.P. Leaders Came to View Climate Change as Fake Science", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byTrump RulesWASHINGTON \u2014 The campaign ad appeared during the presidential contest of 2008. Rapid-fire images of belching smokestacks and melting ice sheets were followed by a soothing narrator who praised a candidate who had stood up to President George W. Bush and \u201csounded the alarm on global warming.\u201dThe Republican Party\u2019s fast journey from debating how to combat human-caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist is a story of big political money, Democratic hubris in the Obama years and a partisan chasm that grew over nine years like a crack in the Antarctic shelf, favoring extreme positions and uncompromising rhetoric over cooperation and conciliation.\u201cMost Republicans still do not regard climate change as a hoax,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist who worked for Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cBut the entire climate change debate has now been caught up in the broader polarization of American politics.\u201d\u201cIn some ways,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s become yet another of the long list of litmus test issues that determine whether or not you\u2019re a good Republican.\u201dSince Mr. McCain ran for president on climate credentials that were stronger than his opponent Barack Obama\u2019s, the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases from fossil fuels to the dangerous warming of the planet has grown stronger. Scientists have for the first time drawn concrete links between the planet\u2019s warming atmosphere and changes that affect Americans\u2019 daily lives and pocketbooks, from tidal flooding in Miami to prolonged water shortages in the Southwest to decreasing snow cover at ski resorts.That scientific consensus was enough to pull virtually all of the major nations along. Conservative-leaning governments in Britain, France, Germany and Japan all signed on to successive climate change agreements.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.Yet when Mr. Trump pulled the United States from the Paris accord, the Senate majority leader, the speaker of the House and every member of the elected Republican leadership were united in their praise.But in Republican political circles, speaking out on the issue, let alone pushing climate policy, is politically dangerous. So for the most part, these moderate Republicans are biding their time, until it once again becomes safe for Republicans to talk more forcefully about climate change. The question is how long that will take.\u201cWith 40 percent of Florida\u2019s population at risk from sea-level rise, my state is on the front lines of climate change,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida. \u201cSouth Florida residents are already beginning to feel the effects of climate change in their daily lives.\u201dThe effort picked up steam the next year after the House of Representatives passed what is known as cap-and-trade legislation, a concept invented by conservative Reagan-era economists.The idea was to create a statutory limit, or cap, on the overall amount of a certain type of pollution that could be emitted. Businesses could then buy and sell permits to pollute, choosing whether to invest more in pollution permits, or in cleaner technology that would then save them money and allow them to sell their allotted permits. The administration of the first President George Bush successfully deployed the first national cap-and-trade system in 1990 to lower emissions of the pollutants that cause acid rain. Mr. McCain pushed a cap-and-trade proposal to fight climate change.\u201cI thought we could get it done,\u201d recalled Henry A. Waxman, a retired House Democrat who led the cap-and-trade push in 2009. \u201cWe just had two candidates from the Republican and Democratic parties who had run for president and agreed that climate change was a real threat.\u201dConservative activists saw the legislative effort as an opportunity to transform the climate debate.Myron Ebell, a senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, worked behind the scenes to make sure Republican offices in Congress knew about Mr. Horner\u2019s work \u2014 although at the time, many viewed Mr. Ebell skeptically, as an extremist pushing out-of-touch views.As Congress moved toward actually passing climate change legislation, a fringe issue had become a part of the political mainstream.\u201cThat was the turning point,\u201d Mr. Horner said.Unshackled by the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision and other related rulings, which ended corporate campaign finance restrictions, Koch Industries and Americans for Prosperity started an all-fronts campaign with television advertising, social media and cross-country events aimed at electing lawmakers who would ensure that the fossil fuel industry would not have to worry about new pollution regulations.Their first target: unseating Democratic lawmakers such as Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Perriello of Virginia, who had voted for the House cap-and-trade bill, and replacing them with Republicans who were seen as more in step with struggling Appalachia, and who pledged never to push climate change measures.But Americans for Prosperity also wanted to send a message to Republicans.Until 2010, some Republicans ran ads in House and Senate races showing their support for green energy.\u201cAfter that, it disappeared from Republican ads,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cPart of that was the polling, and part of it was the visceral example of what happened to their colleagues who had done that.\u201dWhat happened was clear. Republicans who asserted support for climate change legislation or the seriousness of the climate threat saw their money dry up or, worse, a primary challenger arise.\u201cIt told Republicans that we were serious,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, \u201cthat we would spend some serious money against them.\u201dEven for congressional veterans, that message was not missed. Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who once called climate change \u201ca serious problem\u201d and co-sponsored a bill to promote energy-efficient light bulbs, tacked right after the 2010 elections as he battled to be chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee against Joe Barton, a Texan who mocked human-caused climate change.Mr. Upton deleted references to climate change from his website. \u201cIf you look, the last year was the warmest year on record, the warmest decade on record. I accept that,\u201d he offered that fall. \u201cI do not say that it\u2019s man-made.\u201d\u201cIn my own campaign, there were people who felt strongly enough about my views on climate change to use it to help defeat me, and other Republicans are very sensitive to that possibility,\u201d Mr. Lugar said in an interview. \u201cSo even if they privately believe we ought to do something about it, they\u2019re reticent, especially with the Republican president taking the views he is now taking.\u201dAfter winning re-election in 2012, Mr. Obama understood his second-term agenda would have to rely on executive authority, not legislation that would go nowhere in the Republican-majority Congress. And climate change was the great unfinished business of his first term.To finish it, he would deploy a rarely used provision in the Clean Air Act of 1970, which gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to issue regulations on carbon dioxide.The result was the Clean Power Plan, which would significantly cut planet-warming emissions by forcing the closing of hundreds of heavy-polluting coal-fired power plants.The end run around Congress had consequences of its own. To Republican (and some Democratic) critics, the Clean Power Plan exemplified everything they opposed about Mr. Obama: He seemed to them imperious, heavy-handed, pleasing to the elites on the East and West Coasts and in the capitals of Europe, but callous to the blue-collar workers of coal and oil country.\u201cIt fed into this notion of executive overreach,\u201d said Heather Zichal, who advised Mr. Obama on climate policy. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a good enough job on managing the narrative.\u201dRepublicans who had supported the climate change agenda began to defect and have since stayed away.\u201cOn the issue of climate change, I think it\u2019s happening,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a CNN podcast interview last April. But, he said, \u201cThe president decided, at least in the last couple years if not more, to rule by edict.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s political opponents saw the climate rules as a ripe opportunity. \u201cWhen the president went the regulatory route, it gave our side more confidence,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cIt hardened and broadened Republican opposition to this agenda.\u201dStarting in early 2014, the opponents of the rule \u2014 including powerful lawyers and lobbyists representing many of America\u2019s largest manufacturing and industrial interests \u2014 regularly gathered in a large conference room at the national headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, overlooking the White House. They drafted a long-game legal strategy to undermine Mr. Obama\u2019s climate regulations in a coordinated campaign that brought together 28 state attorneys general and major corporations to form an argument that they expected to eventually take to the Supreme Court.They presented it not as an environmental fight but an economic one, against a government that was trying to vastly and illegally expand its authority.West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, led the session, \u201cThe Dangerous Consequences of the Clean Power Plan & Other E.P.A. Rules,\u201d which included, according to the agenda, Scott Pruitt, then the attorney general of Oklahoma; Ken Paxton, Texas\u2019 attorney general; and Geoffrey Barnes, a corporate lawyer for Murray, which had donated $250,000 to the Republican attorneys general political group.When Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, he did not appear to have a clear understanding of the nation\u2019s climate change policies. Nor, at the start of his campaign, did he appear to have any specific plan to prioritize a huge legal push to roll those policies back.This ad appeared in The New York Times in December 2009, urging President Barack Obama to push a global climate change pact being negotiated in Copenhagen. Donald J. Trump and members of his family supported the ad, along with other business leaders.However, it did not go unnoticed that coal country was giving his presidential campaign a wildly enthusiastic embrace, as miners came out in full force for Mr. Trump, stoking his populist message.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about miners all over the country,\u201d he said, eliciting cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put miners back to work.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t used to have all these rules and regulations that make it impossible to compete,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it all off the table.\u201dThen an official from the West Virginia Coal Association handed the candidate a miner\u2019s hat.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers embraced the miners as emblematic of the candidate\u2019s broader populist appeal.\u201cThe coal miners were the perfect case for what he was talking about,\u201d Mr. Bennett said, \u201cthe idea that for the government in Washington, it\u2019s all right for these people to suffer for the greater good \u2014 that federal power is more important than your little lives.\u201dMr. Trump took on as an informal campaign adviser Robert E. Murray \u2014 chief executive of the same coal company that had been working closely for years with the Republican attorneys general to unwind the Obama environmental legacy.Mr. Murray, a brash and folksy populist who started working in coal mines as a teenager, is an unabashed skeptic of climate science. The coal magnate and Mr. Trump had a natural chemistry, and where Mr. Trump lacked the legal and policy background to unwind climate policy, Mr. Murray was happy to step in.\u201cI thank my lord, Jesus Christ, for the election of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Murray said soon after his new friend won the White House.Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Ebell, the Competitive Enterprise Institute fellow who had worked for years to undermine the legitimacy of established climate science, to head the transition team at E.P.A. Mr. Ebell immediately began pushing for an agenda of gutting the Obama climate regulations and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.When it came time to translate Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to coal country into policy, Mr. Murray and others helped choose the perfect candidate: Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump wanted to be seen delivering on the promises he had made to the miners. As controversies piled up in his young administration, he sought comfort in the approval of his base.Meanwhile, a battle raged at the White House over whether to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, urged him to remain in, cautioning that withdrawing could be devastating to the United States\u2019 foreign policy credentials.But these voices did not have clout in Washington, either in Congress or at the White House, when it comes to energy policy.Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, backed by Mr. Pruitt, told the president that pulling out of the deal would mean a promise kept to his base.Dr. Bolin helped steer the conference to its conclusion: \u201cIt is now believed that in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man\u2019s history,\u201d he wrote in the conference\u2019s 500-page report.While the politics of climate change in the United States has grown more divided since then, the scientific community has united: Global warming is having an impact, scientists say, with sea levels rising along with the extremity of weather events. Most of the debate is about the extent of those impacts \u2014 how high the seas may rise, or how intense and frequent heavy storms or heat waves may be.But in Congress, reluctance to embrace that science has had no political downsides, at least among Republicans.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have an example of where someone has paid a political price being on that side of it,\u201d said Michael Steel, who served as press secretary for the former House speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and the current House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, during his 2012 run as Mitt Romney\u2019s vice-presidential choice.Instead, the messages of Mr. Pruitt still dominate.\u201cThis is an historic restoration of American economic independence \u2014 one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said on Thursday, stepping to the Rose Garden lectern after Mr. Trump. \u201cWe owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.\u201dBut most public opinion polls find that voters rank the environment last or nearly last among the issues that they vote on. And views are divided based on party affiliation. In 2001, 46 percent of Democrats said they worried \u201ca great deal\u201d about climate change, compared with 29 percent of Republicans, according to a Gallup tracking poll on the issue. This year, concern among Democrats has reached 66 percent. Among Republicans, it has fallen, to 18 percent.Until people vote on the issue, Republicans will find it politically safer to question climate science and policy than to alienate moneyed groups like Americans for Prosperity.\u201cThis is a local issue for me,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cEven conservatives in my district see the impact. It\u2019s flooding, and it\u2019s happening now.\u201dMr. Curbelo is confident that as the impact of climate change spreads, so will the willingness of his Republican colleagues to join him.Outside of Congress, a small number of establishment conservatives, including a handful of leaders from the Reagan administration, have begun pushing Washington to act on climate change. Earlier this year, James A. Baker III, one of the Republican Party\u2019s more eminent senior figures, met with senior White House officials to urge them to consider incorporating a carbon tax as part of a broader tax overhaul package \u2014 a way to both pay for proposed cuts to corporate tax rates and help save the planet. A Reagan White House senior economist, Art Laffer; a former secretary of state, George P. Shultz; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., George W. Bush\u2019s final Treasury secretary, have also pushed the idea.\u201cThere are members from deep-red districts who have approached me about figuring out how to become part of this effort,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cI know we have the truth on our side. So I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll win \u2014 eventually.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when the Supreme Court stayed the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which regulated emissions from coal-fired power plants. It was in February 2016, not April.Henry Fountain contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Big Tech Stocks Build Market Euphoria, and Jitters", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "Supported byFacebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google.In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes \u2014 Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain \u2014 as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies.But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded.\u201cThere is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. \u201cNo one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.\u201dDespite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks.Other markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election.The stock market, however, remains the main attraction.Late in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end.According to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion \u2014 a consequence of investors\u2019 buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value.As is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment.The push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership.Through these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks \u2014 an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented.It is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market.\u201cIn terms of magnitude, we have not seen this,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist.In Mr. Paulsen\u2019s view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period.So when Facebook\u2019s net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon\u2019s sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice.\u201cYou have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cSo yes, you can see how valuations would get extended.\u201dStock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today\u2019s technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era.Still, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce?For example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year \u2014 with more than half that amount from Apple, the world\u2019s richest company.Of course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business.Amazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard.Still, it is not today\u2019s earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow\u2019s, the argument goes.Surprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it.Bill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Mr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google\u2019s cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered.\u201cI have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cYet that is how the market is pricing it.\u201dAnother well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position.While skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division.\u201cAmazon is more fully valued than when we bought it,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages.\u201dAs these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns.That is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures. For a manager not to match the share of an Apple or an Amazon in a benchmark would result in an actively managed fund trailing its index and its peers.And as investors pour billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds \u2014 a record $314 billion in the last year \u2014 no active manager can afford to lag the competition for too long.So be it a mutual fund, hedge fund, sovereign wealth fund or family office, the strategy has been consistent \u2014 put aside any fears, and stay invested.\u201cIt\u2019s like you are riding a missile that you know could explode at any moment beneath you,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo. He has warned in his reports that some of these stocks have entered a stage of mania. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have no choice but to be sucked into the trade.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dissecting Marissa Mayer\u2019s $900,000-a-Week Yahoo Paycheck", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "Supported byIt will also conclude the remarkable five-year run of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who was paid nearly a quarter of a billion dollars \u2014 a generous sum even by Silicon Valley\u2019s lofty standards \u2014 while presiding over the company\u2019s continued decline.The company ended up so weakened that its board had little choice but to sell.\u201cEveryone acknowledges that it was a difficult situation to come into,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research who has studied Yahoo for years. \u201cBut the company was not run well under her tenure.\u201dSo why did Ms. Mayer receive more than $900,000 a week? The answer, like so many things about Yahoo, is surprisingly complicated. It is rooted partly in the never-lose structure of modern executive compensation packages, but also in two farsighted investments made long ago by one of Yahoo\u2019s founders, Jerry Yang.Ms. Mayer\u2019s pay was mostly in stock and stock options, and she reaped the rewards alongside the other stockholders.\u201cThe only sign you can point to when evaluating a company over a long period of time is how shareholders have done in the exchange,\u201d said David Wise, who heads North American sales at Korn Ferry Hay Group, a firm that advises companies on executive pay packages. \u201cOver the last five years, Yahoo shareholders couldn\u2019t have done a lot better than this.\u201dMore than most chief executives, Ms. Mayer was working for those shareholders.She was essentially hired by one hedge-fund manager, Daniel S. Loeb, who got her predecessor fired and won three seats on Yahoo\u2019s board in 2012. Mr. Loeb was particularly interested in finding a way to unlock the value of Yahoo\u2019s stake in Alibaba, which was already shaping up to be one of China\u2019s leading internet companies. He pushed the board to recruit a star like Ms. Mayer to get people excited about a company that had been stumbling for years.When Ms. Mayer\u2019s early efforts to turn around Yahoo\u2019s business and spin off the Alibaba shares failed to bear fruit, another hedge fund manager, Jeffrey C. Smith of Starboard Value, led a campaign to push for her ouster. Mr. Smith eventually garnered four board seats so he could keep the pressure on.Yahoo declined to comment for this article, citing this coming Thursday\u2019s shareholder vote to approve the Verizon deal. Ms. Mayer and the board chairman, Maynard Webb, who approved her pay packages, also declined interview requests. So did Mr. Smith.\u201cShe was an attractive, high-visibility C.E.O. trying to bring some excitement and glamour to Yahoo,\u201d said Martha Josephson, a senior partner at the recruiting firm Egon Zehnder, who helped Ms. Mayer find several of her top executives. \u201cAs hard as the job was, she didn\u2019t get a break. If she were an ugly man, she\u2019d be a hero.\u201dOn July 16, 2012, the day she was hired, Yahoo\u2019s share price was $15.65. On Friday, it closed at $50.60. The stock\u2019s performance has topped other venerable tech companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco Systems, and matched the gains of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Yahoo\u2019s most direct competitor.As Yahoo shareholders profited, so did Ms. Mayer. By the time the deal closes, she will have made about $239 million, based on Friday\u2019s share price, according to calculations by Equilar, a provider of executive compensation data.To lure Ms. Mayer from Google and compensate her for options she forfeited there, Yahoo\u2019s board offered her a lucrative employment agreement. She initially received restricted stock worth $35 million and stock options worth $21 million, based on 2012 stock prices for Yahoo, along with a cash salary and bonus. Although she gave up a portion of those stock grants after failing to meet performance targets, the rise in Yahoo\u2019s share price more than offset the losses. She received further stock grants in later years, adding to her overall compensation.Yet most of Ms. Mayer\u2019s paycheck ultimately came from the gains in Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments, over which she had little control. Thanks to an investment made in 2005, Yahoo had a 24 percent stake in Alibaba, which today is China\u2019s leading e-commerce company.When Alibaba first sold shares to the public in 2014, Yahoo sold 140 million shares in the offering. It hung on to 384 million shares, which are now worth about $48 billion.Yahoo also owns about 36 percent of Yahoo Japan, now worth about $9 billion, that it received as part of a deal struck in 1996, shortly after Yahoo was founded.The surging value of those investments \u2014 not any brilliant business moves by Ms. Mayer \u2014 is why Yahoo\u2019s shares went up. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone coming into an oil company, and all of a sudden oil prices go up and the stock goes up,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, the director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cWas the return based on what she did?\u201dStill, managing those investments was a key reason that Yahoo\u2019s board hired Ms. Mayer. Mr. Loeb had accused Yahoo\u2019s previous leaders of mishandling both their core business and the Alibaba relationship. When he and two allies gained seats on the board in 2012, they wanted a new chief executive who would fix both problems.Ms. Mayer delegated the Alibaba issue, hiring an experienced dealmaker, Jacqueline Reses, to be the company\u2019s principal liaison to Alibaba and its leaders, Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai. Ms. Reses helped the Chinese company navigate its initial public offering. She also renegotiated an agreement, struck just before Ms. Mayer arrived, that would have forced Yahoo to sell an additional 122 million shares in the offering. Those extra shares are now worth $15 billion.Ms. Mayer, meanwhile, focused on turning around Yahoo\u2019s internet business. It had missed the mobile revolution and was experiencing steady declines in its display and search advertising. There, her record is decidedly mixed.Yahoo had no real strategy for reaching customers on mobile devices when she arrived \u2014 a sure route to obsolescence as smartphones became the principal internet device for most people.Through a combination of acquisitions and hiring, she vastly expanded Yahoo\u2019s mobile team, which initially produced some buzzy hits like the Yahoo Weather app and Yahoo News Digest, along with more prosaic updates of core Yahoo features like fantasy sports and email. Yet Ms. Mayer largely failed in her quest to make Yahoo a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for more users in online video, search and messaging.Yahoo did acquire advertising technology and built a new ad system from scratch, but marketers never embraced it.Yahoo\u2019s board recognized Ms. Mayer\u2019s failure to meet business targets and docked her bonuses and stock awards in four of the five years she was in charge. But under terms of her original employment agreement, it also granted her new shares annually, easing the sting.Given those missteps, was Ms. Mayer overpaid?\u201cFor the existing amount of compensation, could Yahoo shareholders have done better?\u201d Mr. Wieser of Pivotal Research said. \u201cOr for the same outcome, could they have paid less? Ultimately it\u2019s a hard question to answer.\u201dPeter Monaco, who was a vice president for engineering at Yahoo for three years before leaving for Facebook last September, said Ms. Mayer does not get enough credit for transforming Yahoo\u2019s culture. \u201cShe eliminated the dead wood, drove out the politics, put in place compensation policies that rewarded high achievers and energized people to create great products again,\u201d he said.Arguably, Yahoo was unfixable. The company\u2019s DNA and technology were built around its original identity as a web portal \u2014 a powerful position in the early 2000s but increasingly outmoded in the mobile era, as apps and phone platforms like iOS and Android became the gateways to the internet.\u201cGiven the hand she was dealt, I doubt anyone could have done a better job transforming the culture and making Yahoo healthy again,\u201d Mr. Monaco said.Unlike Kilimanjaro, though, the Yahoo challenge proved insurmountable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Advertising Paradise, Reality Is Just a Conversation Away", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingCANNES, France \u2014 The top hitters in media and advertising descended on the beaches of southern France last week, lounging on yachts and sipping wine and frozen ros\u00e9 slushies as the sun sparkled on the cerulean water of the French Riviera. They networked and cut deals at parties in chic hotels \u2014 the type where rooms cost $500 a night.But even in paradise, it did not take long for conversations at the annual industry conference to inevitably turn to the frustrations of the advertising world.\u201cI\u2019m hypersensitive right now,\u201d said Kathleen Hall, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for global advertising and media. \u201cAs a marketer you always think about risk, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily the first thought. I think now you have to be much more sensitive to the idea of risk and how anything might be construed as a political statement or endorsement or issue-based support.\u201d\u201cThe answer, and I think they agree, is just to raise the bar on monetization,\u201d she said.Ms. Hall said that in today\u2019s polarized media environment, people were \u201cjudging and assuming your values are represented by your media placement.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kind of obsessed,\u201d she said, \u201cwith what\u2019s the right balance between people\u2019s freedom of choice, the media\u2019s freedom of expression and our freedom to reach.\u201dHoopla aside, several advertisers said they were taking a harder line with such platforms, though they were eager to continue working with them. Google and Facebook, in particular, are trying to assuage advertisers\u2019 concerns around objectionable content.\u201cThey\u2019ve sort of got away with trying to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re an open-source technology; it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s them,\u2019\u201d Jerry Buhlmann, the chief executive of Dentsu Aegis Network, said about objectionable content online. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting away with it anymore. They\u2019re too big, they\u2019re making too much money, they employ too many people, and it\u2019s too important politically.\u201dOthers are more concerned with creating standards for determining how effectively ads reach people online and being able to compare metrics across platforms \u2014 basically, what a Facebook video view is worth versus an ad viewed on Snapchat.\u201cWhen digital media was a small part of overall advertising, I think we were learning and developing,\u201d said Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever. \u201cBut now it\u2019s starting to become the biggest part of advertising, and I think in that context, we need to make the industry more efficient.\u201dStill, while marketers are more outspoken, the giant online advertising platforms continue to reign supreme \u2014 and attract hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing.\u201cThe duopoly continues,\u201d said Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s biggest ad group, referring to Google and Facebook. \u201cThere\u2019s been all these challenges \u2014 consumer brand safety, what I call political brand safety with terrorist-type stuff, fake news, fraud, transparency. But I don\u2019t think that anything has happened as yet that we\u2019ve seen of great significance in terms of altering the patterns of spend.\u201dWhile Mr. Sorrell likened the timing of the Publicis announcement to a dinner guest\u2019s insulting the host midway through a meal, he noted in an interview that his firm had sent 500 people to Cannes this year, down from 1,000 last year.Advertisers are eyeing ways to work with Amazon, as well as how they can take advantage of the Amazon Echo, particularly as Google and Apple follow the company\u2019s lead in selling voice-activated devices for the home.\u201cWe\u2019re working with Amazon as a retail partner \u2014 which we have a big booming business with them \u2014 and we\u2019re working with them as a media partner,\u201d said Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble. He said Procter & Gamble was moving money there.\u201cI really believe voice is going to be big,\u201d Mr. Weed said. \u201cBrands, of course, are known by their visual representation, but brands don\u2019t have a voice, and I think we\u2019re going to have to think about what is the tone of voice for different brands and how to engage with it.\u201dMs. Lemkau of JPMorgan Chase pointed to Amazon\u2019s data, the millions of verified Chase cardholders who are spending on the site, its media and content arm, its ad serving platform and the potential for marketing through packaging.\u201cI think they will be the biggest presence here potentially one day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you think of alternatives to the big two, they have a really compelling case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Amazon Be the Next Apple?", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBlood is running in the retail aisle. Sears, the most iconic name in American retailing, told its investors in March that \u201csubstantial doubt exists related to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d The appliance retailer HH Gregg went defunct at the end of May, and once-celebrated companies like Bebe and Limited are desperately trying to survive as online-only storefronts. The carnage has spread beyond empty shopping malls and big-box stores to the grocery trade. Last week, a poor earnings report cost Kroger, the nation\u2019s second-largest food retailer, 19 percent of its stock market value in a matter of hours \u2014 and that was before Amazon announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market.So why might Amazon, the giant of online shopping, want to spend $13.4 billion on 461 brick-and-mortar stores of the sort other retailers are shedding left and right, along with a coffee roaster, 11 food distribution centers and manufacturing plants that do things like bake bread and gut fish? One obvious possibility is that Amazon could try to cut delivery times and costs by letting shoppers order online and then pick up their goods at the nearest Whole Foods. Another is that Amazon, for some reason, wants to grab a share of the low-profit grocery business, where online sales have not taken off, and see whether its technological wizardry can revolutionize food shopping.But there may be a less obvious explanation of Amazon\u2019s interest in Whole Foods: Perhaps it wants to be a bit more like Apple.There\u2019s no question that Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has built a hugely successful business. But a large part that business comes from selling the products of others. Only a tiny fraction of its retail sales \u2014 its Kindle e-reader, its Echo home control center, the audio books published by its Audible subsidiary, its Amazon Original videos \u2014 are exclusive to Amazon. The company makes money on the rest only if the prices on its website, with delivery costs added in, are below those elsewhere.What that means is that Amazon\u2019s margins are skinny. Last year its business that provides cloud-based web services for businesses and governments, with $12 billion of revenue, brought in three times the pre-tax profit Amazon reaped from $125 billion in retail sales.How to solve this problem? An envious glance at one of their company\u2019s best-known competitors might offer Amazon executives an answer.Apple doesn\u2019t need flashy stores in expensive locations to distribute phones and computers; those can be ordered on the internet. The Apple Stores, meticulously planned from their online appointment books to the transaction processing system that emails a receipt before you\u2019ve walked out the door, sell an experience, not electronics. Their purpose is to persuade customers that Apple has extraordinarily exciting products for which premium prices are entirely justified.Whole Foods started out with a similar idea, but its approach hasn\u2019t been working well. Its customer count dropped 2.6 percent last year as shoppers rebelled against high prices for food that didn\u2019t seem worth the premium. In a phone call with investors on May 10, John Mackey, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Whole Foods was striving for \u201clower costs, lower prices and higher sales.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like the mantra of a high-end retailer.Aside from its troubled grocery business, though, Whole Foods brings Amazon two important assets: affluent customers and locations in high-income neighborhoods. Amazon might use these assets to broaden its business in a way it cannot do online.Online retailing allows retailers access to millions of customers, but that\u2019s not always a benefit. One of the challenges of e-commerce is that it\u2019s difficult to segment the market. Every customer has access to the same web pages. Online merchants may take advantage of information about individuals\u2019 browsing history and past purchases to offer different prices to some than to others, but there\u2019s no way to make online shopping a special experience with Apple-style margins. For that, it\u2019s still critical to bring customers in the door.That\u2019s where Whole Foods comes in. Whole Foods\u2019s stores are sizeable, averaging nearly 40,000 square feet. Imagine Amazon carving out a fifth of that space, with separate entrances, and creating boutiques with well-trained staff and dynamic merchandising. Under the Amazon name or some newly created brand, those boutiques could sell exclusive products and services to shoppers on their way to grab a kale-and-red-currant salad for lunch or a pound of locally raised grass-fed beef for dinner, without detracting from Amazon\u2019s online business.They could sell excitement at profit margins Amazon will never achieve from selling books and backpacks on the internet \u2014 profit margins that look a lot more like Apple\u2019s.Marc Levinson, a historian and economist, is author of \u201cThe Great A&P and the Struggle for Small Business in America\u201d and \u201cAn Extraordinary Time: The End of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the Ordinary Economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Fires 20 Amid Investigation Into Workplace Culture", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber has fired 20 employees over harassment, discrimination and inappropriate behavior, as the ride-hailing company tries to contain the fallout from a series of toxic revelations about its workplace.Uber disclosed the terminations on Tuesday at a staff meeting at its San Francisco headquarters, according to an employee who attended the event but was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The firings, which occurred in the last few months, stem from an internal investigation into Uber\u2019s workplace, the employee said. The company did not name the people who were fired, but some were senior executives, the employee said.The firings were aimed at tackling what many at Uber say are deep-seated management and cultural issues, which have made the company a cautionary tale for what can go wrong with Silicon Valley\u2019s often freewheeling corporate culture. Uber has been a lightning rod because of its aggressive chief executive, Travis Kalanick, who has flouted rules and regulations to turn the company into a nearly $70 billion behemoth. Uber\u2019s difficulties have revived questions about how the tech industry treats women and employees in general \u2014 and whether start-ups can recover from such stumbles.\u201cYou only terminate 20 people after you\u2019ve determined after an investigation that there is something very, very wrong at the company,\u201d said Deborah Weinstein, the president of the Weinstein Firm, which deals with employment and workplace law issues. \u201cMost places don\u2019t have this level of things going wrong.\u201dAfter Ms. Fowler\u2019s claims, Uber hired Eric H. Holder Jr., former attorney general, and his law firm, Covington & Burling, to conduct an independent investigation of the claims and to assess the ride-hailing company\u2019s culture. Mr. Holder\u2019s report has been delivered to Uber\u2019s board, and the company plans to make some of it public next week, as well as to discuss the findings with employees.Bobbie Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, said the firm was focused on \u201cspecific\u201d allegations raised from a hotline that Uber set up so employees could send information in confidence. Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation is more broad and focused on Uber\u2019s overall culture.Some companies strategically choose to divide an investigation between two investigators to protect lawyer-client privilege, said Liz Rita, an employment lawyer and owner of Investigations Law Group based in Denver.In such a scenario, one investigator may handle elements involving more sensitive or higher litigation risk, and a second investigator may handle findings that may be disclosed more publicly. This is done to protect a company from inadvertently waiving lawyer-client privilege if they publicly reveal parts of an investigation without disclosing all the findings.Ms. Wilson, the partner at Perkins Coie, said the firm was tapped almost immediately after Ms. Fowler\u2019s blog post was made public. The lawyers combed through thousands of internal documents and emails, and interviewed current and former employees to corroborate claims by Ms. Fowler and others.\u201cWe were given unfettered access,\u201d Ms. Wilson said in an interview. \u201cWe did a thorough and painstaking investigation into all of Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations. We spoke to people \u2014 anybody frankly \u2014 who wanted to give us information on the company\u2019s issues.\u201dSome tips came in through the internal hotline that Uber created. Other information came through Liane Hornsey, Uber\u2019s chief human resources officer, as well as to Arianna Huffington, a member of the company\u2019s board of directors.\u201cBut this is not a systemic problem,\u201d she added.In total, Ms. Wilson said that more than 215 cases of workplace violations were investigated at Uber, of which roughly 100 resulted in no action being taken. Forty-seven of the cases were related to sexual harassment, and 54 involved some form of discrimination. Others fell under the categories of unprofessional behavior, including bullying, retaliation, physical security and other nonsexual forms of harassment.Thirty-one employees are now undergoing some form of workplace training, and seven others have been given final warnings, Uber said. There are 57 complaints still under review.\u201cIf there was something serious, we didn\u2019t wait to tell Uber,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cThe company wasn\u2019t going to wait for some future point in time to take action.\u201dShe declined to comment on who was fired and declined to be specific about the episodes for which people were let go.More recently, Uber has hired several new executives. On Monday, the company said it was bringing on Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor and management consultant, as its first senior vice president for leadership and strategy.The company confirmed another hire on Tuesday, that of Bozoma St. John, a former Apple executive, who will come aboard in the newly created position of chief brand officer.An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of an employment lawyer who is also the owner of Investigations Law Group in Denver.

As the second quarter ends this week, 2017 has so far been a banner year, with major indexes hitting records.But as the bull market rolls on, some see storm clouds on the horizon. \u201cValuations are high and it\u2019s one of the longest and largest bull markets in history,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cBull markets don\u2019t last forever. So the question is, when will the music stop?\u201dInvestors \u201care on a knife\u2019s edge,\u201d said Michael J. Kelly, global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments. With many still scarred by the financial crisis, \u201cthey see a potential disaster around every corner.\u201dThis month the so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which have led the market\u2019s rally \u2014 faced a sudden downdraft, which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times to come. Those jitters were on display Thursday, as tech shares led a sell-off that put a dent in the major indexes.And then there\u2019s Mr. Trump himself, whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential to rattle markets.So I asked some prominent investors and market analysts whether they were pulling back from stocks, and how they viewed these latest developments.There\u2019s no question that these market darlings, which together have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the market\u2019s gains, are expensive, and getting more so. Price-to-earnings ratios range from 38 (Facebook) to 184 (Amazon). Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes. They show up not only in so-called growth funds, but also in value and low-volatility funds. Should they embark on a sustained plunge, a bear market could quickly follow.The tremor in June was \u201ca warning shot across the bow,\u201d said Bill Smead, the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle. The Faang stocks \u201care showing all the classic signs of being overcooked,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat magazine hasn\u2019t had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover? There\u2019s no question this can end very badly. But the market can stay irrational for a very long time. My sense is that there\u2019s one big blowout rally left in these stocks.\u201dMr. Stack noted that the Faang stocks had brief sell-offs last June and October, only to rebound. Still, he said, \u201cthe Faang stocks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due to the amount of money that flowed into them and the high expectations that have driven them higher.\u201dBut like Mr. Smead, he doesn\u2019t expect that to be imminent. \u201cWe\u2019re not buying them, but we\u2019re not necessarily saying sell,\u201d Mr. Stack said. He urged investors to rebalance portfolios that have become too heavily weighted in these stocks.Everyone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market, but that may still be years away.\u201cHistorically it\u2019s difficult to find a bear market that wasn\u2019t triggered to some extent by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as they\u2019re going to will have a significant impact. What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced to raise rates faster than everyone anticipates. The Fed has prepared investors for one more rate hike this year. That\u2019s where the potential surprise could come. If we see two or three by year\u2019s end, we\u2019re going to see definite headwinds and maybe a market top of some significance.\u201dMr. Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room to maneuver before stocks start to be affected. \u201cWe just had a once-in-70-year crisis that left very long scars. Businesses basically didn\u2019t invest for eight years. In tightening, the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate. But we\u2019re just getting to the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and we\u2019re seeing more normal economic activity.\u201dMr. Kelly said bull markets typically last another three to four years after such a point in the economic cycle, and can even go another eight or nine. \u201cBull markets die from excess, not old age,\u201d he said.Mr. Smead agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re getting closer to normal rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be difficult for the stock market when it happens. People will be less willing to be adventurous. But that\u2019s still years away.\u201dOver at InvesTech Research, \u201cwe\u2019re still quite bullish,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe\u2019re not increasing cash reserves. We are rebalancing towards more defensive and out-of-favor sectors, like consumer staples and health care.\u201d\u201cThe risks don\u2019t lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cFor political mayhem to upset the economic apple cart, it has to irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level. So far we don\u2019t see that happening. Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16-year highs, and C.E.O. confidence in April was the highest since 2004.\u201dNor have investors given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver business-friendly corporate tax reform and a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code, despite the president\u2019s troubles.At the same time, \u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t be looking to the market for vindication,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a Trump rally. He\u2019s basically riding on the Obama years. \u201cHis bottom line: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to politics, and that\u2019s been a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Said to Face $1.2 Billion Antitrust Fine, but Battle With Europe Looms", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "Supported byEuropean Union officials are expected to issue a record fine of at least 1.1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, against Google as soon as Tuesday for breaking the region\u2019s tough competition rules.Yet the hefty penalty and its timing, which were confirmed by two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity, are likely to be quickly overshadowed by a more complex problem: How should Google comply with the decision to rein in its power?That dilemma will now take center stage as the tech giant fights doggedly to protect its crown jewel \u2014 its closely guarded search algorithm \u2014 from the prying eyes of regulators and, possibly, its competitors.Potentially heavy-handed intervention may raise the hackles of Google and other companies in the American tech world, which could claim that, once again, Europe is unfairly targeting companies from the United States. The region\u2019s officials deny such accusations.No matter the final outcome, analysts warn that jockeying for greater regulatory control over Google\u2019s services in Europe will drag on for months, if not years, as the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, tries to turn its expected antitrust decision against Google into a reality.\u201cThe issue they\u2019re facing is, how does the European Commission solve the underlying problem\u201d of Google\u2019s suspected antitrust abuse, said Christian Bergqvist, an associate professor of competition law at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. \u201cIt will be very difficult to structure any remedy.\u201dHow Google responds to these demands will be left to the company, which must provide the region\u2019s authorities with potential technical solutions to counter its perceived antitrust abuse. Officials can ask for more changes if they are not satisfied with Google\u2019s initial proposals.Experts and some of the company\u2019s competitors claim that any changes would most likely require greater oversight of Google\u2019s products, including a potential independent monitor over its search services (and, potentially, its algorithms) in Europe to guarantee that it continues to comply with the antitrust ruling.A spokeswoman for the European Commission declined to comment on the potential announcement.\u201cWe believe strongly that our innovations in online shopping have been good for shoppers, retailers and competition,\u201d Al Verney, a company spokesman, said in a statement.The coming announcement against Google represents a watershed moment for the search giant, which holds more than 90 percent of the market in online search across Europe. Still, the potential fine represents a mere fraction of the company\u2019s $90.3 billion in revenue in 2016.Other American tech companies, including Apple, Facebook and Amazon, also remain under investigation by European officials for a variety of antitrust, tax and privacy reasons. And while the companies deny any wrongdoing, the continued focus, and potential hefty fines, have given European authorities an increasingly large say over how much of the internet is regulated. That position comes despite European tech companies mostly failing to keep pace with their American counterparts.\u201cEurope has been more aggressive in enforcement against monopolies than the U.S.,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law and economics at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. \u201cIn Europe, we\u2019re more threatened by the dominance of big companies.\u201dAs Google and its foes prepare for battle over how the search giant should comply with Europe\u2019s upcoming antitrust decision, much attention will focus on lessons from a previous failed attempt to settle the online shopping case in 2014.Analysts and Google\u2019s rivals stressed that any new proposal must go further than these previous efforts, which included placing competitors\u2019 ads online alongside Google\u2019s own digital advertising.To ensure the company complies, one remedy may include the regular monitoring of Google\u2019s action by an outside group. The company, however, also has the option of removing some of its specialized search results altogether, or returning them to what they looked like before Europe\u2019s investigation began almost a decade ago.\u201cAll that the complainants are asking for is that Google restores the level playing field,\u201d said Shivaun Raff, a founder of Foundem, a British comparison shopping site that was the first company to file a complaint against Google.For Michael Weber, director of Hot Maps, a German digital mapping company, the conclusion to Europe\u2019s antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s online shopping service cannot come soon enough.\u201cI can\u2019t image life without being a complainant against Google, it\u2019s been going on for such a long time,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who first filed his claim in 2011. \u201cIt has become something like a marriage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "All the Ways Apple\u2019s iOS 11 Will Change Your iPhone", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "Supported byApple\u2019s latest operating system for iPhones and iPads is set to roll out on September 19th, bringing with it a number of new features and tweaks that are designed to make your phone safer to use and more customizable.We all know how dangerous texting, or using your phone in general, while driving can be, but it doesn\u2019t stop people from thinking they can get away with it. Plus, buzzing alerts on your phone are distracting even if you don\u2019t look at them (and sometimes it seems like they never stop). Apple\u2019s next update will include a possible solution to that problem: It will automatically block notifications when your phone thinks you are behind the wheel.Texts sent via iMessage will also be intercepted. When one arrives, the phone will send an automatic reply saying you are driving and that you\u2019ll respond when you get to your destination. (You can program your phone to let some numbers through the blockade, so loved ones can reach you in a pinch.) When the phone has determined that you\u2019ve stopped driving, your screen will come back to life, and you can catch up on everything you\u2019ve missed.The Control Center, that panel full of easily-accessed buttons and tools you see when you swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone screen, will also get an overhaul in the new update. Soon all the controls will be located on one colorful, widget-filled page.Some have complained that the new layout is confusing and cluttered, but it doesn\u2019t have to be: The Control Center will be customizable, so you can add as many (or as few) widgets as you like, including quick access to your camera, calculator or Apple TV.Additionally, there\u2019s a new toggle for the iPhone\u2019s \u201cLow Power\u201d mode, designed to save battery life while you\u2019re out without a spot to charge your phone. The new Control Center also features quick accessibility settings, including options to magnify your screen, change the brightness, make text display larger (or smaller), enable Do Not Disturb mode, and more. And each setting now makes use of Apple\u2019s \u201c3D Touch\u201d feature, where pressing and holding on an icon brings up additional useful options.Siri, Apple\u2019s personal assistant program, will get an overhaul too. The company said the program will soon have \u201ca new, more natural voice\u201d that will be more \u201cexpressive\u201d than the robotic lilt it currently has. At the conference last week, some audio of both the male and female voices were played to showcase its more nuanced pronunciations. But the biggest changes for Siri will be under the hood, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence.Here is what that means: Apple says Siri will learn so much from you that it will be able to anticipate your needs and make suggestions before you even ask for them.For example, it will offer news stories based on things it has learned you like. If you\u2019re texting a friend about a film you saw or a place you visited, Siri will auto-type the name of the movie or the place. It will suggest new searches for you in Safari based on articles you\u2019ve read. It will automatically queue up songs you like, suggest songs it thinks you will like or answer trivia questions about songs you play.Siri is going to know a lot about you.iOS 11 will also help save storage on your phone. When your storage runs low, a new optional feature will automatically remove apps you don\u2019t use very often. It is called \u201cOffload Unused Apps\u201d and you can turn it on by going to Settings, then tapping General. The selected apps are removed, and you get back all of the space they were using, which can be especially useful for people who\u2019ll need to make room for more photos, for phone updates, or just to download music or movies for a long flight.Don\u2019t worry, though. Your phone will keep any data you have associated with the deleted app, which will display as a gray icon after it has been removed. If you ever want to reinstall it, all you have to do is tap the gray icon and everything is back to the way it was.Apple\u2019s mobile payment system, Apple Pay, will also get a boost with the new update. Using your credit or debit card, you will be able to send money to anyone who also uses iOS11 with just a text message, which can be especially useful for splitting the check at a restaurant, paying someone gas money, or even paying the rent if you\u2019re close with your landlord. You even get an electronic receipt that shows the payment went through.This article was initially published on June 12, 2017, and was updated on September 18th, 2017. It was updated again on September 20th to note that Apple Pay is not available at launch. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Whole Foods, Bezos Gets a Sustainably Sourced Guinea Pig", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "State of the ArtBy purchasing the upscale chain, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief, has a chance to tinker with how people buy groceries \u2014 and map the future of the physical store.Supported byWhen big tech companies make big moves, it\u2019s natural to see the news in earthshaking terms.Sure, all of this seems plausible at some point in the future. In particular, an Amazon presence in groceries might transform it from a company you shop at every once in a while to one you think about several times a week. This is not a novel idea: It was the key reason Walmart got into the grocery business in the 1980s, a move that accelerated its shift from a regional chain into the world\u2019s largest physical retailer.Yet if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, after years of watching Amazon, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time predicting future possibilities. He is instead consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer\u2019s eyes. The other thing to know about Mr. Bezos is that he is a committed experimentalist. His main way of deciding what Amazon should do next is to try stuff out, see what works, and do more of that.So the best way to think of this deal is to look at Whole Foods as a kind of guinea pig for Amazon \u2014 a pricey, organically sourced one, perhaps, but a guinea pig all the same.Amazon almost certainly doesn\u2019t know yet how exactly Whole Foods will fit into its long-term plans. You can expect it to make few dramatic changes to Whole Foods in the near future. Instead, Mr. Bezos and his team will most likely spend years meticulously analyzing and tinkering with how Whole Foods works. They will begin lots of experiments. When something works, they will do more of that, then more, and then even more. They may take over the world all the same \u2014 and, in the process, probably usher in big changes to large swaths of the economy, affecting everything from labor to urban planning \u2014 but they\u2019ll do it in ways we won\u2019t be able to predict now.\u201cI think they look at this as an opportunity to learn,\u201d said Venky Harinarayan, an early Amazon executive who later worked at Walmart, and who also ran a venture capital firm in which Mr. Bezos was a big investor. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for everyone \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone has figured out yet how to use a store to service online customers at massive scale. That\u2019s the experimental piece.\u201dIn this light, I suspect that the Whole Foods deal starts less with a strategic end-goal and more with this insight: Shopping for food is broken. Both the in-store experience and the many attempts at online delivery \u2014 from Webvan to Instacart to Amazon\u2019s own service, Amazon Fresh \u2014 have failed to create the sort of seamless buying experience we enjoy with nonfood e-commerce.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.But online grocery delivery also isn\u2019t so great. Delivery services tend to be far more expensive than in-store shopping, and it\u2019s still not quite painless: You have to order ahead of time, you often have to deal with last-minute substitutions, and the whole process is still quite labor-intensive and wasteful. (Ask me about the many pounds of ice-filled plastic bags I have to dispose of every time I shop at Amazon Fresh.)But wait a second, isn\u2019t $13.4 billion a lot for an experiment? Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u201cNo doubt it\u2019s a big deal; it\u2019s a large amount of money,\u201d Mr. Harinarayan said. But he also noted that Amazon is flying high.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whole Foods Deal Shows Amazon\u2019s Prodigious Tolerance for Risk", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Supported byUnlike almost any other chief executive, Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, has built his company by embracing risk, ignoring obvious moves and imagining what customers want next \u2014 even before they know it.Key to that strategy is his approach to failure. While other companies dread making colossal mistakes, Mr. Bezos seems just not to care. Losing millions of dollars for some reason doesn\u2019t sting. Only success counts. That breeds a fiercely experimental culture that is disrupting entertainment, technology and, especially, retail.Mr. Bezos is one of the few chief executives who joke about how much money they\u2019ve lost.\u201cI\u2019ve made billions of dollars of failures,\u201d Mr. Bezos said at a 2014 conference, adding that it would be like \u201ca root canal with no anesthesia\u201d if he listed them.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take bold bets, they\u2019re going to be experiments,\u201d Mr. Bezos explained. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re experiments, you don\u2019t know ahead of time if they\u2019re going to work. Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure. But a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn\u2019t work.\u201dIt is an approach baked into the company since the beginning \u2014 and one that is difficult, if not impossible, for competitors to emulate. Consider how Amazon Web Services began as a small internal cloud computing project to help Amazon\u2019s core business. Then the company started selling excess cloud capacity to other companies.If the cloud computing business just grew, Amazon Prime was a bold bet from the beginning, the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet for shoppers: Pay an annual fee and all shipping costs for the year are covered. Amazon\u2019s shipping expenses ballooned, but revenue soared so much that no one minded.\u201cWhen you have such a long-term perspective that you think in decades instead of quarters, it allows you to do things and take risks that other companies believe would not be in their best interests,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, an analyst with the investment firm Robert W. Baird & Company.Amazon began, for those too young to remember, as a discount internet bookseller in 1995. In the headiness of the late-1990s dot-com boom, it became the symbol of how this new invention called the World Wide Web was going to change everything. Then, like many of the leading dot-com companies, it blew up. The world wasn\u2019t quite ready for Amazon. It came very close to going under.One thing the retailer did not do was make much money. In its two decades as a public company, Amazon has had a cumulative profit of $5.7 billion. For a company with a market value of nearly $500 billion, this is negligible. Walmart, which has a market value half that of Amazon, made a profit of $14 billion in 2016 alone.But the tens of millions of customers do not care whether Amazon is hugely profitable. They care if it is making their lives easier or better.\u201cJeff Bezos is making shopping great,\u201d said Chris Kubica, an e-book consultant and software developer who watches Amazon closely. \u201cHe\u2019s made me come to expect better from every checkout counter. Oh, I can scan my entire shopping cart full of groceries in one go, without stopping, as I roll into the parking lot? Yes, please. Where do I park?\u201dAs Amazon pushes on with its ceaseless experimenting, however, it risks being seen as less of a cute disrupter of the old and as more of a menace. It has hired many workers for its warehouses, but it is also betting heavily on automation. Amazon Go, after all, is an attempt to drain the labor out of shopping.\u201cAmazon runs the risk of becoming too big,\u201d Mr. Kekre said.Some Amazon critics would like the Whole Foods deal to be the trigger for reining in the company. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent foe of Amazon, noted that the company is \u201crapidly monopolizing online retail\u201d and that both Prime and Echo \u201care strategies for locking in consumers and ensuring they don\u2019t shop anywhere else.\u201d Amazon declined to comment for this article.Where will it all end? Mr. Kubica has thought about this. Amazon can be understood as a decades-long effort to shorten the time between \u201cI want it\u201d and \u201cI have it\u201d into as brief a period as possible. The logical end of this would be the something Mr. Kubica jestingly called Amazon Imp, short for \u201cimplant\u201d and also \u201cimpulse,\u201d Mr. Kubica said. It would be a chip inserted under the skin.\u201cThe imp would sense your impulses and desires,\u201d Mr. Kubica wrote in an email, \u201cand then either virtually fulfill them by stimulating your brain (for a modest payment to Amazon, of course) or it would make a box full of goodies for you appear on your doorstep (for a larger fee, of course).\u201dEvery desire fulfilled. \u201cI am sure that Amazon even now is building it,\u201d Mr. Kubica said.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Lesson: Silicon Valley\u2019s Start-Up Machine Needs Fixing", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtWhat happened at Uber is an indictment of everyone who enabled Mr. Kalanick\u2019s worst tendencies and practices, which is just about everyone in a position of power at the ride-hailing company and its funders. In other words, this was systemic. Top to bottom, Uber was a failure of Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up machine.And if we want Silicon Valley to create better start-ups \u2014 which we should, for everyone\u2019s sake \u2014 the Valley would be wise to now examine Uber\u2019s entrails and find another way.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.But there was a crowd standing behind him, too.First, this was a clear failure of oversight \u2014 of investors, boards of directors, partners and anyone else who could have altered Uber\u2019s course and clearly failed to do so. Overlearning the lesson of Steve Jobs\u2019s first fall at Apple \u2014 and of founder-led hyper-successes at Google and Facebook \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s investors created a culture where founders are given carte blanche, their pronouncements and tactics elevated to the level of divine infallibility.A convenient excuse. And, in retrospect, a bad strategy. If Uber had been forced to go public sooner \u2014 if it couldn\u2019t raise billions at the drop of a hat from the likes of Saudi Arabia \u2014 it would have opened itself up to much-needed scrutiny and potential reform. Staying private created a hothouse that reinforced its worst side, and allowed it to delay building a sustainable culture with a focus on long-term interests.How might Uber have created such a culture? First, by admitting that founders are not infallible, and recognizing that the most successful ones do best when their impulses are hemmed in by trusted lieutenants, mentors and firm boards of directors.Fun fact: Mr. Jobs didn\u2019t want to create a Windows-compatible version of the iPod or an app store for the iPhone; it was his lieutenants who pushed him to do it. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and the Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were guided by strong, experienced and extremely sober operators \u2014 Sheryl Sandberg and Eric Schmidt, respectively. Mr. Kalanick, meanwhile, was allowed to operate more or less solo, to micromanage a company that grew to enormous scale, and was left alone even when the firm\u2019s problems became plain to see.Finally, this was a failure driven by plain greed, of ends justifying means.Over the next few days you may hear a revisionist defense of Uber and Mr. Kalanick that will go like this: Uber was fighting an entrenched and monopolistic cabal \u2014 taxi companies and their captured regulators \u2014 so it had to act more like a wolf than a sheep. Related to that, you will hear this: Uber is good for the world. If it wins, it will reduce car ownership, drive up fuel efficiency, reduce traffic, lower the cost of transportation, probably reduce accidents, almost certainly save lives.In every Uber story I write, I get to a paragraph that aims to succinctly note all the recent scandals at the company. What\u2019s notable about this paragraph is how many different kinds of problems there are to put down.It didn\u2019t have to be like this. Yes, business ain\u2019t beanbag; yes, fighting the incumbent businesses requires a strong stomach. But there were so many different problems at Uber that you\u2019d have to be comically na\u00efve to conclude they all stemmed from an intransigent rival.No, there was something much more deeply amiss here \u2014 and everyone put in their money anyway, because, hey, Uber was growing very quickly, so why not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Decline of the Baronial C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Corporate giants once had all-powerful chiefs with domains to match. But activist investors and technological change are remaking the executive suite.Supported byFAIRFIELD, Conn. \u2014 They bestrode the business world, or at least the suburban corporate campus, like a colossus.Sitting behind burnished wooden desks, in glass-walled corner offices like the one Jeffrey R. Immelt occupied at General Electric\u2019s former headquarters here, a select group of American chief executives were once more akin to statesmen than businessmen.G.E. moved out of this sprawling Skidmore, Owings & Merrill-designed emblem of 1970s corporate modernism in favor of smaller, humbler digs in downtown Boston last year. And last week, Mr. Immelt unexpectedly announced plans to retire after 16 years in the top job, amid a sagging stock price and pressure from activist investors.General Electric is just the latest storied name in corporate America to show its leader the door. Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, had been in the job for less than three years when he was fired in late May. Two weeks earlier, Mario Longhi of U.S. Steel abruptly stepped down.With these departures, the American era of the baronial chief executive, sitting atop an industrial dominion with all the attendant privileges, is drawing to a close.It is one consequence of a transformed economic landscape in which many of the mega-corporations that defined 20th-century commercial life are confronting a host of new business and technological challenges. These changes \u2014 in corporate leadership, on boards and across Wall Street \u2014 are recasting the very idea of industry in America.\u201cThe C.E.O. with a big office, a tenure of 10 or 20 years, in a suit and tie, is becoming a thing of the past,\u201d said Vijay Govindarajan, who served as G.E.\u2019s chief innovation consultant in 2008 and 2009 and now teaches at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business.Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit from G.E. is particularly telling, given the company\u2019s reputation as a training ground for the future chief executives of other companies. He tried to change G.E., yet couldn\u2019t react quickly enough to the forces affecting companies like his.These include the rising power of activist investors, who buy up stakes in companies and then demand changes. Activists are now hunting much bigger game, demanding double-digit annual earnings growth in a stagnant economy. Or else.That deal also shows how the digital age has upended the competitive landscape, pitting companies in vastly different industries against one another.\u201cWho ever thought Ford would be competing with Google?\u201d said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who has studied corporate leadership for decades. \u201cBut they are, and Mark Fields wasn\u2019t moving fast enough.\u201dBoards, too, have changed, evolving from country-club-like collections of the same familiar faces into a much more diverse and demanding constituency.To be sure, the money is better than ever. And pockets of unbridled ambition and occasional excess remain, especially in Silicon Valley, where Apple\u2019s new $5 billion spaceshiplike headquarters opened in April.But for most of the Fortune 500, the unquestioned power and perks, the imperviousness to criticism from the likes of shareholders, and the outsize public profile that once automatically came with the corner office have gone the way of the typewriter and the Dictaphone.\u201cThese people were bigger than life, and I saw it up close,\u201d said Kevin Sharer, a former chief executive of Amgen who worked as a top aide to Mr. Immelt\u2019s legendary predecessor at G.E., Jack Welch. \u201cThey were a combination of chief executive, statesman and rock star. They were unassailable.\u201dA Naval Academy graduate, then an officer, before joining G.E. in 1984, Mr. Sharer said the only place that evoked a feeling of power comparable to the long hallways and corner offices of Fairfield in its prime was aboard the fast attack nuclear submarines where he once served as chief engineer.\u201cWe had the confidence, the swagger, and we felt like we had unlimited industrial potential,\u201d he said. \u201cCould we buy RCA or NBC? Of course we could. I\u2019m not complaining, but this is absolutely not the case today.\u201dAs Amgen\u2019s chief executive in the spring of 2009, Mr. Sharer visited the White House repeatedly to meet with Obama administration officials as they designed what would become the Affordable Care Act. He also played a key role in getting fellow pharmaceutical industry chiefs to support the legislation.Now retired and teaching at Harvard Business School, Mr. Sharer said he would never do that today, as wading into bitterly partisan public debates offers little upside for corporate leaders, and risks damage to their company\u2019s reputation.As a result, while companies in many ways have more economic and political power than ever, \u201cchief executives now shy away from weighing in on the policy level or broader societal issues,\u201d Mr. Sharer said. \u201cThey\u2019re more focused on running their companies.\u201dThere are exceptions. Besides Mr. Immelt\u2019s outspokenness on the climate issue, last year Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck called out \u201cbad actors\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry for exorbitant price increases. Timothy D. Cook of Apple challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed immigration restrictions in January.Still, Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit leaves a void at the intersection of business and public policy, along with the retirement this year of Douglas R. Oberhelman, the Caterpillar chief who led both the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers.\u201cIf you start fooling around in Washington with the Business Roundtable or writing op-eds, activist investors will ask what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Useem said.\u201cI don\u2019t see him stepping into that role,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep his head down and focus on the numbers.\u201dAt Exxon Mobil, it\u2019s referred to as the God Pod. On the 11th floor of Procter & Gamble\u2019s headquarters in Cincinnati, there was Mahogany Row. And while the official name of the executive wing at G.E.\u2019s Fairfield headquarters was E3, inside the company it was known as Carpet Land.And no wonder. From the Persian rugs that lined the hallways to the plush wool floor covering in Mr. Immelt\u2019s office and private conference room, the carpets created the hushed atmosphere of a monastery or library.\u201cIt was so quiet, you could feel the energy drain out of you,\u201d said Ann Klee, the G.E. executive who oversaw the move to Boston and the development of its new headquarters there.What these executive aeries all shared was an Olympus-like sense of remoteness, authority and defined hierarchy.At G.E., even in Carpet Land, office size grew in lock step with rank, and the biggest corner space was reserved for the chief executive. Not only did Mr. Immelt have his own bathroom, but his two administrative assistants had a private bathroom and a pantry.The abundant perks \u2014 in G.E.\u2019s case, two helicopter pads, a shoeshine station and an executive dining room linked to the kitchen below by dumbwaiters \u2014 fed the sense of exalted status. At the same time, faster economic growth and rising earnings camouflaged the cost of these indulgences.With G.E.\u2019s profits and shares soaring in the 1980s, Mr. Welch oversaw the construction of a private 28-room hotel known as the Guest House to serve visiting executives and others, with no expense spared on the parquet floors, wood-burning fireplaces and a Steinway piano, which was left behind when the company moved out.\u201cNothing was off-the-shelf,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Brien, a 19-year G.E. veteran who helped supervise the Fairfield facility. \u201cWith Jack Welch, everything was custom and the operation was five star, spot on.\u201dAlmost 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001 and Mr. Immelt took over, G.E. shares have never regained their 2000 peak. So while Mr. Immelt successfully steered the company through a near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis, refocused it on its industrial roots and shed its ancillary businesses, it became a natural target for activist investors.One of those was Nelson Peltz, a onetime corporate raider who relied on Michael R. Milken\u2019s junk bonds for financing back when Mr. Welch was building his Guest House. Mr. Peltz has come a long way since then, having scored big wins forcing laggards like Heinz and Wendy\u2019s to improve their performance, and he acquired a $2 billion stake in G.E. in 2015.G.E.\u2019s chief communications officer, Deirdre Latour, denied that activist pressure was a factor in Mr. Immelt\u2019s decision to retire. \u201cSixteen years is a long time,\u201d she said.But at 61, Mr. Immelt is four years younger than Mr. Welch when he stepped down, and joins a long list of otherwise respected executives whose stately succession plans were seemingly interrupted by impatient investors.\u201cC.E.O. tenure is down from the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, and the G.E. situation is a reflection of that,\u201d said Jason D. Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201cWithout this outside pressure, it\u2019s likely Jeff Immelt would have served out his term and retired at 64 or 65.\u201dNow other chief executives are feeling the same pressure, including Mary T. Barra of General Motors. \u201cShe\u2019s being pulled in different directions,\u201d Mr. Schloetzer said, noting that G.M.\u2019s shares have barely budged in the last two years, even as the broader stock market has soared.If Ms. Barra can\u2019t turn things around in 12 to 18 months, Mr. Schloetzer said, she could share a fate similar to that of Mr. Fields at Ford.Indeed, Mr. Fields\u2019s defenestration was more shocking in many ways than Mr. Immelt\u2019s slow-motion fade, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management.\u201cHe\u2019s the poster child for what\u2019s happened to the C.E.O. job,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cUntil last month, people thought dynastic family capital like the Ford family was the solution to rampant short-termism. I\u2019m sorry Ford forgot that recipe.\u201dHow did activist investors acquire such outsize power over publicly traded companies?\u201cWith fewer public companies out there, any one of them is more likely to become a target of interest for one hedge fund or another,\u201d Mr. Slaughter said.At the same time, activists are getting more, well, active. More than 300 American companies were targeted by these investors in 2015, up from just over 100 in 2010, according to Mr. Useem of Wharton. They\u2019re also becoming more successful at winning board seats, as fewer companies stagger their board elections over three-year cycles.What\u2019s more, chief executives have less internal latitude. In 2001, more than half of new C.E.O.s also assumed the position of chairman when they took over. By 2016, only 10 percent occupied both roles, according to an analysis by Strategy&, the strategy and consulting arm of PwC.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the C.E.O. running the board too,\u201d said Gary L. Neilson, a principal with Strategy&. \u201cNow the C.E.O. has a boss.\u201dBoards themselves have changed, Mr. Sonnenfeld added. A few decades ago, a Pittsburgh-based giant like U.S. Steel would draw board members from a local pool of business and community leaders.\u201cThere was a downside in terms of cronyism, mutual back-scratching and a hesitance to criticize,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positive was that they were anchored in their communities and they invested in them. Now, for C.E.O.s, all the constituencies have changed.\u201dSo while boards are still willing to dole out huge golden parachutes to C.E.O.\u2019s, even if they fail, they\u2019ve become much more generous with money than they are with additional time.The glaring exception to the trends outlined by Mr. Sonnenfeld is in the technology sector. But in many ways, these firms are the exception that proves the rule, because they play by different rules.Facebook also has a multi-class stock structure that effectively guarantees that the founder Mark Zuckerberg will retain control even as he sells shares. And on this point, the company offers no apologies.The staggering profitability of the tech giants provides their leaders with more than a little of the swagger the industrial executives once possessed.In 1990, the revenues of Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers totaled $250 billion while they employed 1.2 million people, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.Silicon Valley\u2019s top three companies in 2014 had almost the same revenues before adjusting for inflation \u2014 $247 billion \u2014 but with 137,000 employees, they required a work force just one-tenth the size.That kind of efficiency adds up to huge profits, soaring stock prices and few complaints from investors. Or as Brooks C. Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown, put it, \u201cIf your stock is doing well, your job is safe.\u201dIf the old quarters for G.E.\u2019s top brass were akin to a pedestal, the new ones are more like a fishbowl. At G.E.\u2019s interim headquarters in Boston, and in the permanent one set to open next year, the offices for top leaders have glass walls that enable them to see out and, in turn, let employees see in.They are also much smaller. In Fairfield, a handful of senior G.E. leaders and their assistants occupied 44,000 square feet in the executive wing. Now the same group shares a total of just 7,800 square feet, less space than in the big mansions many C.E.O.s inhabit in places like Greenwich, Conn., or the Bay Area.\u201cIt has a much more collaborative feel, and the glass replicates the transparency of working together,\u201d said Ms. Klee, the G.E. executive. \u201cThe Fairfield campus was beautiful, but it lacked the spark you feel here. It\u2019s a different time, and we like the power and energy and creativity that comes from mixing people together.\u201dG.E.\u2019s 66-acre Fairfield campus was purchased for $31.5 million last fall by Sacred Heart University, according to Michael J. Kinney, the school\u2019s senior vice president for finance and administration.\u201cThere\u2019s not as big a need for corporate headquarters like this any more,\u201d said Mr. Kinney, who as a Kraft executive once worked in a similarly spectacular setting in the Taj Mahal-like General Foods building in Rye Brook, N.Y. \u201cThose were the days.\u201dMr. Kinney has big plans to convert the old offices into classrooms, a business incubator space and a computer engineering center, among other things. Students will be trained in hospitality at the former Guest House.As a result, the university has kept the campus in pristine condition since the last G.E. executives left. \u201cThe only things missing are the Persian rugs and the artwork,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who now serves as Sacred Heart\u2019s director of facilities.\u201cIt\u2019s such a different vibe with the kids all here,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who added that he\u2019s still getting used to people strolling around the manicured grounds rather than quietly shuttling between hushed offices.Walking around the pub in the Guest House Mr. Welch built, Mr. O\u2019Brien confessed to a little nostalgia for G.E.\u2019s glory days in Fairfield. \u201cCan\u2019t you see just see Jack running the world from here in \u201987 or \u201988?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Titans Make Pilgrimage to White House to Discuss Government Systems", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cGovernment needs to catch up with the technology revolution,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who strolled in at the end of the meeting to greet the tech titans. \u201cWe\u2019re going to change that with the help of great American businesses like the people assembled.\u201dHe later said, drawing laughter, \u201cWe have approximately $3.5 trillion of market value in this room \u2014 but that\u2019s almost the exact number that we\u2019ve created since my election.\u201dThe event was organized by Jared Kushner, special adviser to the president and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Chris Liddell, the White House director of strategic initiatives and former chief financial officer of Microsoft. Mr. Kushner\u2019s Office of American Innovation brought together the executives for 10 workshops on topics such as cybersecurity, analytics and using technology to better connect people to government services.Mr. Kushner opened the event in the White House Indian Peace Treaty room by emphasizing the potential of the companies to improve the government\u2019s outdated and inefficient technology systems.\u201cTogether we will unleash the creativity of the private sector to provide citizen services in a way that has never happened before,\u201d he said.The opportunity for Silicon Valley is enormous. The federal government spends $80 billion a year on information technology, much of it used to maintain outdated technology such as data systems that are decades old and storage that includes floppy disks used at the Defense Department. Federal agencies maintain 6,100 data centers that could be consolidated and moved to the cloud.The meeting occurred as tech company stocks roared back after declining in the last two weeks, pushing the stock market to records on Monday. Apple and Alphabet, the parent of Google, were among the top gainers after three consecutive sessions of declines.Mr. Musk did not attend the meeting Monday. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, was invited but declined because of a scheduling conflict, the company said.\u201cThis is a double-edged sword for the tech C.E.O.s because they don\u2019t want to be window dressing and used for photo ops,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor and associate dean at the Yale School of Management. \u201cBut on the other side, this is the most business-friendly administration since Eisenhower and is much more open than any administration to influence on the spot.\u201dAdministration officials said that the chief executives had done their homework and were engaged in the workshops and discussions.\u201cI don\u2019t think there was any one big suggestion,\u201d Mr. Liddell said in an interview. \u201cBut there was a large number of small suggestions, all of which are interesting for us to follow up.\u201dSeveral tech executives had a chance to address Mr. Trump in a round-table discussion at the end of the day.Mr. Bezos encouraged the president to use commercial technology whenever possible. Amazon\u2019s booming cloud services business has become a contractor to the government. The Amazon founder also emphasized the need to retrain workers and said it was \u201cimpossible to overstate\u201d the importance of artificial intelligence.Peter Thiel, an early Trump supporter and tech investor, praised the president.\u201cYour administration is doing very well,\u201d he said.Two people who were briefed on the tech meeting later said Mr. Trump also voiced support for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration reform, a term that was used during the Obama administration to generally describe a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States.The president made the promise, the two people said, after being told by Mr. Cook that tech employees may worry they are being targeted amid confusion over the administration\u2019s immigration policy. It was unclear exactly what the president meant, or if he was using the term to mean something else. White House press aides did not respond to a request for comment on Monday night, and a spokesman for Apple declined to comment.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from Washington, Vindu Goel from San Francisco, and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pandora Extends Deadline for KKR Deal to Explore Its Options", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "Supported byThe countdown for a possible sale of Pandora Media was extended on Thursday, as the company weighed investments from the private equity firm KKR and an unnamed \u201cstrategic investor\u201d that may well be Sirius XM.Pandora, which has struggled to hold on to its position as one of the dominant outlets for streaming music, struck a deal a month ago in which KKR would invest $150 million through a purchase of convertible preferred stock.Under that agreement, Pandora had the right to terminate the deal within 30 days if it found a buyer for the company. That deadline arrived on Thursday.Pandora did not specify a new deadline in its statement, and a spokesman for the company did not respond to a question about it.Last year, Pandora had a net loss of $343 million \u2014 up from a loss of nearly $170 million in 2015 \u2014 and in the first quarter of this year, Pandora reported the lowest number of active monthly listeners in more than two years, at 76.7 million.The company\u2019s stock is down about 33 percent year to date. On Wednesday, it closed at $8.48, near its 52-week low. That price put the company\u2019s market capitalization around $2 billion.For a year, Wall Street has speculated that Sirius XM, the satellite radio broadcaster, would purchase Pandora. The combination, as many analysts see it, could greatly expand Sirius XM\u2019s advertising business and give it a stronger position in internet-connected cars, where Pandora is popular but Sirius XM\u2019s satellite radio business is threatened.Top executives at Liberty Media, the cable and media giant that owns a majority of Sirius XM\u2019s stock, have stoked much of that speculation. Gregory B. Maffei, the company\u2019s chief executive, has stated repeatedly that he is interested in Pandora, but only at the right price; perhaps as a result, Pandora\u2019s share price has been on steady decline.A spokesman for Liberty Media did not immediately return a request seeking comment.Pandora\u2019s shares rose on the news that it was extending the deadline to terminate the KKR investment, increasing about 1.2 percent to $8.56 by late morning.Advertisement"}
