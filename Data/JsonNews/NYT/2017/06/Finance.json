{"Headline": "The Monk Who Left the Monastery to Fix Broken Retirement Plans", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneySANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 There are many things that Doug Lynam has to think about now that he no longer wears a robe and lives in a monastery. Socks, for one. Do they match? Should he care? \u201cHow does this color thing work?\u201d he wondered aloud in his office this week while sporting a muted gray pair that did not in fact clash.But after decades as a committed seeker, he at least has found his calling. He wants to help schools build better retirement savings plans, so their teachers can leave the classroom at a time of their choosing with dignity and grace.His path to that purpose had some unexpected stops along the way.In his early teenage years in Naperville, Ill., Mr. Lynam dabbled in Christian fundamentalism. \u201cI found community, family and friendship,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the theology was very conservative.\u201dThen came the longhaired hippie phase. \u201cThey talked about peace and love,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there was a lot of smug satisfaction about shared values. What were they doing to help and serve others? The answer was, not much.\u201dAnd then came a stint in the Marine Corps Officer Candidates School in 1994 and 1995. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill people for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there was no pressing global conflict or need for my service.\u201dWhile it all may seem somewhat flighty, Mr. Lynam, 43, said the bouncing around merely reflected a restless soul who was nonetheless committed to doing good. \u201cWhy did God put me on this earth?\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t figure that out, how do I pick a career or spouse, or operate in the world? I felt like I needed to answer that question fundamentally before I could be of use to anyone.\u201dIt was his thesis adviser from St. John\u2019s who invited him to become a Benedictine monk, and the appeal was immediate. \u201cIf you\u2019re really searching for the meaning of life, where better to find it than a monastery?\u201d Mr. Lynam said.The commitment required oaths of celibacy, obedience and poverty. The three monks in residence in Santa Fe did paid work as teachers and pooled their funds. One of the senior monks managed the money, Mr. Lynam said.By the end of the 1990s, however, there was trouble. The three monks had never asked the public for financial support, and they didn\u2019t take money from the Catholic Church either, as they wished to maintain their independence.But poverty had turned out to be a relative term. The monks needed cars and new tires and health insurance, and they lived in a house that came with expenses. They took others on religious retreats and made trips to Rome themselves. Both older monks had brought debt to the relationship that Mr. Lynam did not know about until years into their brotherhood.Eventually, they were so far in the hole that personal bankruptcy for all three of them was the best option for keeping the monastery intact. While Mr. Lynam did not ultimately appear before a judge in his robe, the irony and embarrassment were no fun nonetheless. \u201cIt was emotionally gut-wrenching,\u201d said Mr. Lynam, who didn\u2019t know much about personal finance at the time. \u201cOne of the worst things that has ever happened to me.\u201dBut it also awakened something in him. The stream of visitors to his monastery would arrive with many purported reasons. As the junior monk, he did not give much religious counsel. But he soon recognized a pattern: Every person who arrived with a spiritual issue had a financial problem lurking somewhere beneath it.\u201cSo I would say, \u2018I\u2019ll pray for you, but let\u2019s make a budget,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s start paying off student loans. Let\u2019s get the child support you deserve.\u2019 Prayer and contemplation can help you take more mindful action, but action is the outcome of contemplation.\u201dAs a math, astronomy, economics and, eventually, personal finance teacher at Santa Fe Preparatory School, Brother Doug, as the students knew him, also became the person many colleagues turned to when they had questions about their financial lives. And when one lifelong teacher showed him her $16,000 retirement account, he was aghast.While she cried in front of him, his head exploded with questions that he did not know how to answer. Who was in charge of this plan? How did they not know that she had so little money saved? Why didn\u2019t they tell her? And how do I fix this?His conclusion? \u201cThese plans have drifted for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are poor investment choices, high fees and annuities that are abusive. Schools have forgotten that they are fiduciaries, and we\u2019re seeing retirements being torpedoed by negligence, essentially.\u201dSo has Mr. Lynam concluded that his former colleagues need him more than his former students? Not exactly. \u201cI\u2019m not irreplaceable in the classroom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did not see another company serving teachers in the way that I can serve them. It\u2019s not that one form of service is higher or lower.\u201dIt is a very different role, though \u2014 one he describes as being a \u201csuffering prevention specialist.\u201d His professional conversations now feel a lot like confession, he said, with people sharing stories of unpaid debts, betrayals and sure things that were far from it. He listens, and then he must hold the mirror up to those who may not want to see the truth.\u201cPerhaps one of the cardinal sins that I see the most, though it\u2019s not a popular one to talk about, is sloth,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people are afraid but also a little lazy, and they don\u2019t really want to do the hard work of facing their mistakes or lack of organization and knowledge on these subjects and take responsibility.\u201dAnd yet he loves it, as he knew he would have to for it to feel he was retiring from the monastery to move toward something great. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very circuitous journey to find out what my calling is, what is being asked of me in the truest sense, that will bring all of my being,\u201d he said. \u201cThis requires all of my mind, heart and devotion. And that is a beautiful thing.\u201dTwitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Kindergarten Blast in China, \u2018The World Didn\u2019t Seem Real\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byXUZHOU, China \u2014 On most days, the pageant of parents jostling to pick up their children began at 4:45 p.m. on the tree-lined streets outside the Chuangxin kindergarten. Car horns blared. Parents whistled and waved their arms, holding boxes of juice and cookies, as the children emerged.But on Thursday, the rite turned into a scene of carnage, as an explosion outside the school\u2019s main gate killed eight people and injured 65 others. Children, their faces covered in blood, screamed on the sidewalk. Parents lay on the street, some unconscious and others pleading for help.\u201cSuddenly, we were in a nightmare,\u201d said Bo Li, 62, who was waiting to pick up his 4-year-old granddaughter. \u201cThe world didn\u2019t seem real.\u201dChinese investigators on Friday pointed to a suspect in the explosion, Xu Taoran, 22, a university dropout who had written violent screeds against parents and children. The police recovered explosive materials in the home of Mr. Xu, who died at the scene.\u201cThey feel frustrated that they can\u2019t solve the problems in their life,\u201d said Pi Yijun, a criminology professor at China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing. \u201cThe attention and terror they get by hurting children are far more than that achieved from hurting adults.\u201dWhile a booming economy has spread prosperity across China, rapid changes in society have caused anxiety in some regions. In recent years, as the economy slowed, a glut of college graduates has left many young people struggling to find work.Mr. Xu, who lived across the street from the kindergarten, seemed to be grappling with feelings of isolation. Over the past several days, he appeared to reach a breaking point, writing violent messages inside apartment buildings, the authorities said.\u201cCriminals=fathers and mothers,\u201d said a message scribbled in an apartment entryway that was viewed by The New York Times.\u201cWhen two people commit a crime, two people die,\u201d said another. \u201cWhen a nation commits a crime, a nation dies.\u201dJoshua Miller, a professor at Smith College who has studied attacks at schools, said many people in China were caught between traditional definitions of love, success and filial piety and the pressures of modern life.\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lot of social upheaval, people are in a less secure, stable situation in general,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes there is a localized grievance, fueled by a person\u2019s sense of being disenfranchised, angry and upset at unfairness or inequality in society.\u201dAt the same time, many Chinese hospitals are ill equipped to handle patients with mental health problems. The country\u2019s psychiatric system was torn apart under Chairman Mao, who considered mental illness a creation of the bourgeoisie and prescribed communist writings as a remedy.In recent years, the field has made important strides. But financing remains limited, and a social stigma against people with mental illness is pervasive.\u201cThere\u2019s been far fewer public health campaigns like in the West that have educated people that psychiatric problems are an illness,\u201d Professor Miller said.Attacks at schools have gained widespread attention in recent years, prompting some reflection about campus safety and mental health. Guns are strictly regulated in China, but assailants often employ knives and other tools.In addition to the 2012 attack, a man wielding a knife climbed over the wall of a kindergarten in January and attacked 11 students in Pingxiang, a city in the southern region of Guangxi. And last month, a disgruntled driver in eastern China lit a school bus on fire, state news media reported, killing 11 children.Top government officials, including Premier Li Keqiang, have in the past promised to improve school safety. But mental health issues persist, especially in rural areas, where health care for the poor is often inadequate.The Chinese Ministry of Education, seeking to ease concerns among parents, issued an order on Friday calling for stricter security on school campuses in light of the case in Xuzhou.The authorities have said that no children or teachers from the kindergarten were killed in the explosion there on Thursday. Most of the victims appeared to be parents and grandparents, who were lining up outside the school gate to pick up students, according to interviews with relatives and hospital officials. When the explosion occurred, children were still inside classrooms, parents said.Witnesses said the explosion had occurred just as the main gate was sliding open for dismissal. In interviews, residents said they did not recall seeing Mr. Xu at the scene.But a dossier that circulated on social media and was verified by The Times said the police believed that Mr. Xu had thrown an explosive at the gate. The authorities said they had DNA evidence linking Mr. Xu to the attack.Li Quanquan, 27, who was picking up his son, said the crowd of people had fallen to the ground as soon as the explosion broke out.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what had happened,\u201d he said from a hospital bed as he received treatment for hearing problems. \u201cI lost consciousness.\u201dMr. Xu\u2019s parents worked for the People\u2019s Liberation Army. As a child, he lived in a compound for military employees and their families in Xuzhou. His former neighbors said that the family was well off and that Mr. Xu appeared to have a normal childhood.Along the streets surrounding the kindergarten, residents said they worried about safety. A small explosion in a nearby apartment building several weeks earlier had gone unexplained, they said, and the police were slow to respond to Thursday\u2019s attack.\u201cIf it didn\u2019t happen so close to me, I wouldn\u2019t care,\u2019\u2019 said Liu Yao, who lives near the kindergarten. \u201cBut it\u2019s right here in my own neighborhood. It\u2019s frightening.\u2019\u2019Yufan Huang, Adam Wu and Karoline Kan contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

They scamper urgently across the room in pursuit of things we cannot see.And yet, cats are a strangely relaxing presence during yoga class.The yoga sessions are partly just for fun, but they also bring in new people who may want to adopt a pet. (The cats on hand tend to be highly available.)At least 40 cats will wander through the yoga class, Ms. Riley said, while others will sit on perches and observe. \u201cSometimes one will choose a particular person and will stay with them throughout the whole class,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd some are social butterflies who meet with all the different students.\u201dDuring the savasana, or final resting pose of a yoga class, \u201cusually at least half the people will have a cat asleep on their chest \u2014 it\u2019s just the sweetest thing,\u201d Ms. Riley said.For Megan O\u2019Boyle, a 30-year-old social worker who moved from her native Wisconsin to New York for graduate school, cat yoga is just one way to spend time with animals, something she misses from home. Living in the city with a roommate, \u201cI need animal time,\u201d she said. \u201cI go to the dog park sometimes.\u201d Ms. O\u2019Boyle said she grew up with cats and occasionally practices yoga. After a recent class at Meow Parlour, she said, \u201cIt was easy to do, and it was fun to have the cats all around.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a big stress reliever,\u201d Ms. Ginzburg said. \u201cI want to keep coming back.\u201dYoga participants are warned against bringing their own mats, which are likely to see some claw-induced damage.\u201cNone of the classes are ever the same,\u201d said Emilie Legrand, a co-owner of Meow Parlour and an affiliated bakery, Macaron Parlour, both on the Lower East Side. \u201cIt depends on the group of cats and the time of day.\u201d Afternoon classes tend to be more laid back, she said, because the cats are sleepy and just observe, while at the evening classes, when the cats are anticipating supper, they tend to be more frolicsome.\u201cLike, sometimes a cat will be using the litter box.\u201dSimilar cat cafes have sprouted across the country in the last two years or so, typically separating the animal playspace from the food area, for health reasons.The emphasis tends to be less on the food than on fostering good times for people in need of a cat fix. Cat participation in the yoga classes varies widely.\u201cWe\u2019ve actually had kitties who have stretched with people,\u201d said Ms. Hatt. \u201cProbably unintentionally. But they do an excellent downward dog.\u201dMs. Legrand, of Meow Parlour, said that the rotating cast of cats refreshes the experience. \u201cIt\u2019s fun when we have a few new cats, and you can tell it\u2019s their first yoga class, because they are very curious,\u201d she said. \u201cThe yoga mats are like cat magnets.\u201d\u201cCats\u2019 energy is such a wonderful and relaxing thing to be around,\u201d Ms. King said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a perfect match to yoga.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rabbi Meir Zlotowitz, Who Made Jewish Prayer Books Clear to All, Dies at 73", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis son Rabbi Gedaliah Zlotowitz said the cause was a liver ailment.Though Jews often refer to themselves as \u201cpeople of the book,\u201d the canonical books they studied and prayed from into the 1970s were often dense with undifferentiated Hebrew and Aramaic typeface and translated in inflated or turgid English. They were suitable for cognoscenti but not for novices or rusty yeshiva alumni.ArtScroll, founded by Rabbi Zlotowitz in the mid-1970s, worked to make the books accessible to both, starting with the megillah (scroll) of Esther and crowning the company\u2019s output in 2005 with a 73-volume set of the Babylonian Talmud.\u201cArtScroll made it possible for anyone to study Talmud on his or her own,\u201d said Samuel C. Heilman, who specializes in Jewish studies as a distinguished professor of sociology at the City University of New York.The elegant ArtScroll siddur, or prayer book, used for daily, Sabbath and holiday prayers is so sought after that more than a million copies have been printed. It is used even by some synagogues in the more liberal Conservative Jewish movement.ArtScroll\u2019s sales have been helped by the striking growth of the Orthodox movement; 10 percent of American Jews identify themselves as Orthodox, according to a Pew Research Center study in 2015, but 27 percent of children under 18 are Orthodox, foreshadowing a mushrooming share of the Jewish population in years to come.Rather than assume that every Jew knows the sometimes arcane procedures and rationales for prayer, the siddur lays them out in clear contemporary English and features explanatory footnotes, in the way that an annotated edition of Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses\u201d might ease that novel\u2019s reading.For example, the siddur tells those unfamiliar with the central Amidah prayer to \u201ctake three steps backward, then three steps forward\u201d at the start, and urges a worshiper to \u201cpray loudly enough to hear himself\u201d but not so loudly that its recitation is audible to others.J. Philip Rosen, a lawyer whose donation financed the siddur\u2019s 1992 edition, said Rabbi Zlotowitz, concerned about making books \u201cvery user-friendly,\u201d agreed to make the type large enough for those with diminishing eyesight, like Mr. Rosen\u2019s father.Rabbi Zlotowitz, ArtScroll\u2019s president, ran the business with his partners of 41 years, Rabbi Nosson Scherman, who has served as general editor, and Rabbi Sheah Brander, its graphics expert. Both are continuing with the company. Rabbi Zlotowitz wrote or edited 15 of the company\u2019s 2,000 titles himself, including a six-volume anthology of commentary on Genesis.Meir Zlotowitz, a soft-spoken man with a flowing white beard, was born in New York City on July 13, 1943, the youngest child of Aaron and Fruma Zlotowitz, immigrants from Lithuania. The father was a ritual circumciser and slaughterer with an almost thorough recall of the Talmud. Rabbi Zlotowitz told friends that he never woke up without hearing the singsong melody of his father studying.He attended two yeshivas, Rabbi Jacob Joseph School and, for post-high school, Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem, both on the Lower East Side of Manhattan at the time. The latter was led by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, who was regarded as his generation\u2019s leading authority on Jewish law. Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem conferred Meir Zlotowitz\u2019s rabbinical ordination.Talented in art and design, Rabbi Zlotowitz took courses in graphics at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and began doing calligraphy for wedding contracts (kesuvos) and honorary scrolls in a Manhattan studio, then set up a print shop on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn that added invitations and brochures to its products.In 1975, a close friend died childless and, to offer him a legacy, Rabbi Zlotowitz published a translation of Esther accompanied by commentary, with Rabbi Scherman serving as a writer and editor.It sold 20,000 copies, Rabbi Scherman said in an interview, and Rabbi Zlotowitz, encouraged by the response from leading rabbis, wound down the invitation business and from then on devoted himself to publishing religious works.In addition to his son Gedaliah, he is survived by his wife, Rochel; their three other sons, Ira, Boruch and Chaim; their daughters, Estie Dicker, Faigie Perlowitz, Devorah Morgenstern and Tzivi Munk; and more than 50 grandchildren.Advertisement"}

Two of those who left started their own consulting firms; one took a job in California; and Ms. Mesa, the former director, now runs a sustainability program at the Earth Institute at Columbia University.Daniel A. Zarrilli, the city\u2019s chief resilience officer, who oversees the sustainability office, said it had experienced \u201ca natural level of turnover.\u201d\u201cWe have a fantastic team,\u201d Mr. Zarrilli said. \u201cI think we\u2019re well staffed for what we need to do.\u201d He said that the agency was looking for people to fill the vacant jobs and that it was also expanding, with plans to hire an additional deputy director who will focus on neighborhood-level projects, as well as two additional policy advisers.\u201cNew York City must step up to stop climate change,\u201d said the order, which directed the Office of Sustainability to come up with plans to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and instructed all other city agencies to work with it in that effort. It set a Sept. 30 deadline to create a citywide plan for how to achieve the Paris agreement\u2019s goals.\u201cWe want to surpass that now, because the bottom line is, if the United States of America is going to waver on addressing climate change, then cities or states have to step up,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on WNYC. \"We will now start the process of increasing our goals to lower emissions even further and faster, because bluntly, in the places and countries that do understand we have to act, we\u2019re going to have to shoulder more of the burden now.\u201dRobert Freudenberg, a vice president of energy and environmental programs for the Regional Plan Association, said Mr. Trump\u2019s move on the Paris accord may breathe new energy into the city\u2019s efforts to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\u201cMy hope is that now, with this executive order, that office gets completely filled,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need thought leadership and real policy making to make that happen if we're going to hit this 80 by 50 goal.\u201dSarah Currie-Halpern, a waste and recycling expert who left the sustainability office last July to start a consulting firm, lauded the mayor for setting an ambitious agenda, but said, \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the ability to get all the work done without filling the vacancies that have come up over the last year.\u201dShe added, \u201cThere\u2019s a very heavy mandate upon the Mayor\u2019s Office of Sustainability.\u201dCouncilman Costa Constantinides of Queens, the chairman of the City Council\u2019s Environmental Protection Committee, praised the mayor\u2019s record on climate change and the sustainability office.\u201cThey are highly productive and we\u2019ve had a good partnership on getting good environmental policy done,\u201d Mr. Constantinides, a Democrat, said. \u201cThe thing that raises the most red flags to me is what\u2019s going on in Washington.\u201dBut Councilman Rory I. Lancman, who also sits on the environment committee, expressed concern at the departure of so many highly experienced employees.\u201cIf you look at the mayor\u2019s environmental policy team, it\u2019s depleted and unable to really effectuate any kind of grand vision of sustainability in New York City, let alone our unilateral adherence to the Paris climate change agreement,\u201d Mr. Lancman said. \u201cThe nuts and bolts of government are lacking.\u201dMr. Lancman, a Democrat, also noted that the city\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection has been headed by an interim commissioner since the last commissioner retired a year ago.\u201cThere\u2019s a significant disconnect between the policy goals the mayor announces and their actual fleshing out and implementation,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Solar Trade Case, With Trump as Arbiter, Could Upend Market", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byMillions of Americans now get their electricity, at least in part, from the solar panels that have rapidly spread throughout the country since 2010, thanks to their sharply declining cost. For customers \u2014 including homeowners, businesses and utilities \u2014 as well as for the companies that promote and install them, cheap solar panels have been a good thing.But for American manufacturers, those cheap panels \u2014 specifically, a glut of low-cost supplies from overseas \u2014 have not been a good thing, driving more than a dozen of them to the brink of bankruptcy and beyond.Now, manufacturers are fighting back, in an unusual trade case that could put the final decision about government intervention, and any remedy, directly in President Trump\u2019s hands.The case, filed with the United States International Trade Commission, is shaping up to be one of the first major trade decisions of the Trump administration. The outcome could have a powerful impact on whether the American solar industry will be able to compete on cost with conventional fuels like natural gas and coal in producing electricity.And China, Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent foil on trade issues, has interests on both sides of the fight.The cheaper equipment coming into the American market is often from Chinese manufacturers that the trade commission previously determined were dumping goods below cost, according to the petition. But the company that initiated the new case, Suniva, is an equipment maker based in Georgia whose majority owner is a Chinese company.The petition seeks steep tariffs and minimum price guarantees on certain solar energy equipment made outside the United States. The commission is set to vote on the merits of the case by Sept. 22, and send any recommendations to the president by Nov. 13. But it is already reshaping the market.Prices for solar panels have increased as buyers rush to get ahead of potential tariffs. Solar-farm developers have become skittish about long-term commitments to supply power at prices that could become uneconomical if tariffs, which can be applied retroactively, raise their costs.\u201cIt clearly throws a wrench into what is already a challenged global market,\u201d said Shawn Kravetz, president of Esplanade Capital, a hedge fund based in Boston that is focused on solar energy companies. \u201cThere are going to be winners and losers. The list of losers is long.\u201dBack then, SolarWorld Americas, a subsidiary of a now-bankrupt German panel maker, filed a trade complaint along with six other domestic solar manufacturers that accused their Chinese counterparts of using unfair government subsidies to finance their operations and then selling their merchandise for less than the cost of manufacturing and shipping it.SolarWorld, which has joined Suniva\u2019s petition, won that battle, as well as a second case that included Taiwan, where Chinese manufacturers had turned for cells to avoid anticipated tariffs.After the imposition of tariffs beginning in 2012 that ranged from about 20 percent to about 55 percent for the largest cell and panel makers, manufacturers outside China and Taiwan \u2014 including those in the United States like SolarWorld and Suniva \u2014 saw their fortunes rise. In 2014, SolarWorld Americas, based in Oregon, announced a $10 million expansion of its plant and plans to hire hundreds more workers to meet surging demand for solar panels.Suniva had grown out of government-supported research at Georgia Tech to become one of the largest American makers of solar cells and finished modules. But the much larger Chinese manufacturers that came to dominate the global market kept up the pressure on price. Seeking a much-needed infusion of cash to finance an anticipated expansion, Suniva sold a majority stake in 2015 to a Chinese company, Shunfeng International Clean Energy, which wanted to get a foothold in what it believed was a growing American market.Then came a glut of cheap, new panels as Chinese manufacturers began operating or contracting with factories in countries like Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, the petition charges. Last year, the Chinese government suggested it might slash its domestic incentives for buyers of solar panels, sharply reducing demand for equipment and adding to the oversupply. Manufacturers cut their prices to compensate, which sent global prices plummeting. Even though China ended up shaving subsidies just slightly and only for large power-plant arrays, prices remained low.As panel prices dropped to about 40 cents per watt in late 2016 from 57 cents per watt in 2015, American solar installations reached a record high, making solar energy the biggest source of new electricity generation last year. But the domestic industry\u2019s share of the panel market, which had been declining since 2013, tumbled to 11 percent in 2016 from 17.1 percent the previous year, according to the market research firm IBISWorld.In those conditions, Suniva could not compete as a supplier. Starting in March it shuttered its two factories in Michigan and Georgia, laying off about 250 workers, and in April it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. About a week later, it secured a loan from one of its creditors to pursue the trade case.With control of Suniva in the hands of the bankruptcy court, Shunfeng declared in May that it no longer supported the company\u2019s trade case, saying it was \u201cnot in the best interests of the global solar industry.\u201d It said in March that it would take a charge of roughly $38 million on its Suniva investment, though it could still benefit if the company prevails in the case.Suniva argues that because of the global nature of the solar trade, the American manufacturing industry needs blanket safeguards from the trade commission that would apply to the crystalline silicon cells and modules manufactured anywhere outside the United States. It is the only way, the complaint argues, to keep manufacturers from circumventing tariffs aimed at specific countries by setting up shop elsewhere.\u201cWithout global relief, the domestic industry will be playing Whac-a-Mole,\u201d the petition says. \u201cThe way that the world\u2019s largest producers have reacted to antidumping and countervailing duty claims demonstrates that global relief is required.\u201dBut opponents say the case threatens many of the hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs could be eliminated in an industry slowdown. Those include people who install, finance and oversee the development of large-scale solar projects, as well as manufacturers of support structures for the panels and devices that regulate the flow of electricity from them.According to a report from GTM Research, a consultant firm that tracks the solar industry and provides data and analysis for the industry\u2019s main trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, which is aggressively fighting the petition, a finding in Suniva\u2019s favor could reduce expected installations over the next five years by 50 percent.Adding to anxiety in the industry is the potential role of Mr. Trump, who would have broad leeway to determine how to proceed should the commission find that the domestic industry had been harmed by the surge in imports.Though the president has pledged to increase manufacturing jobs, he has not offered the same full-throated support as his predecessor for solar energy. Proponents see solar energy as an important weapon in the fight against climate change, making its ability to compete economically with conventional sources \u2014 a concept known as grid parity \u2014 even more critical.\u201cGrid parity is of the utmost importance, so that we are competing on price and price alone,\u201d Abigail Ross Hopper, chief executive of the solar trade group, said. \u201cIf you change the underpinnings of that, it undermines what we\u2019re doing.\u201dIf things go Suniva\u2019s way, analysts say, other domestic manufacturers could also benefit, although the industry would most likely contract over the next few years.Two makers of crystalline silicon cells and panels, SunPower and Solaria, are expanding their production capacity at factories in California. Then there is First Solar, based in Tempe, Ariz., which is also expanding production at its factory in Perrysburg, Ohio. The company mainly manufactures in Malaysia, but it uses a different technology and would not be subject to the trade restrictions. And if Tesla is able to get its troubled and much-delayed panel factory in Buffalo up and running, it could benefit as well.Then, too, the major Chinese manufacturers are already exploring options for opening their own factories in the United States, said Ocean Yuan, chief executive of Grape Solar, a distributor of panels based in Eugene, Ore.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way for them to enter the U.S. except that they make panels in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I guess that\u2019s the positive side.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Fires Executive Over Handling of Rape Investigation in India", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber has fired a senior executive who obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India, the latest example of misconduct unearthed at the ride-hailing giant.Eric Alexander, Uber\u2019s president of business in Asia, was terminated on Tuesday after reporters began asking questions about his actions, according to three people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.The episode provides more ammunition to critics of Uber who say the company\u2019s top officials have set a tone that fosters dysfunction.Uber has spent the past three months confronting a series of explosive claims about misconduct in its offices around the world, including accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination. Next week, employees are expected to hear the results of an investigation into the company\u2019s culture led by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general who is now a partner at the law firm Covington and Burling.Mr. Alexander was not among those employees. As investigators pursued tips from rank-and-file Uber workers about problems at the company, top executives did not disclose that they knew Mr. Alexander had obtained the records of the Indian woman, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. Both Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, and Emil Michael, the company\u2019s senior vice president of business, had read and discussed the woman\u2019s medical records with Mr. Alexander at length, according to those people.Mr. Alexander, who was based in Hong Kong, is a longtime confidant of Mr. Michael\u2019s; the two worked together as far back as 15 years ago at the start-up Tellme Networks. Mr. Alexander was also one of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s most trusted lieutenants. The three men once attended a South Korean escort bar together, according to two of the people familiar with the medical-records matter. That trip prompted a complaint to Uber\u2019s human resources department.The actions that led to Mr. Alexander\u2019s termination began in late 2014, when it became public that a woman had accused an Uber driver of raping her after she dozed off on a ride to her home in the Delhi region.The attack came at a fraught time for Uber. The company was banned in Delhi after the story broke, putting at risk Uber\u2019s plan to dominate the market in India, a country of more than 1.3 billion people that the company hoped would fuel enormous growth. Uber had also just closed a $1.4 billion round of financing, and was in the middle of talking to other companies about more financing.Mr. Alexander was convinced that the rape charges were part of a plan hatched by Ola, the leading ride-hailing company in India and one of Uber\u2019s largest Asian competitors, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. He spent months in India as Uber established itself there, and conducted his own investigation. He shared his concerns with Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael, who were also fixated on the case, according to the two people.Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Alexander had long telephone conversations about what they believed to be subterfuge on the woman\u2019s part, trying to figure out how to rectify the situation, according to two people familiar with those talks. Mr. Alexander carried the woman\u2019s records, which he believed were at odds with her account, with him. The ban imposed on the company in Delhi added to their suspicions.Current and former Uber employees were surprised to learn that Mr. Alexander was not one of the 20 employees that Uber said on Tuesday it had fired. He was let go only after reporters asked Uber about his actions, despite several high-level executives having knowledge of the matter, according to two of the people familiar with the matter.For now, Uber employees are awaiting the results of Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation. The company is expected to address his findings at a meeting for all employees on Tuesday.Advertisement"}

Available, but Exacting", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringPaying off the house used to be a cause for celebration, but many retirees no longer see it that way.An increasing number of older Americans prefer to have a mortgage. They may have the means to buy with cash but choose instead to take advantage of prevailing low interest rates and tax breaks, while freeing up their savings for other uses.Some may wonder if they can still qualify for a home loan without having a full-time job. But more often than not, banks are willing to lend \u2014 as long as you have regular monthly income, like a pension and Social Security, or retirement assets.But these days, she said, \u201cWe see that people are carrying mortgage debt at older ages, and it\u2019s both the percentage of families carrying the debt and the amount of debt that has increased.\u201dThese figures are likely to continue rising as the baby boom population ages \u2014 an estimated 10,000 a day turn 65 \u2014 and remains active in the housing market.Beth Holland and Chuck Queener, who are both semiretired and in their early 70s, chose to finance the recent purchase of a 2,200-square-foot condominium in a 55-plus community in Newtown, Conn., with a 30-year mortgage fixed at 4.25 percent.Their investments, which include Individual Retirement Accounts, along with monthly income from Social Security and annuities \u2014 together with their good credit \u2014 helped the couple qualify for a mortgage. However, both Ms. Holland, a yoga instructor, and Mr. Queener found the whole process more arduous than earlier applications they made for mortgages.Lenders \u201clook at every penny you got coming in,\u201d Mr. Queener said. \u201cIt was a strenuous process. Every time we turned around, there was more paperwork to fill out.\u201dThose who have been out of the mortgage-application process for a while and are now looking to buy a vacation or retirement home might be surprised by all the extra hoops they have to jump through.The 2008 financial crisis brought about more stringent lending regulations, which have made qualifying for a mortgage more difficult for just about everyone, but especially so for the self-employed with fluctuating earnings and retirees on fixed incomes. Lenders must now adhere to guidelines that include lower debt-to-income ratios.Older borrowers \u201cshouldn\u2019t be making assumptions based on what happened in the past,\u201d said Brian Koss, the executive vice president of the Mortgage Network, a lender based in Danvers, Mass. \u201c\u2018Oh, I can get a mortgage anytime \u2014 I have all this money in the bank and great credit.\u2019\u201d\u201cAfter the financial crisis,\u201d he added, \u201cthe regulators rightfully built in ability-to-repay regulations using a spelled-out rule book of how to qualify to ensure monthly payments are made.\u201dThis is particularly beneficial for people who may be rich in savings but have a reduced monthly income after leaving the work force.To improve your chances of getting approved for any mortgage, Mr. Koss suggests meeting with a loan officer or financial adviser before retiring.\u201cIt\u2019s never too early to begin to ask questions and run scenarios to determine the impact,\u201d he said. Once you leave, \u201cyou want to make sure you are in the best possible position.\u201dTim Beyers, an analyst at American Financing, a mortgage banker based in Aurora, Colo., agreed, adding that older borrowers have to understand how they are seen by a lender.\u201cThe stuff that mattered when you\u2019re younger still matters when you\u2019re older,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at your credit report and credit score, and take a look at all your available income.\u201dCarole Ferraud, 64, credits good financial advice and years of prudent habits for helping her and her husband, Fay Sanford, 70, recently qualify for a mortgage on a second home, a three-bedroom condo in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.The couple, whose main residence is on Camano Island in Washington State, are both retired school administrators; each has a guaranteed pension, while Mr. Sanford also has a military pension. \u201cI knew we were going to qualify, based on our pensions,\u201d Ms. Ferraud said. But also, \u201cOur cars are paid for, and we have no outstanding credit-card debt.\u201d\u201cPoor credit, no credit or lack of verifiable income \u2014 all a big problem,\u201d he added.And speaking of verifiable income, if you\u2019re semiretired and self-employed, you should expect an additional layer of scrutiny in the mortgage application process. So you\u2019ll need to keep careful track of income and business expenses.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have proof of income or verifiable income, you\u2019re going to have a very difficult time qualifying,\u201d said Mr. McBride, adding that lenders typically want at least two consecutive years of tax returns. \u201cYou may have to make a significant down payment in order to get lenders comfortable.\u201dThis comfort level, Mr. Koss and others say, often starts with a 40 percent down payment. \u201cAt that level, you\u2019ve given the lender a real margin of safety,\u201d he said. In return, borrowers are likely to see more attractive loan terms.\u201cThe smaller banks are a lot more inclined to look at the individual and not just the numbers,\u201d Mr. Given said. \u201cThey also have a better understanding of the local market and the whole appraisal process.\u201dOther strategies to consider, mortgage experts say, are downsizing or moving to a place where homes are more affordable.Rita and John Hunt, both retired, in their early 70s and collecting Social Security and small pensions, chose to do both. They sold their three-bedroom ranch in Riverside, Calif., this year and bought a less expensive, though larger, Tudor-style house in Topeka, Kan., their home state, where they hope to spend the rest of their lives.They took out a 30-year fixed mortgage at 4.78 percent but made just a 20 percent down payment, even though they could have easily put more money down or paid for most of the new home in cash. The bulk of the proceeds from the California sale, Ms. Hunt said, were used to paint and install flooring in their new house, as well as to pay off debts and bolster savings.Advertisement"}

They are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity.Citing questions about funding, two investigating judges have said that they are prepared to issue a stay of proceedings against the three men, effectively putting an end to the tribunal once the two current cases are completed.The judges said a decision on the disposition of the cases could come as early as next Friday.The trial is a combined enterprise of the United Nations and the Cambodian courts. Most of its funding comes from international donor nations whose generosity has been strained as the trial has dragged on and other priorities have taken its place.Mr. Hun Sen has repeatedly warned of civil war if the tribunal moves on to more prosecutions. Many analysts say that if these cases are dropped as a result of government pressure, it will cast a shadow over the entire tribunal and throw the integrity of the process into question.Mr. Khieu Samphan was the last person to speak at the proceedings on Friday.As before, he pleaded ignorance about the forced labor and killings that terrorized the country while he was in power.And he repeated his familiar, nuanced mea culpa, saying, \u201cI want to bow to the memory of all the innocent victims, but also to those who perished believing in an ideal of a brighter future and who died during the five-year war, under the American bombardments and the conflict with the Vietnamese invaders.\u201dBoth he and Mr. Nuon Chea have pointed to American B-52 strikes that killed many civilians and energized the Communist movement as precursors of the Khmer Rouge.At an earlier court session, a defense lawyer for Mr. Khieu Samphan, Anta Guiss\u00e9, took a more aggressive tone, saying that the trial, and its international backers, intended from the start to convict and sentence the defendants.\u201cMr. Khieu Samphan is going to die in jail,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to die in jail, and he knows that. His defense knows that as well. You know it as well. The prosecution as well as the civil parties know it, too. Especially the donors who financed this court know it as well. Mission accomplished.\u201dMr. Nuon Chea refused to attend the session on Friday, preferring to watch, as he often has, on a closed-circuit monitor in a holding room beneath the trial chamber.Speaking on his behalf, his lawyer, Victor Koppe, called the proceedings \u201csome sort of circus\u201d and said: \u201cNuon Chea couldn\u2019t care less if you convict him again to a life sentence. He really doesn\u2019t care because, rightfully so, he doesn\u2019t take this institution seriously.\u201dWhere Mr. Khieu Samphan bobs and weaves around the charges against him, Mr. Nuon Chea comes across as a true believer, and he appears certain that he will be vindicated by history.His lawyer repeatedly urged the Cambodian public to read \u201cour 550-page closing brief and its more than 4,000 footnotes\u201d to find the true story of the Khmer Rouge.\u201cI\u2019m convinced that the Cambodian public will understand that our long brief will consist of real history and not of quote-unquote fake history,\u201d Mr. Koppe said.The prosecution portrayed Mr. Nuon Chea as dedicated and unrepentant. It played clips from interviews he gave to the journalist Thet Sambath in which Mr. Nuon Chea said he had \u201cno regrets\u201d for the killings.\u201cBelieve me, if these traitors were alive, the Khmers as a people would have been finished,\u201d Mr. Nuon Chea said in the recording. \u201cI dare to suggest our decision was the correct one. If I had shown mercy to these people, the nation would have been lost. But if the individual becomes a problem, then they must be solved.\u201dAt an earlier hearing, a prosecutor, Chea Leang, described the accusations against the two defendants: starvation, overwork, disease, other inhumane acts, persecution, genocide of the Cham indigenous people and of Vietnamese, the forced marriage and rape of Khmer women, and the imprisonment, forced labor and torture of millions of others in work sites and security centers.For all the passion of the words, there was an air of anticlimax about the final session, with the lawyers and judges going through well-worn paces and stating well-known positions.The statements of the lawyers were accompanied by a constant echo of translations that were transmitted in English, French and Khmer through headsets. Given the difficult legal language and the varying speeds with which the translators were able to keep up, not everyone in the chamber was hearing exactly the same testimony.Protected by a huge, bulletproof partition, the courtroom was packed with judges, lawyers, clerks and a small number of victims. Through the glass, a cavernous auditorium was filled with sunburned farmers, the latest group to be bused in for the day as part of an outreach program.And beyond the trees surrounding the isolated courthouse, heavy traffic surged noisily by, an emblem of a new century in Cambodia that has, in one way or another, left the Khmer Rouge behind.Advertisement"}

Waves of austerity measures to satisfy creditors have inflicted great suffering: More than a quarter of Greeks are unemployed, and vital services, like health care and transportation, are running as bare-bones operations. The economy is in recession, and there is virtually no way Greece can dig itself out of such a deep hole.On May 18, Greece\u2019s Parliament dutifully passed a fresh round of austerity measures, including tax increases and new cuts to pensions. Yet, Greece\u2019s creditors met in Brussels last week and shamefully failed to agree on terms that would permit the release of 7 billion euros in bailout funds needed by July to keep Greece from defaulting.Much of the blame goes to Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats party.

The company, based in San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, has already raised about $500 million over the past three years and was valued by investors last year at about $4 billion.In the past few years, Slack has also stirred acquisition interest from potential buyers, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, according to three people with knowledge of the acquisition offers. Most recently, Amazon expressed interest in acquiring Slack, these people said.Slack\u2019s messaging product, introduced in 2014, was initially a cult hit that grew mostly by word of mouth, a rare feat for a company that caters to businesses rather than consumers.Tools made by Slack are now used daily by five million people, up from four million in October.

{"Headline": "As Government Retrenches, Philanthropy Booms", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLast year, as Kalamazoo, Mich., struggled with a budget deficit and other economic woes, two local philanthropists stepped forward, pledging $70 million to improve the city\u2019s fortunes. Earlier in 2016, a group of foundations put up even more money to help another troubled Michigan city, Flint, recover from the contamination of its water supply. And a few years before that, foundations helped to rescue Detroit from bankruptcy.These episodes, coming after years of cuts in state aid to Michigan\u2019s cities, may offer a glimpse of America\u2019s future.In Washington, D.C., where it\u2019s already difficult to get things done, governing is likely to get exponentially harder in coming decades as the baby boomers retire and fiscal pressures mount sharply. More states and localities will also face budgetary crises as pension bills come due and as fiscal conservatives prioritize tax cuts over public investment.So where will the leadership and money come from to take on urgent challenges?In Michigan and beyond, we\u2019re already seeing an answer: Philanthropy will increasingly slide into the driver\u2019s seat of public life, with private funders tackling problems that government can\u2019t or won\u2019t.This is hopeful in many ways, and most of these donors have the best of intentions. But make no mistake: Their influence is growing in tandem with their largess, shifting power away from democratic institutions.Look in any area \u2014 the arts, education, science, health, urban development \u2014 and you\u2019ll find a growing array of wealthy donors giving record sums. Philanthropists have helped fund thousands of charter schools across the country, creating a parallel education system in many cities. The most ambitious urban parks in decades are being built with financing from billionaires. Some of the boldest research to attack diseases like cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s is funded by philanthropy. Private funders, led by the Gates Foundation, play a growing role in promoting global health and development.More big league givers keep emerging as the vast fortunes of a second Gilded Age are harnessed to philanthropy. The most recent: The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, worth more than $80 billion, last week posted on Twitter a \u201crequest for ideas\u201d for a philanthropy strategy he should pursue. Among a Forbes 400 with a combined net worth of at least $2.4 trillion are numerous billionaires who plan to give away much of their wealth. All told, over $20 trillion is likely to find its way to philanthropy in the next half century.It\u2019s true that philanthropy doesn\u2019t have anything close to the resources of government and can\u2019t replace vital functions of the public sector. But the giving power of private funders has grown more significant as federal spending has flatlined, especially funds that can be used flexibly. Nondefense discretionary spending totaled $518 billion in 2016, compared with charitable giving of $390 billion last year. This gap is likely to keep narrowing as budget cuts hit harder and the wealthy step up their giving. Donors are also using for-profit social investments on a much larger scale \u2014 like when Bill Gates recently organized a slew of billionaires to invest in clean energy research.It\u2019s not just their money that makes the givers so powerful in public life; it\u2019s also their nimbleness. Answering to neither voters nor shareholders, philanthropists and foundations can move boldly. This freedom sounds like a good thing, and often is. But it can produce actions disruptive to communities, as we saw in Newark, where donors led by Mark Zuckerberg backed a school reform effort that lacked local support. When things go wrong with big philanthropy, citizens have little recourse. The givers are accountable to no one.Most Americans have yet to consider what the power shift away from government means for United States democracy. When people think of philanthropy, they tend to imagine giving for museums or hospitals. Yet today\u2019s biggest donors aren\u2019t much interested in such old-style charity, aiming instead to make \u201csystemic\u201d changes in society.Today\u2019s mega-givers keep charging forward. Although the push for charter schools has created both enormous controversy and mixed results, top philanthropists in this field are doubling down. The Walton family is spending $1 billion to promote school choice over the next five years \u2014 almost as much as it spent in the previous two decades. A group of funders in Los Angeles are advancing a plan to move half of all K-12 students in that city into charter schools, stirring fierce debate.In New York City, a proposed island park in the Hudson River financed by the billionaire Barry Diller and his wife, Diane von Furstenberg, has faced strong legal challenges that underscore a growing uneasiness about the role of private money in public spaces. Other big urban park projects have raised similar concerns, and in Baltimore, alarm bells went off when philanthropists funded an aerial surveillance project by the city\u2019s police department.Surveys show that most Americans feel that their voice doesn\u2019t count in public life and want to reduce the influence of the wealthy. But today\u2019s big philanthropy is moving us in the opposite direction, at a time when inequality stands at record levels.It\u2019s time to look harder at how the wealthy wield clout through philanthropy \u2014 and to update oversight rules for a new era of megagiving.For starters, there should be more transparency in the reporting of charitable gifts, which increasingly flow through opaque entities like donor-advised funds that allow givers to remain anonymous, even when their donations seek to influence government policy. Such funds should have to reveal where their money is coming from. More timely reporting of gifts is important, too.There should also be stricter limits on tax-deductible giving, to discourage gifts by wealth holders that amplify their preferences in public debates. In an earlier era, when America had less inequality and stronger mass-member organizations, nonprofits advocating on policy issues typically spoke for lots of ordinary people \u2014 not a handful of private funders, as is now often the case. One way to rebalance civic life would be to restrict the size of allowable tax-deductible gifts to policy groups, while encouraging gifts by smaller donors. Another step might be to narrow which nonprofits qualify for tax-deductible gifts, with an eye toward reducing giving to influence public policy.Ultimately, efforts to level the playing field of civic life won\u2019t get very far as long as economic inequality remains so high, putting outsize resources in the hands of a sliver of supercitizens. Critics of today\u2019s income and wealth gaps tend to focus on who gets what. Yet as a deluge of new wealth pours into civil society, which Alexis de Tocqueville once saw as the realm of the Everyman, we should also be asking who gets heard.Advertisement"}

And it highlights the fragility of a proposed Middle Eastern alliance that Mr. Trump touted as the major achievement of his first foreign trip.These countries have long been at odds over Qatar\u2019s relationships with Iran, the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. Qatar fancies itself a bridge to all three; however objectionable their conduct, they are not going away and need to be engaged. The Saudis, Emiratis and Egyptians see Qatar as an enabler of extremists, providing them financial support, political backing or the region\u2019s most powerful megaphone, the Al Jazeera television network. They also resent tiny Qatar \u2014 empowered by staggering natural gas resources \u2014 asserting itself in regional affairs and cheerleading the Arab Spring.Until now, Washington has avoided taking sides, while quietly pressing Qatar to stop financing extremist groups. Qatar hosts one of the most important United States air bases in the Middle East: Al Udeid, home to about 11,000 service members in the anti-Islamic State coalition, most of them American. Coalition planes flying from that base lead the air campaign to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Speaking in Saudi Arabia last month, Mr. Trump called Qatar \u201ca crucial strategic partner.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s unconditional support for the Saudis during that same visit also seemed to embolden them to not just break relations with, but also impose an economic blockade on, Qatar. His tweets taking credit for the move left the Qataris reeling.After Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson rushed to the White House to explain the stakes, Mr. Trump appeared to reverse gears. He pressed the Saudi and Qatari leaders to address their differences directly and emphasized the importance of a united front in fighting the Islamic State. American diplomacy seemed to be firing on all cylinders. Until, that is, Mr. Trump used a press conference with Romania\u2019s president earlier this month to unleash another volley, accusing Qatar of financing terrorism \u201cat a very high level\u201d \u2014 and throwing a wrench into his own diplomatic works.If all of this seems confusing, consider this: the Trump administration says it wants to create a military coalition of Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, to fight Islamist terrorism. It was as if Mr. Trump was trying to break his own alliance, described as an \u201cArab NATO,\u201d before it had even formed.If he was, perhaps it was for the best. The administration is right to want the Arabs to take more responsibility for the fight against the Islamic State and, more broadly, for their own security. But a series of contradictions at the heart of the proposed alliance almost guarantee it will be a mirage.First, where Mr. Trump sees an alliance united against extremism, the Saudis see a Sunni coalition that will roll back Iran. This could potentially pull the United States into the sectarian struggle between Sunni and Shia. Beyond that, Saudi-exported, ultra-conservative Wahhabism, which breeds intolerance around the world, is no less dangerous to Western interests than Iran\u2019s support for radicalism, regional meddling and expansionism.An anti-Shia coalition masquerading as a Middle Eastern security alliance will only fuel those sectarian fires and produce more, not less, terrorism. Instead of taking sides in that conflict, Washington should press Riyadh and Tehran to stop feeding it.Second, whereas our core alliances in Europe and Asia are defensive, our Arab partners could use the anti-Islamic State coalition to go on the offensive, dragging the United States into new misadventures in the Middle East. Exhibit A is Riyadh\u2019s counterproductive campaign in Yemen against the Houthi rebels, whom they see as an Iranian proxy.I was the first senior American official to meet with Riyadh\u2019s dynamic Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after the Saudi intervention in Yemen in 2015. I reiterated the United States\u2019 commitment to defend Saudi Arabia against Houthi aggression and to help press the Houthis back to the bargaining table. Then I asked him Saudi Arabia\u2019s objective in Yemen itself. \u201cTo remove every last vestige of Iranian influence,\u201d he responded.Two years and countless civilian casualties later, the Saudis are still at it, with Washington torn between backing our ally and being complicit in a fiasco that\u2019s also leaving a power vacuum filled by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.Third, while Mr. Trump expects a Middle Eastern coalition to leverage the Arabs to do more, they will want to use it to deepen United States military engagement in the Middle East, while doing as little as possible themselves. Mr. Trump\u2019s frustration with spendthrift NATO allies in Europe will pale in comparison to what awaits him in the Middle East. The members of the existing mutual-assistance structure \u2014 the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 are risk averse, fearful of reprisals and divided in their priorities. They will spend more on weapons but are unlikely to use them effectively against the Islamic State.Finally, NATO itself is more than a coalition of common interests \u2014 it\u2019s an alliance of shared values. Mr. Trump seems more at home with Middle Eastern autocrats than he does with European democrats. Interests change and diverge; values do not. In their absence, an \u201cArab NATO\u201d will prove to be a hollow enterprise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Hidden H.I.V. Epidemic", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "FeatureWhy do America\u2019s black gay and bisexual men have a higher H.I.V. rate than any country in the world?Supported byNegotiating a maze of unpaved roads in Jackson in the company car, a 13-year-old Ford Expedition with cracked seats and chipped paint, he stopped to drop off H.I.V. medication at a couple\u2019s home. One of the men was H.I.V.-positive, the other negative; they lived in the neighborhood locals call the Bottom, where every fifth or sixth home is abandoned, with broken windows, doors hanging off hinges, downed limbs and dry leaves blanketing front yards. Sturdevant banged on the door of a small house, its yard overgrown with weeds; he knew not to leave the package on the doorstep, where it could be stolen. After a while a young man emerged, shirtless, shrugging off sleep. He had just gotten out of jail. Sturdevant handed him the package, shook his hand and told him to \u201cstay out of trouble.\u201dSturdevant drove on another 15 minutes to pick up Marq (a shortened version of his name to protect his privacy), a teenager who was still reeling from the H.I.V. diagnosis he received the previous spring. As they headed to and from a doctor\u2019s appointment and a meeting with a counselor, Sturdevant, slow-talking and patient, with eyes that disappear into his cheekbones when he smiles and a snowy beard, gently grilled him, reminding him to stay on his meds. The teenager slumped in the back seat, half listening, half checking his texts. He looked up briefly when Sturdevant told him, \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d But Marq barely said goodbye as he jumped out of the car in front of a convenience store on an avenue scattered with a pawnshop, a liquor store and several Baptist churches, and he all but admitted he was planning to spend the afternoon smoking weed and looking at Instagram. \u201cKnucklehead,\u201d Sturdevant whispered, as the teenager slammed the door. Pulling off his favorite Dallas Cowboys baseball cap and running a hand over his bald head, Sturdevant added softly, \u201cBreaks my heart.\u201dThese patients of Sturdevant\u2019s are the faces of one of America\u2019s most troubling public-health crises. Thanks to the success of lifesaving antiretroviral medication pioneered 20 years ago and years of research and education, most H.I.V.-positive people today can lead long, healthy lives. In cities like New York and San Francisco, once ground zero for the AIDS epidemic, the virus is no longer a death sentence, and rates of infection have plummeted. In fact, over the past several years, public-health officials have championed the idea that an AIDS-free generation could be within reach \u2014 even without a vaccine. But in certain pockets of the country, unknown to most Americans, H.I.V. is still ravaging communities at staggering rates.The South also has the highest numbers of people living with H.I.V. who don\u2019t know they have been infected, which means they are not engaged in lifesaving treatment and care \u2014 and are at risk of infecting others. An unconscionable number of them are dying: In 2014, according to a new analysis from Duke University, 2,952 people in the Deep South (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas) died with H.I.V. as an underlying cause, with the highest death rates in Mississippi and Louisiana. Among black men in this region, the H.I.V.-related death rate was seven times as high as that of the United States population at large.Sturdevant, born and raised in Metcalfe, a tiny Mississippi Delta town of about 1,000, understands all too well the fear, stigma and isolation that can come with being a black gay man in the South. \u201cGrowing up, I was taught that God was not fixing to forgive a person who was homosexual,\u201d Sturdevant said. \u201cThe Bible supposedly said you\u2019re going straight to hell, automatically, there\u2019s no forgiveness. There were several times I thought about suicide. There were several times I wanted to get sick and die. Finally, my thought was, I just want to get out of here.\u201d He moved to Dallas, and then to Memphis.When he learned he had H.I.V. in 2005, Sturdevant knew little about the virus and was too depressed and ashamed to tell anyone at first. When his partner died the following year, he let the disease consume him. \u201cI was weak, had a fever of 103, couldn\u2019t even keep down water,\u201d he recalled. Sturdevant has shared his story too many times to count, to let young men know that he has been there, too, and to help them understand that they can survive this plague. He also knows that many black gay and bisexual men have been rejected and discarded, and has wrapped his arms around as many as he can grab hold of, treating them like family. Sturdevant has two daughters from an early marriage and three grandchildren, but he says he feels just as strongly about his 16 or so unrelated \u201cchildren,\u201d most of them living with H.I.V. He feeds them, sometimes houses them, but mostly listens to them. \u201cYoung black men feel abandoned and need someone they can believe in and who believes in them,\u201d Sturdevant said as he drove past fields of fluffy cotton, his hands resting lightly on the steering wheel. \u201cI told God I want to be able to help guys like me, that didn\u2019t grow up with their father, and they started coming to me, wanting to talk. After a while, they would bring other people to me and say, \u2018Dad, can you help him, too?\u2019\u2009\u201dSturdevant moved his seat back, preparing for a long drive, and adjusted the radio to 107.5, the local R.&B. oldies station. Toni Braxton\u2019s wail \u2014 \u201cI wish you\u2019d hold me in your arms like that Spanish guitar\u201d \u2014 filled the car. He was headed to a small town 90 miles east of the city to visit Jordon, an H.I.V.-positive 24-year-old. When Sturdevant himself was at his lowest point, he said, \u201cI looked something like this boy we\u2019re going to see.\u201dHe took a call from De\u2019Bronski, one of the \u201csons\u201d he has cared for and bonded with. Sturdevant met the young man in 2009 and took him in; he later helped him deal with his H.I.V. diagnosis. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d Sturdevant told him. Then he turned down a dead-end street and pulled up in front of the one-story brick home where Jordon lived. \u201cI\u2019m real worried about him,\u201d Sturdevant said, lowering his voice as he walked up the driveway\u2019s cracked pavement toward the front door. Jordon had recently posted a photo of his skeletal frame on Facebook, asking friends to \u201cpray for me.\u201dIn February 2016, Jordon suddenly found himself too weak and tired to attend the community-college classes he had enrolled in; he could hardly lift his head from his mother\u2019s couch. He wasn\u2019t accustomed to being sick and had tested negative for H.I.V. just five months before, so thinking he had a bad cold, he waited weeks before his family forced him to go to the emergency room at a hospital in his small town, where he was tested again. \u201cThe doctor said to me, \u2018Your H.I.V. is so bad \u2014 how could you not know?\u2019\u2009\u201d Jordon recounted through tears. He ended up in intensive care for three weeks. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d He paused and then added quietly, \u201cIt was the worst day of my life.\u201dWith effort, Jordon sat up slightly, untangling himself from a jumble of sheets. Sturdevant asked how he was doing, and he cataloged a laundry list of what he called his \u201cold man\u201d ailments. \u201cI\u2019ve had everything \u2014 diarrhea, hemorrhoids, now this neuropathy,\u201d he said. \u201cMy body hates me.\u201d Once a month, his mother or grandmother drove him to medical appointments in Jackson, to receive care from providers experienced in treating people living with H.I.V. and to avoid the small-town gaze at the local facilities; there is no Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis for him to visit in his small town, as there would be if he lived in New York. \u201cEverybody knows everybody here,\u201d Jordon said. \u201cAt the hospital, they know my mom and my brother and my grandmother. I would rather be around people who don\u2019t know me.\u201d Too ashamed to admit that he had the virus, Jordon had told few friends about his diagnosis.\u201cAre you taking your medicine?\u201d Sturdevant asked. For many young men, the H.I.V. diagnosis and the illness are so overwhelming that maintaining a new and unfamiliar regimen of medication can be difficult. Jordon looked down. \u201cNot as often as I should.\u201d When he saw Sturdevant\u2019s glare, he continued, sounding like a little boy. \u201cI hate taking medicine; I hate it. I have to take six pills, now seven, eight, plus a shot \u2014\u201dSturdevant cut him off. \u201cWe all have to do this, Jordon. Don\u2019t you want to get better?\u201dJordon let his head fall back on the pillow. \u201cI know I can get better, Mr. Ced,\u201d he said, massaging his feet. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how everything got so bad.\u201dGiven the advances in research, information and treatment, it seems inconceivable that someone living with the virus today, like Jordon, could look as if he had stepped out of the early years of the epidemic. And yet a series of fateful decisions and omissions, dating back to the discovery of the disease, have led to a present that looks like the past \u2014 but only for some.Dr. Michael Gottlieb, the lead author of the report and a renowned physician specializing in H.I.V./AIDS, treated Rock Hudson before he died of AIDS complications in 1985 and still practices in Los Angeles. Gottlieb said he is often asked why he didn\u2019t include in that first report the documented case of the gay African-American man, who had both PCP and cytomegalovirus, a virus that attacks the organs of patients with compromised immune systems. He explains that he discovered the case after the report was finalized. \u201cUntil recently, I wouldn\u2019t have thought it mattered,\u201d said Gottlieb, who said that he and others on the front line were grappling with an unprecedented and frightening medical mystery and largely working in the dark. \u201cBut in retrospect, I think it might\u2019ve made a difference among gay black men.\u201dIncluding gay black men in the literature and understanding of the origins of the disease and its treatment could have meant earlier outreach, more of a voice and a standing in H.I.V./AIDS advocacy organizations, and access to the cultural and financial power of the L.G.B.T. community that would rise up to demand government action. But 35 years of neglect, compounded by poverty and inadequate local health care infrastructure, have left too many black gay and bisexual men falling through a series of safety nets.In 2011, HPTN 052, a study of 1,763 couples in 13 cities on four continents funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, found that people infected with H.I.V. are far less likely to infect their sexual partners when put on treatment immediately instead of waiting until their immune systems begin to fall apart. This \u201ctest and treat\u201d strategy also significantly reduces the risk of illness and death. The data was so persuasive that the federal government began pushing new H.I.V./AIDS treatment guidelines to health care providers the following year. And in 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved the preventive use of Truvada, in the form of a daily pill to be taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (commonly called PrEP). It has been found to be up to 99 percent effective in preventing people who have not been infected with H.I.V. from contracting the virus, based on the results of two large clinical trials; an estimated 80,000 patients have filled prescriptions over the past four years.But these measures have not extended to most black gay and bisexual men. A C.D.C. report in February noted that only 48 percent of black gay and bisexual men effectively suppress the virus with consistent medication, and the numbers are even lower for these men in their late teens and 20s. In 2014, nearly one in five black gay men who had received a diagnosis of H.I.V. had progressed to AIDS by the time they learned of their infection \u2014 which meant that they were generally very ill by the time they began treatment. Only a small percentage of black people use PrEP to prevent contracting the virus, accounting for only 10 percent of prescriptions; the vast majority of users are white. Many black gay and bisexual men either can\u2019t afford PrEP or don\u2019t know about it \u2014 they may not see a doctor regularly at all, and many medical providers haven\u2019t even heard of PrEP.Turning things around would mean expanding testing and providing affordable treatment for those who are positive \u2014 to stop sickness and dying and also to block transmission of the virus. It would also require getting information and medication, including PrEP, to those most at risk. Even more challenging would be reducing the stigma, discrimination and shame that drive gay and bisexual men to hide their sexuality and avoid the health care system \u2014 and making sure providers have adequate resources and understand how to care for H.I.V. patients.\u201cIt\u2019s deeply troubling when 50 percent of African-American gay men are expected to get H.I.V. during their lifetime, but it\u2019s also been a clarion call for all of us to improve on what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, the director of the C.D.C.\u2019s National Center for H.I.V./AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, S.T.D. and TB Prevention. \u201cWhat we have been trying to do is ensure that we\u2019re having the greatest effect with the resources we\u2019re provided.\u201dJune Gipson, president and chief executive of My Brother\u2019s Keeper, the Jackson nonprofit Cedric Sturdevant works for, believes that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act wouldn\u2019t have an immediate catastrophic effect in her state \u2014 but only because things are already so dire. Like most of the South, Mississippi refused Medicaid expansion, and nearly half of its citizens who are living with H.I.V. rely on the Ryan White H.I.V./AIDS Program to stay alive. Named for an Indiana teenager who contracted H.I.V. through a blood transfusion in the \u201980s, this federal program provides funding for H.I.V. treatment and care for those who have no other way to finance their medication. If the A.C.A. is repealed, Gipson said, \u201cit just means that the entire country becomes Mississippi.\u201dBlack America, however, never got a Pepfar. Though the raw numbers were much lower than in Africa, parts of our country looked like the continent the program was created to save. Yet while buckets of money went overseas, domestic funding for H.I.V./AIDS remained flat, and efforts to fight the disease here were reduced to a poorly coordinated patchwork affair. \u201cWhen we saw that the epidemic was out of proportion in the black community, we started calling for a domestic Pepfar that would bring new resources to the effort, create clear and ambitious objectives and rebuild health care infrastructure around the country,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut we just couldn\u2019t get the administration to focus on a domestic plan.\u201dGreg Millett, a senior scientist for the C.D.C. for 14 years and a senior policy adviser for the Obama administration\u2019s White House Office of National AIDS Policy, put it more candidly. \u201cDuring the Bush years, the administration dropped all pretense that they cared about AIDS in this country,\u201d said Millett, who is now the vice president and director of public policy at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research. \u201cThe White House said H.I.V. is only a problem in sub-Saharan Africa, and that message filtered down to the public. Though the Bush administration did wonderful work in combating H.I.V. globally, the havoc that it wreaked on the domestic epidemic has been long-lasting.\u201dBeginning in the late \u201990s, the United States government funneled billions of federal dollars into abstinence-until-marriage programs here and abroad. In place of effective sex education, these programs often discouraged condom use while teaching abstinence as the only way to prevent the spread of AIDS \u2014 even as well-regarded research established that this kind of sex education does not lower the risk of contracting H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases.During this time, many scientists, researchers and government administrators were afraid to speak openly about condoms, needle exchange and L.G.B.T. issues for fear of reprisal and loss of funding. Community organizations became targets of anti-gay crusades, subjected to intense scrutiny, including exhaustive audits, by federal agencies. \u201cIt is no coincidence that new rates of H.I.V. infection among gay men, especially gay black men, began to spike sharply from 2000 on, because of an anti-science campaign that allowed for little or nothing to be done for a maligned community simply due to ideology and bigotry,\u201d Millett said. \u201cThe hostile environment made funding effective H.I.V.-prevention programs, messages or research impossible for U.S. communities most impacted by H.I.V.\u201dAs the center of the epidemic has moved from New York and San Francisco to the smaller cities in the South, and from gay white men of means to poorer people of color, L.G.B.T. advocacy and fund-raising has shifted to marriage equality. In 2013, H.I.V. activists persuaded 35 L.G.B.T. leaders to sign a statement and create a video imploring the greater gay community to recommit to the AIDS struggle. The message: \u201cWe need you to come back.\u201d But of $168 million in H.I.V./AIDS philanthropic dollars spent in the United States in 2015, $31 million was disbursed to the South, just 19 percent of total H.I.V. philanthropy in the United States; only $26 million directly targeted African-Americans, and just $16 million went directly to gay and bisexual men, according to the organization Funders Concerned About AIDS.In a too brightly lit wood-paneled back room, Sturdevant and the younger men set up a table, displaying brochures, condoms, lube and a few lollipops. Stevenson and Watson, both open, friendly and handsome, attracted a few guys to the table, but mainly ones who had already heard the protect-yourself-against-H.I.V. spiel. Stevenson pointed out that the crowd was sparse \u2014 maybe 50 men and a few transgender women \u2014 because so many Jackson residents were attending the annual state fair. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s always hard to make contact in the club,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer one on one. That way it\u2019s not, \u2018I\u2019m trying to educate you\u2019; we\u2019re just talking and having fun. I tell them what I do, and they feel comfortable asking questions.\u201dStevenson took out his phone and opened Jack\u2019d, a hookup app popular with men of color. He pulled up his \u201cprofessional\u201d profile \u2014 on which he\u2019s smiling, clean-cut and buttoned-up amid a sea of bare chests and crotch shots. At the bottom he had put a link to a website with information about PrEP; next to it he\u2019d written: \u201cInbox me if you want to know more.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a bunch of messages asking about side effects, how much it costs and does it work,\u201d Stevenson said. He and Watson said they take the medication \u201cjust in case.\u201dAfter an hour they folded up the table and stuffed the condoms and brochures back into a gym bag, dropped it next to Sturdevant, who was sipping a syrupy cocktail from a can, and headed out to the dance floor. A remix of Rihanna\u2019s \u201cWhere Have You Been\u201d came on, so loud the walls shook. Like everyone else, Stevenson and Watson, who are dance coaches and choreographers, had perfected their moves from watching YouTube videos of the Prancing J-Settes. Stevenson bent and thrust, at once explosive, angular and precise. Watson\u2019s face was still as a stone; as he snapped his neck to the side, his waist-length dreadlocks whipped around his head. After a few songs, the music ended as the club prepared for a 1 a.m. drag show. Stevenson, sweaty and breathless, melted into a conversation with other dancers.Everybody knows everybody else in Jackson\u2019s small, tight-knit black gay community, and most men will find their sexual partners in this network. Most scientists now believe that risk of contracting H.I.V. boils down to a numbers game rather than a blame game: If the virus is not present in your sexual network, you can have unprotected sex and not get infected. But if you are in a community, like Jackson, where a high percentage of gay and bisexual men are infected with H.I.V. \u2014 and many don\u2019t know it and go untreated \u2014 any unprotected sexual encounter becomes a potential time bomb. This explanation of \u201cviral load\u201d helps dispel the stubbornly held notion that gay and bisexual black men have more sex than other men, a false perception embedded in the American sexual imagination and fueled by stereotypes of black men as hypersexual Mandingos dating back to slavery.An elevated viral load in a smaller sexual network (because most people still tend to have sex with people of the same race), amplified by the structural issues that Moore pointed to, also explains why H.I.V. rates have always been disproportionately high in the black community over all. But in the first decades of the epidemic, these ideas and explanations had not been widely accepted to explain the growing body of data pointing to fast-rising numbers of H.I.V. cases among black heterosexuals \u2014 in rates unmatched by those of white Americans. In fact, the African-American community was largely in denial about the fact that H.I.V./AIDS was a black issue. Worse, most believed the disease was a conspiracy on the part of the federal government to kill off the race, God\u2019s punishment for homosexuality or simply not a subject for polite conversation, because the disease was thought to be connected to promiscuity and crack and heroin use.The community\u2019s awakening came in 1991, when Magic Johnson tearfully announced, \u201cBecause of the H.I.V. virus I have obtained, I will have to retire from the Lakers today,\u201d and warned, \u201cIt can happen to anyone.\u201d By 1994, AIDS had become the No. 1 killer of all African-Americans ages 25 to 44. The virus was 16 times as common in black women as in their white counterparts \u2014 and the gap would widen over the next few years. I was an editor at Essence in 1994 when the magazine\u2019s editor in chief, Susan L. Taylor, insisted that we shine a light on the disturbing increase of H.I.V. among African-American women by putting Rae Lewis Thornton, a Chicago woman who described herself as \u201cyoung, educated, drug-free and dying of AIDS,\u201d on the cover.I had been writing about AIDS in the black community since the mid-\u201980s but had never seen anything like the coordinated efforts that started in the late \u201990s, when civil rights groups, politicians, clergy, fraternities and sororities and celebrities stepped up to encourage testing and distribute prevention information. All the major black publications collaborated in a highly visible campaign to spotlight the disease as a major health crisis. Black churches created AIDS ministries and offered H.I.V. testing \u2014 and the number of congregations participating in the Black Church Week of Prayer for the Healing of AIDS ballooned to more than 10,000.Most of the lock-step mobilization efforts focused on preventing the disease in black women, who, for the most part, were contracting the virus through sex with male partners. Though the C.D.C. and other agencies offered plenty of alarming statistics confirming the high and growing numbers of H.I.V. cases and deaths among black women, there was a lack of empirical evidence to clearly explain why the rates were so high. Experts in academia and government researchers tried to unravel a knotted tangle of factors: Women were contracting the virus from bisexual men; higher rates of sexually transmitted infections among black women facilitated the spread of H.I.V.; socioeconomic issues drove up the rates of all disease. The lack of research to create a coherent explanation was further confounded by a reluctance on the part of some scientists and activists to perpetuate the dangerous myth of black women as sexually promiscuous \u2014 another holdover from slavery.Given the confusion, it was simplest to latch onto the most provocative idea: that black gay men, who we knew were also contracting H.I.V. in high numbers, provided a \u201cbridge to infection\u201d to black heterosexual women, a phrase I first heard from researchers at a medical conference. As the theory went, closeted black gay men were using women as unsuspecting \u201ccover girls\u201d to hide their sexuality and then infecting them with H.I.V. In my reporting for both The Times and Essence, I found no shortage of anecdotal accounts of H.I.V.-positive women who were infected by male partners who had been having sex with other men in secret. As a black lesbian myself, I understood the stigma, shame and fear that could drive black gay men to create seemingly straight lives while sleeping with men \u2014 and end up unwittingly infecting their female partners with H.I.V. This idea made a certain amount of sense in the frustrating absence of scientific data.In retrospect, the high rate of H.I.V. infection among African-American women was a result of a complicated combination of all these factors, as well as the reality that after decades of denial and neglect, the viral load piled up in black communities, making any unprotected sexual encounter with anyone a potential \u201cbridge to infection.\u201d But two decades ago, in the midst of a very scary, fast-growing epidemic, the down-low brother became the AIDS boogeyman. I first heard about the \u201cD.L.\u201d from J.L. King, an author and self-proclaimed sex educator whom I interviewed in 2001. He had just warned a rapt audience of health care providers and H.I.V. educators at an AIDS conference in Washington: \u201cI sleep with men, but I am not bisexual, and I am certainly not gay. I am not going to your clinics, I am not going to read your brochures, I am not going to get tested. I assure you that none of the brothers on the down low like me are paying the least bit of attention to anything you have to say.\u201dKeith Boykin, a former Clinton White House aide, became so incensed by the down-low hysteria that he wrote a 2005 best-selling book, \u201cBeyond the Down Low: Sex, Lies and Denial in Black America.\u201d \u201cBecause the whole down-low story was doing a disservice to the black gay community and creating a racially troubling narrative that black men who have sex with men were villains, I felt I had to step in and correct the record,\u201d said Boykin, a CNN commentator who teaches at Columbia University\u2019s Institute for Research in African-American Studies. \u201cI think the near-decade-long obsession with the down low diverted our attention into what was really a side issue.\u201dIn the end, the organized H.I.V. outreach and education that proved successful to black women never translated to black gay men \u2014 and the excessive focus on the down low sucked away critical time, energy and resources. Between 2005 and 2014, new H.I.V. diagnoses among African-American women plummeted 42 percent, though the number of new infections remains unconscionably high \u2014 16 times as high as that of white women. During the same time period, the number of new H.I.V. cases among young African-American gay and bisexual men surged by 87 percent.As the men settled into their seats, Sturdevant asked them to go around and \u201ccheck in.\u201d Jermerious Buckley, watchful behind black rectangular glasses, with no sign of the makeup and colorful pumps he wore on weekends at Metro, told the group, \u201cI\u2019m doing a whole lot better.\u201d Last year, he said, \u201cDaddy,\u201d as he called Sturdevant, had pulled him back from the dead, after he had shrunk to 85 pounds, his arms covered with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma lesions, his kidneys failing. He felt like a \u201czombie,\u201d he said, too weak and hopeless to bother with his meds. Now Buckley thought he was finally strong enough to get back onto the pageant circuit where he competed. From his phone, he pulled up a picture of himself as \u201cAkeelah,\u201d unrecognizable in a shimmery white body-hugging gown and towering wig. \u201cNovember in New Orleans \u2014 y\u2019all wish me luck,\u201d he said.The group turned toward Benjamin Jennings, who wore a serious expression, with a shock of long hair in dreadlocks flipped to the side. When he said it was his first time there, everyone clapped. \u201cI was diagnosed July 8 of this year, and my goal is to learn everything that I can about this thing,\u201d said Jennings, 21, talking in a tumble of words as he pulled at his cropped T-shirt. \u201cThe first person I told was my mom. Thank God \u2014 I am so lucky to have her in my life.\u201d He paused, looking into the faces of the men around the table and speaking more slowly. \u201cI used to keep my feelings bottled up, but then I started opening my mouth on it,\u201d he said. \u201cI did everything to prevent this disease, but because of one slip-up I have it. Now I want to help anyone I can in any type of way. My goal is to not to let anyone judge me or let this disease own me.\u201dMany say rejection feels most acute and painful from the institution that should offer sanctuary and support: the black church. Individual congregations, religious organizations and clerics have made strides in openness and acceptance, but in general the black church remains largely absent from and often hostile toward the L.G.B.T. community. An African-American pastor in Jackson, the Rev. Edward James of Bertha Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, became a cringe-worthy symbol of homophobia in December 2014 for his protest against same-sex marriage equality. News outlets and social-media accounts shared a photo of him in his clerical robe, holding a sign that read: \u201cMarriage is one man and one woman. Anything else is a perversion,\u201d next to a horse clad in a white wedding dress. \u201cThe church is someplace to go for release and spiritual comfort, but the church is actually fearful for me,\u201d said Buckley, who, growing up, attended Baptist services with his grandmother in the delta. \u201cNow I stay at home on Sunday. It\u2019s too hard.\u201dUntil recently, Justin Huff, a former Jackson State student, shared a room on the second floor of Grace House\u2019s main facility. He was infected with H.I.V. a year and a half ago, when a man he met on Jack\u2019d sexually assaulted him. He received his diagnosis just after his 21st-birthday celebration. \u201cI was throwing up and couldn\u2019t eat anything for a few days; I thought it was from the drinking,\u201d Huff said. \u201cWhen I went to the doctor, he was like, if I hadn\u2019t made it in the next two days, I would\u2019ve been dead.\u201dFrightened and overwhelmed, he eventually landed on the doorstep of Grace House. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I was living in a shelter,\u201d said Huff, who is now couch-surfing, applying for jobs at fast-food outlets and retail shops and attending Sturdevant\u2019s support group, determined to stay healthy. \u201cI felt like I had no one. Off and on, I got tired of living, because all I was doing was basically dying trying to stay alive.\u201dBehind Grace House is a small, quiet makeshift graveyard that holds the cremated remains of 35 or so residents whose families did not pick up their bodies after they died. Ceramic angels, pieces of glasswork and other mementos left by friends in memory of the deceased dot the patch of earth at the base of a pecan tree. Stacey Howard, 47, the director of programs, remembers one of the last people buried there, a young man who was H.I.V.-positive and addicted to crack, who had lived off and on at Grace House before he was found dead on the street in the spring of 2016.\u201cThey had him at the local funeral home and were getting ready to turn his body over to the state, because no one would claim his remains,\u201d Howard explained as she leaned against the tree. \u201cWe got in touch with his family, who didn\u2019t want anything to do with him but at least signed the paperwork. I think it\u2019s part of our responsibility that when someone in our community passes away, we give them the dignity of a place to rest.\u201dDespite the persistent anti-L.G.B.T. stigma and entrenched social and economic issues that cling to the South, Sturdevant feels a complicated, bone-deep tie to the people and the place. When he encourages his \u201csons\u201d and \u201cdaughters\u201d to take care of themselves and others, he is echoing the love and acceptance he received from his own large family. After years of hiding, when he came out to his mother in his 20s, she told him, \u201cI love you regardless.\u201d When his family eventually found out that he was sick, his mother and sister drove up to where he was living in Memphis, along with six carloads of aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins. They tried to serve him plates laden with down-home food that he was too ill to eat and did their best to love him back to health. In the hospital, he finally admitted to his mother he had AIDS. \u201cShe told me, \u2018Boy, you gonna be all right; God got you,\u2019\u2009\u201d he recalls, tearing up. In the end, they took him home. He moved back to his mother\u2019s house in Metcalfe, with somebody from the sprawling network of nearly 100 family members always close by, until he recovered. \u201cThey saved my life, and I\u2019ll never forget that,\u201d he said.But even Sturdevant knows he can\u2019t save everyone. A shadow passes over his face and his voice grows low when he talks about the one young man he couldn\u2019t save. He remains haunted by him. A few years ago, a co-worker, Dot, suggested Sturdevant talk to a quiet fair-skinned man who was struggling with his H.I.V. diagnosis. \u201cI told him my story and let him know, \u2018You can do this, too,\u2019\u2009\u201d Sturdevant recalled. \u201cHe was in denial and very secretive, but still, he got into treatment and was doing good.\u201dBut when Sturdevant saw him again in January 2016, he had stopped taking his meds and had taken a bad turn. \u201cHe was nothing but skin and bones,\u201d Sturdevant said, looking down at his hands. \u201cHis eyes were bloodshot red. It almost looked like they were bleeding. We took him to the clinic, but the doctor said, \u2018Get him to the hospital immediately.\u2019\u2009\u201dFor the next two months, Sturdevant and Dot kept a close eye on the young man, scolding, nagging and pleading with him to stay in treatment and to tell his family the truth so he would have someone to support him. On a Friday in March 2016, Sturdevant arranged to visit him and take medication to his house. But when he arrived, there was no answer. \u201cI banged on the door, and then constantly called him all weekend,\u201d Sturdevant said. \u201cOn Monday, they told me he had passed away.\u201dSturdevant was devastated. Sometimes when he closes his eyes, he said, he still sees the smiling, fit and slender 27-year-old. \u201cI felt like I had failed,\u201d he said, choking up. \u201cI kept thinking, He was going to get better, so how could this happen?\u201d He took a breath, looking uncharacteristically tired, his eyes focused on a point off in the distance. \u201cListen, I know I can\u2019t be there night and day for everyone. But at this point now, I feel like I can\u2019t lose another young man to this disease.\u201dLinda Villarosa is the director of the journalism program at the City College of New York in Harlem and an assistant professor of media and communication arts.

{"Headline": "Creating a Garden Oasis in the City", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe FixSamira Kawash and Roger Cooper bought their Park Slope brownstone five years ago with the idea of giving big dinner parties and enjoying lazy afternoons in the extra-large backyard. But after they moved in with their daughter, Illia, then 9, they realized that the poor layout, overgrown plants and swampy conditions limited what they could do in the space.\u201cThe rear area was damp and shady, so totally infested with mosquitoes,\u201d said Ms. Kawash, 53, a writer. (Her husband, 48, is a lawyer.) \u201cThe fences were collapsing under ancient overgrown ivy,\u201d she added, and a beautiful but messy juneberry tree dropped fruit that found its way inside on the bottom of shoes, staining everything it came into contact with.\u201cInitially, we intended to repair and renovate: replace the rotting fences, restore the low stone walls around raised beds, and so on,\u201d Ms. Kawash said. \u201cBut as we realized the extent of the underlying problems \u2014 which also included drainage issues and a faulty installation of the brick pavers \u2014 we understood that having a garden that was functional and beautiful was going to mean a much bigger project.\u201d So they put the project off, sticking mainly to a front section of the yard to avoid mosquitoes and soggy ground.As a result some would-be urban gardeners end up neglecting the terrace or balcony that was once high on their list of apartment must-haves. Balconies become bike storage. Gardens grow out of control. Terrace landscaping turns to tumbleweeds in the sweltering city sun, alongside rusted grills and sun-bleached toys.\u201cOutdoor space in New York City is on many buyers\u2019 wish lists, but there just isn\u2019t enough to go around, and a lot of what is available isn\u2019t that usable when you get right down to it,\u201d said Xanthe Tabor, a saleswoman for Halstead Property. \u201cA private roof terrace may seem appealing, but becomes less so after you\u2019ve carried a tray of wineglasses up and down a flight of stairs a few times.\u201dThose with the determination \u2014 and the wherewithal \u2014 to turn a balcony, terrace or backyard into a functional outdoor area, however, say the investment is well worth it for a breath of air in a crowded city. Here is a look at how five homeowners invested in their very different outdoor spaces, from a tiny Upper East Side balcony to a sprawling backyard in Brooklyn.\u201cTodd brought us the idea of arranging the space into connected rooms, and creating the idea of a journey to move from space to space,\u201d Ms. Kawash said. \u201cThe rear is totally inviting now \u2014 it\u2019s shady in the hottest part of the day, with the burble of the fountain to drown out all the city noise, and the trees and plantings block out all the other houses.\u201dClosest to the house is the dining area and grill, so it\u2019s easy to run in and out during meals. In the center, there are sofas and chairs for lounging, surrounded by native flowers that draw bees and butterflies \u2014 \u201can unexpected bonus,\u201d Ms. Kawash said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can attract even more butterflies this year. There is something incredibly peaceful and life-affirming about surrendering to the rhythms and activities of the insects.\u201dOf course, none of this was cheap. The pavers alone cost $12,000 installed, said Ms. Kawash, who declined to provide the total cost. Instead, she offered, \u201cI would say, more than we expected, but totally worth it.\u201dTo create a \u201cflower-filled chill space,\u201d Ms. Rogue said, she created a \u201cboardwalk-style\u201d deck surrounded by blue Mexican pebble stone and custom planter boxes at varied heights, for their $30,000 budget. \u201cA beachy, Montauk feel led the design,\u201d added Ms. Rogue, who created an intimate coffee space outside the master bedroom, a designated spot for a lounger and a bench outside the kitchen surrounded by flora, to \u201cinsulate the space\u201d with color and texture. \u201cWe really love the dimension it adds to the rest of the apartment,\u201d Ms. Shelley said.But Ms. Ahmad-Llewellyn knew it had potential. Another plus: \u201cHaving small, elderly dogs who were used to warm weather and outdoor space\u201d \u2014 Mo and Lala, Ms. Ahmad-Llewellyn\u2019s 17-year-old miniature Dobermans \u2014 \u201cthe ability to have a safe place for them to go outside off leash when the weather is bad was a major draw.\u201d\u201cThe green roof was a major element of what we wanted for many reasons: to give the feeling of a yard, while still on a roof; to add interest in what otherwise could have been a bare, hallway-feeling space; for the green aspects,\u201d said Mrs. Gensler, 35, who works in home d\u00e9cor and e-commerce. \u201cWe also were keen on hiding elements of the roof next to us and even blocking some sound from an air vent on top of that building.\u201dThe couple have since moved, because of a job relocation.

{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Not Get Carried Away", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI was the op-ed editor at The Wall Street Journal at the peak of the Whitewater scandal. We ran a series of investigative pieces \u201craising serious questions\u201d (as we say in the scandal business) about the nefarious things the Clintons were thought to have done back in Arkansas.Now I confess I couldn\u2019t follow all the actual allegations made in those essays. They were six jungles deep in the weeds. But I do remember the intense atmosphere that the scandal created. A series of bombshell revelations came out in the media, which seemed monumental at the time. A special prosecutor was appointed and indictments were expected. Speculation became the national sport.In retrospect Whitewater seems overblown. And yet it has to be confessed that, at least so far, the Whitewater scandal was far more substantive than the Russia-collusion scandal now gripping Washington.There may be a giant revelation still to come. But as the Trump-Russia story has evolved, it is striking how little evidence there is that any underlying crime occurred \u2014 that there was any actual collusion between the Donald Trump campaign and the Russians. Everything seems to be leaking out of this administration, but so far the leaks about actual collusion are meager.There were some meetings between Trump officials and some Russians, but so far no more than you\u2019d expect from a campaign that was publicly and proudly pro-Putin. And so far nothing we know of these meetings proves or even indicates collusion.I\u2019m not saying there shouldn\u2019t be an investigation into potential Russia-Trump links. Russia\u2019s attack on American democracy was truly heinous, and if the Trump people were involved, that would be treason. I\u2019m saying first, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves and assume that this link exists.Second, there is something disturbingly meta about this whole affair. This is, as Yuval Levin put it, an investigation about itself. Trump skeptics within the administration laid a legal minefield all around the president, and then Trump \u2014 being Trump \u2014 stomped all over it, blowing himself up six ways from Sunday.Now of course Trump shouldn\u2019t have tweeted about Oval Office tape recordings. Of course he shouldn\u2019t have fired James Comey.But even if you took a paragon of modern presidents \u2014 a contemporary Abraham Lincoln \u2014 and you directed a democratically unsupervised, infinitely financed team of prosecutors at him and gave them power to subpoena his staff and look under any related or unrelated rock in an attempt to bring him down, there\u2019s a pretty good chance you could spur even this modern paragon to want to fight back. You could spur even him to do something that had the whiff of obstruction.There\u2019s just something worrisome every time we find ourselves replacing politics of democracy with the politics of scandal. In democracy, the issues count, and you try to win by persuasion. You recognize that your opponents are legitimate, that they will always be there and that some form of compromise is inevitable.In the politics of scandal, at least since Watergate, you don\u2019t have to engage in persuasion or even talk about issues. Political victories are won when you destroy your political opponents by catching them in some wrongdoing. You get seduced by the delightful possibility that your opponent will be eliminated. Politics is simply about moral superiority and personal destruction.The politics of scandal is delightful for cable news. It\u2019s hard to build ratings arguing about health insurance legislation. But it\u2019s easy to build ratings if you are a glorified Court TV, if each whiff of scandal smoke generates hours of \u201cBreaking News\u201d intensity and a deluge of speculation from good-looking former prosecutors.The politics is great for those forces responsible for the lawyerization of American life. It takes power out of the hands of voters and elected officials and puts power in the hands of prosecutors and defense attorneys.The politics of scandal drives a wedge through society. Political elites get swept up in the scandals. Most voters don\u2019t really care.Donald Trump rose peddling the politics of scandal \u2014 oblivious to policy, spreading insane allegations about birth certificates and other things \u2014 so maybe it\u2019s just that he gets swallowed by it. But frankly, on my list of reasons Trump is unfit for the presidency, the Russia-collusion story ranks number 971, well below, for example, the perfectly legal ways he kowtows to thugs and undermines the norms of democratic behavior.The people who hype the politics of scandal don\u2019t make American government purer. They deserve some of the blame for an administration and government too distracted to do its job, for a political culture that is both shallower and nastier, and for fostering a process that looks like an elite game of entrapment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Preferred Candidate Wins Again, This Time in Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump views Prince Mohammed as a crucial ally in his effort to cement a Sunni Muslim alliance in the Persian Gulf. The prince, who also serves as the Saudi defense minister, favors a confrontational line toward Iran, which dovetails with the Trump administration\u2019s hostile stance toward Tehran. And he is spearheading Saudi Arabia\u2019s embargo of neighboring Qatar, which Mr. Trump has praised because he, like the Saudis, accuses the Qataris of financing extremist groups.The young prince is also a favorite of the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Mr. Kushner began cultivating Prince Mohammed soon after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. When the prince visited Washington in March, he dined with Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, at their home. When the couple joined Mr. Trump on his visit to Saudi Arabia last month, the prince hosted Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump for a dinner at his house.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain compatibility there,\u201d said Jon B. Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThe president and his entourage think fellow billionaires who have an itch to get things done make the world go \u2018round.\u201dMr. Kushner and Prince Mohammed, senior officials said, worked closely together to choreograph Mr. Trump\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia, which yielded a renewed commitment by dozens of Arab and Muslim leaders to combat extremism in their countries and to turn off the financial spigot to extremist groups.For Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, that trip ranks as a highlight of his foreign policy so far, and they credit the prince for what one senior official described as under-promising and over-delivering.Prince Mohammed\u2019s elevated status was apparent in the earliest days of the Trump administration. Senior American officials said they wanted the United States to help Saudi Arabia with its campaign in Yemen against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, in part because the success or failure of the military campaign could affect the prince\u2019s fortunes in the kingdom\u2019s succession battle.During the prince\u2019s first visit to the White House, in March, the president welcomed him with a meeting in the Oval Office and a formal lunch in the State Dining Room. The next day, Prince Mohammed spent four hours with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis at the Pentagon.Mr. Kushner also hopes for Prince Mohammed\u2019s backing, or at least his blessing, in a peace initiative between Israel and the Palestinians. On Wednesday, Mr. Kushner made his first major foray into the process, meeting in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and in the West Bank with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority.\u201cThe United States officials and Israeli leadership underscored that forging peace will take time,\u201d White House officials said in a statement. But administration officials said the process would be helped if major Arab countries, notably Saudi Arabia, signed on to the concept of an agreement.Middle East experts said that Prince Mohammed believes Saudi Arabia should have a normal relationship with Israel in the future. But several expressed doubt that the prince would want the Saudis to be an important component of an Israeli-Palestinian negotiation.While the Trump administration clearly views Prince Mohammed as a reformer \u2014 pointing to Vision 2030, his blueprint to modernize Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy and society \u2014 others warned that the White House could be in for a disappointment. \u201cThere are other people who are more circumspect,\u201d Mr. Alterman said. \u201cThey wonder if he has the right temperament. They wonder if he has the right political skills.\u201dThat ambivalence ran through the Obama administration, which was caught off guard by the rapid rise of King Salman\u2019s favorite son. Prince Mohammed, unlike other prominent royals, was not educated in the West and had not had a track record of government service, and he was nearly unknown in Washington when he ascended to the position of deputy crown prince in 2015.He also assumed the title of defense minister and almost immediately became the public face of the kingdom\u2019s hastily launched military campaign against the Houthis in Yemen. The chaotic early months of the campaign gave him a reputation in some parts of the Obama administration as reckless and hotheaded.There was also the problem of finding someone in Washington to develop a relationship with the young prince. Prince Mohammed\u2019s natural counterpart on the American side, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, had little inclination to spend time nurturing ties to the prince.Secretary of State John Kerry assumed that mantle, inviting Prince Mohammed to his Georgetown home for an iftar dinner and meeting with the prince in May 2016 on the Serene, a luxury yacht that the prince bought from a Russian billionaire.Still, there were issues that could never be bridged. A particular point of friction was the Obama administration\u2019s attempts at rapprochement with Iran.At a meeting in Turkey in November 2015 between President Barack Obama and King Salman, the prince leapt into what American officials said was a lecture on what he saw as the administration\u2019s failures in the Middle East.There are no such differences with the Trump administration, however. Saudi officials have lavished praise on Mr. Trump for his bombing of Syria and his hawkish stance toward Iran.Prince Mohammed bin Nayef had close ties to national security officials in the Obama administration. But the political change in the United States this year brought a reversal of fortune for Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who lost many of his contacts.The March visit to the White House by Prince Mohammed bin Salman so angered Prince Mohammed bin Nayef that he made his annoyance known to the American government using unofficial channels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Agency Seeks to Hold South Carolina Company in Contempt", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation\u2019s top consumer regulatory agency is seeking to hold a South Carolina housing finance company in contempt for moving too slowly to respond to a judge\u2019s order that it turn over documents and audio recordings.A federal judge on Tuesday referred the matter to a United States magistrate judge for a hearing.The unusual legal maneuver by the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to hold National Asset Advisors and a related company in contempt shows that the agency is proceeding with an investigation into businesses associated with the sale of homes to lower-income borrowers with seller financing.The move also indicates that the bureau, which was established after the 2008 financial crisis, is not backing down even as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress support proposals that would greatly reduce its enforcement powers. The agency has sought to enforce in court compliance with subpoenas in about eight matters, but this is the first time it has sought to hold a company in contempt for not complying with a judge\u2019s order.Conservative critics have complained that some of the agency\u2019s investigatory subpoenas are too burdensome on businesses and amount to document grabs. But the bureau\u2019s supporters said the subpoenas, or civil investigative demands, were an important tool for regulators.\u201cDespite efforts by banks to kill the agency, they are not backing away from their mission of preventing Americans from getting ripped off by financial firms,\u201d said Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy with the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group in Washington.Harbour, based in Dallas, is complying with the subpoena.The consumer bureau\u2019s lawyers said it was not until a week ago that National Asset sent information about employee complaints and cellphone numbers for \u201capproximately 8,000 consumers who purchased properties from Harbour.\u201d But the lawyers said the company continued to move slowly in producing some 30,000 \u201cscorecards\u201d that were used to track Harbour\u2019s home sales.National Asset, based in Columbia, S.C., has also not turned over hundreds of thousands of relevant audio recordings between it and Harbour customers.Lawyers for the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.But in court filings, the lawyers said National Asset had \u201cworked diligently to respond to the bureau\u2019s demands\u201d and was no longer challenging its right to subpoena records. The lawyers said National Asset was a small company \u201cwith one I.T. employee\u201d but had \u201cgone above and beyond to cooperate at every step of the way.\u201dA major problem for the firm was isolating the recording of phone calls with Harbour customers from the roughly one million audiotapes National Asset has maintained. But the lawyers said the firm was working toward a solution.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Imposes New Sanctions Over North Korea Ties", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on a Chinese bank, a Chinese company and two Chinese citizens in an effort to crack down on North Korea\u2019s financing and development of weapons of mass destruction.The most significant action is directed at the Bank of Dandong, a Chinese lender that Treasury officials say acts as a conduit for illicit North Korean financial activity and money laundering. The department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is moving to sever the bank from the American financial system, which would severely limit its ability to work with other banks around the world.\u201cWe will follow the money and cut off the money,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said Thursday during a briefing at the White House.Mr. Mnuchin would not say if the United States had warned China about the sanctions, but he said they were not meant as any sort of message to the Chinese government.\u201cThe Department of the Treasury is committed to protecting the U.S. financial system from North Korean abuse and maximizing pressure on the government of North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWhile we will continue to seek international cooperation on North Korea, the United States is sending an emphatic message across the globe that we will not hesitate to take action against persons, companies and financial institutions who enable this regime.\u201dBy targeting the bank, the Trump administration is also hoping that China\u2019s financial sector will pressure North Korea in ways that its government has failed or been unwilling to.Anthony Ruggiero, a former official in the Treasury\u2019s Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, said that because of Thursday\u2019s move, other Chinese banks would likely be getting calls from their American counterparts to make sure that they were not engaging in illicit transactions with North Korea. He said that similar actions against bigger Chinese banks could be in store.\u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Mr. Ruggiero said. \u201cWe know there are more Chinese banks that are either wittingly or unwittingly assisting North Korea.\u201dSanctions are also being imposed on Dalian Global Unity Shipping and two Chinese citizens who the Treasury said have business dealings with North Korea related to illicit financial transactions.President Trump encouraged China, one of North Korea\u2019s only allies and a major trading partner, to pressure the North to curb its nuclear ambitions.Last week, Mr. Trump expressed his frustration on Twitter: \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out.\u201dHe added, \u201cAt least I know China tried!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Your Mother\u2019s Jersey Shore", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKnocking on the 2-by-8-inch double beams that form the peaked roof of a waterfront house he is building for his friends, Ross Vardiman admired its solid construction.\u201cIt\u2019s like the \u2018Three Little Pigs\u2019 story,\u201d he said, stepping out on the home\u2019s third-floor deck to view a blustery Barnegat Bay. \u201cThis is the brick house. The winds aren\u2019t blowing this house down.\u201dThe homeowners are Bill and Michele Garofalo, two accountants from Fairfield, N.J., who decided it was time to invest in a beach house because their teenage children\u2019s sports schedules have eased up, and they found themselves with more resources and free time.Last July they bought a bayfront lot in Ortley Beach, N.J., where a small cottage had been washed away by Hurricane Sandy. Paying $245,000 for the land, they spent another $450,000 to build and customize a five-bedroom modular home that Mr. Vardiman is hoping to have finished by the Fourth of July.Although Ortley Beach was devastated by Hurricane Sandy, the Garofalos recognized a good opportunity in this town where many empty building lots suddenly became available after the October 2012 storm. All but 60 of the beach community\u2019s 2,600 houses there were damaged or destroyed.\u201cI saw all the horror and the pictures and it was a little intimidating,\u201d said Mr. Garofalo, 51, a chief financial officer for an engineering society. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re going out and buying a cheeseburger; it\u2019s a major investment. It was a leap of faith, but we decided to do it.\u201dDespite predictions that this year\u2019s hurricane season will be more turbulent than usual, second-home buyers like the Garofalos are willing to invest heavily in beach communities that until recently were seen as risky.Almost five years after Sandy wreaked havoc, much of the fear in this part of the Jersey Shore has dissipated as wealthy clientele build significantly larger homes along the coast. Combined with the millions of public dollars spent on new boardwalks, parks, roads and beaches, these once sleepy towns are seeing their profiles fully reinvented.\u201cIt\u2019s a shiny new penny here,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Shea, a real estate broker with Keller Williams Shore Properties, describing Ortley Beach. \u201cBefore, it was mostly a blue-collar community where houses were passed down from one generation to the next and people weren\u2019t doing a lot of major improvements. We\u2019ve got a whole different thing going on here now, with 3,000- to 4,000-square-foot houses going up.\u201dThis rebirth is a direct result of the damage Sandy caused in Ortley Beach, which is part of Toms River. With 117 miles of coastline hugging Barnegat Bay and the ocean, Toms River saw 10,000 of its houses damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Sandy.Since the storm, more than 2,000 homes in Toms River have been demolished and are being rebuilt, according to Mayor Thomas Kelaher, while 1,200 are being elevated. Ortley Beach has two new lifeguard stations, a new boardwalk, a new park and new street lighting. This fall, all the roads will be repaved and new underground storm pipes will be installed.\u201cWe figured it was going to take a while, but compared to how bad it was, we\u2019re in pretty good shape,\u201d said Mr. Kelaher, who estimated that the town was 70 percent recovered, largely thanks to millions in federal and state emergency aid.In response to Hurricane Sandy, New Jersey has instituted new construction regulations that follow federal standards and then some. Those people building new homes or rebuilding damaged homes in designated flood zones are required to raise their houses to the base flood elevation levels determined for each community by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, plus one extra foot, as set by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.For those living in some flood-prone areas, those elevations must be on wood or cylindrical concrete pilings, while in less vulnerable coastal areas, masonry blocks can be used. Piling foundations require open sides or breakaway walls so that if another flood occurred, the water would wash right through the base of the house. Wiring and utilities also must be placed above the elevation levels. Such measures will be protection from storms and may help prevent rising flood insurance costs.\u201cThe reason we did this was obviously to protect people\u2019s homes, but also to protect them financially,\u201d said Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. \u201cThe higher you go, the lower your rates.\u201dHomeowners along the Jersey Shore have been aggressive in elevating their houses, including those who are not required to do so under the new regulations, but want to reduce their flood insurance rates. Lifting a house can exceed $100,000, between adding the new foundation, replacing sewer and electric lines, constructing staircases and regrading property.When Michael Leonard bought his three-bedroom bungalow in Long Beach in 2010 for $309,000, he didn\u2019t expect to be spending $120,000 more seven years later to raise it. But that\u2019s what he did this spring, adding 11-foot wood pilings and switchback staircases beneath his 1930 house on Long Beach Island.He was able to recoup a quarter of the cost with a $30,000 grant from FEMA, which has provided $198 million in financing for the elevation of New Jersey houses severely affected by Sandy.\u201cI was up to paying $2,200 a year in flood insurance last year and saw no end in sight,\u201d said Mr. Leonard, who lives in Cold Spring, N.Y. \u201cThe guy next door raised his house and he\u2019s down to $600. I\u2019m expecting mine to be around that.\u201dOne major task yet to be completed is the expansion of the beaches, which were severely diminished by Hurricane Sandy and have been battered by annual storms. Over Memorial Day weekend, Ortley Beach was the first stop of a $128 million Ocean County beach replenishment project by the Army Corps of Engineers. By the end of the year, 11 million cubic yards of sand will have been pumped from the ocean\u2019s floor onto the coast, creating 150-foot-wide beaches and building 22-foot dunes along the 14-mile stretch between Point Pleasant Beach and Island Beach State Park.By late August, the ocean dredges will have made their way to Mantoloking, about six miles north of Ortley Beach, where some sections of coast are barely wide enough to lay down a beach towel.\u201cThe beach replenishment is going to have a very positive impact for us,\u201d said Lance White, the town council president in Mantoloking. \u201cPsychologically, it\u2019s significant. We\u2019re a beach town. The beach is an important part of our existence.\u201dBoasting the highest per capita income in Ocean County, Mantoloking was mostly underwater when the Atlantic Ocean breached through to Barnegat Bay at the Mantoloking Bridge on Oct. 29, 2012, splitting houses in half and leaving some floating in the bay. Close to half of the town\u2019s 524 homes had first-floor flooding, Mr. White said, while 119 were either destroyed or significantly damaged.After so much damage, a number of waterfront properties that had been held by the same families for generations became available, said Perry Beneduce, marketing director for Diane Turton Realtors.\u201cWhen Sandy hit, some of these houses didn\u2019t have flood insurance, and if it was a family estate, some couldn\u2019t afford to rebuild,\u201d said Ms. Beneduce, whose agency handled the sale of several large properties that were subdivided, with new houses built on smaller lots.Since the storm, 115 new houses have been built in Mantoloking, and 99 have been elevated, Mr. White said. Though the lots may be smaller, the houses are far grander than what this town of 296 year-round residents has seen in the past.Before Sandy, area homes averaged about 4,000 square feet, according to Jeff Childers, a real estate agent with Sotheby\u2019s International. Now the average is 6,000 square feet. The highest listing on the market is a new 6,200-square-foot oceanfront mansion at $6.8 million. With these higher prices, the buyer profile has shifted as well.\u201cThe demographic is younger, and more tied to New York finance,\u201d Mr. Childers said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost becoming a southern Hamptons.\u201dMr. White, 67, who has been coming to Mantoloking for 33 years, and living here year-round since 2007, acknowledged that as a result of Hurricane Sandy \u201cwe\u2019re not quite as innocent as we once were.\u201d\u201cBefore Sandy, we were more of a quiet beach town with old Jersey Shore-style houses, some were decent-sized and some were modest sizes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe houses being built now are not modest for the most part. If people are going to spend the money, they want to build the biggest house they can.\u201dFor these new houses, the living space doesn\u2019t begin until about 10 feet of elevation. They are also using sturdier building materials, along with high-end finishes. \u201cOne is trying to outdo the next with architectural design and features,\u201d Mr. Childers said.A few miles south of Mantoloking, a modest shorefront community has experienced dramatic change as well. Built in the 1940s and \u201950s to accommodate working-class families, Ocean Beach, an unincorporated section of Toms River, originally offered one- and two-bedroom cottages for sale at $2,095, or rent for about $70 a week ($10 extra for hot water). In subsequent decades, Ocean Beach property values increased but its barracks-style rows of single-story bungalows marching toward the ocean stayed the same. Until Sandy.Now, many of those small cottages have been raised up on six- or eight-foot-high pilings, while others are being replaced with larger homes, like the five-bedroom modular house that Kristin Sebelle is eagerly waiting to be completed.Growing up, Ms. Sebelle spent summers vacationing in Ocean Beach, with numerous family members piling into one of those cottages. Last April, she teamed up with her brother and cousin to pay $230,000 for a small Ocean Beach ranch house that had been gutted by Hurricane Sandy. They demolished it in January and have spent $400,000 building a house where the three families will spend their summers. The one hitch was the months it took to win approval from the homeowners association to build a two-story home in an area that is deed-restricted to one-story houses. Other homeowners are following suit.\u201cThey\u2019re not the little beach shacks anymore,\u201d said Ms. Sebelle, 39, noting the transformation of Ocean Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s a different aesthetic but I don\u2019t think the culture of the area will change all that much. It\u2019s still very family oriented.\u201dHomeowners along the shore continue to grapple with the rising cost of flood insurance, which is required for anyone carrying a mortgage on a house in a designated flood zone, and the rates can increase annually by as much as 25 percent for second homes, though a Senate bill to overhaul the national flood insurance program introduced last week proposes capping these annual increases at 10 percent.But homeowners can significantly reduce their flood insurance charges by raising their houses above base flood elevation levels. At the same time, homeowners who raise their houses high enough may gain parking spaces beneath, a valuable commodity at the shore. For Dan Holland, building a new house in Manasquan won him something else, too.Last May, Mr. Holland bought a bungalow a half block from the ocean in an area that had been damaged by Hurricane Sandy. He lived in it through the summer and then knocked it down last Thanksgiving, replacing it with a two-story house atop 10-foot pilings. His second-story master bedroom has an unobstructed view of the ocean.\u201cThis summer, I\u2019ll be able to sit out on my balcony and watch the fireworks,\u201d said Mr. Holland, 38, manager of 15 Wawa convenience stores.Mr. Holland is part of the changing demographic that this southern Monmouth County shore town has been courting since Hurricane Sandy. Unlike many seasonal shore towns, Manasquan has long served as a primary residence for many homeowners, with about two-thirds of its population living there year-round. That said, there\u2019s also a robust summer rental market, much of which had been dominated by college-age renters filling small beach bungalows to the gills. Mr. Holland was among this faction, having spent about 10 years renting bungalows with a number of college friends. His new three-bedroom house will be his year-round residence.Many of the older bungalows that were used as rentals were severely damaged by Hurricane Sandy, especially those close to the beach, where Frank DiRoma, Manasquan\u2019s code construction supervisor, estimated that 40 percent of the homes have been rebuilt or raised.\u201cThe group rentals have definitely diminished,\u201d Mr. DiRoma said. \u201cThose who had their homes destroyed are building larger homes that they\u2019re either not renting out at all, or renting out at a higher price, to more responsible people.\u201dThe hurricane has been a boon for Terrance Hegel, whose company, Atlantic Modular Builders, has built 20 homes in Manasquan in the last five years, including Mr. Holland\u2019s house. While some of his customers may have been thinking about upgrading before the storm, Mr. Hegel said, \u201cSandy tipped the scale.\u201dA block from the ocean, 91-year-old Daniel LeRose, who is known as Buddy, lives in a three-bedroom Cape Cod that his sister bought in 1942. His neighbor to the south has recently raised her bungalow up on 10-foot concrete blocks. His neighbor to the north built a three-story house that he plans to expand, having recently purchased an empty lot next door. Waving his arm down the block, Mr. LeRose wistfully noted, \u201cAll the houses are being torn down and rebuilt by wealthy people who are just using the homes for themselves.\u201dAcross the street sits a row of weather-beaten cottages he refers to affectionately as Animal House, because they are rented out to large groups of people each summer. It can get a little wild on summer weekends, he said, but it\u2019s a part of Manasquan that he is not eager to see disappear.\u201cThey\u2019re nice kids and they liven the place up,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to see the young people enjoy themselves. But I also like it at the end of the summer when they go home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stop Totalitarianism in Venezuela", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHowever, Chavista power in Venezuela is continuing its decline from its glory days with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. On Tuesday, a rogue faction of police apparently dropped grenades from a helicopter onto the Supreme Court in Caracas in what Mr. Maduro called a \u201ccoup plot.\u201dVenezuela suffered through long periods of dictatorship and achieved constitutional order only in 1959, at the hands of another extraordinary figure, R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, the first Latin American convert from communism to democracy. Unfortunately, democracy confronted an expiration date. In 1998, the Venezuelan people, tired of a two-party regime stained by corruption and social inequalities, voted Hugo Ch\u00e1vez into power. Much more than a populist, he was a redeemer skilled at and addicted to the intense use of media.I was present for that penultimate cycle of this longstanding but now intensified tension. I traveled to Venezuela at various times and spoke to numerous Chavistas, from important government functionaries to social leaders, and was impressed by the spontaneous testimony, in poor neighborhoods, by Venezuelans approving the man who, they would say, \u201ctook them into account for the first time.\u201d I felt that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s social commitment was genuine but that putting it into practice did not require the installation of a dictatorship. In 2008, the minister of finance, Al\u00ed Rodr\u00edguez Araque, disagreed with me. \u201cWe\u2019re constructing a communal state,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich the Soviets, the Chinese and the Cubans have not been able to do.\u201d\u201cOn what do you base your optimism?\u201d I asked.\u201cOn the price of oil. It\u2019s now at $150 per barrel and it will go up to $250.\u201d\u201cAnd if the price falls, as in 1982 Mexico, and bankrupts the country?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it will get to $250,\u201d he answered.(At present it stands at about $45 per barrel.)I also spoke with anti-Chavistas from various walks of life. The dismantling of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the highly productive oil corporation nationalized in 1975, and its astounding present level of corruption alarmed them. But their principal concern was the destruction of democracy: the confiscation of the major private television broadcaster, Radio Caracas Televisi\u00f3n, and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s growing personal domination over the government branches and electoral functions. There was a clear drift toward totalitarianism that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had foreshadowed in his first visit to Cuba, when he had expressed his wish to be \u201cel todo\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe embodiment of everything\u201d \u2014 as Fidel Castro had become in Cuba.It is impossible to know how all this will end. But there is a potential answer, one that R\u00f3mulo Betancourt formulated in 1959 and that has been reaffirmed by the O.A.S. secretary, Luis Almagro, whose valiant leadership has restored the dignity and initiative of the organization. It is recognized in international law as the Betancourt Doctrine:\u201cRegimes that do not respect human rights and violate the freedoms of their citizens,\u201d it says, \u201cshould be submitted to a rigorous quarantine and eradicated through the collective action of the international juridical community.\u201dNothing can be expected from dictatorial regimes like China or Russia or those Latin American and Caribbean countries still benefiting, albeit precariously, from Venezuelan subsidies in oil \u2014 it was these countries that blocked the recent attempt at condemnation of the regime by the O.A.S. Perhaps President Barack Obama might have had some effect on the Cuban government, but it would be best if the Trump administration, with its lack of moral legitimacy, does not intervene.And yet, in solidarity with the courageous Venezuelan people, Europe and the major countries of Latin America could support a quarantine \u2014 diplomatic, financial, commercial and political \u2014 of the outlaw regime of Mr. Maduro. They might persuade the first Latin American pope to take a stronger stand and together pressure Ra\u00fal Castro to accept a democratic solution: a halt to the repression, immediate elections, the re-establishment of civil liberties, respect for democratic institutions and the release of political prisoners.Enrique Krauze is a historian, the editor of the literary magazine Letras Libres and the author of \u201cRedeemers: Ideas and Power in Latin America.\u201d This essay was translated by Hank Heifetz from the Spanish.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Is Popular, but Renting Out Your Car? That\u2019s Another Story", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyOn any given holiday weekend, there might be a million people paying to stay in rooms in somebody\u2019s house or putting their whole family up at private homes. Airbnb helps many of those travelers and is now a household name.But personal vehicles, which are also near the top of the list of many people\u2019s most expensive assets, are even more underused than homes. Most people don\u2019t drive more than two hours a day, after all. So why isn\u2019t there a globe-straddling colossus on the tip of our tongues that puts millions of privately owned vehicles into a part-time rental pool?Because of \u201climited availability,\u201d said a Turo spokesman, Steve Webb, no one was available to talk to me on the phone. He said via email that less than 1 percent of Turo rentals result in damage.One of Turo\u2019s own insurance partners filed suit in federal court last year over another death. In that instance, a Turo vehicle struck another car and killed its driver in Smyrna, Ga. Brian Lewis, a lawyer representing a passenger in the Turo vehicle, said that the Turo renter was not the person actually behind the wheel, and that the suit would resolve the question of whether Turo\u2019s insurance ought to cover that situation. (The lawyers for the insurance company did not respond to a request for comment.)In an email, Mr. Webb said that the Turo vehicle in the Smyrna accident had been stolen, that the insurance company does not believe it owes coverage to a criminal, and that the coverage would indeed protect the car owner. He declined to provide overall theft figures, though he did say that it was \u201cextraordinarily rare.\u201dA spokeswoman for Getaround, Jacqueline Tanzella, said that its rate of recovered cars from in-trip thefts was 100 percent.Even Mr. Root is willing to give Turo a fourth chance if he replaces his car after the three accidents. While he found the company difficult to deal with after the damage occurred, he was often making twice as much from renting it out as the car cost in monthly lease payments, at least until it was totaled.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carbon in Atmosphere Is Rising, Even as Emissions Stabilize", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE GRIM, Tasmania \u2014 On the best days, the wind howling across this rugged promontory has not touched land for thousands of miles, and the arriving air seems as if it should be the cleanest in the world.But on a cliff above the sea, inside a low-slung government building, a bank of sophisticated machines sniffs that air day and night, revealing telltale indicators of the way human activity is altering the planet on a major scale.For more than two years, the monitoring station here, along with its counterparts across the world, has been flashing a warning: The excess carbon dioxide scorching the planet rose at the highest rate on record in 2015 and 2016. A slightly slower but still unusual rate of increase has continued into 2017.Scientists are concerned about the cause of the rapid rises because, in one of the most hopeful signs since the global climate crisis became widely understood in the 1980s, the amount of carbon dioxide that people are pumping into the air seems to have stabilized in recent years, at least judging from the data that countries compile on their own emissions.That raises a conundrum: If the amount of the gas that people are putting out has stopped rising, how can the amount that stays in the air be going up faster than ever? Does it mean the natural sponges that have been absorbing carbon dioxide are now changing?Scientists have spent decades measuring what was happening to all of the carbon dioxide that was produced when people burned coal, oil and natural gas. They established that less than half of the gas was remaining in the atmosphere and warming the planet. The rest was being absorbed by the ocean and the land surface, in roughly equal amounts.In essence, these natural sponges were doing humanity a huge service by disposing of much of its gaseous waste. But as emissions have risen higher and higher, it has been unclear how much longer the natural sponges will be able to keep up.The record increases of airborne carbon dioxide in 2015 and 2016 thus raise the question of whether this has now come to pass. Scientists are worried, but they are not ready to draw that conclusion, saying more time is needed to get a clear picture.Many of them suspect an El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern that spanned those two years, one of the strongest on record, may have caused the faster-than-usual rise in carbon dioxide, by drying out large parts of the tropics. The drying contributed to huge fires in Indonesia in late 2015 that sent a pulse of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Past El Ni\u00f1os have also produced rapid increases in the gas, though not as large as the recent ones.Yet scientists are not entirely certain that the El Ni\u00f1o was the main culprit; the idea cannot explain why a high rate of increase in carbon dioxide has continued into 2017, even though the El Ni\u00f1o ended early last year.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Scientists say their inability to know for certain is a reflection not just of the scientific difficulty of the problem, but also of society\u2019s failure to invest in an adequate monitoring system to keep up with the profound changes humans are wreaking on the planet.\u201cIt\u2019s really bare bones, our network, contrary to common misperceptions about the government wasting money,\u201d said Pieter Tans, chief of a unit that monitors greenhouse gases at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.While the recent events have made the scientific need for an improved network clear, the situation may be about to get worse, not better. President Trump\u2019s administration has targeted American science agencies for cutbacks, with NOAA, the lead agency for tracking greenhouse gases, being one of those on the chopping block.The network is complete enough to give a clear picture of the overall global trends in industrial gases in the air, scientists say. But it is too sparse to give definitive information about which parts of the planet are absorbing or releasing greenhouse gases at a given moment. Lacking such data, scientists have trouble resolving some important questions, like the reasons for the rapid increase of carbon dioxide over the past three years.\u201cIt\u2019s really important that people get that there\u2019s an awful lot that\u2019s just not known yet,\u201d Sam Cleland, the manager of the Cape Grim station, said.Human activity is estimated to be pumping almost 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air every year, an amount that Dr. Canadell of the Global Carbon Project called \u201cstaggering.\u201d The atmospheric concentration of the gas has risen by about 43 percent since the Industrial Revolution.That, in turn, has warmed the Earth by around 2 degrees Fahrenheit, a large number for the surface of an entire planet.Four virtual-reality films take you on, above and below the Antarctic ice.With a better monitoring network, scientists say they might be able to specify in greater detail what is causing variations in the amount of carbon dioxide staying in the air \u2014 and, perhaps, to give a timely warning if they detect a permanent shift in the ability of the natural sponges to absorb more.Dr. Tans of NOAA would like to put sensors on perhaps a hundred commercial airplanes to get a clearer picture of what is happening just above land in the United States. The effort would cost some $20 million a year, but the government has not financed the project.The uncertainty stemming from the recent increases in carbon dioxide is all the more acute given that global emissions from human activity seem to have stabilized over the past three years. That is primarily because of changes in China, the largest polluter, where an economic slowdown has coincided with a conscious effort to cut emissions.\u201cI\u2019d estimate that we are about at the emissions peak, or if there are further rises, they won\u2019t be much,\u201d said Wang Yi, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, who also belongs to the national legislature and advises the government on climate policy.Emissions in the United States, the second-largest polluter after China, have also been relatively flat, but Mr. Trump has started tearing up President Barack Obama\u2019s climate policies, raising the possibility that greenhouse gases could rise in coming years.Dr. Tans said that if global emissions flattened out at today\u2019s high level, the world would still be in grave trouble.\u201cIf emissions were to stay flat for the next two decades, which could be called an achievement in some sense, it\u2019s terrible for the climate problem,\u201d he said.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Peace in Afghanistan, Talk to Pakistan", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe Trump administration\u2019s Afghanistan policy review provides an opportunity to confront a central truth: No strategy, even with more troops, will succeed without reducing Pakistan\u2019s support for the Afghan Taliban and the affiliated Haqqani network that is responsible for some of the deadliest attacks against the United States and its partners in Afghanistan.After more than $30 billion in assistance to Pakistan since 2002, it is understandable that critics of the current United States policy toward Pakistan advocate a more coercive approach: slapping further conditions on assistance, imposing sanctions or listing Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism.The trouble is that such \u201csticks\u201d are unlikely to change Pakistan\u2019s behavior, because its existential concerns are tied to broader regional priorities. To get Pakistan to alter its approach in Afghanistan, the United States must understand and address Pakistan\u2019s strategic anxieties.The Pakistani military, in particular, is moved foremost by their country\u2019s rivalry with India. They have always feared a scenario in which Afghanistan offers India a second base from which to squeeze Pakistan. Leaders in Islamabad also worry that India\u2019s support may embolden their counterparts in Kabul to forcefully challenge the validity of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and reassert Afghan claims on Pakistani territory.While most of India\u2019s aid to Afghanistan has been economic, India has stepped up security assistance in recent years, including military equipment, to bolster the Afghan security forces against the Taliban. Other Indian efforts, like financing for Iran\u2019s Chabahar port that allows landlocked Afghanistan to bypass Pakistan, have further stoked Pakistani concerns.Though many in the United States and India believe Pakistan is being paranoid, the fact remains that Pakistan is convinced it is under threat. The Pakistani security establishment sees the Taliban as a check on Indian activity in Afghanistan and has doubled down on its efforts to counter deepening Afghan-India ties.Yet Pakistan\u2019s goal is not continued chaos in Afghanistan. Nor does it wish for a Taliban victory, as this would strengthen their militant kin in Pakistan. What Pakistan wants is a reconciliation process that ushers the Taliban back into the political fold in Afghanistan, without allowing the militants to control the country once again. The Taliban would counterbalance Indian influence in Afghanistan, and an inclusive political settlement would prevent their radical ideology from taking hold or spilling across the border.United States policies toward Pakistan have long underestimated the centrality of this regional dynamic in defining Pakistani choices. An approach that links efforts to enlist Pakistan\u2019s support in Afghanistan to a strategy aimed at improving India-Pakistan ties could change this.Better India-Pakistan relations are necessary to reduce Pakistan\u2019s apprehensions in Afghanistan. They also serve other long-term American interests: eliminating terrorist threats from the region, reducing the risk of nuclear war and supporting a greater global role for India.To achieve this, the United States should facilitate an India-Pakistan dialogue on the full range of economic and political issues, including their mutual concerns in Afghanistan, without trying to stage-manage the results. The United States\u2019 playing this role should be contingent on Pakistan preventing cross-border terrorist attacks in India.President George W. Bush encouraged such a comprehensive dialogue after a dangerous nuclear standoff in 2002. Within three years, India-Pakistan relations had made unprecedented progress. Terrorist movement from Pakistan across the border dropped dramatically, and India and Pakistan got extremely close to signing a deal on Kashmir. The budding rapprochement was cut short in part by an internal political clash within Pakistan.The United States must also get serious about a political settlement in Afghanistan that involves all elements of Afghan society, including the Taliban. An opportunity to start this process has been created by last week\u2019s agreement between President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan to resurrect the stalled Quadrilateral Coordination Group (the United States, Afghanistan, Pakistan and China). The United States should back this effort as a means of getting the Taliban to the reconciliation table. Other regional consultative forums like the Kabul Process, started by Mr. Ghani recently, will remain useful in keeping a larger set of important countries engaged.Without reduction in Taliban-led violence in Afghanistan, the Afghan government will be unable to rally its people behind negotiations. So in exchange for getting a say in reconciliation through the Quadrilateral forum, Pakistan must take verifiable steps to curtail the financing and arming of the Taliban, target those Taliban elements that oppose talks, and give those willing to negotiate with the Afghan government the freedom to do so. The United States also should work closely with China to encourage Pakistan. China has committed over $60 billion in investment in Pakistan and risks losing it if the region remains unstable.Our recent conversations with senior Pakistani officials suggest that a window of opportunity exists. Pakistani officials recognize that the Trump administration will have little patience with them if it senses their continued double-dealing on Afghanistan. At the same time, they will not move if they see this as ignoring Pakistan\u2019s own security needs.This new, more strategic approach would give Pakistan the incentives it needs to work with the United States on common priorities across the region. And it does so without eliminating any United States options should Pakistan still fail to see the benefits for its own future.Stephen J. Hadley, chairman of the United States Institute of Peace, was national security adviser from 2005 to 2009.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Role in European Elections Under Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Dodd, a maker of musical instruments in northern England, joined an experiment. He and around 10,000 others volunteered their data, allowing researchers to monitor in real time which political ads were showing up in their Facebook news feeds as Britain\u2019s election approached.Their goal: to shed more light on how political campaigns are using Facebook and other digital services \u2014 technologies that are quickly reshaping the democratic process, but which often offer few details about their outsize roles in elections worldwide.\u201cThese political ads aren\u2019t regulated; nobody knows what is being said on Facebook,\u201d said Mr. Dodd, 26, who planned to vote for the Labour Party on Thursday elections, but who continued to be bombarded with online messages from the Conservatives. \u201cWherever politics is concerned, there needs to more transparency.\u201dFacebook provides little information on how political parties use ads to reach undecided voters on the site. And concern has been growing since the American presidential election about the company\u2019s role in campaigns, including about how politically charged fake news is spread online.Costing less than $1,000 to build, the technology, which works as a plug-in on desktop web browsers and anonymizes users\u2019 personal information, was created because the social network does not share information on political ads shown to its more than 36 million users in Britain, roughly half the country\u2019s population.That lack of information has raised hackles about the activities of both Facebook and politicians in a country where campaigns are highly regulated and political financing is tightly capped.\u201cPolitical advertising is fundamentally different; there\u2019s a lot of concern about what\u2019s being seen on Facebook,\u201d said Sam Jeffers, the group\u2019s co-founder and a former digital media strategist. \u201cThe people deserve some sense of what\u2019s going on.\u201dAs the volunteer group is not completely representative of the British population, the data is by no means perfect, highlighting the difficulty of tracking political activity on Facebook.In the buildup to the election, for instance, the data showed that the Liberal Democrats \u2014 who are likely to remain a minority presence in Parliament \u2014 posted the largest number of political ads on Facebook. The Conservative Party was second, despite the political party\u2019s pledge to spend 1 million pounds, or $1.3 million, on social media messaging. The Labour Party, which planned to spend a similar amount, was in third place.Initially, all the British parties spent money on broad-brush messages that blanketed the social network without targeting specific voters. But as Election Day approached, that strategy began to change.The ads have included Conservative Party messages about potential nuclear energy jobs in three areas in northern England with ties to the industry, and that are some of the country\u2019s most contested districts. By contrast, the Labour Party targeted older women nationwide with directed ads about potential threats to their pensions.\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental conversation to have about how we regulate this,\u201d said Nick Anstead, a media and communications expert at the London School of Economics. \u201cFacebook has a responsibility to tell its users who is buying advertising that is targeting their votes.\u201dIn response, the company says its roughly two billion users worldwide have complete control over which ads they are shown on the network, and that it is the responsibility of individual political parties to comply with their countries\u2019 electoral laws. Facebook adds that its commercial agreements and protection of individuals\u2019 privacy restrict it from sharing more data on how information is distributed on the platform.\u201cFacebook\u2019s goal is to make it easier for people to get the information they need to vote,\u201d Andy Stone, a company spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage any and all candidates, groups and voters to use our platform to engage in the elections.\u201dAcademics and others scrutinizing the vote also said the company\u2019s failure to provide data on what Facebook users in France shared among themselves made it virtually impossible to determine if false reports spread on the network affected the overall result.For Ben Scott, such issues bring back mixed memories of the American presidential election, when he was a digital consultant for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.He has now turned his attention to a project at the New Responsibility Foundation, a Berlin-based research organization that is monitoring the spread and impact of fake news ahead of Germany\u2019s election in September.He and his team are categorizing potential online misinformation in a digital database, tracking how these false reports spread across social media and the wider web and conducting focus groups to gauge the impact on voters\u2019 decisions.The role of companies like Facebook in spreading online falsehoods is limited in Germany, Mr. Scott said, because social media does not play as significant a role in everyday politics as it does in the United States.Still, the social media giant \u2014 which has roughly 36 million users in Germany \u2014 is a force to reckon with in the coming election.Despite Mr. Scott\u2019s discussions with Facebook about potential collaborations, the company has so far declined to give his research project any data on how local users share potential misinformation among themselves on the social network.\u201cIf we see something getting significant media attention and there\u2019s a sudden spike,\u201d Mr. Scott said, \u201cthen we can guess there\u2019s something going on inside Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Elusive $1,500 Rental", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFinding an apartment in New York that does not drain your bank account can feel like a nearly impossible task.Competition is fierce. And for what? Cramped spaces that deliver little more than a grinding commute to work. But knowing where to look \u2014 and when to act \u2014 can mean the difference between crummy or cozy quarters. Apartments for less than $1,500 a month do exist, as long as you\u2019re willing to take on a roommate or two or explore neighborhoods that might be less than convenient to your work.\u201cRents have gone up, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d said Vicki Been, the faculty director at the Furman Center and a former commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development. \u201cAt the same time, people\u2019s incomes have stayed flat. That\u2019s making housing less affordable.\u201dTo find those apartments, renters \u201care going to have to look long and hard,\u201d Ms. Been said. \u201cPeople are having to make trade-offs. The cheaper the apartment, the further away from transit it is.\u201dThe search for apartments fitting a smaller budget often leads to pockets of the city that are rapidly changing, but often lack conveniences like express trains, shops and restaurants. Although rents have been stagnating over the last two years, they are still near historic highs. And neighborhoods that were considered reasonably priced options just a few years ago no longer are.In 2016, only about 14 percent of the one-bedroom apartments listed in Crown Heights on StreetEasy were asking less than $1,500-a-month rent; and in Washington Heights, around 10 percent of one-bedrooms asked less than $1,500 a month, according to data provided by StreetEasy.But head over to a Brooklyn neighborhood like Northeast Flatbush, an area south of Crown Heights, and about 63 percent of the one-bedrooms were listed for less than $1,500 a month last year; while in Norwood in the northwest Bronx, almost 94 percent of them were, according to StreetEasy.\u201cThese are predominantly residential neighborhoods with older housing stock,\u201d said Grant Long, the senior economist for StreetEasy.Last month, Tess Bonn, 27, a television writer and producer, moved back to New York City from Washington for work. She had always lived in Brooklyn, but areas she once found affordable were suddenly out of reach. She found a listing on Craigslist for an apartment in Inwood in Upper Manhattan. \u201cWhen I went to see that apartment, it was the first time I\u2019d ever been that far uptown,\u201d she said.That one didn\u2019t work out, but she was smitten by the neighborhood. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful area,\u201d she said. \u201cIt kind of reminds me of Brooklyn, but less overrun with hipsters.\u201dPrice isn\u2019t the only deciding factor. When Katrina Shakarian and Jessica Franco needed to move out of their $1,650-a-month two-bedroom apartment in Woodside, Queens, by May 31, the roommates hoped to discover a new neighborhood. \u201cWe thought, \u2018This is an opportunity to do something different,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Shakarian, 31, who works for the city and grew up in Queens. Ms. Franco, 31, who grew up in the South Bronx, works in health care.But after looking at apartments in Inwood, the South Bronx and Jackson Heights, Queens, they ended up signing a lease on a two-bedroom just a few blocks away from their old apartment.The other options they considered were cheaper, like a $1,700-a-month two-bedroom on Tinton Avenue in the South Bronx with no broker\u2019s fee. But it was on the ground floor, with bars on the windows. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in a cage,\u201d Ms. Shakarian said. An apartment in Inwood was listed for $1,750 with no broker\u2019s fee. But it was tiny. A larger Inwood apartment, also for $1,750 a month, was a fifth-floor walk-up.Ultimately, the roommates settled on a large two-bedroom apartment in Woodside for $1,850 a month, which they moved into in early June. They had to pay a broker\u2019s fee of one month\u2019s rent. Although the apartment is more expensive than the others, and farther from the subway than their old place, it is newly renovated and the building has a pool and an elevator. \u201cI think we\u2019ve gotten more space for the money,\u201d Ms. Shakarian said. \u201cIt was more bang for my buck.\u201dOne is the loneliest number \u2014 and also the most expensive. A renter who is willing to move in with one, two or even three roommates will invariably trade privacy for cash and space.\u201cYou will get more space for your money by having three or four roommates,\u201d said Mr. Courts of Nooklyn, who once lived with seven skateboarders in a Brooklyn loft with only one bathroom. (\u201cIt was a party house, obviously,\u201d he said.)Not only might a three- or four-bedroom apartment end up costing less money for a group of roommates, it might be easier to find than a smaller apartment. Just consider Bedford-Stuyvesant. Last year, less than 6 percent of the listings for one-bedrooms on StreetEasy were asking under $1,500 a month in that neighborhood. But during that same period, 23 percent of two-bedrooms listed in the neighborhood asked less than $2,000 a month; about 75 percent of three bedrooms asked less than $3,000 a month; and 58 percent of four bedrooms asked less than $3,500 a month.With more options available, the chances of finding a nicer-quality space go up. \u201cYou think when you move to New York your first place is going to have leaky faucets and broken everything,\u201d said Jake Corcoran, who spent last summer looking for two-bedrooms apartments to share with a roommate, Andrew Perez.Mr. Corcoran, 23, an actor, dancer and choreographer, did most of the apartment hunting while Mr. Perez, 23, was still living in Boston.They ultimately settled on a two-bedroom in Washington Heights for $1,975 a month. \u201cWe got lucky in having new tiles, new appliances,\u201d said Mr. Corcoran.The apartment is on the first floor so that Mr. Corcoran would not disturb any downstairs neighbors when he choreographs tap dances.\u201cIf you see it, you take it. You can\u2019t hesitate at all,\u201d said Ms. Whitney of Bohemia Realty Group. Landlords often \u201cjust rent to the first person who walks in the door.\u201dOrganizing your paperwork can have another added benefit. It can alert you ahead of time to potential problems. When Kate Blemler, a graduate student and nanny, started apartment hunting last year, she had no idea that her tax returns would complicate her search.She had been paying around $900 a month for a bedroom that was large enough for only a twin-size bed in an apartment on the Upper West Side that she shared with two roommates. She wanted space and privacy. She filled out an apartment application in Inwood only to get rejected by the landlord because her tax returns did not reflect her total income.\u201cThat was eye-opening,\u201d said Ms. Blemler, 29. She scrambled to get a letter from her employer verifying her income and asked her parents to guarantee her lease. Even so, it complicated her search, and limited her options. She got approved for a $1,650-a-month one-bedroom in a walk-up building in Inwood a few weeks later. \u201cI jumped on it,\u201d she said.Most renters have to move within a matter of weeks. But the luxury of time can help, particularly for those who do not know what they want, like Hollis Heath, who works in youth development and still lives at home in West Harlem with her parents. Around January, she decided it was time to move, grudgingly.Ms. Heath began her hunt hoping to live alone in Central Harlem for less than $1,500 a month. What she saw was small. \u201cI\u2019m a tall woman,\u201d said Ms. Heath, 29. \u201cIf I spread my arms, I\u2019d touch the entire apartment.\u201dMs. Heath spent nearly six months warming to the idea of lower rent in exchange for a longer commute. \u201cI\u2019m trying to look at it like an adventure,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s keeping me hopeful about not being able to catch a cab from Trader Joe\u2019s anymore.\u201dOn June 1, Ms. Heath submitted an application for a $1,500-a-month one-bedroom in Mott Haven in the South Bronx, which was approved a few days later. With new appliances, ample light and access to an express train, it hit all the \u201cmust haves\u201d on her list. And the landlord will pay the broker fee. \u201cIt has everything I wanted,\u201d she said. She will move in before the end of the month.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "School Board Decisions Spur Onondaga Nation Protest", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byONONDAGA NATION \u2014 On Thursday evening, after the last day of classes at the Onondaga Nation School here, students and families plan to gather at the Tsha\u2019 Tho\u00f1\u2019nhes, or sports pavilion, to celebrate the eighth graders. There will be singing and dancing. Parents will give the eighth graders beaded necklaces signifying their clans and the younger students will give them presents.While it will not be an official graduation ceremony, the families in the nation, south of Syracuse, hope to make it as festive as possible, to put an exclamation mark on the end of a year that is otherwise ending in uncertainty and discord.Since June 16, most parents have kept their children home from school. They are protesting what they see as disrespectful actions by the local school board, which manages the school under a contract with the state but has no Onondaga representatives. The families say that they and the nation\u2019s leadership have been excluded from decisions about hiring and budgeting.The last straw, they say, was the board\u2019s refusal to appoint an Onondaga teacher at the school to replace the current principal, who is retiring on Saturday.The conflict echoes battles elsewhere over how much say parents should have in the direction of a school, but with an unusual twist because of the cultural divide between the leadership of the district, the LaFayette Central School District, and the families the Nation School serves.The Onondaga consider themselves citizens of a sovereign nation and do not participate in any elections, including those for the school board. Their say on decision-making depends in large part on the will of board members and the superintendent.Sidney Hill, the Tadodaho, or traditional leader, of the Onondaga Nation, said that it seemed like \u201ca no-brainer\u201d to elevate the longtime teacher, Simone Thornton, who attended the school herself and sent her children there, and has deep knowledge of the culture. \u201cWe want our kids to be educated, but we also want them to know who they are,\u201d Mr. Hill said.Instead of Ms. Thornton, the LaFayette board selected Warren Smith, an assistant principal in a nearby district, who is also a colonel in the Army Reserve. After attending a meeting on May 25 in which Onondaga members criticized the decision, Mr. Smith turned down the job. (Mr. Smith did not respond to messages.)But in a letter dated June 14, sent by a lawyer for the school district to the nation\u2019s general counsel, Joseph Heath, the district said that it was not considering Ms. Thornton for the position, saying that she lacked leadership experience and the necessary certification. (Mr. Heath said Ms. Thornton had taken the required coursework for certification and had submitted an application for it to the state.)Mr. Hill said that appointing a person with a military background had been especially alarming, evoking the history of Indian boarding schools of the 19th and early 20th century, one of the most notorious of which, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, was started by an Army officer, Richard Henry Pratt. Pratt and others believed that it was in Native Americans\u2019 best interest for them to renounce their traditional culture and assimilate.Mr. Hill\u2019s parents attended boarding schools in Western New York.\u201cWe don\u2019t need someone to be grabbing us by the hand and telling us, \u2018Oh, come along with me, I\u2019ll take care of you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cWe\u2019re mature people. We can make mature decisions for our children.\u201dBut the incoming district superintendent, Jeremy Belfield, who participated in the principal selection process, said the nation misunderstood its role in public school decisions.\u201cThere is probably a strong feeling from the nation and from the community right now that they should have the final and ultimate say regarding personnel decisions in the school district,\u201d he said. But \u201cin a New York State public school, the board of education and the superintendent have the final say.\u201dThe Onondaga Nation School, which has roughly 140 students, is one of three state-financed schools on Indian territories in New York State. The state contracts with a local school district to run each school.The LaFayette district has managed Onondaga Nation School since 1970. The district has about 900 students; 65 percent are white and 30 percent are Native American. (Children living in the Onondaga Nation are also allowed to attend the district\u2019s other elementary school, and they attend the district\u2019s junior/senior high school starting in ninth grade.)The Nation School offers a standard New York State curriculum, but students also take classes in Onondaga language and culture. The academic year ends late in June because the school closes for 11 ceremony days during the year, in addition to the standard winter and spring breaks.About half the teachers at the school are Native American, according to the district. But the school has not had a Native American principal since the early 1970s.In April, the district convened a hiring committee for the principal position; about half its members were Onondaga, Mr. Belfield said. Ms. Thornton was the only Native American candidate to be interviewed, said Awe\u00f1heeyoh Powless, a mother who was on the committee, and she was one of the three candidates recommended by the committee to the board and superintendent.Some parents said that having Ms. Thornton as principal would provide a role model for their children and ease the tension some families feel between holding onto their culture and pursuing an education.\u201cSimone would be amazing, just to show our Native children that they can continue on to school and come back,\u201d said Ashley Bennett, who has one child and three stepchildren at the school, and is the president of the Parent Teacher Student Association.The day before parents and students walked out of the Nation School, Mr. Heath, the general counsel, sent a letter to the state\u2019s education commissioner, MaryEllen Elia, requesting a meeting to express the nation\u2019s concerns about the district\u2019s actions and asking the state to audit the district\u2019s budget. Last week, two officials with the State Education Department met with Mr. Belfield and the district\u2019s lawyers, as well as parents and grandparents from the nation.The departing superintendent, Laura Lavine, said the district had faced challenges in trying to work with the Onondaga leadership. She said the district had been told that the nation would form an education committee so the district would have a set of consistent contacts, but that had not happened.Nonetheless, she said, she had tried to be responsive to the nation\u2019s concerns, increasing the time devoted to language classes at the school. She said she had also tried to improve instruction, which had resulted in improved reading scores at the school, while the number of students classified as speech impaired had decreased.Mr. Hill said the nation planned now to form an education committee to address its concerns.\u201cWe really don\u2019t have a voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI think definitely things have to change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Libya\u2019s Increased Oil Production Thwarts OPEC\u2019s Reduction Plans", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 The price of oil keeps sinking, and there is no shortage of reasons: American oil companies are producing too much petroleum. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has not cut production enough. Motorists around the globe are not driving enough to shrink crude and gasoline inventories as quickly as expected.But the biggest wild card in the equation \u2014 one that could tip prices at the pump from one day to the next \u2014 is oil-rich Libya, among the most unstable countries in North Africa. Contrary to the predictions of almost all experts, Libya\u2019s production has climbed a wall of crisis in recent months to 885,000 barrels a day last week, roughly triple its production of only a year ago.The unexpected production in Libya has added to the downward pressure on prices. West Texas intermediate crude ended Tuesday at the lowest point since last year, $43.23, a decline of 2.2 percent.Libya\u2019s success in the oil fields has been highly improbable at a time when the country is hopelessly divided between two competing governments and several hostile tribal and regional militias. Deals are made from week to week between oil officials and tribal groups seeking leverage in the southern desert just to keep pipelines open. And suddenly the tensions between Qatar and its Middle Eastern neighbors are echoing more strongly in Libya, threatening exports.But the seemingly ungovernable country has already undermined OPEC\u2019s efforts to cut production, and now Libyan oil executives are projecting that their production will reach a million barrels a day by the end of July, a level not seen in four years.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible disconnect between the security situation and the oil story,\u201d said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cI just find it amazing, but I don\u2019t know how long you can reconcile these divergent stories.\u201dLibya has Africa\u2019s largest oil reserves, and its high-quality light crude is in demand around the world. During the 2011 revolution against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and most of the years that followed, production was reduced to a trickle while exports were blocked by militias that controlled the ports.But by the end of 2016, the blockades were lifted by one armed group, the Libyan National Army, and threats to the oil fields by local adherents of the Islamic State were alleviated by a successful push of opposing militias. Those were positive developments for Libya, but they came just as OPEC decided to take a new course of production cuts to lift crude prices.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Libya, along with Iran and Nigeria, was excluded from the OPEC agreement to slash production last year by more than a million barrels a day. Now all three have increased production, but Libya has been by far the biggest surprise.\u201cA lot of experts figured things were so unstable in Libya and politics were so opaque that they did not want to factor in more supply from there,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research. With the Libyan surprise, he added, \u201cOPEC has been wounded. It gets back to the problem that OPEC has a lot of members in bad shape, making it difficult for them to call on everybody to make sacrifices equally. So they excluded those three and now it\u2019s come back to bite them.\u201dLibya continues to complicate that outlook.Last month the national oil company announced an aggressive three-phase development plan to lift Libyan output to 1.32 million barrels a day by the end of 2017, to 1.5 million barrels a day by the end of 2018, and to 2.2 million barrels a day by 2023. That kind of growth will require the expertise of Western oil companies that have mostly shied away from investing in Libya in recent years because of the instability and dangers to their workers. Few oil executives outside of Libya are optimistic that the goals will be reached.Many oil experts say that the Libyan oil company and its partners have been lucky over the last year and that their luck may soon run out, in part because of the rising tensions between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbors along with Egypt. The Qataris are aligned with powerful members of the Tripoli-based government backed by Western nations and Turkey, while the competing government based in the eastern city of Tobruk is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Russia.The two governments reached an uneasy deal in late 2015, and the national oil company tries to remain neutral, but the effort led by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to isolate Qatar is already spilling over into Libya.Potentially caught in the crossfire is Glencore, the Swiss-based commodities trading giant, which is the marketer of a large percentage of Libyan oil production and is partly owned by the Qatari Investment Authority. The head of the eastern branch of the Libyan national oil company has accused Qatar of using its 8.5 percent stake in Glencore to divert the trading company\u2019s sales of Libyan oil to finance terrorists, a charge denied by Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of the national oil company based in Tripoli. Glencore called the allegation \u201ctotally false and baseless.\u201dMr. Sanalla has official authority over all exports, but the prime minister of the eastern government, Abdullah al-Thinni, has ordered Glencore to halt oil exports from the port of Hariga. About 200,000 barrels a day of exports could eventually be put at risk.\u201cI appreciate the deals that Sanalla has done to re-establish production,\u201d said Geoff D. Porter, president of North Africa Risk Consulting. \u201cBut those deals don\u2019t reflect any structural change in the oil sector or the geopolitical risks or labor unrest, safety issues and tribal unrest. These are huge issues that could slow up the sector at any point.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Initial Jolt Over Qatar Tensions, Energy Markets Settle", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe flare-up in the Middle East adds to the instability in the world\u2019s most important energy-exporting region. Saudi Arabia is the biggest exporter of crude oil, while Qatar is home to substantial natural gas resources.But a diplomatic dispute will not necessarily cut into supplies, provided tensions in the region do not escalate. Amid a global glut, other countries could easily step in to fill the void.Investors seem to be calculating that. While oil prices initially spiked 1.6 percent on Monday, the markets quickly fell back to just above $50 a barrel.\u201cIn the Middle East, there is politics and then there is business,\u201d said Chase Untermeyer, who served as the American ambassador to Qatar in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd business tends to keep on going regardless of political scrapes.\u201dAt present, the markets are digesting an oversupply of crude oil, which has kept prices low for more than two years. Saudi Arabia and other major oil-exporting nations are trying to keep supplies in check, but American shale companies continue to ramp up production.A small country with only 2.2 million residents \u2014 many of whom are not citizens \u2014 Qatar occupies a strategic position, jutting into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula. Qatar has a border with Saudi Arabia and shares the world\u2019s largest natural gas field with Iran.Qatar is a relatively small oil producer with output of about 620,000 barrels a day in April, less than 1 percent of world supply. But the country is a world power in natural gas.Through partnerships with Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and other companies, Qatar has built major infrastructure for chilling natural gas into liquid form so that it can be exported on ships. Qatar was the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas last year, accounting for nearly 30 percent of supplies, according to the consultancy group Wood Mackenzie.Gas has helped make Qatar one of the world\u2019s richest countries per capita. The government has used the steady flow of cash to intervene in regional disputes and to finance activities like the broadcast network Al Jazeera, actions that often annoy its Arab neighbors.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.The diplomatic crisis comes at a difficult time for Qatar\u2019s economy. Over the last two years, Australia\u2019s mushrooming liquefied gas exports have increasingly crowded out Qatari gas meant for Japan, South Korea, China and other growing Asian markets.That squeeze \u2014 coupled with weak energy prices and exorbitant spending in preparation to host the 2022 World Cup \u2014 has driven up Qatar\u2019s debt. Last month, Moody\u2019s downgraded Qatar\u2019s credit ratings below those of several Gulf states. Even before this diplomatic row, the country\u2019s economy was expected to grow only about 2 percent this year.As Arab neighbors sever ties, the move could most immediately damage the premier national airline, Qatar Airways. The airline will no longer be able to fly over Saudi and Egyptian airspace to Europe. While alternative routes will probably be established over Iran and Turkey, added flight times will almost certainly hurt ticket sales, to the benefit of its competitor, Emirates Airlines.\u201cIf this continues for any length of time it will have implications for the Qatari economy,\u201d said Richard Mallinson, a geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm. \u201cThe question is, do calmer heads prevail and do we see work to de-escalate.\u201dNatural gas is the economic unknown.Qatar\u2019s leaders realized decades ago that they had to bring in foreign investors to gain access to the capital and technology needed to take advantage of their major natural gas deposits. Shell has pumped about $20 billion into an enormous facility, while Exxon Mobil is probably Qatar\u2019s most important partner with stakes across the country\u2019s natural gas industry.\u201cI would think both are pretty worried,\u201d said Trevor Sikorski, a gas analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based research firm.Shell and Exxon declined to comment.Any disruptions depend on whether the diplomatic rift deepens \u2014 a crucial variable as companies decide whether to invest more in Qatar.Saudi Arabia in 2011 sent troops into Bahrain to bolster the ruling family, which was facing unrest. Some analysts worry that Egypt could block Qatari exports from going though the Suez Canal.But such actions seem unlikely at this point. The Saudis, for one, are already wrestling with several foreign entanglements, particularly the war in Yemen.\u201cNobody is going to meddle with their oil and gas fields,\u201d said Sadad Ibrahim Al-Husseini, former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco. \u201cThe issue is they are not going to have any luck selling their gas within the Gulf region.\u201dQatari gas exports that previously went to Asia are expected to be diverted to Europe. But Qatar will probably be squeezed again, as American supplies are expected to rise over the next year or two as new export terminals come online.Qatar has tried to compensate for lost markets by exporting more gas to Middle Eastern markets. But the new political tension will hurt those efforts.\u201cThe prospects for future Qatari gas exports to adjacent markets have been reduced to less than zero,\u201d said Mr. Al-Husseini.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Troubles at a Midsize Italian Bank Worry the E.U.", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Some banks go to the international markets when they need money for a big deal. Monte dei Paschi di Siena, one of Italy\u2019s biggest lenders, tapped its own loyal customers.\u201cThe bank has always been a gold mine and the pride of the city,\u201d said Paolo Emilio Falaschi, a lawyer in Siena who represents several aggrieved clients.As the bank runs low on cash, the Italian government is stepping in to help, with plans to inject as much as 20 billion euros into Monte dei Paschi and other troubled lenders. European regulators gave their preliminary approval to the Monte dei Paschi deal on the condition that the bank go through an in-depth restructuring and its finances pass muster.Much of the reform instituted after the 2008 financial crisis was intended to prevent banks from becoming so big and so risky that they could hold the global economy hostage. Politicians and policy makers didn\u2019t want taxpayers to be on the hook for the banks\u2019 mistakes.Under the new rules, national governments are not supposed to inject fresh taxpayer money into a bank if it is deemed insolvent. When a bank gets into financial trouble, shareholders and bondholders, assumed to be sophisticated investors aware of the risks, are supposed to take the hit and bear the losses.The health of Monte dei Paschi \u2014 which will be assessed by the European Central Bank as a condition of the deal \u2014 will be a crucial measure to ensure the bailout follows the rules. But the finances of Monte dei Paschi are open to significant interpretation, putting the rescue in a regulatory gray area.Monte dei Paschi is the first case in which the European Central Bank has exercised its oversight role under new bank bailout rules. The central bank is responsible for determining whether Monte dei Paschi can be saved and how much capital it needs.If authorities stretch the definition of solvency for a midsize Italian lender, a fraction the size of JPMorgan Chase or Deutsche Bank, the case could raise questions about whether the world was any safer from a really big bank failure.\u201cThis is the first serious test for the European banking union,\u201d said Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, an economic research institute in Munich.\u201cIf the bail-in rules are violated without very good reasons,\u201d Mr. Fuest said, \u201cthe credibility of the banking union will be damaged.\u201dMonte dei Paschi declined to comment.Monte dei Paschi\u2019s problems have been festering for nearly a decade. Founded in 1472 and still based in a fortresslike medieval building, the bank for centuries was a sleepy regional lender. The local foundation that owned the bank showered its profit on Siena and the surrounding region, subsidizing things as diverse as the local professional soccer team and Siena\u2019s famous Palio horse race.The bank\u2019s troubles began in 2008, when it acquired Antonveneta, a small regional player. The price of \u20ac9 billion, all in cash, was considered alarmingly high.Stretched, the bank used a series of dubious transactions to raise money. Among them was the sale of \u20ac2 billion in bonds to customers, employees and other middle-class savers.Weakened by the purchase, Monte dei Paschi was acutely vulnerable to the shocks that followed the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in late 2008 and the European debt crisis in 2010. Prices plunged for the bank\u2019s holdings of Italian government bonds. The amount of problem loans surged, as Italy\u2019s sputtering economy hurt small businesses and left many unable to repay their debts.Monte dei Paschi managers made the problems worse by trying to conceal growing losses from shareholders and regulators, in part using derivatives devised with the help of Japanese bank Nomura and Deutsche Bank. After the losses were exposed in 2013, the bank needed a \u20ac3.9 billion bailout from the Bank of Italy to stay afloat.A succession of new top managers tried to fix Monte dei Paschi by pushing thousands of bank workers into early retirement, selling problem loans and asking shareholders to put up new capital. The measures were not enough.Last July, stress tests by European bank regulators determined that Monte dei Paschi\u2019s capital would be wiped out in the event of a severe economic crisis. No other bank tested fared so poorly.The bank tried to raise more capital. But the company failed to persuade private investors.The crisis comes at a particularly sensitive time. New elections are expected later this year, or next spring.Leaders in Rome are worried that forcing small-time investors to take a hit would make them susceptible to appeals by the populist Five Star Movement or the right wing Northern League. The Five Star Movement has organized noisy demonstrations in front of Monte dei Paschi\u2019s headquarters.\u201cYou can expect Five Star and the Northern League to play this card,\u201d said Silvia Merler, an affiliate fellow at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels.Sergio Burrini, a retired Monte dei Paschi employee who is secretary of group representing small investors, expressed anger at \u201ca terrible political and managerial class that did not prevent this mayhem from happening.\u201d But Mr. Burrini expressed no sympathy for the Five Star Movement.Local lawyers in touch with bondholders doubt that their clients would turn to populist parties. Most of the investors are relatively well-to-do people unlikely to support such movements, the lawyers said.The debate about the bailout has reopened familiar fault lines between Italy and countries like Germany that insist on strict adherence to the letter of the law. Early in the process, the German government raised objections to a bailout.But it may be reluctant to put up obstacles now. The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel faces an election in September, and Germany may need to save its own troubled institution, the state-owned HSH Nordbank.On Thursday, the Finance Ministry in Berlin declined to comment on the decisions by European authorities to approve the bailout.Ms. Merler of Bruegel argued that Italy is not violating European rules by helping Monte dei Paschi. Europe\u2019s bank resolution law allows countries to provide temporary aid to banks in order to avert a financial crisis, provided the bank has not already collapsed.Some analysts are concerned that Monte dei Paschi\u2019s troubles could spread to other Italian banks. Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca both asked for state aid last month, but European regulators may be reluctant to give them arrangements similar to Monte dei Paschi\u2019s.While the details of Monte dei Paschi\u2019s deal are still being finalized, Italian taxpayers are expected to the bear the brunt of the cost. The Italian government is expected to kick in \u20ac6.6 billion, with the remaining \u20ac2.2 billion of its capital shortfall covered by senior bondholders. As part of the plan, the ordinary folks who bought bonds would be compensated in some manner.The justification for repaying the small-time investors in full is that they were victims of false marketing. But critics say consumer fraud issues should be treated separately from the bailout.\u201cThey can sue the bank for selling them something they did not want to buy,\u201d said Mr. Fuest of the Ifo Institute. \u201cI cannot see that financial stability depends on bailing out all retail investors.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, Gaia Pianigiani from Rome and Chad Bray from London.

Its confrontation with its neighbors has threatened to tear apart the alliance of petroleum-rich gulf monarchies that is crucial to the Western efforts to contain Iran, to combat the Islamic State and to choke off extremist fund-raising.Tensions between the two sides over questions of power and autonomy date back at least two decades. But at the core of the current dispute is Qatar\u2019s support for the Arab Spring revolts of 2011, in particular the Muslim Brotherhood-style Islamists who at the time appeared poised to win elections across the region.Qatar saw an alliance with the Brotherhood and its movement as a hedge against dominance by Saudi Arabia; Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates saw the same forces as a threat to the stability of their governments and the region.The new Saudi and Emirati list was issued on Friday as the German foreign minister appeared with his Qatari counterpart on a visit to Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Germany.Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, had previously attributed the escalation of the dispute to what he called a dangerous \u201cTrumpification\u201d of regional politics.The new Saudi and Emirati list includes some people already designated as terrorist fund-raisers by the West. They include Hajjaj al-Azmi, a Kuwaiti who is sometimes in Doha, the capital of Qatar. It also includes at least one Libyan group, the Defend Benghazi Brigades, which has included people and organizations designated as terrorists or aiding terrorism by the West. Many Libyans believe elements of the Brigades have received support from Qatar.Also on the list is a former Qatari interior minister, Abdullah Bin Khalid Al-Thani, who is a member of the royal family but had been accused in the past of ties with extremists in the period before the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.Some entries on the list are likely to raise questions in the West. It includes the former Egyptian Islamist militant Tarek el-Zomor, who served a jail sentence, renounced violence, participated in electoral politics and is believed to have fled to Qatar after the military takeover in Cairo in 2013. Another is Yusuf al-Qaradawi, an Egyptian-born Muslim cleric and scholar associated with the Muslim Brotherhood who years ago became a citizen of Qatar. Mr. Qaradawi has sometimes endorsed violence against Israel, but he is usually considered a preacher rather than a militant or terrorist fund-raiser.The list also includes several Bahraini opposition groups that appear to have little or no relation to Qatar. The Qatari-owned news organization Al Jazeera reported that 18 of the people on the list were Qatari citizens. Several Qatari charities were also named, and Qatar denied that they were involved in financing terrorism.Egypt, which has become a close ally of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates since the military takeover in 2013, also endorsed the list.David D. Kirkpatrick reported from Doha, and Gardiner Harris from Washington.Advertisement"}

There is no spreadsheet that can guarantee you will be fine.I know people in the finance industry love to talk about retirement projections as if they can tell you what the future holds, and there is definitely value in having a plan.2. More money does not solve feelings of financial insecurity. I\u2019ve met with people who have more money than they could ever spend, and they\u2019re absolutely convinced that tomorrow will be the day it all disappears. In fact, in my experience there is very little correlation between net worth and a personal sense of financial security. To be clear, I am not talking about actual security. I\u2019m talking about one\u2019s sense of security. Those are two different things.So let\u2019s stop hoping to find the magic certainty button. It doesn\u2019t exist. At some level, we must learn to be O.K. with the inevitable risk of simply being alive.Here\u2019s an idea I have seen work. Think of it as Serenity Prayer training. Make a list of all the things that matter that you do control: saving something for your retirement, evaluating the way you invest, spending less, finding side hustles to make a bit more, etc.Now, look at that list and put a big, fat check mark next to everything you\u2019ve addressed to the best of your ability. Whatever you didn\u2019t check off, take some time and effort to work on it.Any time you start to feel fear or discomfort creep up again, just go back to that list, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you have done everything you can. Then, repeat after me: \u201cI need to let go of the rest. I need to let go of the rest. I need to let go of the rest.\u201d And that becomes the touchstone for what can help you feel a little more fine.Advertisement"}

The spokesman, Michael Short, said in an email only that Mr. Trump had \u201cformally extracted himself\u201d from management of his business, the Trump Organization.Then Mr. Trump defended the blockade again just hours after Mr. Tillerson had urged an end to it. \u201cThe time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding\u201d of terrorism, Mr. Trump said.His company filed paperwork to create eight inactive corporations in Saudi Arabia around that time, presumably contemplating a hotel or licensing deal in Jidda that has not come to fruition.In May, the rulers of the kingdom agreed to invest $20 billion in a fund to invest in American infrastructure, billed as part of an initiative Mr. Trump has championed. The $20 billion investment went to a fund set up by the money manager Blackstone, whose founder is close to Mr. Trump, his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner.Mr. Trump made his first deal in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, in 2005, to build a hotel with a state-owned developer. He pulled out after the 2008 recession, but by 2010 Mr. Trump and two of his children, Ms. Trump and Donald Jr., were back in the region scouting for new business.Mr. Trump agreed to manage a golf course as part of a development built by Damac, Mr. Sajwani\u2019s company. Mr. Trump hung billboards of Ms. Trump, a former model and executive for his company, all over the city to sell properties, and he pronounced it \u201cthe greatest golf community in Asia.\u201d In 2014, he agreed to manage a second course with Mr. Sajwani.As president-elect, Mr. Trump said he had declined. \u201cI did not have to turn it down,\u201d he said in January, noting that presidents are exempt from ethics laws barring such conflicts.Mr. Trump and Ms. Trump looked for deals in Doha, Qatar, too, and the Trump organization eventually opened shell corporations there. \u201cThe growth and development is visionary and outstanding\u201d in Doha, Ms. Trump told the Emirati publication Gulf News after a trip to Qatar in 2010 to solicit business.But the Trumps had less luck in Doha. Their only business with Qatar was leasing office space in Trump Tower, in Manhattan, to the national airway. The airline moved out before Mr. Trump became president.\u201cCould anyone have imagined that five or 10 years ago, when businessmen turned down a New York mogul and reality TV host auditioning for its investment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat they were jeopardizing the security of their country?\u201dAndrew W.

{"Headline": "F.B.I. Investigating Deals Involving Paul Manafort and Son-in-Law", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal investigators are examining financial transactions involving Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, who embarked on a series of real estate deals in recent years fueled by millions of dollars from Mr. Manafort, according to two people familiar with the matter.The transactions involve the financing of apartments and luxury homes in New York and California using money from Mr. Manafort, as well as from other investors solicited by the son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai, including the actor Dustin Hoffman and his son. F.B.I. agents have reviewed financial records related to Mr. Yohai, who has been accused in a lawsuit of defrauding investors, the sources said.It was not clear if the F.B.I.\u2019s interest was part of the broader investigation that has ensnared Mr. Manafort, who was President Trump\u2019s campaign chairman until he resigned last August amid reports that he had received millions of dollars in off-the-book payments for his consulting work in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort has been the focus of several inquiries looking into his business activities, failure to file foreign lobbying disclosures and possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia.Mr. Manafort has emerged as a key figure in the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia investigation, which has focused on interactions between Trump associates and Russians during and after last November\u2019s presidential election. In addition to his work for Ukraine\u2019s former president, an ally of the Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Manafort\u2019s long lobbying and consulting career has included numerous financial dealings with Russian oligarchs. One of his former employees has been investigated in Ukraine on suspicion of having ties to Russian intelligence.The revelation about investigators\u2019 interest in Mr. Yohai\u2019s activities comes amid indications that the scrutiny of Mr. Manafort has intensified. Besides the F.B.I. and congressional inquiries, the New York State attorney general\u2019s office has opened a preliminary inquiry \u201cfocused on certain real estate dealings\u201d involving Mr. Manafort, according to a third person with direct knowledge of the matter.Mr. Manafort declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Yohai did not respond to a request for comment.The Summerbreeze loan was part of a series of mortgages over the past year, totaling $20 million, secured by properties belonging to Mr. Manafort or his wife. Some of that money appears to have been used by Mr. Manafort to try to salvage his investments with Mr. Yohai. Court records show that Mr. Manafort and his wife invested at least $4 million in several California properties, part of a real estate business that one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s daughters described as a joint venture between her father and Mr. Yohai.The partnership was unexpected given Mr. Manafort\u2019s early opinion of his son-in-law, as described in text messages belonging to Andrea Manafort, one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s two daughters, which were hacked last year and posted on a website used by Ukrainian hackers. In the messages, Ms. Manafort said in 2013 that her father \u201cwholeheartedly opposes\u201d her sister Jessica\u2019s marriage to Mr. Yohai, whose financial problems had deeply concerned Mr. Manafort.Yet within two years, Mr. Yohai, who had a degree in journalism and became a real estate professional only in 2011, was forming shell companies to purchase luxury properties in the Hollywood Hills, worth tens of millions of dollars, which Mr. Manafort would put money into. Mr. Manafort was more than a passive investor; Jessica Manafort told her sister last year that Mr. Yohai had \u201ca contract that says dad and him are 50/50 business partners.\u201d\u201cHe flew out to California and helped Jeff completely reorganize and set up his business,\u201d wrote Jessica Manafort, who filed for divorce in March.While Mr. Yohai borrowed millions from banks and obtained money from investors, he also intimated he had access to large amounts of cash. In January 2016, he offered $7 million in cash for a mansion whose owner, a Russian businessman, was in debt to several associates from Russia who had liens on the house. Mr. Yohai put $160,000 down to secure the mansion deal, but by June 2016 had backed out of it and forfeited the deposit.A month later he appeared on a reality television show, \u201cMillion Dollar Listing,\u2019\u2019 and proposed buying three apartment units in New York City for $15 million in cash; the real estate agent said on the show that he had \u201cseen proof of funds.\u201d When a friend texted Andrea Manafort, asking if her sister and Mr. Yohai really had access to that kind of money, Ms. Manafort replied, \u201cOf course they don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHer hubby is running a Ponzi scheme,\u201d Ms. Manafort wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it.\u201dThat is what Mr. Yohai was accused of in a lawsuit filed in November by an investor in Mr. Yohai\u2019s real estate business. The suit asserted that Mr. Yohai employed a \u201cweb of dozens of limited liability companies\u201d to repay early investors with money from new investors to create the illusion of a \u201cquick and large return on their investments.\u201dA representative for the Hoffmans did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Yohai denied Mr. Aroch\u2019s accusations in a court filing, and said the lawsuit invoked Mr. Manafort\u2019s name \u201cin an improper effort to attract publicity.\u201d Mr. Yohai and Mr. Manafort have the same lawyer.\u201cThis allegation that I participated in fraud and criminal activity is obviously an extremely derogatory accusation that will harm my reputation,\u201d he said in the filing.Many of Mr. Manafort\u2019s real estate purchases over the years coincided with his long-running work as a political consultant to the Russia-backed Party of Regions in Ukraine. During his time there, Mr. Manafort used a network of shell companies in the tax havens of Cyprus and Belize to move money around and collect payments from clients, who, in addition to the Ukrainians, included Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with whom Mr. Manafort partnered in investments.Back in the United States, Mr. Manafort created still more shell companies to make cash purchases of expensive properties for millions of dollars and other investments. His Los Angeles investments were handled through a limited liability company called Baylor Holding, in which Mr. Manafort and Mr. Yohai were partners, according to court records.In a deposition related to Mr. Aroch\u2019s lawsuit, Mr. Yohai said his California real estate business operated under the name Marin West and was focused on buying and redeveloping luxury homes in exclusive neighborhoods around Hollywood. Although he was the sole owner of Marin West, Mr. Yohai seemed ignorant of important details, saying he was not sure when it was created or where it was incorporated, and was uncertain who wrote the content for its website. He speculated it could have been written by someone he described as \u201ckind of like the accountant for Marin West.\u201d\u201cI think he wrote this bio,\u201d Mr. Yohai said, referring to a description of himself that appeared on the site. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Puerto Rico\u2019s Debt Crisis, Worries Shift to Virgin Islands", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLOTTE AMALIE, V.I. \u2014 The United States Virgin Islands is best known for its powdery beaches and turquoise bays, a constant draw for the tourists who frequent this tiny American territory.Yet away from the beaches the mood is ominous, as government officials scramble to stave off the same kind of fiscal collapse that has already engulfed its neighbor Puerto Rico.Now, a combination of factors \u2014 insufficient tax revenue, a weak pension system, the loss of a major employer and a new reluctance in the markets to lend the Virgin Islands any more money \u2014 has made it almost impossible for the government to meet its obligations. In January, the Virgin Islands found itself unable to borrow and nearly out of funds for basic government operations.The sudden cash crunch was a warning sign that the financial troubles that brought Puerto Rico to its knees could soon spread. All of America\u2019s far-flung territories, among them American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, appear vulnerable.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can say it\u2019s a crisis, but they have challenges \u2014 high debt, weak economies and unfunded pensions,\u201d said Jim Millstein, whose firm, Millstein & Company, advised Puerto Rico on its economic affairs and debt restructuring until this year and has reviewed the situation in Guam and the Virgin Islands. He called the combination of challenges in the territories \u201ca recipe for trouble in the future.\u201dFor decades, these distant clusters of islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific have played critical roles as American listening posts, wartime staging grounds, practice bombing ranges and even re-entry points for astronauts splashing down in the Pacific.The military presence buoyed their small economies, and a federal tax subsidy made it relatively easy for them to issue bonds. Over the years, they have collectively borrowed billions of dollars to build roads, run schools, treat drinking water and fund hospitals.Now the G.A.O. auditors are back, re-examining the debt and repayment ability of each territory, amid concerns that other crushing debt burdens may have escaped notice. An agency spokesman, Fuller O. Griffith, said it would report by the end of the year on \u201cfederal options to avert the future indebtedness of territories.\u201d It is not clear what those options will be.\u201cWashington can\u2019t appropriately manage its relationship with the states, much less the territories,\u201d said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics.Even the states are not immune, despite their legal status as sovereigns. Illinois, stuck in political gridlock, is just days from entering its new fiscal year without a balanced budget, in violation of its own constitution. The ratings agencies warn that Illinois\u2019s bond rating is in peril of being downgraded to junk. Once that happens, as the territories show, hedge funds move in and economic management becomes a series of unpleasant choices.American Samoa, one of the smallest territories, lost one of the biggest engines of its economy in December when a big tuna cannery closed after being required to pay the federal minimum wage. Moody\u2019s Investors Service then put the territory\u2019s debt under negative outlook, citing its fragile economy.In the Northern Mariana Islands, the depleted public pension fund was wreaking such fiscal havoc in 2012 that the territory declared it bankrupt, but the case was thrown out. The government then tried cutting all retirees\u2019 pensions 25 percent, but the retirees have been fighting the cuts, and the fund is nearly exhausted anyway.Even Guam, which enjoys the economic benefit of several large American military installations, has been having qualms about its debt after Puerto Rico\u2019s default.\u201cPuerto Rico\u2019s troubles provide a teachable moment for Guam,\u201d said Benjamin Cruz, the speaker of the legislature, who recently helped defeat a proposal to borrow $75 million to pay tax refunds. \u201cSpending borrowed money is too easy.\u201dBut the debt dilemma is now most acute in the Virgin Islands \u2014 the three main islands are St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John \u2014 where the government has been struggling ever since a giant refinery closed in 2012, wiping out the territory\u2019s biggest nongovernment employer and a mainstay of its tax base.Its troubles began to snowball last July, when Puerto Rico defaulted on most of its debts.In August, Fitch downgraded the Virgin Islands\u2019 debt to junk, citing the territory\u2019s chronic budget deficits and habit of borrowing to plug the holes, like Puerto Rico.More downgrades followed, and in December, Standard & Poor\u2019s dealt the territory a rare \u201csuperdowngrade\u201d \u2014 seven notches in one fell swoop \u2014 leaving it squarely in the junk-bond realm. That scared away investors and forced it to cancel a planned bond offering in January.The failed bond deal meant there was not enough cash to pay for basic government operations in February or March. As a stopgap, the territory diverted its workers\u2019 pension contributions.The Virgin Islands\u2019 governor, Kenneth E. Mapp, said he had no intention of defaulting on any bonds.\u201cI didn\u2019t ask anybody for debt relief, so don\u2019t put me in the debt-relief boat,\u201d Mr. Mapp said in an interview at Government House, the ornate seat of the territorial government, perched on a hillside overlooking the lush palms and bougainvillea of the capital, Charlotte Amalie, on St. Thomas.Still, Mr. Mapp is contending with many of the same problems that proved too much for Puerto Rico, driving it in May to seek bankruptcylike protection under a new law for insolvent territories, known as Promesa. Puerto Rico is now embroiled in heated negotiations over how to reduce its roughly $123 billion in debts and unfunded pensions.When Congress drafted the Promesa law last year, it made it possible for the other American territories to seek the same kind of help.Now, even though the Virgin Islands maintains it has no intention of defaulting on its debts \u2014 and has even given creditors new protections \u2014 the mere prospect of bankruptcy has spooked the markets, putting borrowed money beyond the territory\u2019s reach and greatly limiting its options.In something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, by giving territories the option to declare bankruptcy, Congress seems to have made such an outcome more likely.\u201cThat innocuous provision, when sent to the bond market, said, \u2018Here\u2019s an escape valve for your debt obligations,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mapp said. \u201cThat changed the whole paradigm.\u201dThe problem is that in Puerto Rico, Promesa is turning out to shred the many legal mechanisms that governmental borrowers use to make their debts secure. These include liens and allowing creditors access to the courts.\u201cUnder Promesa, all the security structures are dissolving,\u201d Mr. Fabian said.Investors who thought they were secured creditors before now find themselves holding moral obligation pledges, which are not enforceable.After the Virgin Islands\u2019 bond offer fell through in January, the fuel supplier to its electric authority stopped shipments, saying it had not been paid; the authority was already in court with its previous fuel supplier, which had not been paid either.Then came the House of Representatives\u2019 plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Mapp saw the federal money that the Virgin Islands relies on for its public hospitals going up in smoke.Mr. Mapp scrambled. He reactivated a five-year economic plan that had been languishing and pushed higher taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and soft drinks through the legislature. He fought for a permanent electric rate increase. He got $18 million in new federal funds for health care. He struck a deal to tax Airbnb rentals.He hired collection agents to go after delinquent property and income taxes. He scheduled auctions for delinquent properties. He hired a team to work on the pension system, which is in severe distress, with only about six years\u2019 worth of assets left.Until recently, the pension system was chasing high returns by investing in high-risk assets, like a $50 million placement in life viaticals \u2014 an insurance play that is, in effect, a bet that a selected group of elderly people will die soon. It also made loans to an insolvent inter-island airline, a resort that went bankrupt, and a major franchisee of KFC restaurants. The territory\u2019s inspector general has declared the loans illegal.Mr. Mapp said he hoped to start restructuring the pension system in the fall. Already, he said, the government had stopped diverting the workers\u2019 pension contributions, as residents began filing their tax returns and payments in April. The tax payments eased the immediate liquidity crisis.Recently, he met with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, to discuss possible incentives to attract tech business to the Virgin Islands. And he hopes to return to the capital markets.\u201cThe fact that we didn\u2019t complete the sale in January gives the impression that our market access is constrained,\u201d said Valdamier O. Collens, the territorial finance commissioner.Investors have nothing to worry about, the governor said. For decades, the Virgin Islands has used a lockbox arrangement that makes default all but impossible.Merchants collect sales taxes and send the money to a trustee for the bondholders. Not a cent goes to the territorial government, including the pension fund, until the bond trustee gets enough to make all scheduled bond payments for the coming year.\u201cWe have no access to the moneys before the bondholders are paid,\u201d Mr. Mapp said. \u201cThese moneys are taken out of the pie before the pie is even in the oven. Our debt has never been in jeopardy.\u201dBut in Puerto Rico, such lockbox arrangements have turned out to be one of the thorniest disputes of the bankruptcy proceedings. And Mr. Collens, the finance commissioner, is all too aware that the same dynamic could upend the Virgin Islands, too.\u201cWe know that there has been a contagion effect with Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Collens said. \u201cThe market saw that by the stroke of a pen, Congress could create a Promesa for the rest of the territories.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The order prohibits new federal government officials who have worked as a lobbyist or an industry lawyer in the previous two years from handling matters they were involved with on behalf of their former clients.

{"Headline": "A New History Recalibrates the Villains of the Russian Revolution", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.On the afternoon of July 4, 1917, thousands of soldiers, sailors and workers converged on a former royal palace, a sprawling Palladian structure in the Russian capital, then called Petrograd. The palace was serving as the seat of the Petrograd Soviet \u2014 or council \u2014 of workers\u2019 and soldiers\u2019 deputies, a group of mostly radical revolutionaries that was sharing power with the country\u2019s provisional government. Four months had passed since the so-called February Revolution forced Czar Nicholas II from the throne, and the democratic socialists and liberals who had taken control were locked in a mounting power struggle marked by shifting alliances, palace intrigues and occasional street fighting. Denouncing them as bourgeois \u201cminister-capitalists,\u201d the mobs now demanded that the Soviet take full command of the country.The protesters were acting on the orders of the small but militant Bolshevik wing of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Party, which had been busy propagandizing military units and factory workers. Although the Bolsheviks had called for a peaceful demonstration, their real plan was to seize power in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. With gangs in armored cars and trucks roaming the city, they were already in de facto control. Vladimir Lenin was inside the palace waiting to proclaim a new government. When a leading minister stepped outside to calm the crowd, a worker raised a fist to his face, shouting, \u201cTake power, you S.O.B., when they give it to you!\u201d Others seized him and dragged him into a car. But the Bolshevik plan soon fizzled.Whether due more to a loss of nerve than bad planning, the mobs dissipated and the Bolshevik leaders were arrested. With evidence that they were being lavishly financed by Russia\u2019s wartime enemy Germany, the provisional government prepared to dispatch the traitorous radicals. \u201cNow they are going to shoot us,\u201d Lenin warned his co-conspirator Leon Trotsky before shaving his beard and fleeing to Finland. He would not be seen again in public until the Bolsheviks staged a second coup attempt nearly four months later, this time resulting in the cataclysmic October Revolution, which, according to Sean McMeekin\u2019s estimates, ultimately caused 25 million deaths, radically transformed Russian society and polarized global politics for more than half a century.Striking as the Bolshevik reversal was in July 1917, the provisional government\u2019s response to the failed coup was even more stunning. Even with public and political sentiment turning against the Bolsheviks, Alexander Kerensky \u2014 the ambitious 36-year-old lawyer who had emerged as the government\u2019s leader \u2014 dropped treason charges against them, freed their leaders and even allowed them to rearm. The next time they saw an opportunity, the Bolsheviks wouldn\u2019t pass it up. During the successful coup of Oct. 25, the Red Guards arrested the ministers of Kerensky\u2019s liberal government and seized control. What could Kerensky have been thinking?That\u2019s one of the chief questions posed by McMeekin, the latest historian to tread the well-worn path of revolution scholarship in a new book published to coincide with the event\u2019s centenary this year. A professor at Bard College, McMeekin argues that one of the seminal events of modern history was largely a matter of chance. Well-written, with new details from archival research used for vivid descriptions of key events, \u201cThe Russian Revolution\u201d comes nearly three decades after Richard Pipes\u2019s masterpiece of the same name.Pipes\u2019s monumental work rejected the traditional view of the revolution as somehow the result of social movements from below, characterizing the outcome instead as a coup by \u201cidentifiable men pursuing their own advantages.\u201d McMeekin takes that line further. For Pipes, the revolution reflected the gradual breakdown of Russia\u2019s distinct autocracy, shaped by a centuries-old tradition of collectivism and patrimonial rule, but McMeekin disputes Pipes\u2019s arguments, seeing virtually no difference between the Russian empire and its European rivals. Significantly shorter than Pipes\u2019s study, or Orlando Figes\u2019s worthy \u201cA People\u2019s Tragedy\u201d (1998), McMeekin\u2019s history follows the main events and players, though without much of Pipes\u2019s sweeping context and analysis of Russian and European history.Far from the hopeless backwater depicted in most histories, McMeekin argues, Russia\u2019s economy was surging before the war, with a growth rate of 10 percent a year \u2014 like China in the early 21st century. \u201cThe salient fact about Russia in 1917,\u201d he writes, \u201cis that it was a country at war,\u201d yet he adds that the Russian military acquitted itself well on the battlefield after terrible setbacks in 1915, with morale high in early 1917. \u201cKnowing how the story of the czars turns out, many historians have suggested that the Russian colossus must always have had feet of clay,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut surely this is hindsight. Despite growing pains, uneven economic development and stirrings of revolutionary fervor, imperial Russia in 1900 was a going concern, its very size and power a source of pride to most if not all of the czar\u2019s subjects.\u201dNicholas II \u2014 rightly characterized as an incompetent reactionary in most histories \u2014 is partly rehabilitated here. His fundamental mistake, McMeekin says, was to trust his liberal advisers, who urged him to go to war, then conspired to remove him from power after protests over bread rations led to a military mutiny. Even the royal family\u2019s trusted faith healer Rasputin, the ogre of conventional wisdom, largely gets a pass for sagely advising the czar that war would prompt his downfall.Although McMeekin agrees the real villains are the ruthless Bolsheviks, he reserves most criticism for the hapless liberals. Leaving Kerensky\u2019s motivations during the July events largely unexplained, he only hints at the common rationale for Kerensky\u2019s refusal to prosecute the Bolsheviks: Deeply unpopular among the liberals, he needed the leftists on his side, believing the greater threat to his government came from right-wing leaders aiming to restore Nicholas to the throne. The Bolsheviks, meanwhile, cunningly pursued Lenin\u2019s master plan to \u201cturn the armies red,\u201d encouraging mutinies and desertions with their promise to end the war and redistribute land. \u201cIn view of Kerensky\u2019s impotence, the only really surprising thing about the course of events is how long it took the Bolsheviks to act,\u201d McMeekin writes.Having taken power, the Bolsheviks turned on the unwitting soldiers and peasants who were among their most fervent supporters, unleashing a violent terror campaign that appropriated land and grain, and that turned into a permanent class war targeting ever-larger categories of \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d Unconcerned about Russia\u2019s ultimate fate, they were pursuing their greater goal of world revolution.McMeekin depends on a surprisingly narrow focus to make his overarching argument, eschewing analysis of the deeper social and political forces required for any comprehensive study of the revolution and its lessons for us today \u2014 when radical political groups are again relying on subterfuge and populism to force a fundamental change of the world order. Yes, Russia was rapidly reforming at the turn of the century while its economy was growing \u2014 and revolution was far from inevitable. But there were reasons the empire had so much catching up to do, which involved uniquely Russian characteristics like its sprawling landmass, terrible climate and poor soil. These made scratching out a living difficult, and governing unwieldy. The symbolic role of the boss \u2014 whether in the form of a village elder or the czar \u2014 provided crucial stability for a society in which most saw individual freedoms as a threat to group survival.Of the three-quarters of the population classified as peasants by a government census in 1897, the vast majority were illiterate \u2014 very conservative people with a long tradition of highly centralized rule for whom drastic change mainly in the urban centers was deeply destabilizing. McMeekin leaves no doubt that chance certainly played a significant role in the Bolsheviks\u2019 ascent, but it was no mere coincidence that following the revolution\u2019s dramatic destruction of the ruling elite, the Bolsheviks\u2019 extreme centralization succeeded in re-establishing Russia\u2019s traditional political culture by the 1930s.That pattern repeated itself six decades later. After the Soviet collapse in 1991 ushered in 10 years of destabilizing westernizing reform, another autocratic leader who took power by chance succeeded in consolidating it by returning the country to its longstanding political roots. A hundred years after the revolution, Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia still faces many of the same fundamental problems: rigid authoritarianism, widespread poverty and deeply rooted corruption. Little wonder the Kremlin has been at pains to play down celebration of the revolution\u2019s centenary this year.What are the lessons of this history a century on? McMeekin points to what he calls a resurgence of Marxist-style philosophy, warning readers to be wary of \u201copenly avowed socialists\u201d like Bernie Sanders \u2014 as if right-wing ideologies played no part in the 20th century\u2019s convulsions. This is an especially bizarre conclusion when mounting nationalism and a global shift to the right are threatening the postwar liberal order today. With Putin and Donald Trump again exploiting popular insecurities, the Russian Revolution\u2019s real lesson must surely be that however unlikely their rise, populist tyrants ultimately succeed when rapid social change, even in times of relative peace and prosperity, alienates the masses enough to rebel against their ruling elites.Gregory Feifer is the author of \u201cRussians: The People Behind the Power.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Projected Drop in Medicaid Spending Heightens Hurdle for G.O.P. Health Bill", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe budget office analysis created a fresh challenge for Republican leaders as they tried to muster support for their bill, even as senators scattered to their home states for a 10-day July 4 recess. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, entertained a stream of senators on Thursday, trying to reach agreement on the contents of a revised bill.But by the end of Thursday, Mr. McConnell\u2019s caucus still appeared far from a consensus, and it was unclear when a new version of the bill would be ready.The nonpartisan budget office had already said that the bill would cut projected Medicaid spending 26 percent in 2026. \u201cA large gap would grow between Medicaid spending under current law and under this bill,\u201d the new report said, and that gap would widen, so that federal Medicaid spending in 2036 would be more than a third lower under the bill than under the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThat is going to cause a lot of harm, and that\u2019s one of my biggest concerns about the bill,\u201d Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a crucial holdout on the bill, told CNN after the release.For Republican leaders who say Medicaid spending is unsustainable, the findings might be seen as evidence that their policies would work. They want to put annual caps on Medicaid spending and roll back the expansion of the program, which has extended coverage to millions of people in 31 states.But for Republican senators from some of those states, including Nevada, Ohio and West Virginia, the pain of those cuts may prove politically untenable.Hoping to revive their repeal bill, Senate Republicans said on Thursday that they were seriously considering proposals to keep one of the law\u2019s taxes on high-income people while providing more money to combat the opioid epidemic and a new incentive for people to establish tax-free savings accounts for medical expenses. Ms. Collins said Republican leaders and Trump administration officials had agreed to $45 billion for an opioid treatment fund.Republicans also said they were considering a proposal that would allow insurers to sell cheaper, less comprehensive health plans if they also offered at least one plan that complied with consumer protection standards like those in the Affordable Care Act.The talk of leaving in place a tax on investment income was a big break from the House-passed health bill and from the Senate\u2019s approach.\u201cIt\u2019s not equitable to have a situation where you\u2019re increasing the burden on lower-income citizens and lessening the burden on wealthy citizens,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cThat\u2019s not a proposition that is sustainable, and I think leadership knows that.\u201dBut for every concession made to one senator, another senator seemed to balk.\u201cWe pledged that we would repeal Obamacare. I don\u2019t remember anybody going around saying, \u2018Oh, except for these job-killing tax increases,\u2019\u201d Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said of the talk of leaving the investment tax increase in place. \u201cSo I expect that we\u2019ll be repealing all of the taxes in Obamacare.\u201dThe negotiations themselves are attracting controversy, and personal strains are showing.Democrats are also angry. For seven years, Republicans have denounced what they call corrupt deals made by Senate Democrats to buy votes for passage of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care bill.The frantic wheeling and dealing among Republican senators on Thursday had more than a faint resemblance to the negotiations that led to adoption of the health care law in 2010.\u201cThe slush fund is open,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, referring to about $200 billion that could be available for deals in the Senate repeal bill. \u201cApplicants can queue up and have a good chance of being treated favorably if they are from the right political party.\u201dRepublicans were talking publicly on Thursday about keeping a tax on capital gains and other investment income, imposed by the Affordable Care Act on individuals with annual incomes exceeding $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000.Mr. McConnell\u2019s bill would repeal that tax, like most other taxes in Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. The Congressional Budget Office said that repealing the investment tax, retroactive to the start of this year, would cost the government $172 billion in lost revenue from 2017 to 2026.Ms. Collins said, \u201cI do not see a justification for doing away with the 3.8 percent tax\u201d on certain investment income. She said the investment tax differed from other taxes in the Affordable Care Act, like an excise tax on medical devices, because those taxes can increase costs for consumers. \u201cI distinguish between those tax increases that were part of Obamacare that increase premiums and the cost of health care versus those that don\u2019t,\u201d she said.The money for drug abuse treatment \u2014 $45 billion over 10 years \u2014 was meant to woo wavering Republicans from states hard hit by the opioid epidemic, including Mr. Portman and Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.But Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire, another state hit by the opioid crisis, said the additional money was \u201ca drop in the bucket that would not come close to making up for the damage\u201d that could be done by the bill\u2019s cuts in Medicaid.The Congressional Budget Office said that over 10 years, Mr. McConnell\u2019s bill would cut more than $770 billion from projected spending under Medicaid, a program that pays for a large share of substance abuse treatment and prevention costs in many states.Another proposal, championed by some conservatives, would allow people to use money in health savings accounts to pay premiums for insurance policies, not just medical expenses.Christopher E. Condeluci, a former tax and benefits counsel at the Senate Finance Committee, said the change would make health savings accounts more attractive to people who could afford to put money into them. Such savings accounts have become more important, he said, as more Americans have high-deductible health plans, which require them to pay a larger share of their medical costs.Senate Republicans are also considering a plan from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, intended to create lower-cost insurance options. Under the proposal, if an insurer offered at least one plan that met certain federal requirements, offering benefits like maternity care and mental health services, it could also sell insurance policies that did not meet those standards.Mr. Cruz says the proposal would allow consumers to buy policies they desire and can afford. But insurance experts see a risk that healthy people might sign up for the low-cost, less comprehensive policies, leaving sicker people in the more expensive plans. Republicans said there were ways to minimize that risk.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Santander Rescues Troubled Rival in Test of Europe\u2019s New Rules", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the global financial crisis, Europe built a system designed to contain the collateral damage from failing banks. That new system appeared to pass its first test on Wednesday, as authorities efficiently dispatched a troubled Spanish lender.The relative lack of drama after the failure of Banco Popular, Spain\u2019s fifth-biggest bank, highlighted the large strides made by the eurozone compared with a few years ago, when the problems of even small lenders had the potential to rock financial markets and raise existential questions about European unity.Bank stocks rose in Europe after authorities in Frankfurt and Brussels declared that Banco Popular was essentially a lost cause and sold it to Banco Santander, Spain\u2019s largest bank. The swift action by European Central Bank and European Union officials defied critics who said a system for winding down sick banks, put into place at the end of 2014, was too unwieldy to deal with a fast-moving crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s very positive for establishing the new banking policy framework,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cIt will demonstrate to a number of people that the framework is working better than many doubters expected.\u201dThe rescue is the first in which the European Central Bank has determined that a eurozone lender has failed or is about to fail. The central bank assumed authority over eurozone banks in 2014 as part of changes intended to prevent banking crises like that of 2008.But the failure of Banco Popular, felled by its exposure to toxic mortgages left over from a housing boom, was nevertheless a reminder that, nearly a decade after the financial crisis, the eurozone\u2019s banking system remains vulnerable.Many banks in Italy, Germany and elsewhere in the 19-country euro area suffer from piles of bad loans, thin capital cushions and meager profits. The woes of banks continue to weigh on economic growth in the bloc.For Monte dei Paschi to qualify for government aid, the European Central Bank must determine that it is solvent. But by some measures, the Italian lender is in worse shape than Banco Popular. Monte dei Paschi fared significantly worse than the Spanish lender in assessments of bank health last year. The central bank could be accused of playing favorites if it clears the way for Monte dei Paschi to receive a taxpayer rescue.The path of the two banks also serves to illustrate the diverging economic fates of Spain and Italy.Spain, one of the countries hardest hit by the eurozone debt crisis in 2010, has since cleaned up many of its domestic banks \u2014 though clearly not Banco Popular \u2014 and taken politically unpopular steps to improve the functioning of the economy, like making it easier for companies to fire unwanted workers. Spanish unemployment is dropping from catastrophic levels and growth is among the fastest in the eurozone.By contrast, Italy is only beginning to institute such reforms, the economy is barely growing, and many Italian banks remain fragile. The government in Rome has not been willing to risk letting a big bank fail and perhaps creating a broad market panic.Italian authorities also feared the political ramifications if Monte dei Paschi collapsed. Without government aid, the bank would be forced to impose losses on thousands of middle-class savers who bought the bank\u2019s bonds. There is fear the public backlash would benefit populist parties and add to political turmoil in the country.In Spain, the government signaled it did not want taxpayers to rescue Banco Popular, even though investors would bear some of the pain.If, as is likely, the European Central Bank allows the rescue of Monte dei Paschi to proceed, it can argue the situation is different than in Spain. By requesting approval to provide capital to Monte dei Paschi, the government triggered different procedures than apply to Banco Popular.Still, Mr. V\u00e9ron of Bruegel predicted that Banco Popular\u2019s collapse would prompt lawsuits by people who own its bonds and are losing their money.The Spanish bank\u2019s problems stem from the large mortgage portfolio it built up during the country\u2019s housing boom. When the European banking crisis struck in 2012, several lenders had to take emergency action, and Banco Popular opted to raise capital multiple times over the next four years.But its mortgage problems mounted, and it reported an annual loss of \u20ac3.5 billion in 2016. In February, it hired a new chairman, Emilio Saracho, to help lead a turnaround.Mr. Saracho set about selling nonstrategic assets and began looking for new ways to raise financing, before announcing in April that his bank might instead seek a merger. He eventually hired outside bankers to organize an auction, but Banco Popular said last week that it had failed to receive any formal offers.Shares of Banco Popular had dropped by more than half in the past week over concerns that the bank would need additional capital as it struggled under the weight of billions of euros in bad real estate loans.Officials at the European Central Bank, which is responsible for supervising eurozone banks, had been closely monitoring Banco Popular. By Tuesday, as it became clear that the bank could no longer borrow money from other banks and was running out of cash, the European Central Bank had determined that the lender was \u201cfailing or likely to fail.\u201d\u201cThe significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due,\u201d the central bank said.Responsibility for winding down Banco Popular then passed to the Single Resolution Board in Brussels, which sold the bank to Santander. The multilayered system had been criticized as too cumbersome, but functioned in this case.The combined business of Banco Popular and Santander will be led by the current management team of Santander Spain with Rami Aboukhair as chief executive, Santander said.Still, while the acquisition averts a banking crisis, it also increases Santander\u2019s dominance of the Spanish banking market and reduces competition, which could eventually be bad for customers.The takeover of Banco Popular comes five years after the near-collapse of a giant Spanish mortgage lender, Bankia. That forced the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to negotiate a huge European banking bailout. In the end, Spain needed \u20ac41 billion of bailout money.Chad Bray reported from London, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt. Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mother\u2019s Death, a Botched Inquiry and a Sheriff at War", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "The sheriff called it a suicide. When a state investigator raised questions, he became the investigated.Supported byST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. \u2014 Rusty Rodgers did not fit everyone\u2019s image of a law enforcement officer, particularly in deeply conservative northeast Florida. One police chief, well ensconced in the local power structure, expressed irritation over what he called the officer\u2019s \u201cJimmy Buffett look\u201d \u2014 long hair, beard, loafers and no socks.No one, however, questioned Agent Rodgers\u2019s tenacity as an investigator.Later, Agent Rodgers joined the state\u2019s elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where he quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors \u2014 and a meeting with the governor \u2014 for helping dismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East. For the governor, he made a concession: He cut his hair.Then, in January 2011, came the call that would upend his life.Go to St. Augustine, he was told, to reinvestigate the death of 24-year-old Michelle O\u2019Connell, shot while packing to leave her deputy sheriff boyfriend, Jeremy Banks. The fatal bullet came from his service weapon.Agent Rodgers had been summoned here twice before to answer questions about cases involving the St. Johns County sheriff, David B. Shoar \u2014 examining whether his officers had drawn their guns and used pepper spray to break up a peaceful graduation party in an African-American neighborhood (they had), and whether a political supporter of the sheriff had engaged in improper conduct with minors (he hadn\u2019t).This time, the stakes were higher. There was a dead body \u2014 a single mother of a 4-year-old girl \u2014 and the sheriff\u2019s office had chosen to investigate its own deputy, poorly as it turned out. Because detectives quickly concluded that Ms. O\u2019Connell had taken her own life, they had done little investigating.Now, with crucial evidence missing or unexamined, Agent Rodgers had to make sense of the mess. And that meant possibly antagonizing one of Florida\u2019s most powerful sheriffs. A mercurial leader, unctuous one moment, bitingly critical the next, Sheriff Shoar didn\u2019t countenance challenges to his authority. He had resisted the O\u2019Connell family\u2019s demands for an outside review of the case for nearly five months.When the sheriff finally agreed, his office had one requirement \u2014 that Agent Rodgers, and only Agent Rodgers, conduct the investigation, according to Steve Donaway, a former supervisor with the state investigative agency. (The sheriff disputes that.)It took the agent only two weeks to find evidence that fundamentally changed the complexion of the case. Two neighbors told him that they had heard cries for help on the night of the shooting, prompting the medical examiner to change his ruling from suicide to \u201cshot by another.\u201d As the investigation moved toward homicide, the local state attorney suddenly recused himself, prompting the governor to appoint a special prosecutor.But the medical examiner changed his mind yet again, and the special prosecutor, citing insufficient evidence, closed the case without bringing charges. And for a year, that\u2019s where the case stood \u2014 closed if not forgotten.My record request was routine, but Sheriff Shoar didn\u2019t view it that way. In his world, an out-of-town reporter \u201cpoking around\u201d a closed case \u201ckind of stunk,\u201d he said, and he alerted prosecutors so they wouldn\u2019t be caught off guard. But when the sheriff learned that I had already asked Agent Rodgers\u2019s supervisor for an interview, and that he had not been notified, the sheriff erupted, suspecting, incorrectly, that the agency was behind my visit.\u201cI realized I\u2019m dealing with a whole different set of facts, quite truthfully malice and wickedness,\u201d he told state officials. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 33 years. I know how to deal with bullies.\u201dHis answer was a scathingly personal yearslong attack on Agent Rodgers \u2014 a campaign that put the outsize powers of a small-town sheriff on full display and ultimately swept up nearly everyone in its path.The sheriff commissioned his own investigation of the investigator, accusing him of serious crimes that, he said, had nearly caused an innocent man \u2014 his officer \u2014 to be charged with murder. He embedded his accusations in the public consciousness through a cascade of press releases, phone calls, letters, interviews and online posts. He sent his findings to state law enforcement officials and the F.B.I. As a result, Agent Rodgers\u2019s own employer and later a special prosecutor began investigating him. He was placed on administrative leave, forced to surrender his badge and gun, barred by his agency from publicly defending himself.In April, I returned to St. Augustine to report on this second act of a drama that, over seven years now, has sown deep scars in this community by the sea. It has divided the law enforcement establishment, not to mention the family of Michelle O\u2019Connell. It has been reviewed by one state attorney, three special prosecutors and four medical examiners, and is debated still in the local press, on the beaches and in the bars. It has, in short, become the stuff of Florida noir, featured in a documentary on Netflix, in People magazine and on television shows like \u201cDr. Phil.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d said Dr. Frederick Hobin, who performed the original autopsy.On this trip, I approached several of the central players who had declined to be interviewed before. I had new questions, based on my review of thousands of documents not available when I first reported on the case.Sheriff Shoar had promised to spend the rest of his career holding Agent Rodgers accountable. But what I came to learn was that the sheriff had tried to destroy the investigator with accusations that were often nothing more than innuendo and unverified rumors. Even so, they went virtually unchallenged for years.In the end, the sheriff did not achieve his goal of seeing Agent Rodgers sent to prison, charged with a crime or even fired from his job. But he did accomplish something else: He diverted attention away from his office\u2019s own botched investigation, the spawning ground for so much of the anger and conflict that followed.It is an hour\u2019s drive down Interstate 95 from the Jacksonville airport to St. Augustine, which promotes itself as America\u2019s oldest city, where Ponce de Le\u00f3n mythically searched for the Fountain of Youth.St. Augustine forms the core of a very red county that in 2016 voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump and for Sheriff Shoar, re-electing him to a fourth term with 85 percent of the vote.The sheriff\u2019s persona plays well on this political stage. Speaking to a Christian prayer group in 2015, he railed against gun control, separation of church and state and especially Washington. America\u2019s problems began, he said, when the government \u201ctried to outlaw our faith.\u201d He blamed the media for \u201cburning down Ferguson\u201d and spreading the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that police officers are bad people who must be watched with body cameras. Along the way, he sprinkled in a little Shakespeare on the brevity of life.Sheriff Shoar, who declined to speak for this article, draws support from an important Florida constituency: law enforcement and the military. He is a former member of the Florida National Guard and a past president of the Florida Sheriffs Association, where he recently welcomed his newly elected brethren with an ethics lecture titled \u201cKeeping the Tarnish Off the Badge.\u201dThe state enforcement agency, known locally as F.D.L.E., \u201chas always bent over backwards for sheriffs,\u201d said Mr. Donaway, who supervised Agent Rodgers and his investigative colleagues in 13 counties. \u201cThe sheriffs association is politically very powerful.\u201dSheriff Shoar began his rise to power as a patrolman for the St. Augustine police, eventually becoming chief. His personnel file from that era includes extensive praise, but also a hint of problems.\u201cOne area he could improve is to slow down and get all the facts prior to making decisions,\u201d his supervisor wrote in October 1999. In an earlier personnel review, the supervisor had written that \u201ctoo many projects at once cause a loss of focus.\u201dThe sheriff does not suffer from a lack of self-regard. He once told law enforcement officers that they might want an \u201c8-by-10 photograph\u201d of him after reading his \u201cbeautiful\u201d letter to The New York Times \u2014 he copied 31 public figures and members of the media \u2014 saying the paper\u2019s reporting on the shooting lacked objectivity. The Times was still eight months away from publishing its first article on the case.His power is nourished by his gift for extemporaneous, often humorous, oratory, not to mention his position as one of the county\u2019s largest employers. He has the means to reward people he favors. One month after his agency\u2019s flawed investigation of the O\u2019Connell shooting, he surprised employees by handing out $1,000 bonuses. He later promoted the officers who investigated Agent Rodgers \u2014 \u201cmy brightest guys,\u201d he called them.And he hired as a deputy the 20-year-old son of the special prosecutor who had declined to charge Deputy Banks. The prosecutor, Brad King, listed the sheriff as his first character reference in an unsuccessful attempt last year to join the Florida Supreme Court. (Mr. King said that he did not know the sheriff during the O\u2019Connell case and that his son was highly qualified for the job.)\u201cHe really fancies himself as a kingmaker,\u201d said Michael Gold, the sheriff\u2019s first campaign manager, who broke with him years ago and publishes an online news report. After he criticized the handling of the O\u2019Connell case, Mr. Gold said, the sheriff refused to renew his press credentials. He was never given a reason.\u201cHe demands absolute authority and does not like to be questioned by anyone,\u201d Mr. Gold said.Nancy Shaver, a political neophyte who unseated a Shoar supporter as mayor of St. Augustine in 2014, wrote a letter to the local paper asking the United States attorney to review the O\u2019Connell case. When she ran for re-election two years later, Sheriff Shoar backed her opponent, the owner of a conservative radio station. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever,\u201d the sheriff proclaimed, \u201cto have elected leaders who stand with our police officers.\u201dMs. Shaver said it was the first time the sheriff had injected himself into the nonpartisan mayoral race. She won anyhow.At 11:20 on the night of Sept. 2, 2010, Deputy Banks called 911 to report that his girlfriend had shot herself: \u201cI\u2019m Deputy Banks with the St. Johns County Sheriff\u2019s Office. I work with y\u2019all. Get someone here now.\u201d The sheriff\u2019s officers found him holding Ms. O\u2019Connell as she lay on the floor with a gunshot to the mouth.According to the deputy, Ms. O\u2019Connell was packing to move out after breaking up with him when he heard a shot while he was sitting in the garage. He rushed to another part of the house, he said, smashed through a locked door and found her on the ground.Two inexperienced detectives hastily decided that Ms. O\u2019Connell had taken her own life, even though the crime scene offered a muddled picture. How could a woman unfamiliar with guns withdraw her boyfriend\u2019s weapon from a retention holster? Why was a second bullet buried in the carpet several inches from her body? Why did she have a bleeding cut above her eye?After months of questions and complaints from the O\u2019Connell family, Agent Rodgers was dispatched to re-examine the shooting.The investigator, now 60, has never shied from difficult assignments.\u201cThere are two types of people in law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Donaway, the former F.D.L.E. supervisor, said in an interview. \u201cFor one group, it\u2019s a job \u2014 good people \u2014 but it\u2019s their job. They feed their family and look at retirement.\u201d Agent Rodgers, he said, was in a different class \u2014 officers who, \u201cwhen they see evil, and the bad things that happen to people,\u201d are driven to do something about it. He had investigated cold-case killings, child pornography, police shootings and an officer suspected of serial rapes.What made this case especially delicate was that Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s brother and mother worked for the sheriff, while Agent Rodgers\u2019s immediate superior was married to a senior official in the sheriff\u2019s office.The agent\u2019s first task was easy \u2014 identify holes in the sheriff\u2019s investigation. He gave his findings to the sheriff\u2019s second-in-command, Joel Bolante, who considered him a friend from when they worked a vice case years before. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any problems with Rusty,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew he was pretty thorough with that kind of work.\u201dWith no witnesses or suicide note in hand, Sheriff Shoar\u2019s officers should have interviewed Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s family to assess her mental state, but did not. They also failed to canvass the neighborhood, send evidence to the lab, download cellphone data, collect all relevant clothing and properly interview the boyfriend. \u201cEvidence that could have been collected, to either prove or disprove what happened that night, had been lost forever because of their incompetence,\u201d Mr. Donaway said. Unfairly or not, suspicion fell on Deputy Banks. And the O\u2019Connell family lost the chance to achieve closure.Then, two weeks in, Agent Rodgers made his surprise discovery \u2014 the two neighbors who said they had heard screams for help before each gunshot. Still, many questions remained unresolved, and on the advice of the state attorney, the agent hired a respected crime scene reconstructionist, Jerry Findley. In April 2011, Mr. Findley rendered his conclusion: The evidence was more consistent with homicide than with suicide.If Mr. Findley\u2019s findings did not sway the medical examiner, Dr. Hobin, the neighbors\u2019 testimony did. In June, he changed his finding from suicide to \u201cshot by another.\u201dSoon after, another influential figure joined the discussion \u2014 a newly appointed medical examiner, Dr. Predrag Bulic. Although the O\u2019Connell case was not his, Dr. Bulic assumed control. He produced no report but concluded that Ms. O\u2019Connell had taken her own life. Eventually, Dr. Hobin came to agree.Both cited the lack of defensive wounds, though there was a new injury above Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s eye. Dr. Bulic theorized that she had turned the gun upside down and shot herself, causing the outer edge of the gun\u2019s tactical light to cut her skin as it was fired.Later, the special prosecutor would latch on to Dr. Bulic\u2019s theory, saying the light recoiled \u201cforward\u201d rather than backward, causing the injury. Forensic experts I interviewed dismissed that as ludicrous.Dr. Bulic had also incorrectly measured the gun \u2014 by a lot \u2014 rendering his explanation even more implausible.Using an unloaded gun, Dr. Bulic demonstrated his theory at a meeting called by the state attorney. Mr. Donaway, one of several F.D.L.E. agents in attendance, recalled that, before sitting down, Dr. Bulic said words to the effect that \u201cI had a number of meetings with Sheriff Shoar about this case, but I want you to know it did not influence my decision.\u201dThe agents were stunned. The meeting went downhill from there, F.D.L.E. records show. Mark Brutnell, Agent Rodgers\u2019s immediate supervisor, said that as law enforcement officials \u201ckept firing questions,\u201d Dr. Bulic repeatedly changed his account of how Ms. O\u2019Connell had held the gun.The medical examiner, who denies discussing the case with Sheriff Shoar, gave them another reason to worry. \u201cAfter he\u2019s fumbling and bumbling, he makes the statement, \u2018And I can rule undetermined if you want,\u2019\u201d said Dominick Pape, who ran the agency\u2019s Jacksonville office. At that meeting, he said, he became convinced that Dr. Bulic \u201cdid not have a clue how she could have committed suicide with that weapon.\u201dAt one point, prosecutors considered exhuming Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s body. But \u201cBulic did a cursory review of what Hobin did, and he said there is no need to pull the body out of the ground,\u201d Agent Brutnell recalled. \u201cThat is a game-changer. It stopped the investigation.\u201dThe state attorney, R. J. Larizza, suddenly recused himself, citing his friendship with the sheriff. He refused to elaborate when I asked why that had not been a concern from the outset.With the case now in the lap of the special prosecutor, Mr. King, yet another medical examiner was called in \u2014 Dr. Steven Cogswell. He endorsed the upside-down gun theory, though he produced no report and could not remember details when I interviewed him in 2013.Mr. King also discounted Mr. Findley\u2019s conclusion of homicide, saying the analyst admitted that he had not considered the upside-down gun theory.Mr. Findley disputes that claim. It was considered, he said, but quickly rejected as implausible.On March 12, 2012, Mr. King announced his decision, explaining in a memorandum that the evidence cited by F.D.L.E., pointing toward homicide, had \u201cequally innocent explanations.\u201dHis conclusion: \u201cThe facts as they currently exist do not support the prosecution of Jeremy Banks for any homicide offense.\u201dThat was where the case stood a year later when I made my first trip to St. Augustine, to report on the shooting and its impact on the community. Sheriff Shoar would later cite that visit as the reason he ordered his officers to re-examine a closed case.An F.D.L.E. supervisor, he said, told the sheriff\u2019s office that I had interviewed him about the shooting for 30 to 40 minutes. On hearing this, I immediately informed the sheriff that he was mistaken, that the supervisor had in fact refused to answer any of my questions. Even so, Sheriff Shoar repeated his statement in his report.For an interview that never happened, it had quite an impact.In a little more than a month, the sheriff responded with a blistering 152-page report that all but declared war on the state\u2019s investigative agency. The sheriff accused Agent Rodgers of manufacturing evidence, coaching witnesses and lying to obtain search warrants, among other misdeeds. He also harshly condemned Mr. Pape, the special agent in charge, or S.A.C., in Jacksonville, where Agent Rodgers worked.\u201cThough I and many others suspected that Agent Rodgers and SAC Pape were careless and reckless during their review/investigation of this case, it was not until we conducted this exhaustive review did we come to understand the gravity of their misconduct,\u201d Sheriff Shoar wrote.The officer who led the sheriff\u2019s investigation, Skip Cole, now a commander, confirmed that his team started reviewing Agent Rodgers\u2019s files after learning of my interest in the case. \u201cWe tried to get out in front of it,\u201d he said in court papers.Sheriff Shoar acknowledged alerting the medical examiner, Dr. Bulic, of possible trouble ahead. F.D.L.E.\u2019s supervisors, he told him, \u201care dirty dealing, and this guy from The New York Times ain\u2019t no good either.\u201dOne thing Sheriff Shoar\u2019s officers did not do was try to interview their target, Agent Rodgers. Later on, however, they would share information with the special prosecutor investigating him.All the while, F.D.L.E. prohibited the agent from responding, even as Sheriff Shoar continued to publicly roast his reputation. (Agent Rodgers was also barred from speaking for this article.)But the documents I recently located and reviewed \u2014 thousands of pages of investigative files, court records, letters, emails and audiotapes from the inquiries into Agent Rodgers and from a lawsuit filed by Deputy Banks \u2014 when taken together, offer a radical counterpoint to the sheriff\u2019s portrait of an ethically corrupt investigator.Agent Rodgers\u2019s work was not flawless. While certain facts remain in dispute, this much is clear: The most damaging accusations against him turned out to be demonstrably false, unsupported by existing evidence or contradicted by Sheriff Shoar\u2019s own sources. Lesser criticisms were either overblown or deemed mostly within the bounds of accepted investigative practices.What\u2019s more, records show that the sheriff and his officers made little or no effort to confirm their accusations, which were simply passed on to government agencies in hopes of provoking a criminal investigation.The misstatements begin in the opening of the report, where Sheriff Shoar erroneously contends that Mr. King, the special prosecutor, concluded that Ms. O\u2019Connell killed herself. He made no ruling about how she died.Some false statements are repeated. Sheriff Shoar twice accuses the agent of lying to obtain a search warrant by telling the court that Deputy Banks had failed to mention that a third person was present during the shooting.\u201cThis is a deliberate misrepresentation of the truth,\u201d the sheriff wrote, alleging that Agent Rodgers knew the person had not been present but made the statement \u201cin an attempt to portray his perception of Banks\u2019s guilt and to mislead the court.\u201d In fact, it was only after warrants were issued that Agent Rodgers learned that the third person had not been present after all, according to F.D.L.E.\u2019s internal affairs investigators.The report portrayed him as a rogue agent whose investigative style, and supposed early belief in Deputy Banks\u2019s guilt, troubled other investigators. Agent Rodgers\u2019s employer did not publicly challenge this, but privately his supervisors did.\u201cIf somebody came up and said your investigators are doing it wrong, that would be a huge red flag,\u201d Mr. Donaway said. But that never happened, he said.Agent Rodgers\u2019s supervisors said his work was closely monitored. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t trust Rusty,\u201d Mr. Donaway said. \u201cWe trusted him explicitly. But we wanted to make sure that we ran it through many minds and made collective decisions.\u201d Everyone, he said, knew it was \u201ca hot-potato case.\u201dOnly after The Times began examining the shooting, more than two years after Ms. O\u2019Connell died, did Sheriff Shoar list many, but not all, of his own agency\u2019s mistakes on just two pages buried in the middle of his 152-page attack.Perhaps the biggest challenge Sheriff Shoar faced in seeking to discredit Agent Rodgers was his discovery of the two neighbors who said they had heard a woman scream for help.Their statements appeared to undercut Deputy Banks\u2019s account that he and Ms. O\u2019Connell had not argued at the house the night she died. As one F.D.L.E. supervisor wryly observed, \u201cA lot of suicide people don\u2019t scream for help before they shoot themselves.\u201dStill, state investigators were initially skeptical. Investigators from the state attorney and the special prosecutor separately visited the neighbors \u2014 Heather Ladley and Stacey Boswell \u2014 and found them credible. Both passed polygraph exams.Sheriff Shoar\u2019s reaction to the new disclosure would become the template for his response to anyone who disagreed with his view of the case \u2014 he attacked.\u201cI know what happened,\u201d he told F.D.L.E. agents investigating Agent Rodgers. Without offering proof, or even interviewing the neighbors, he said the two women were \u201cbogus\u201d and knew nothing. \u201cRodgers, I think, interviewed them all at the same time, and I\u2019m sure he coached them.\u201dHe also accused Agent Rodgers of trying to hide how he had found them, yet the investigator explained that in his written report. Both women said under oath that they had been interviewed separately, and that the agent had not coached them.As for the polygraph exams, the sheriff had an answer for that, too: Although the polygraph examiner was \u201cpretty damn good,\u201d he said, Agent Rodgers \u201ceither strong-armed him or conned him into it because I\u2019ve had experts look at the polygraph and it\u2019s nonsense.\u201d The sheriff did not interview the examiner before making that accusation.Sheriff Shoar had one more line of attack. The women, he wrote, underlined and in boldface, admitted that they frequently smoked marijuana and couldn\u2019t remember if they had done so on the night of the shooting.But Sheriff Shoar\u2019s supposed source of that information, Robert Hardwick, then an investigator for the state attorney, has denied telling the sheriff that, and the women have denied telling him.In preparing my original article, I sent the sheriff written questions, among them why he hadn\u2019t publicly corrected the record about drug use. \u201cWhether it is true or not is immaterial,\u201d he replied, though he eventually removed the statement from his online post.Deputy Banks\u2019s lawyer, Robert L. McLeod, tried a different approach. He hired a former Jacksonville deputy sheriff to run a sound test with an actress imitating Ms. O\u2019Connell screaming for help. \u201cThe sound was inaudible at the distant recording location,\u201d he concluded.Apart from running a test that involved a different woman at a different time of day, the former deputy, Michael A. Knox, had been criticized last year by the Forensic Science Commission in Texas for concluding, based on a surveillance video, that an armed robber was much taller than witnesses had said. That finding prompted the Innocence Project of Texas to accuse him of using \u201cjunk science,\u201d court records show. Mr. Knox defended his work, but has revised his height estimate downward.Sheriff Shoar also attacked Mr. Findley, the crime scene reconstructionist who had disagreed with his conclusions about the O\u2019Connell case. \u201cBecause of Agent Rodgers\u2019s conduct, the Findley report is meaningless and wrong,\u201d the sheriff wrote. \u201cIt is apparent that Findley did not view all of the evidence.\u201dHow he reached that conclusion is unclear, because he never asked Mr. Findley what he had reviewed. Nor did his officers.Commander Cole, who led the sheriff\u2019s review of Agent Rodgers\u2019s work, would be asked about that later at a hearing by the agent\u2019s lawyer, Chelsea Winicki.\u201cSo if he wasn\u2019t provided all of the evidence, what was he not provided?\u201d she asked.\u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201dMs. Winicki pressed for an answer. \u201cAt no point did you contact Findley to clarify what evidence he was provided?\u201d\u201cI did not.\u201d\u201cDid anybody on your team?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dCommander Cole said logic dictated that if Mr. Findley had reviewed all the evidence, he would have agreed with the sheriff. \u201cSo that\u2019s my opinion, I guess.\u201dSoon, Sheriff Shoar would get what he wanted. Agent Rodgers\u2019s employer began investigating him, and the governor appointed a special prosecutor. Deputy Banks, who has denied harming his girlfriend, sued the agent, accusing him of violating his civil rights.The sheriff used his public office to promote his deputy\u2019s private lawsuit, posting on his agency website not only the legal complaint, but also Deputy Banks\u2019s notice of his intent to sue and other related court filings, which closely tracked the allegations in the sheriff\u2019s report. Agent Rodgers\u2019s legal responses are not displayed.A central plank in Sheriff Shoar\u2019s campaign was the allegation that the agent had lied to obtain search warrants.In late 2013 or early 2014, the county judge who had approved the warrants received an unusual request. It was the sheriff, asking to meet him \u2014 a potential witness in Deputy Banks\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 over the weekend at a Starbucks so he could hand-deliver some documents. The sheriff wanted the judge to read his accusation that the agent had lied.In court papers, the judge, Charles Tinlin, recounted that the sheriff, who had never before contacted him about a case, wanted \u201cto deliver a package to me.\u201d Asked if the meeting was \u201coff the books,\u201d Judge Tinlin replied: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him that. It wasn\u2019t on my books.\u201d Sheriff Shoar acknowledged that the judge was a potential witness, yet he followed up by sending an officer to deliver his full investigative binder.The sheriff told F.D.L.E. investigators that Judge Tinlin \u201cvividly\u201d remembered Agent Rodgers because he was so \u201canimated and forceful\u201d in seeking the warrants and in suggesting that the sheriff\u2019s office was involved in a \u201ccover-up\u201d involving Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s death.\u201cCan you imagine saying that to a sitting judge?\u201d the sheriff told investigators. \u201cCan you imagine the arrogance of that?\u201dBut Judge Tinlin disputes that account. \u201cI don\u2019t remember Agent Rodgers ever using the word \u2018cover-up,\u2019\u201d he said. In fact, the judge added, \u201cI\u2019m the one that asked him about a cover-up.\u201dThe judge said the agent \u201canswered the questions I was asking of him; he handled things in a professional manner in that sense.\u201dSheriff Shoar\u2019s propensity for talking to potential witnesses earned him a rebuke from F.D.L.E.\u201cIt would greatly assist us if you would refrain from conducting any further interviews of witnesses,\u201d the agency\u2019s internal affairs chief wrote to the sheriff in April 2013. \u201cSuch ad hoc interviews have the potential to negatively impact our ability to conduct a fair and impartial investigation.\u201dSheriff Shoar\u2019s own second in command, Mr. Bolante, concurred.\u201cThe main thing I disagreed with was not allowing F.D.L.E. to do their investigation without interference,\u201d said Mr. Bolante, who has since retired. \u201cBecause a witness\u2019s name would come up and the sheriff would send a couple guys out to interview that witness. I said, \u2018That\u2019s a witness for F.D.L.E. to interview, not us.\u2019\u201dAt the same time, the sheriff mounted a media blitz \u2014 with online posts of his report and personal opinions about the case, along with media interviews. Publicly criticizing the subject of an active criminal investigation is frowned upon in most legal circles. According to American Bar Association standards, adopted by the State of Florida, law enforcement officers should refrain from disclosing information about a criminal matter that is \u201cnot part of the public court record.\u201d\u201cHe is certainly not in the bounds of proper behavior,\u201d said Walter Mack, a former prosecutor who once served as New York City\u2019s deputy police commissioner for internal affairs.While publicly condemning Agent Rodgers, the sheriff nonetheless demanded silence from F.D.L.E., even threatening a young agent unconnected to the case who had expressed his opinion in casual conversation with another law enforcement official.\u201cIn the event that I become aware of any future similar conduct, in addition to filing a formal complaint against the offender, I will employ any other remedies available,\u201d the sheriff wrote to F.D.L.E.The sheriff became so consumed with taking down Agent Rodgers that Mr. Bolante said he often had to run the office himself. The special prosecutor\u2019s chief lawyer on the case, William Gladson, said that even after his boss decided not to prosecute, he had about 50 telephone conversations with Sheriff Shoar, mostly to discuss subsequent investigations and reporting by The Times. The sheriff initiated most of those calls, Mr. Gladson said.As police chief in St. Augustine, Sheriff Shoar acted quite differently after his own officers came under investigation for their treatment of a group of transients. In a 2001 memo, he criticized local residents who \u201chave waged a deliberate media campaign including use of the print media and voice media to broadcast their version of the events.\u201d Not only was it \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d to publicize their complaints before the conclusion of the inquiry, he said, it was \u201cpossibly a criminal violation.\u201dFor Agent Rodgers, his friends say, being told to turn in his badge and gun was devastating. That was just the beginning.The continuing assaults on his reputation, and his inability to speak out for himself, wore on him. His mother was gravely ill, and Vinny Cassidy, a friend and former F.D.L.E. agent, told how Agent Rodgers\u2019s mother died without knowing whether her son would be exonerated. Agent Rodgers battled cancer and spent tens of thousands of dollars on legal bills.\u201cMany other people would have folded,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said. \u201cI think a lot of people were counting on him to throw in the towel, on both sides of the street.\u201dBut Agent Rodgers did not. \u201cWhere do you go to get your reputation back if you don\u2019t hang in?\u201d Mr. Cassidy asked.Eventually, Mr. Donaway tired of watching Sheriff Shoar lambaste the agent, so he retired early last year, forfeiting, he said, a large sum of money. Over a recent lunch at a Jacksonville restaurant, he said, \u201cI was just so sick, so angry with my agency for not backing him up.\u201dF.D.L.E. still refuses to comment on the case or let Agent Rodgers speak on his own behalf. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to win an argument when only one side is talking,\u201d Mr. Donaway said.Agent Rodgers did get his job back last year after being cleared of any crimes. His agency counseled him, without discipline, for a handful of mistakes, including not typing his handwritten notes for one interview and incorrectly adding an extra word \u2014 \u201cnow\u201d \u2014 to Deputy Banks\u2019s 911 call, according to Mr. Donaway and F.D.L.E.\u2019s internal affairs report. The special prosecutor concluded in his report that most of Sheriff Shoar\u2019s accusations of serious misconduct were essentially baseless or overblown, though Agent Rodgers had misled some witnesses. (His lawyer disputes that.)\u201cNone of these actions, however, are clearly or provably criminal in nature,\u201d the special prosecutor\u2019s report states, adding, \u201cIndeed, courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have generally allowed enforcement officers to engage in even blatant deception towards witnesses and suspects in the pursuit of justice.\u201dA second special prosecutor, appointed to examine new allegations about the shooting, took no further action. Even so, his investigator took it upon himself to criticize Agent Rodgers, often echoing Sheriff Shoar\u2019s points of attack. The agent\u2019s lawyer, William J. Sheppard, said those criticisms contained \u201cnumerous false, unfounded and unsolicited opinions.\u201d The investigator, Mr. Sheppard added, never contacted Agent Rodgers.When the sheriff learned the agent was back on the job, he flogged him once more, telling the media that he would receive \u201cremedial training and increased supervision\u201d and could not work criminal cases in St. Johns County.During much of 2013, I tried to get an on-the-record interview with Sheriff Shoar. We talked by phone, email, in his office, over coffee at a local restaurant. I stopped by places he was known to frequent, like the Barnes & Noble on Route 1, hoping to catch him where he relaxed and read. We exchanged titles of our favorite history books.Over and over he promised to accommodate my request, only to change his mind, once just minutes before the interview was to begin.This spring, I tried another tack. I paid $65 to attend a county Republican fund-raiser where Sheriff Shoar was a featured speaker. I wanted to hear his views on all that had happened since we last discussed the O\u2019Connell case, and perhaps to glean some insight into what had driven him in his long pursuit of Rusty Rodgers.At the event, the sheriff, his badge dangling from his sport coat, spoke passionately about the county\u2019s heroin problem and the need for better mental health services. (He recently won an award for his advocacy on behalf of mentally ill people.)With the questions that followed, donors seemed more interested in the long reach of George Soros, whether there were Islamic terrorist training camps in Florida and the threat of Shariah law.I approached the sheriff as he was about to leave and asked if we could set a time to speak. He said he would need to think about it. We said our goodbyes, and I left.A couple of weeks earlier, Sheriff Shoar had shown that the O\u2019Connell case still rankled him. At the sheriff\u2019s annual awards dinner, a protester stood silently outside in the lobby of the public auditorium with a sign saying Ms. O\u2019Connell had been murdered.\u201cYou got to leave,\u201d the sheriff ordered him. \u201cYou are trespassing.\u201d The protester, Jeff Gray, said the building was public, owned and paid for by the citizens of St. Johns County and that he would not leave.\u201cWell, you are leaving one way or another,\u201d the sheriff replied, summoning uniformed officers, who escorted Mr. Gray out of the building under threat of arrest.Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s mother, Patty, says she has grown tired of waiting for the government to deliver justice. So last year, she authorized a private pathologist, a former medical examiner of Orange County, Fla., to exhume the body.The pathologist, Dr. William R. Anderson, discovered that Ms. O\u2019Connell had a cracked jaw. \u201cThe findings are most consistent of blunt force trauma causing incapacitation of Ms. O\u2019Connell, and subsequent gunshot wound inflicted by another,\u201d he wrote in his report. (Dr. Bulic, who had never mentioned the broken jaw, now says the gunshot caused it.)The exhumation enraged Sheriff Shoar. He called it \u201creprehensible\u201d and accused Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s mother of \u201cmolesting\u201d the body by removing it from its \u201cplace of rest.\u201d The examination, he said, was conducted by a \u201cpaid expert,\u201d not a state medical examiner, and offered nothing that hadn\u2019t been reviewed in the initial autopsy.Sheriff Shoar was wrong on both counts. According to the O\u2019Connell family, Dr. Anderson performed the examination pro bono. And records show that the cracked jaw was not described in the first pathologist\u2019s autopsy report, even though it was evident in a post-mortem X-ray.Asked about the sheriff\u2019s comments, Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s sister Jennifer Crites offered this terse reply: \u201cHe lies because he can.\u201dFor the O\u2019Connells, the grief has been compounded by the sheriff\u2019s embrace of one of their own \u2014 Michelle\u2019s brother Scott. Mr. O\u2019Connell was fired from the sheriff\u2019s office for losing his temper after learning there would be no charges in his sister\u2019s death. But Scott was rehired after he concluded that Agent Rodgers manipulated the family into believing that Ms. O\u2019Connell had been murdered.Patty O\u2019Connell, who now cares for Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s 10-year-old daughter, Alexis, wants nothing to do with her son Scott. \u201cThere cannot be forgiveness until he says he is sorry for lying about Michelle,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it must eat at his conscience.\u201dScott O\u2019Connell did not return a message seeking comment.The two local medical examiners who sided with Sheriff Shoar experienced their own setbacks in March, when the Florida Medical Examiners Commission accused them of violating state rules in their handling of the O\u2019Connell case.The panel recommended that Dr. Hobin be suspended for an undetermined period for keeping his amended opinion \u2014 that Ms. O\u2019Connell had been \u201cshot by another\u201d \u2014 at home, where it was not accessible to the public. Dr. Bulic, the panel said, should be reprimanded for letting people view autopsy photographs of Ms. O\u2019Connell without her family\u2019s permission.The commission also criticized Dr. Hobin for failing to note the broken jaw in his report. Both doctors can contest that ruling, but so far have not.Meanwhile, accusations of domestic violence involving the police \u2014 the reason I came to St. Augustine in the first place \u2014 continue to be an issue in the sheriff\u2019s office. In a single month last summer, three deputy sheriffs were accused of domestic violence; two resigned, and one was fired. A sheriff\u2019s spokesman said the number of episodes was highly unusual.\u201cI have a long history of holding subordinates accountable,\u201d the sheriff wrote in a letter.But records from one of the cases, obtained by The Times, suggest a different story.Two former wives of a deputy named Kevin D. Nickmeyer obtained protective orders after accusing him of domestic violence. He also had a long record of official misconduct, including suspensions, letters of reprimand and threats of termination.Even so, in 2015, Sheriff Shoar wrote to Mr. Nickmeyer, granting him a raise and thanking him for exemplifying the high professional standards of his office: \u201cTaking Care of People; Be the Best We Can Be in All That We Do; Integrity; and Treating People with Dignity and Respect.\u201dLess than a year later, Mr. Nickmeyer resigned after being accused of domestic violence by another ex-wife. Even so, several months afterward, the sheriff quietly rehired him for another position, but he resigned again about a week later, records show. He subsequently entered into a deferred-prosecution agreement and must wear a tracking device.Mr. Nickmeyer agreed to an interview for this article, only to back out.Here in St. Augustine, the community remains deeply divided over what happened to Michelle O\u2019Connell, even after seven years of verbal and legal combat. Three special prosecutors took no position on how she died. The family still believes she was murdered. The sheriff, Deputy Banks and the medical examiners still say it was suicide. The deputy\u2019s civil rights lawsuit against Agent Rodgers continues.Robert Hardwick, who worked on the case for the state attorney and is now police chief in St. Augustine Beach, is familiar with the investigation\u2019s complexities. \u201cOne day you are 60-40 on homicide; you come in the next day and you hear something else and you are 60-40 suicide,\u201d said the police chief, who considers Sheriff Shoar his mentor and friend.Chief Hardwick criticized parts of Agent Rodgers\u2019s inquiry, but in an interview with F.D.L.E. investigators, he called the sheriff\u2019s 152-page report \u201ca biased opinion.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tainted. Everybody\u2019s tainted. The media\u2019s tainted us. The conversations among cops that are local has tainted us.\u201dWhat happened, he said, is not fair to anybody. But, he added, \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201dSusan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Has the Democratic Party Gotten Too Rich for Its Own Good?", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist, lived up to the grand Democratic tradition of favoring the underdog at the expense of the rich.The Sanders tax-and-spending plan throws into sharp relief the problem that the changing demographic makeup of the Democratic coalition creates for party leaders. Trouble brews when a deeply held commitment to the underdog comes into conflict with the self-interested pocketbook and lifestyle concerns of the upper middle class.Higher up the ladder, the tax increase would grow to $130,275 for those in the top 5 percent, to $525,365 for those in the top one percent and to $3.1 million for the top 0.1 percent.We must send a message to the billionaire class: \u201cyou can\u2019t have it all.\u201d You can\u2019t get huge tax breaks while children in this country go hungry.But Sanders spoke to the Democratic Party of 2016, not the Democratic Party of the Great Depression.In days past, a proposal to slam the rich to reward the working and middle classes meant hitting Republicans to benefit Democrats.In other words, 41 years ago, the year Jimmy Carter won the presidency, the Sanders proposal would have made political sense.But what about now?In the past, Democrats could support progressive, redistributive policies knowing that the costs would fall largely on Republicans. That is no longer the case. Now supporting these policies requires the party to depend on the altruistic idealism of millions of supporters who, despite being relatively well off, often feel financially pressed themselves.This problem applies not only to tax policy, but even more to social policies concerning education and housing.Reeves argues that those in the top 20 percent of the income distribution have become an increasingly isolated class; if the country is to restore the American tradition of upward mobility, this elite will have to pay for it.\u201cThe upper middle class has been having it pretty good. It is about time those of us in the favored fifth recognized our privileged position,\u201d Reeves writes. As members of this class protect their status and economic gains for themselves and their children, Reeves contends, they have capitalized on a host of less visible forces \u2014 exclusionary zoning, the clustering of elites, legacy college admissions, disproportionate political influence \u2014 to build a protective wall, keeping those in the lower quintiles of the income distribution from breaking in.As Reeves points out,it is a stubborn mathematical fact that, at any given time, the top fifth of the income distribution can accommodate only 20 percent of the population. Relative intergenerational mobility is a zero sum game. For someone to move up the ladder, someone else must move down.Even the most liberal parents are unlikely to be comfortable with the idea that their own children should fall down the scale in the name of making room for a smarter kid from a poorer home.His proposals calling on the upper middle class to abandon unfair \u201copportunity hoarding\u201d raise a basic political question. Can the Democratic Party, as it is currently constructed, maintain its commitment to a redistributive agenda? Put another way, can a political party impose costs on its own constituents, especially those voters who make up the most influential faction of the party: the affluent and well educated?The preliminary evidence from actual events is that demanding sacrifice poses major risks. Asking people to think of themselves as compassionate and to pay higher taxes is one thing \u2014 many Democrats have made that leap \u2014 but ask them to live in a mixed income neighborhood or ask them to have their kid give up her spot at Princeton, and you get a different response.\u201cThe idea was sensible, simple, and progressive,\u201d Reeves writes. \u201cThe episode was a brutal reminder that sensible policy is not always easy politics.\u201d Reeves noted that two of the leading Democratic opponents of the 529 reform, Nancy Pelosi and Chris Van Hollen, who was elected Maryland\u2019s junior senator in November but was a congressman when Obama proposed it, represented districts where \u201calmost half their constituents are in households with six-figure incomes.\u201dPerhaps the most problematic issue for affluent Democrats are proposals calling for expanded construction of affordable housing in middle-to-upper-middle class neighborhoods.Segregation is a disaster for the poor. It crushes upward mobility by cutting off resources to essential public goods like quality education. Yet, in almost every city and metropolitan municipality there is a strong entrenched group committed to using political regulations to perpetuate segregation. These people are more commonly known as homeowners.The Lucas Valley Homeowner\u2019s Association was formed to oppose \u201chigh density development.\" Likewise, the Marin Community Alliance was formed \u201cto protect and preserve the character\" of the area.The response, Rothwell continued,is sadly typical. Since zoning\u2019s modern origins in the 1920s, homeowner associations and other groups have banded together to keep racial minorities and non-affluent people out of their suburban municipalities and neighborhoods.In an effort to further explore this question, I asked Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale, two questions:As the share of Democrats who are well-educated and upper middle class grows, how can the party continue to advocate redistributive policies? Can a party survive that calls on its own members to pay the costs of policies designed to help those on the bottom rungs?Hacker replied:The evidence is clear that even relatively affluent Democrats are more supportive of redistribution than a typical Republican \u2014 at least in opinion surveys. This general support, however, doesn\u2019t always translate into support for pro-opportunity policies at the local level.Affordable housing, Hacker wrote, \u201cis far and away the best example.\u201d Opposition to zoning allowing denser and more affordable housing \u201ccomes not just from well-off residents but also from landlords who get monopoly rents.\u201d The inherent zero-sum thinking underlying not-in-my-backyard approachesprevents positive-sum solutions that could reduce the economic conflict between poorer members of the Democratic coalition and the more affluent segments.Hacker concluded his email on an upbeat note, contending that \u201cdemography is not destiny\u201d and that Democratic leaderscould work more aggressively to identify and create positive-sum solutions \u2014 pro-growth policies that both lift up the least advantaged and attenuate class-based cleavages within its own coalition.Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, less optimistically put his finger on the core problem for Democrats:The Democratic Party is evolving in multiple ways that separate it from the living conditions of large numbers of working-class Americans.The result, Lupia wrote, is thatmany Democrats now know less, and appear to care less, about the day-to-day struggles of many working class Americans. Hillary Clinton is an example of a Democrat who struggled to be seen by many such Americans as having a sincere and credible grasp of their concerns.Hacker and Lupia, while differing in outlook, together raise a basic concern about the contemporary Democratic Party: the casual, if not negligent, willingness of the party elite to adopt policies and positions, however worthy, without regard to the costs such policies impose on others.The Democratic delegates were well to the left of Democratic voters, a trend that continues. Seven out of ten delegates said that abortion should be generally available and 20 percent said abortion should be available under \u201cstricter limits\u201d; 43 percent of Democratic voters supported generally available abortion and 39 percent said under \u201cstricter limits.\u201dMore than 8 out of 10 Democratic delegates in 2008 agreed that \u201cgovernment should do more to solve national problems,\u201d while 54 percent of Democratic voters shared that view, according to American National Election Studies. Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 Democratic coalition clearly reflected the same priorities.As the Democratic elite and the Democratic electorate as a whole become increasingly well educated and affluent, the party faces a crucial question. Can it maintain its crucial role as the representative of the least powerful, the marginalized, the most oppressed, many of whom belong to disadvantaged racial and ethnic minority groups \u2014 those on the bottom rungs of the socioeconomic ladder?The steady loss of Democratic support in the white working class, culminating in Trump\u2019s Electoral College victory on the backs of these white voters, must inevitably send a loud and clear signal to the Democratic elite: The more the party abandons the moral imperative to represent the interests of the less well off of all races and ethnicities, the more it risks a repetition of the electoral disaster of 2016 in 2018, 2020 and beyond.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Queen\u2019s Speech to U.K. Parliament Outlines Theresa May\u2019s Scaled-Down Agenda", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on Wednesday, Mrs. May jettisoned much of her policy agenda, putting forward a slimmed down legislative program intended to minimize the risk of defeats in Parliament while focusing on Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, a process known as Brexit.Having already postponed by two days the Queen\u2019s Speech to Parliament, in which the monarch outlines the government\u2019s coming legislation, Mrs. May proceeded without an accord with the D.U.P., and in the knowledge that any contentious bill risks defeat.Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s role in presenting the agenda is a significant ceremonial duty. Buckingham Palace announced Wednesday morning that the queen\u2019s husband, Prince Philip, had been hospitalized Tuesday night \u201cas a precautionary measure, for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition.\u201d Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, accompanied the queen to Parliament in place of Prince Philip for a ceremony that was, by British standards, relatively light on pomp.The speech she delivered, meanwhile, was noteworthy less for what it contained than for what it omitted or played down. Those included moves to expand the number of grammar schools, which admit pupils after tests; several promises to remove some financial privileges for affluent elderly voters; a pledge to reopen Britain\u2019s debate on fox hunting; and a push to consider a price cap on energy costs, which appeared to have been toned down.Mrs. May\u2019s next crucial test will be winning a vote next week on the Queen\u2019s Speech.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, promised to use \u201cevery opportunity to vote down government policies that failed to win public support.\u201d\u201cThis is a government without a majority, without a mandate, without a serious legislative program, led by a prime minister who has lost her political authority, and is struggling to stitch together a deal to stay in office,\u201d Mr. Corbyn told lawmakers.While Mrs. May\u2019s medium-term position remains fragile, she is likely to secure some sort of support from the D.U.P. A party with strong Protestant roots, the D.U.P. worries that without its help, Mrs. May\u2019s government could fall and one way or another, power could pass to the Labour Party and its left-wing leader, who has a history of close ties to Irish republicans.It remained unclear whether the D.U.P. would support the government on crucial confidence motions, or would enter a broader arrangement to guarantee the passage of other important bills, including those on finance.Even if Mrs. May prevailed and won approval for the Queen\u2019s Speech, as expected, she would still struggle to pass every piece of contentious legislation, hence her decision to drop some measures that were once at the heart of her political thinking.That approach presents its own perils, however, because the general election failed to deliver an endorsement of the clean break with the bloc that she wanted \u2014 one that prioritizes control of immigration over economic interests.Although the Labour Party accepted the outcome of the referendum on withdrawing from the European Union, it wants to keep closer economic ties to the bloc and it could try to obstruct crucial parts of the government\u2019s exit-related plans.Yet if Mrs. May softens her stance on withdrawing from the bloc to accommodate pro-Europeans worried about the British economy \u2014 including some members of her own cabinet \u2014 she risks a rebellion from leading supporters of the withdrawal.That would include possible successors like Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and David Davis, the cabinet minister responsible for negotiating Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.How long Mrs. May can survive is unclear. George Osborne, the former chancellor of the Exchequer who was fired by Mrs. May last year and is now a newspaper editor, has described her as a \u201cdead woman walking.\u201dFew analysts believe that Mrs. May will be allowed to lead the Conservatives into another election, but there seems little appetite for an immediate contest to replace her.In recent decades some weakened governments in Britain have continued longer than expected, after prime ministers appeared to lose authority. That situation befell another Conservative leader, John Major, in 1992, after Britain crashed out of the European Union\u2019s exchange rate mechanism \u2014 yet he survived until 1997.When he finally did seek re-election, however, Mr. Major led his Conservative Party to a landslide defeat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Los Angeles Philharmonic Lost Its Leader. Can It Stay on Top?", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 American orchestras are supposed to be in crisis, fighting for economic survival and cultural relevance. But no one seems to have told the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which, two years shy of its centennial, is stronger than ever.But there is a dissonant undertone of uncertainty: Deborah Borda, the visionary chief executive who made the orchestra the envy of the music world during her 17 years in charge, left last month to run the New York Philharmonic, a troubled institution dearly in need of a savior.Orchestra officials said they were confident that success would breed more of the same. \u201cPeople are very envious about being part of this organization,\u201d Jay Rasulo, a former Disney executive who is the chairman of the Philharmonic\u2019s board, said in an interview. \u201cWe have our pick of people in our field because of what this team represents to people, what this organization represents to people. And I think that Deborah\u2019s departure was inevitable. Was it inevitable three months ago? No, but it was inevitable. And I think that there\u2019s an incredible amount of confidence.\u201dThe Philharmonic works hard to reach out beyond the cultural acropolis downtown where its gleaming concert hall stands. \u201cWe cannot be sitting here and expecting people to come to us,\u201d Mr. Dudamel said in an interview backstage at Disney Hall. \u201cThat is too arrogant. We have to go to the community. We have to change.\u201dIn an interview after she decamped to New York, Ms. Borda described the L.A. Phil as an institution \u201cin alignment.\u201d\u201cOne of the things in Los Angeles that I find different from any other city that I\u2019ve worked in,\u201d she added, \u201cis if you have an idea, people don\u2019t simply say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s a crazy idea.\u2019 If you can make it work, people will be open to it.\u201dThat is not true for everyone, he noted. So the orchestra is working to appeal separately to different segments of its audience, sometimes selling its most daring programs, including the Reykjavik Festival, separately from its main subscription concerts.The orchestra enjoys advantages that allow it, unlike most of its peers, to earn more money from ticket sales than from donations. The Hollywood Bowl, which the Philharmonic operates on a lease from Los Angeles County, is a veritable cash machine, with its healthy box-office revenues bolstered by the pop, world music and movie nights that augment the Philharmonic\u2019s traditional classical concerts. All told, roughly two-thirds of the Philharmonic\u2019s ticket revenue each year comes from the Bowl, said Gail Samuel, the orchestra\u2019s acting president and chief executive, with the other third coming from Disney Hall.On the site of the swimming stadium that was used in the 1932 Olympics, a group of musicians from the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles, known as YOLA, was rehearsing for opening night at the Bowl, where they were to accompany the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra on a program headlined by the Moody Blues.Ms. Borda said she had hit on the idea of starting a youth orchestra a little more than a decade ago, when she was flying back and forth to Caracas trying to sign Mr. Dudamel to succeed Esa-Pekka Salonen as the Philharmonic\u2019s music director. She was inspired by Venezuela\u2019s government-financed music-education program, El Sistema, of which Mr. Dudamel is a proud product. Some board members blanched, but she persuaded them. After starting with just 80 students, the Los Angeles program now has 800 at three sites across the city.A bass player at a rehearsal, the 20-year-old Isaac Green, was a recent alumnus of the program. Like 90 percent of YOLA\u2019s first set of graduates, he has gone on to college: He is now majoring in music at California State University, Northridge. Playing Tchaikovsky alongside the Philharmonic, he said, was \u201cthe musical highlight of my life.\u201d\u201cThe tide has definitely shifted,\u201d he said, crediting the Philharmonic with playing a big role. \u201cPeople now really understand that L.A. is culturally such a dynamic place, so vital.\u201dMost pressing, though, is replacing Ms. Borda. The orchestra has two internal candidates seen as possible successors. Mr. Smith is one but said he was happy with his current artistically oriented responsibilities as they are now. \u201cWe\u2019re the writer\u2019s room,\u201d he said of his team, using a suitably Hollywood-style television analogy, \u201cnot the showrunner.\u201dThe board has not decided whether to promote from within the respected team Ms. Borda built, or search elsewhere, said Mr. Rasulo, the chairman. \u201cWe all feel on the board we owe it to the organization to be comprehensive,\u201d he said, \u201cto not maybe jump at the obvious.\u201dMr. Dudamel, for his part, said that while he was sad to see Ms. Borda go, he was confident that the Philharmonic would be able to build on her success; flux, he contended, had been a part of its makeup from the start.\u201cThis orchestra\u2019s tradition,\u201d he said, \u201cis the tradition of the new.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the company quintupled the price of Evzio in the middle of a national opioid abuse epidemic, prompting letters from lawmakers who demanded to know why the price had shot up.Express Scripts says it is owed more than $14.5 million in fees and rebates related to Evzio, and it has dropped the drug from its preferred list.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Organization to Go Budget Friendly With \u2018American Idea\u2019 Hotel Chain", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the campaign trail, President Trump\u2019s children rolled through dozens of small towns across the country, reveling in the adoration of the crowds. But they were less enamored of the budget-friendly hotels along the way, an assortment of run-of-the-mill offerings that were barely distinguishable from one another.That led to a business idea.On Monday, the Trump Organization announced plans for a new three-star hotel chain with a patriotic flair, echoing President Trump\u2019s campaign slogan about putting America first and reflecting the organization\u2019s promise to enter into new deals only in the United States. The intention is to differentiate the chain, called American Idea, by featuring artifacts of American culture in the hotels, such as an old Coca-Cola machine in the lobby or American-made sundries in the rooms.And while the Trump Organization and its business partner say the down-market move is not about politics, the president\u2019s business is inherently viewed through that lens: The chain will make its debut in little-known towns in Mississippi, a state in the heart of Trump country that favored him over Hillary Clinton by a margin of 18 percentage points. The organization\u2019s business partner in Mississippi is a family-owned hotel company whose co-owner met Mr. Trump at a campaign event last summer and donated to his campaign.This new chain is an unlikely venture for a company commonly associated with luxury accommodations in upscale locations, and it indicates that the Trumps see dollar signs in the vast support the campaign received from conservative areas well beyond major cities. The first hotels are expected to come online quickly because they will involve rebranding existing properties like Holiday Inns and Comfort Inns.Eric Danziger, the chief executive of the Trump Organization\u2019s hotels division, said in an interview that the company had planned a hotel expansion for nearly two years, apart from the Trump campaign. During the campaign, the Trump children would report back about the thousands of supporters attending rallies and what they saw as a chance to build a line of hotels standing out from the cookie-cutter options in midsize and small cities.\u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s brilliant,\u2019\u201d Mr. Danziger recalled. \u201cThe reality is we should have something in those kinds of locations.\u201d\u201cThere is no political thought to it,\u201d Mr. Danziger said regarding the new chain, and he added that there could be \u201cmany hundreds\u201d of American Idea hotels in both red and blue counties and states. The counties in Mississippi that will get the first hotels tilted toward Mrs. Clinton, for instance.Even before Mr. Trump took office in January, ethics experts and political opponents criticized his refusal to divest from the far-flung business. Mr. Trump handed over control of the Trump Organization to his eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and other executives, and he agreed to forgo new deals abroad and donate profits from foreign governments to the Treasury. But Mr. Trump remains financially invested in the family business.The new hotels will have no overt connection to Mr. Trump \u2014 his name will not appear anywhere, Mr. Danziger said.The American Idea chain is the latest expansion of the Trump hotel empire, coming just months after Mr. Danziger unveiled plans for a four-star brand known as Scion. The Trumps will not own the new hotels under either brand but instead license them to business partners (who must pay royalties and other fees). The Trumps plan to manage the day-to-day operations of the Scion hotels but leave that task to their partners at the American Idea properties.Trump executives had hinted that a three-star hotel chain was in the works in recent interviews, and in April 2016 they filed for a trademark on the American Idea name.At Trump Tower on Monday evening, Mr. Danziger and Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest sons announced that their partner in Mississippi would be an Indian-American family that through its company, Chawla Hotels, owns 17 hotels in the region. Those hotels are currently branded by well-known chains; the plan is to convert at least three of them to the American Idea line, Mr. Danziger said.American Idea will compete with nearly 20,000 other hotels in the so-called midscale and upper-midscale business, according to STR, a hotel data and analytics specialist. In Mississippi, there are about 250 such properties, and that, according to hotel experts, leaves room for new players.\u201cThere\u2019s always room for new brands,\u201d Jan A. deRoos, a professor of hotel finance and real estate at Cornell University, said, noting that Hilton had recently opened a more-affordable brand called Tru.As for the Trumps joining the three-star market, Professor deRoos said: \u201cThis completely opens up the world to them. The brand evolution is great. But as a president, he needs to separate himself from this.\u201dChawla Hotels will also be a partner in a Scion property being built in Cleveland, Miss., making it the first Scion location to be publicly announced. The boutique development is expected to include a restaurant and meeting space near a music museum. Mr. Danziger said he expected to announce four additional Scion hotels in the next couple of months, including one in Dallas.Mr. Burchfield has granted approval for the Trumps to proceed with Chawla Hotels as a partner, Mr. Danziger said.During the presidential campaign, the Chawlas became acquainted with the Trumps after Suresh Chawla, who runs the hotel business with his brother, wrote a letter that appeared in several local newspapers in the fall of 2015. It described how their father was inspired by Mr. Trump more than 25 years earlier when he sought advice about financing a hotel project. Suresh Chawla recalled how their father, a convenience store owner, had cold-called Mr. Trump\u2019s office in New York to ask for a $425,000 loan.Mr. Trump returned the call, the story goes. And while he did not offer a loan \u2014 Mr. Trump supposedly called the deal \u201csmall-fry\u201d \u2014 he instructed the elder Mr. Chawla to explore less conventional sources of funding and said he admired his immigrant story.Eventually, Mr. Trump met Suresh Chawla during a campaign visit last summer in Jackson, Miss. Mr. Chawla told The Mississippi Business Journal that Mr. Trump had encouraged him to \u201cthink grand\u201d with one of his projects.Months later, the Trumps contacted Mr. Chawla about possibly becoming partners with him and his brother, Dinesh Chawla. When Mr. Danziger heard the family\u2019s story, he called Mr. Chawla and briefed him on the new brand, he said.\u201cIt would be the most amazing thing on the planet,\u201d Mr. Danziger recalled telling him, \u201cif you were the first one.\u201dIn an interview, Suresh Chawla said the announcement was \u201cextremely surreal; my father should be here.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about plans by the Trump Organization to create a new three-star hotel chain with a patriotic flair, known as American Idea, that would echo President Trump\u2019s pledge to put America first misstated the year of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.

Here\u2019s a partial history of the prophetic year that somehow never passes into the past.The show opened with the image of a mushroom cloud and a warning that it was \u201cunsuitable for children or those with weak nerves.\u201d The next day, The Daily Express reported a casualty under the front-page headline \u201c1984: Wife Dies as She Watches.\u201d The BBC was flooded with complaints, and the British Housewives\u2019 League denounced it as \u201csadistic and horrible.\u201dIt had the lasting effect of turning Orwell\u2019s shadowy villain into a celebrity. \u201cThe term Big Brother, which the day before yesterday meant nothing to 99 percent of the population,\u201d The Times of London reported, \u201chas become a household phrase.\u201dDystopian echoes of the novel appeared in Anthony Burgess\u2019s \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d published in 1962, and the British television series \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d which began airing in 1967, but the Orwell estate kept a lid on outr\u00e9 direct adaptations, including a musical version by David Bowie.As 1984 itself approached, the news media ran numerous articles comparing Orwell\u2019s vision to reality. Shortly after the year arrived, the Soviet political journal New Times issued its own propaganda strike, in an article charging that Orwell\u2019s vision had come true \u2014 \u201cin the United States, under a \u2018Big Brother\u2019 named Ronald Reagan.\u201dIrony alert: The decommissioned Battersea Power Station in London, which doubled as the facade of the grim Victory Mansions apartment complex in the movie, is currently being transformed into a $17 billion development whose tenants include the new British headquarters for Apple.In the second-time-as-farce department, the novel\u2019s infamous torture chamber, Room 101, where victims confront the thing they fear most, has lent its name to a British comedy show in which celebrities discuss their pet peeves.

{"Headline": "Michael K. Williams Is More Than Omar From \u2018The Wire\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe Wire,\u201d HBO\u2019s five-season epic of Baltimore life, is a perennial contender for the greatest television series ever, and Michael K. Williams, in his role as the stickup man Omar Little, its most memorable actor. But on the show\u2019s first day of filming, when a prop person handed him his character\u2019s signature shotgun, Mr. Williams clutched it with a look of sheer bewilderment.\u201cHe didn\u2019t know which end was which,\u201d said David Simon, the creator and showrunner of \u201cThe Wire.\u201d \u201cMike is a beautiful man, but a gangster he is not.\u201dMr. Williams would not be deterred. Later that week, he left the set in Baltimore and returned home to East Flatbush, Brooklyn, and enlisted a local drug dealer to help hone his craft. Standing on the roof of the Vanderveer Estates, the man walked him through the particulars of firearms by spraying a hail of pellets into a steel door.\u201cBest acting lesson I ever had,\u201d Mr. Williams said.In the years since then, Mr. Williams, 50, has continued to draw inspiration for his characters from the world of Vanderveer, a housing complex now known as Flatbush Gardens, where he lived for much of his life. Time and again, his work has returned to the complicated intersection of race, masculinity, crime and institutional failure. After Omar, he was Chalky White, an Atlantic City bootlegger in \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d who reminded Mr. Williams of his father; then, in \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d Freddy Knight, a Rikers Island inmate like his nephew Dominic Dupont; and Ken Jones, a gay rights activist in \u201cWhen We Rise,\u201d whose battle with H.I.V. paralleled that of another nephew, who died.Mr. Williams, as Omar, will forever be remembered for his scowl, his scar, his mordant wit and the sawed-off shotgun he held at the ready, but he has always wanted more. Even today, when a film like \u201cMoonlight\u201d wins the Oscar for best picture, typecasting is still woefully commonplace, and black actors are still forced into one-dimensional roles. Mr. Williams has made a mission of depicting his community in all of its nuance and variety.Emmy nominations will be announced within a couple of weeks, but after years of snubs he is no longer counting on industry approval. Capitalizing on the continued relevance of \u201cThe Wire\u201d and the rest of his catalog, Mr. Williams is now delving into film and television production, and deepening his activist role with the American Civil Liberties Union.\u201cVanderveer is 59 buildings, six floors high, with seven apartments on each level,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThere are so many people here \u2014 beautiful and beautifully flawed people \u2014 and I want all of their stories to be told.\u201dIt was a warm Friday afternoon in June, the 15th anniversary of the premiere of \u201cThe Wire,\u201d and Mr. Williams was back in East Flatbush to celebrate with some friends. Though he lives in Williamsburg now, he goes back every few months to visit Vanderveer, a collection of red-brick buildings that stretches across 30 acres along Foster Avenue in the middle of Brooklyn. (Despite its rechristening, it will always be Vanderveer to everyone in Mr. Williams\u2019s orbit.) There, he walked down the street like a benign potentate, accepting compliments and memories, shaking hands and taking pictures with people on every corner. Some of them were strangers familiar with his work, but many more were friends and longtime neighbors who knew him not as Omar from \u201cThe Wire\u201d but Mike from Tower 3301. At one point, a young mother sheepishly stopped him to say she had named her child Omar in his honor.\u201cThe way a lot of us from the neighborhood see it, Mike is like the prophet of the projects,\u201d said Darrel Wilds, 50, who grew up with Mr. Williams in Vanderveer. \u201cHe\u2019s representing the people of this neighborhood to the world.\u201dBut even as he has worked to champion his community, Mr. Williams has often ended up falling victim to the perils he tried to elude there. Many of his roles have unearthed agonizing memories and plunged him into a serious drug addiction that he grapples with to this day. Indeed, the work that has vaulted him to fame has also nearly been his undoing.\u201cThe characters that mean the most to me are the ones that damn near kill me,\u201d he said, leaning back into a sidewalk bench on Foster Avenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a sacrifice I\u2019ve chosen to make.\u201dThe Vanderveer of Mr. Williams\u2019s childhood was often a landscape of drugs and violence. As he rode down the avenue, nearly every corner conjured a grisly memory. \u201cThat\u2019s where I saw my first shooting,\u201d he said, passing New York Avenue. Two blocks later: \u201cThat\u2019s where I first got robbed.\u201dBorn in 1966, Mr. Williams rarely envisioned a life beyond Brooklyn. His mother, an immigrant from the Bahamas, worked as a seamstress for much of her life before opening a small day care center that she ran out of Vanderveer. His father, who came from South Carolina, was a gregarious but wayward man who battled health problems.Starved of opportunities, many in the community took their cues from local gangsters, who exuded a swaggering masculinity that Mr. Williams contorted himself to realize.As a boy, he was sexually molested and the experience left him withdrawn and confused about his own sexuality. He never spoke of the abuse back then, but his peers seized on his vulnerability and tormented him relentlessly.\u201cThey had two nicknames for me: Blackie and Faggot Mike,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cI was very soft, very fragile.\u201dThough formal acting was not yet on the horizon, his life became a kind of delicate performance as he desperately tried to conform. He wore knockoff streetwear and learned to walk with a lean. As a favor to a friend, he smuggled balloons of marijuana into Rikers for a man he barely knew. He was 16. (The experience later helped inspire a plot point on \u201cThe Night Of.\u201d) Before long, he developed a drug problem of his own, and by 19, he was cycling in and out of clinics. To finance his addiction, he tried his hand at carjacking and credit card fraud, though the schemes left him with little more than a thickening arrest record.Alienated from his family and friends in Vanderveer, he found a sense of belonging at the gay bars of downtown Manhattan in the 1980s and \u201990s. Though he did not identify as gay himself, Mr. Williams relished the sheer liberty of carousing around a space unencumbered. Many weekends, he would dance until the early morning at clubs like the Roxy, Sound Factory and Palladium. His nimble moves even landed him some work as a part-time backup dancer.Then one night at a bar in Queens, on the eve of his 25th birthday, he stepped outside to find a group of men jumping his friend. When he tried to intervene, one of the muggers pulled out a razor blade and sliced him across his face and neck. One gash went straight through his jugular. The next day, his mother took out a second insurance policy on his life.\u201cShe told me I\u2019d never live to 30,\u201d Mr. Williams recalled, \u201cand I believed her.\u201dBut the attack that almost killed him left an indelible mark that also revived his life: a scar trailing diagonally down his face, from the top of his forehead to the middle of his right cheek. It was impossible to ignore. And it radically transformed his image.\u201cAll my life I\u2019m this cream puff, and next thing I know everyone sees me as some kind of gangster,\u201d he said. \u201cIt almost made me laugh.\u201dSoon enough, he was dancing in music videos and on tour alongside artists such as George Michael and Madonna, inevitably cast in the part of a street tough. His first substantial acting role came courtesy of no less an authority than Tupac Shakur, who tapped Mr. Williams to play his brother in the 1996 film \u201cBullet.\u201d Three years later, he appeared as a drug dealer in Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cBringing Out the Dead.\u201d Then it was a brief cameo on \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d And finally, in 2002, \u201cThe Wire.\u201dThough his credentials were modest and his technique still unpolished, Mr. Williams immediately stood out in his audition. \u201cHis read was good, but it was the scar,\u201d Ed Burns, the show\u2019s producer and co-creator, said. \u201cThis battle wound on his face seemed to say so much about who he was, what he\u2019d been through.\u201dIn Omar Little, Mr. Williams saw versions of himself and many of his friends, in all their complexities and inner conflicts. The character was at once menacing and jocular, openly gay and privately tortured, a lawless vigilante and regular churchgoer.\u201cOmar is this dark-skinned outspoken man in the hood who didn\u2019t care what anyone thought of him,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cHe is everything I wished I could be.\u201dHe made a point of accentuating those contrasts. During the filming of a scene in the first season involving Omar and his boyfriend, Brandon, Mr. Williams improvised a kiss that had not been in the script.\u201cI remember somebody immediately saying, \u2018There go our ratings,\u2019\u201d Mr. Burns recalled. \u201cThat sort of intimacy was not shown much then, but Mike insisted, and it breathed life into the character.\u201dWhen it came to technique, Mr. Williams relied on his own emotional acuity. Building off his experience in dance, he often made detailed musical playlists that corresponded with the mood of each episode. Before filming the scene when Omar was killed, for example, he listened to \u201cLet There Be Light,\u201d by the rapper Nas. To this day, he finds the song so affecting that the mere mention of it brings him to tears.The show\u2019s writers grew so enamored of Mr. Williams\u2019s mastery of his character that they began to challenge him for sport. \u201cWe started writing these Britishisms for him just to see if he could pull it off,\u201d Mr. Simon said. Once, they included the word \u201cconstabulating\u201d in the script as an inside joke they planned to cut. \u201cThat\u2019s a word that hasn\u2019t been said in the history of Baltimore, but he somehow made it work,\u201d he said.Even as \u201cThe Wire\u201d staggered in the ratings \u2014 it was initially more admired than watched \u2014 Omar became its icon, the subject of tribute art and academic dissertations. Nowhere was the performance more beloved than in East Flatbush. When Mr. Williams moved back into his apartment in Vanderveer after the first season, in 2002, the neighborhood men who had harassed him for years were suddenly currying his favor. The attention was intoxicating, but he couldn\u2019t help feeling unnerved.\u201cThere was just one small thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one was calling me Mike. They were calling me Omar. That\u2019s when the lines got blurred.\u201dWhat followed was something of an existential crisis. Months removed from filming, Mr. Williams struggled to shake the grave psyche of his character. He was racked by doubts both personal and political: Had he lost hold of his identity? Was he glorifying the ills of his community, or exposing their roots? He couldn\u2019t divine the answers, so he turned to cocaine.Even weighed down by addiction, Mr. Williams\u2019s acting was sharp \u2014 perhaps even more naturalistic \u2014 but off camera, his life was deteriorating. He blew most of his money on drugs and stopped paying rent until he was kicked out of Vanderveer. When he wasn\u2019t staying in a hotel during filming, he lived out of a single suitcase, often spending nights on a drug house floor in Newark. There were days he showed up to set visibly high, but the show\u2019s producers didn\u2019t dare let him go.\u201cWe worried that if he lost the work he\u2019d become truly untethered,\u201d Mr. Simon said.Mr. Williams made it through the show\u2019s run with the support of a church community he found in Newark, but his drug dependency lingered as he continued to question the impact of his work. During one particularly rough stretch in spring 2008, just after \u201cThe Wire\u201d ended, he was on a three-day-long bender when his mother brought him to a rally for Barack Obama in Harrisburg, Pa. Earlier during his campaign, Mr. Obama had declared \u201cThe Wire\u201d the best show on television and Omar his favorite character. When the two men met privately after the event, Mr. Williams, lock-jawed and high on cocaine, could barely speak.\u201cHearing my name come out of his mouth woke me up,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized that my work could actually make a difference.\u201dMr. Williams resolved to continue pursuing similarly powerful roles, no matter how agonizing the demons they unleashed. During the filming of the HBO series \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d he relapsed. For the role, he drew on the experience of his nephew Dominic, who was at Rikers awaiting trial in connection with a murder (and is now serving a sentence at the Green Haven Correctional Facility). Every day on the set forced him to confront the brutality of his nephew\u2019s incarceration, and every night he escaped that mentality with cocaine.\u201cAddiction doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an everyday struggle for me, but I\u2019m fighting.\u201dAlong with taking more commercially viable roles in films such as a coming installment of the Star Wars series, Mr. Williams is expanding his work into production. Among his projects in development are a film called \u201cBishop,\u201d which he describes as \u201ca hip-hop coming-of-age cautionary love story set in the Fort Greene projects\u201d; \u201cBrooklyn Chronicles,\u201d a television series examining the relationship between the West Indian immigrants and Orthodox Jews of East Flatbush; and an as-yet-unnamed documentary series about recovering from addiction.His desire to produce follows a lifetime of frustrations with the racial politics of the film industry, of \u201cfeeling like us black actors are rabbits jumping for a dangling carrot.\u201d\u201cWhile we\u2019re wasting our energy being angry about a damn statue, the crime happened months ago in a boardroom,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who has received hardly any award nominations. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough people of color behind the scenes, and that\u2019s where real change happens.\u201dMost immediately, he is completing a documentary to be released this fall through Vice on HBO. The project intends to detail the dangers and inequities of the American criminal justice system, particularly the juvenile justice system, largely focusing on the stories of three people close to Mr. Williams: his cousin Niven, who is trying to reintegrate into society after more than a decade in prison; his nephew Dominic; and his friend and \u201cWire\u201d co-star Felicia Pearson, who has cycled in and out of prison.Matt Horowitz, a producer for Vice who is working on the film, said the choice to collaborate with Mr. Williams was easy: He could simply draw more from his subjects than a typical reporter could. \u201cPeople know they can trust him with their stories because he\u2019s coming from a place of personal understanding,\u201d he said.In one scene, Mr. Williams visits a middle school in Newark, where he speaks with a seventh grader named Mike. The boy had maintained a reticent facade during filming but eventually opened up at Mr. Williams\u2019s coaxing, telling the harrowing story of his mother\u2019s death along with his father\u2019s abuse. \u201cI was abused too when I was younger,\u201d Mr. Williams tells the boy. \u201cAnd I did a lot of stupid stuff to hurt myself.\u201dFlashbacks of those past tribulations came to Mr. Williams in waves as he ambled through East Flatbush that June day. Though the neighborhood is already seeing the onset of gentrification, the blocks around Vanderveer felt to him as if they were suspended in amber. Young kids played stickball on the concrete courtyards, while older ones loitered in packs on the corners. Afternoon turned to evening, and everyone seemed to assemble on the handball courts to share a bottle of Hennessy, as a team of cops glowered from the periphery and threatened citations, the same dramas playing out unresolved and unending.\u201cMan, why do you even stay coming out here?\u201d a friend named Earl asked. \u201cWhy not Los Angeles?\u201dMr. Williams laughed. It\u2019s a question he gets a lot. \u201cI\u2019m over that old-school thought that you got to get out the hood,\u201d he said. Like many actors, he is prone to monologue and now the words were coming in a rush.\u201cWe\u2019ve been taught success means leaving the communities that made us, but this is the only place in the world where I feel free,\u201d he said. Despite the difficulties of his youth in East Flatbush, he still feels at peace there. \u201cTrust me, it gets lonely for a man like me in Brentwood, Calif.\u201dSatisfied with the answer, Earl passed Mr. Williams a shot of liquor. Cautiously, he raised the plastic cup to his lips and took a gulp.An earlier version of this article misstated a word inserted into Mr. Williams\u2019s dialogue on \u201cThe Wire\u201d as a joke. The word was \u201cconstabulating,\u201d not \u201cconfabulate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Works, Private Benefit", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAs to whether private financing resulted in more reliably completed and maintained projects, the C.B.O. found that it sometimes could be arranged more quickly than public financing, which allowed some projects to be completed sooner. But three of the projects went bankrupt and one required a public buyout of the private partners.In recent years, investor risk in privately financed projects has been reduced through heavier public subsidies, federal tax breaks, federal loans or state and local grants. But the more public backing there is for any given deal, the greater the chance that taxpayers will ultimately bear excessive costs \u2014 including debt, cost overruns and litigation. In effect, when private partnerships with significant public backing go well, investors reap most of the reward; when they go badly, taxpayers take a hit.A case in point is the South Bay Expressway in California, an $828 million private project whose financing included a $140 million federal loan. Completed in 2007, the project filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010. When the bankruptcy court imposed a new financing and ownership structure the following year, taxpayers essentially had to forfeit $73 million in loan principal and accrued interest, in all, a loss of 42 percent of the investment.It\u2019s bad enough that Mr. Trump is not tackling the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure needs. It\u2019s worse that he seems determined to use the limited funds he has scrounged to enrich private investors at taxpayers\u2019 expense.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mihai Tudose, Once Accused of Plagiarism, Is Romania\u2019s New Prime Minister", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA little-known former economy minister who surrendered his Ph.D. after plagiarism accusations was confirmed by Parliament on Thursday as Romania\u2019s prime minister, a decision that disappointed reformers.The party\u2019s leader, Liviu Dragnea, is widely seen as Romania\u2019s de facto leader, though he is ineligible to be prime minister because of a fraud conviction.Mr. Tudose, a member of Parliament since 2000, served two stints as economy minister since 2014, but remains a relatively obscure figure despite his time in public service.The appointment of Mr. Tudose and his cabinet disappointed some observers, who had in mind a requirement announced by the country\u2019s president, Klaus Iohannis, for the prime minister to be a figure of integrity and competence.\u201cPlagiarism, fraud, no connection whatsoever with the field that they are supposed to manage,\u201d Oana Suciu, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, said in assessing the new government.In Mr. Tudose, Mr. Dragnea has found a prime minister who is seen as malleable, one who will allow him to lead from behind the scenes. That arrangement, however, could make the government vulnerable to continued infighting among the Social Democrats.\u201cThere is a structural tension that leads to the sort of situation that we saw, the conflict between Dragnea and Grindeanu,\u201d said Paul Ivan, a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center, a Brussels think tank.A case in which Mr. Dragnea is accused of abusing power and instigating forgery will continue in September.But before Mr. Tudose\u2019s government was confirmed, his new finance minister, Ionut Misa, caused alarm by proposing a new income tax. He also hinted at changes to the country\u2019s pension program, only to be quickly contradicted by Mr. Dragnea.Analysts were immediately skeptical. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to raise money from new sources because they promised that they were going to increase salaries and realized that they didn\u2019t have the money,\u201d Ms. Suciu said.Observers predicted that the change in power would have minimal impact on the economy, which relies heavily on funding from the European Union and foreign investment. \u201cWhile the political turmoil is a cause of worry, Romania offers a combination of low wages, a good business infrastructure and consumers with strong affordability, which are usually hard to match,\u201d said Oru Mohiuddin, an analyst with Euromonitor, a market research firm.So far, however, the handling of the new tax and pension proposals suggests that opponents are watching closely and are ready to react. \u201cGiving people the impression that you are going to take the money they\u2019ve saved is never a good idea,\u201d Mr. Ivan said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Love of Adventure Leads to Love Near Home", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsLilly Leas was raised in Palm Beach, Fla., surrounded by the sea, bright tropical colors and a loving family with a strong work ethic. This was enthusiastically demonstrated by her grandmother Lilly Pulitzer, who designed a namesake collection of preppy pink, green and orange fashion frocks, which she originally sold at a small juice stand.Like her grandmother, Ms. Leas, 28, is smart, funny, down-to-earth and unafraid of challenges.\u201cMom and Lilly are similar in that they each loved working,\u201d said Minnie Pulitzer McCluskey, Ms. Leas\u2019s mother, adding: \u201cMom had tons of energy and a huge desire to create. Lilly is exactly the same.\u201dAfter founding a South Florida public relations firm and running it for two years, Lilly Leas quit to attend the University of Florida, where last month she received an M.B.A. Beginning in July, she will be in business management and corporate development at NextEra Energy, a nuclear electric power company in Juno Beach, Fla.Although Ms. Leas didn\u2019t formally meet Sean Ferreira until she was in high school, they lived four streets away from each other during her middle school years. They shared mutual friends and saw each other at the beach, but he was older and nothing developed beyond a casual friendship.In 2006, while he was a student at Florida Atlantic University, Mr. Ferreira, now a Southeast sales representative for Vans apparel, started a clothing company inspired by his passions for surfing, skateboarding, music and art.Ms. Leas was impressed with his enterprise and wanted to work for him while pursuing her undergraduate degree. \u201cI was entrepreneurial and really liked Sean\u2019s energy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was constantly smiling, and I liked being around him.\u201dMr. Ferreira, 32, didn\u2019t hire Ms. Leas but was taken with her moxie. \u201cShe was self-motivated and liked to tackle challenges,\u201d he said.They didn\u2019t get close until late 2008, when Mr. Ferreira, in his senior year, persuaded Ms. Leas to take a money and banking class with him. \u201cI\u2019m a morning person, so it took some convincing for me to agree to a three-hour Monday-night class,\u201d she said.After the course ended, they talked on the phone, texted and often played tennis, but there was no romance. \u201cWe were both focused on ourselves,\u201d Ms. Leas said. \u201cI was studying finance, and Sean was working hard to find the right career after he got his business degree. It was almost like we both needed to find our own paths before we could join each other\u2019s.\u201dIn late spring 2010, the night before Mr. Ferreira was departing for a monthlong international trip, he and Ms. Leas attended a party in West Palm Beach with 10 other friends. She realized there was something more to their connection. It was time to make a move.\u201cSean and I were friends for so long,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he gave me butterflies and I said to myself, \u2018It\u2019s now or never.\u2019 So I pulled him aside.\u201d Once they made eye contact, Ms. Leas had no doubt passion was in the room, but unfortunately so were their friends.\u201cWe were staring at each other, and we both knew,\u201d Ms. Leas said. \u201cWe tried to talk but kept getting yanked away and ended up going home separately.\u201dDuring the time he was gone they had no contact. But on the day he returned to Palm Beach, he called Ms. Leas. Their first date was a tennis match followed by sharing a pizza from the trunk of his vehicle. \u201cWe had a great time just being together,\u201d she said.They dated every weekend leading up to her 21st birthday party in late September, which was when Ms. Leas\u2019s family got a whiff of their romance. \u201cThere was real energy between us,\u201d Mr. Ferreira said.Mrs. McCluskey said: \u201cLilly had great high school boyfriends, but it was different with Sean from the very beginning. There was a spark, a twinkle in their eyes. We knew something special was happening even back then.\u201dTwo months later, Ms. Leas and Mr. Ferreira took their first vacation together, a spontaneous Christmas holiday break in Montreal. \u201cWe had so much fun that I decided to invite Sean on a 10-day family trip to the Bahamas,\u201d she said.But these trips are not for the faint of heart. Twenty or more members of the Pulitzer clan rent a house to snorkel, spearfish, swim, picnic and trawl with their boat. They also host competitive talent shows, which Ms. Leas often wins with her musical parodies of the family\u2019s vacations in the Bahamas.\u201cSean fit in with our family so well on that first trip,\u201d Mrs. McCluskey said. \u201cHe has this huge, amazing heart, and I have to admit that it was really fun to see how he loves to fish, dive, surf, travel and work like a fiend.\u201dIn April 2013, when Lilly Pulitzer died, Mr. Ferreira further bonded with the family, cutting short a California work trip. \u201cSean was there for me and my family like he always had been,\u201d Ms. Leas said. \u201cGranny was always full of life, and I like to remember Sean\u2019s time with her.\u201dNot long after, the couple learned Mr. Ferreira was offered a job with Vans that would take him across five states to visit clients. \u201cI was excited yet worried,\u201d Mr. Ferreira said of being away so often. \u201cBut Lilly encouraged me to do this. I learned a lot from her about never settling and always challenging myself.\u201dMr. Ferreira\u2019s father, David Ferreira, said it was just another indication of the couple\u2019s drive to succeed and their love for each other. \u201cThey feel comfortable with whatever they are doing together,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they are not on top of the other, they have always given each other space.\u201dIn 2014, Ms. Leas left a fund-raising job to start a public relations business, but this didn\u2019t keep the couple from running marathons together and traveling.Ms. Leas said both her family and Mr. Ferreira\u2019s instilled the idea that travel is an essential part of life. \u201cSo we\u2019ve always prioritized experiences over things,\u201d she said. \u201cWith no debt, good jobs and no kids, we\u2019ve been able to save a good amount and spend when we can on travel. We stay focused on earning, saving and planning the next adventure.\u201dThat fall, they flew to Japan, landed in Shinjuku and arrived at their hotel around 2 a.m., starving. \u201cWe had no plan but found a hole in the wall down a dark alley and ordered six unknown items that looked gross, but we ate them all,\u201d she said with a laugh.During the same trip, they visited Indonesia with their close friends Tyler Sargent and Camila Helander. \u201cLife is a big adventure for them,\u201d said Mr. Sargent, the best man in the wedding.But by 2016, as their romance was blazing and their careers booming, Ms. Leas announced she wanted to sell her business, follow her heart and study for an M.B.A., which would take her out of town and away from Mr. Ferreira.They discussed every aspect of such a major decision, such as the finances, how they would see each other and who would care for Conch, a rescue dog they adopted three years earlier. They decided Mr. Ferreira would keep the dog and send her regular photos. Ms. Leas was accepted to the University of Florida\u2019s accelerated program in Gainesville.While there, they talked constantly and saw each other frequently; Mr. Ferreira traveled to cities near Gainesville for work, and Ms. Leas went home many weekends. They even managed a long February weekend in Iceland where they dived in freezing water to touch two continental plates at the same time. They also survived a blizzard on a lonely road while there.\u201cI was so scared, but Sean stayed cool,\u201d Ms. Leas said. \u201cWe laughed and got through it. That moment is when I knew I wanted to look at Sean\u2019s smile for the rest of my life.\u201dOn July 1, during another Pulitzer family vacation in the Bahamas, Ms. Leas and Mr. Ferreira were gazing at shooting stars over the ocean aboard the Sea Hunter, the Pulitzer family boat. An engagement ring, with a conch pearl cleverly hidden under a diamond, was in Mr. Ferreira\u2019s pocket when he proposed, blurting out: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of our lives together.\u201dThey were married May 20 on a picture-perfect evening at the Sailfish Club of Florida near their childhood homes. Before about 40 close friends and relatives, Ken Mahanes, an ordained Southern Baptist Minister, officiated the short nondenominational ceremony written mostly by Ms. Leas.Dr. Mahanes told the guests: \u201cLilly loves Sean\u2019s passion and drive, and Sean loves every part of Lilly, who views life as an adventure.\u201d Dr. Mahanes then turned to Ms. Leas, who was wearing an ivory Hayley Paige A-line gown with a beaded bodice, flowing chiffon skirt and T-strap back, and continued: \u201cSean admires your courage. Every day he falls more in love with you.\u201dGuests clapped and cheered as the couple enjoyed a lingering kiss.\u201cLilly has the best heart and is so smart,\u201d said Ms. Helander, a bridesmaid. \u201cSean\u2019s heart is on his sleeve, and he is always in a good mood. They are not interested in material things, each loves life experiences. They are the luckiest humans on earth because they met each other.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of a bridesmaid. She is Camila Helander, not Claudia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.K. to Fund Abortions in England for Women From Northern Ireland", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was an abrupt rebuff to the Conservatives\u2019 new ally, the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, a fierce opponent of abortion and gay marriage that had appeared to advance its socially conservative agenda this week by agreeing to keep Mrs. May in power.The issue is a delicate one because in Northern Ireland abortions are allowed only if a woman\u2019s life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her physical or mental health. Pregnant women who travel to England, where the law is much less restrictive, currently have to pay for terminations.The about-face on the issue was bitterly denounced by abortion opponents. \u201cThis is a black day for unborn children, for mothers and for democracy,\u201d said John Smeaton, chief executive of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the abortion industry, which cares nothing about unborn children and for the welfare of women.\u201dThe government\u2019s announcement came before a vote on the issue in Parliament, on an amendment forced by Stella Creasy, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, and amid signs that some of Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party legislators might rebel, putting her parliamentary majority in doubt.The concession underlines the precariousness of the government\u2019s position, and its vulnerability to political ambush in Parliament, where it now runs the constant risk of losing votes after Mrs. May lost her majority in recent elections.Conservative worries about the ability to win votes in Parliament were displayed on Wednesday when the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was summoned from Switzerland to vote on the Queen\u2019s Speech, which outlines the government\u2019s legislative program. On Thursday, Mrs. May left meetings in Berlin early to ensure that she could attend the final vote on the Queen\u2019s Speech, which the government won by a vote of 323 to 309 with the help of the largely Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, or D.U.P.\u201cI can barely put into words my anger at the deal my party has done with the D.U.P.,\u201d Heidi Allen, a Conservative legislator, said in Parliament.Others have suggested that because of its reliance on the D.U.P., the British government will no longer be able to act as an honest broker in trying to secure a power-sharing agreement among the political parties in Northern Ireland. Negotiations on that issue were extended on Thursday, despite the lack of agreement when the latest deadline expired in midafternoon.Under the deal with the Conservatives at Westminster, the D.U.P. guaranteed its support for Mrs. May\u2019s party on crucial confidence and finance votes, and on the issue of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, effectively keeping the government from falling.Both the Conservative Party and the D.U.P. emphasize that they have not formed a coalition, and that their arrangement in Parliament falls short of a deal on a full policy program. As such, the decision to fund abortions does not breach any part of the accord.The government concession was announced by the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, who was asked by a Conservative lawmaker, Peter Bottomley, why, in the case of women from Northern Ireland, \u201conly the poor should be denied lawful abortions.\u201dMr. Hammond replied that Justine Greening, the minister for women and equalities, was in the process of announcing by letter \u201cthat she intends to intervene to fund abortions in England for women arriving here from Northern Ireland.\u201dThe British Pregnancy Advisory Service, an organization that supports abortion rights, described the change as a \u201clandmark moment,\u201d but, in a statement added, \u201cClearly this is not the solution to the gross injustice whereby women in Northern Ireland are denied access to abortion care at home, and we look forward to seeing progress on that front.\u201dJo Swinson, a lawmaker from the centrist Liberal Democrats who supported the amendment on abortion, said the government\u2019s decision showed \u201cthe power of cross-party pressure.\u201d She added that it was \u201cembarrassing that the health secretary had done nothing on this so far and only the threat of a defeat prompted change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Billions\u2019 Worth of Baubles Could Wind Up in U.S. Hands in 1MDB Case", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchProsecutors may not be able to convict the individuals involved in suspect transfers, but an important tool in the federal arsenal lets them seize assets that are tied to foreign corruption, even if none of the criminal conduct took place within this country.The complaint details how 1 Malaysia Development Berhad, known as 1MDB, raised money by selling bonds that would help fund development in the country. The Justice Department claims that from 2009 through 2014, over $4.5 billion was diverted to benefit those with ties to Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Najib Razak, who ostensibly oversaw the fund, including as much as $1 billion funneled to accounts he may have controlled.The Justice Department routinely seeks to seize assets in criminal cases as one part of the indictment. If it wins a conviction, then a defendant is liable to return anything of value derived from the crime. In addition, the government can also seek \u201csubstitute assets,\u201d which means it can seize any other money or property that might be available if the proceeds of the crime are not enough to satisfy the full amount of the forfeiture order.Unlike a criminal prosecution, a civil asset forfeiture case allows the government to seize only assets that it can trace to the underlying crimes. That puts a premium on following the flow of money, and the complaint goes into great detail in describing how cash flowed out of accounts controlled by 1MDB through banks in Switzerland, Singapore and Luxembourg before reaching the United States and Britain to pay for the assets prosecutors want to seize.A crucial limitation on this defense is that if the person acquired the property after the illegal conduct, then that person must be a \u201cbona fide purchaser or seller for value\u201d to avoid forfeiture. If it was received as a gift, rather than being bought or sold in an ordinary transaction, then the person can be compelled to turn it over to the government, regardless of whether the recipient knew how it was acquired. So the adage that \u201cpossession is nine-tenths of the law\u201d does not apply here.The complaint identifies gifts given to Leonardo DiCaprio by Jho Low and Riza Aziz, Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson, who set up the movie production company Red Granite Pictures with 1MDB funds. Among the gifts to Mr. DiCaprio, who starred in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d which Red Granite financed, were a collage by Jean-Michel Basquiat valued at $9.2 million, a Picasso painting worth $3.2 million and the Oscar statuette won by Marlon Brando in 1955.Mr. DiCaprio has returned the gifts, perhaps because he had no basis to claim he was an innocent owner to resist the government\u2019s effort to seize them.One potential issue facing any defendant outside the country who wants to fight an asset forfeiture case is that the court could require the person to come to the United States to be examined as part of the discovery process. That would entail a risk that the government could arrest and charge the person with the money laundering if there is evidence of involvement in diverting funds from 1MDB.If the Justice Department succeeds in seizing the property, an interesting question is whether those assets should be returned to Malaysian officials. Since the complaint in effect names Mr. Najib as a recipient of some of the money diverted from the fund, it would be anomalous to then turn it back over to his government.The size of the supposed misappropriation from 1MDB is stunning, and the power of the Justice Department to fight foreign corruption means that government officials who try to loot their own treasuries must beware that the United States will do its best to take the proceeds of crime away from them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley Billionaires Remaking America\u2019s Schools", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "Supported byEducation DisruptedIn San Francisco\u2019s public schools, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, is giving middle school principals $100,000 \u201cinnovation grants\u201d and encouraging them to behave more like start-up founders and less like bureaucrats.In Maryland, Texas, Virginia and other states, Netflix\u2019s chief, Reed Hastings, is championing a popular math-teaching program where Netflix-like algorithms determine which lessons students see.In the space of just a few years, technology giants have begun remaking the very nature of schooling on a vast scale, using some of the same techniques that have made their companies linchpins of the American economy. Through their philanthropy, they are influencing the subjects that schools teach, the classroom tools that teachers choose and fundamental approaches to learning.The involvement by some of the wealthiest and most influential titans of the 21st century amounts to a singular experiment in education, with millions of students serving as de facto beta testers for their ideas. Some tech leaders believe that applying an engineering mind-set can improve just about any system, and that their business acumen qualifies them to rethink American education.But the philanthropic efforts are taking hold so rapidly that there has been little public scrutiny.Tech companies and their founders have been rolling out programs in America\u2019s public schools with relatively few checks and balances, The New York Times found in interviews with more than 100 company executives, government officials, school administrators, researchers, teachers, parents and students.Furthermore, there is only limited research into whether the tech giants\u2019 programs have actually improved students\u2019 educational results.One of the broadest philanthropic initiatives directly benefits the tech industry.Mr. Hastings of Netflix and other tech executives rejected the idea that they wielded significant influence in education. The mere fact that classroom internet access has improved, Mr. Hastings said, has had a much greater impact in schools than anything tech philanthropists have done.\u201cIn our society as a democracy, I think it is healthy that there is a debate about what are the goals of public education,\u201d Mr. Hastings added.Captains of American industry have long used their private wealth to remake public education, with lasting and not always beneficial results.What is different today is that some technology giants have begun pitching their ideas directly to students, teachers and parents \u2014 using social media to rally people behind their ideas. Some companies also cultivate teachers to spread the word about their products.Such strategies help companies and philanthropists alike influence public schools far more quickly than in the past, by creating legions of supporters who can sway legislators and education officials.\u201cWe should be asking a lot more questions about who is behind the curtain,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Mr. Benioff, the billionaire behind Salesforce, had a blunt message for San Francisco\u2019s mayor and its schools superintendent.It was 2013, and the two city officials had approached Mr. Benioff hoping to persuade him to pony up a few million dollars to install Wi-Fi in schools and buy some classroom laptops. But the request seemed too penny-ante to the software mogul.\u201cThat\u2019s when I had to say, \u2018You guys need to think bigger!\u2019\u201d Mr. Benioff recalled in an interview in his San Francisco home. He urged the superintendent to imagine \u201cwhat nirvana would look like\u201d in his schools, if money were no object.With that conversation, Mr. Benioff set in motion a transformation of the relationship between philanthropist and public education. He has emerged as a kind of personal venture capitalist to the city\u2019s public schools \u2014 one intent on remaking a traditional school bureaucracy in Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurial image.Mr. Benioff ultimately pledged $100 million over a decade to the San Francisco Unified School District through his company\u2019s nonprofit arm, Salesforce.org. Unlike conventional benefactors, he is hands-on: School district administrators now submit an annual grant wish list to the Salesforce.org board for review. And Mr. Benioff dispenses not just money, but also management prescriptions.\u201cHe\u2019s almost a public-sector V.C.,\u201d said Richard A. Carranza, who was then the superintendent of San Francisco schools.Mr. Benioff rejected the notion that his approach to education philanthropy was venture-capitalist-like. \u201cWe are not giving them a new religion,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are trying to work with them in a smart way and augment what they are doing.\u201dThe partnership with the district kicked off in 2012 when San Francisco\u2019s mayor, Edwin M. Lee, asked Mr. Benioff to help the city\u2019s middle schools. The mayor wanted to give students a better chance at landing tech jobs. And he wanted Mr. Benioff to pay for it.\u201cI would like to give our kids the opportunity, when they graduate, to see themselves working at those tech companies,\u201d Mr. Lee recalled telling Mr. Benioff.But Mr. Benioff\u2019s \u201cthink bigger\u201d mandate also led to culture clashes. Chief among these: He established a Principal\u2019s Innovation Fund, which awards annual unrestricted grants of $100,000 to the principal at each of the district\u2019s 21 middle and K-8 schools.Administrators subsequently asked principals to select projects that fit with the district\u2019s priorities. Principals have used the grants to start robotics clubs, provide English-tutoring programs for immigrant students and redesign a school library with hangout zones where children can sit with their laptops.Mr. Benioff said he knew that his methods pushed some administrators beyond their comfort zones. \u201cYou\u2019d have the same issue at Salesforce if somebody from the outside came in and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to help you to blah-blah-blah,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBureaucrats would try to stop them.\u201dSo far, Salesforce.org has provided about $20 million to the schools. By hiring additional teachers, schools reduced the average class size across eighth-grade math to 24 students from 33 \u2014 enabling teachers to give more individualized instruction, district officials said.\u201cPeople think school districts are too bureaucratic, can\u2019t be nimble and can\u2019t innovate,\u201d Mr. Carranza said. \u201cWe are proving that this is just not true.\u201dThere are limits to Mr. Benioff\u2019s approach: Most school districts will not be able to secure their own billionaire benefactors. But Mr. Benioff said he intended to keep working with local schools for decades to come.\u201cThis is not just a sea gull strategy where we are dumping a bunch of money and leaving town,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe are in the trenches.\u201dThey also share a guardian angel: Mr. Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive.In 2009, he heard about a start-up that used artificial intelligence to adapt math lessons to students. The math program worked a bit like the software Netflix used to customize its video recommendations.\u201cIt is probably fair to say I recognized the power of personalization maybe more than other people, because I had seen it in my own working life,\u201d Mr. Hastings said in an interview at Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles office.There was just one problem: DreamBox Learning was running low on cash. So Mr. Hastings stepped in, donating about $11 million to a nonprofit charter-school fund so it could buy the math platform.Today, more than two million students use the program for supplemental math instruction.DreamBox takes elements from animated video games, with some math lessons populated by aliens that whoosh about and animals that cluck. When students complete a math lesson successfully, they earn points that they can use to unlock virtual rewards.Administrators in some districts said that students so enjoyed the math program that some had begged their parents to let them play DreamBox even during trips to the supermarket. But four parents with children in public schools in Baltimore County, Md., said the program was so stimulating that they had curbed its use at home.\u201cIt really can suck a kid in,\u201d said Brenda Peiffer, a former school counselor, whose son, a third grader, was assigned DreamBox for homework. After noticing that he seemed more interested in spending points to customize his avatar than in actually doing math, she put the kibosh on DreamBox. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing it at home,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect solution for everyone,\u201d she said.And some experienced teachers said it was preposterous to think that algorithms could be better than skilled teachers at adapting to students\u2019 abilities. \u201cWhat you are seeing right now is a heavy push to disrupt and diminish the role of teachers as experts,\u201d said Arienne Adamcikova, a high school teacher in San Mateo, Calif.Mr. Hastings saw it differently.DreamBox Learning tracks a student\u2019s every click, correct answer, hesitation and error \u2014 collecting about 50,000 data points per student per hour \u2014 and uses those details to adjust the math lessons it shows. And it uses data to help teachers pinpoint which math concepts students may be struggling with.Mr. Hastings described DreamBox as a tool teachers could use to gain greater insights into their students, much the way that physicians use medical scans to treat individual patients. \u201cA doctor without an X-ray machine is not as good a doctor,\u201d Mr. Hastings said.Is DreamBox effective?DreamBox is among the minority of digital learning start-ups that have allowed independent academic researchers to examine and publicly report on their data. Still, the platform\u2019s effectiveness is difficult to gauge.Even so, Ms. Woolley-Wilson, DreamBox\u2019s chief executive, described the study as good news, saying it confirmed encouraging reports from teachers. She pointed out that, unlike DreamBox, many other education start-ups lacked research to prove even the most basic assumption: that their apps did not harm students\u2019 educational results.\u201cThat sounds like a low bar,\u201d Ms. Woolley-Wilson said. \u201cBut with the history of education technology, it is not.\u201dMr. Hastings (who is a company director but has no financial interest in the math company) said he was enthusiastic about DreamBox\u2019s potential and predicted wider classroom use for the technology as artificial intelligence improved.Still, he emphasized that he did not view technology generally as a panacea for education. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little cynical and jaundiced about technology,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe tech can help, but it is often oversold.\u201dIf Facebook\u2019s Mr. Zuckerberg has his way, children the world over will soon be teaching themselves \u2014 using software his company helped build.It\u2019s a conception that upends a longstanding teaching dynamic. Now educators are no longer classroom leaders, but helpmates.In public remarks and Facebook posts, Mr. Zuckerberg has described how it works. Students cluster together, working at laptops. They use software to select their own assignments, working at their own pace. And, should they struggle at teaching themselves, teachers are on hand to guide them.\u201cWhen you visit a school like this, it feels like the future \u2014 it feels like a start-up,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told an audience last fall in Peru. \u201cYou get the feeling this is how more of the education system should work.\u201dHe is well on his way to achieving this vision. In 2015, 19 American schools introduced the software that Facebook helped develop. This school year, more than 100 schools use it. Next fall, Mr. Zuckerberg said, he expects that \u201cmany hundreds of more schools will upgrade.\u201dThe effort began a few years ago with visits by Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician who is his wife, to Summit Denali, a middle school in Sunnyvale, Calif. There, classrooms lack walls, and students with laptops often zoom around on caster chairs.Mr. Zuckerberg, she said, admired the software that Summit had created for its schools. He offered Ms. Tavenner a team of Facebook engineers to further develop it and make it available free to schools nationwide.Summit developed its student-directed learning approach after administrators there discovered that their teachers had been so supportive of students, Ms. Tavenner said, that many of its graduates were struggling in college, unprepared to pace themselves or seek help.That is how Summit\u2019s platform came to show students every lesson they will need to complete for the year. They may tackle lessons in any order. At the end of each unit, they take a 10-question multiple-choice test.Not all educators agree. Four former Summit teachers said they found the system problematic. They asked that their names be withheld, saying they feared repercussions for their careers.At Summit, they said, they were required to teach students cognitive skills (like how to construct an argument) while making students responsible for teaching themselves underlying lesson material (like how diverse plants and animals coexist). But some students raced through lessons without actually understanding basic facts, the teachers said, making it difficult to help them structure arguments on specific topics, like climate change.Ms. Tavenner of Summit, however, said that was exactly the point: to make students discover for themselves that they cannot succeed on applied projects without learning the fundamentals.Students think to themselves, \u201c\u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to actually go back and deeply understand it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Tavenner said. \u201cThose are the habits of success that we are trying to instill in kids that simply don\u2019t get instilled in the normal system.\u201dIt can be a steep learning curve.\u201cKids were self-pacing to failure,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.Teachers remedied that by helping students set realistic goals. The school is now happy with the program, she said, and has expanded it to the seventh grade. Even so, Ms. Fisher said, \u201cWe definitely have a concern about the quality of the assessments in the curriculum and whether it actually promotes deeper learning.\u201d\u201cOur hope over the next decade is to help upgrade a majority of these schools to personalized learning and then start working globally as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told the audience. \u201cGiving a billion students a personalized education is a great thing to do.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Trump Hands the Chinese a Gift: The Chance for Global Leadership", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has managed to turn America First into America Isolated.In pulling out of the Paris climate accord, Mr. Trump has created a vacuum of global leadership that presents ripe opportunities to allies and adversaries alike to reorder the world\u2019s power structure. His decision is perhaps the greatest strategic gift to the Chinese, who are eager to fill the void that Washington is leaving around the world on everything from setting the rules of trade and environmental standards to financing the infrastructure projects that give Beijing vast influence.Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks in the Rose Garden on Thursday were also a retreat from leadership on the one issue, climate change, that unified America\u2019s European allies, its rising superpower competitor in the Pacific, and even some of its adversaries, including Iran. He did it over the objections of much of the American business community and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, who embraced the Paris accord when he ran Exxon Mobil, less out of a sense of moral responsibility and more as part of the new price of doing business around the world.As Mr. Trump announced his decision, the Paris agreement\u2019s goals were conspicuously reaffirmed by friends and rivals alike, including nations where it would have the most impact, like China and India, as well as the major European Union states and Russia.The announcement came only days after he declined to give his NATO allies a forceful reaffirmation of America\u2019s commitment to their security, and a few months after he abandoned a trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that was designed to put the United States at the center of a trade group that would compete with \u2014 and, some argue, contain \u2014 China\u2019s fast-growing economic might.\u201cThe irony here is that people worried that Trump would come in and make the world safe for Russian meddling,\u201d said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was briefly considered, then rejected, for a top post in the new administration. \u201cHe may yet do that,\u201d Mr. Haass added, \u201cbut he has certainly made the world safe for Chinese influence.\u201dThe president, and his defenders, argue that such views are held by an elite group of globalists who have lost sight of the essential element of American power: economic growth. Mr. Trump made that argument explicitly in the Rose Garden with his contention that the Paris accord amounted to nothing more than \u201ca massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.\u201dIn short, he turned the concept of the agreement on its head. While President Barack Obama argued that the United Nations Green Climate Fund \u2014 a financial institution to help poorer nations combat the effects of climate change \u2014 would benefit the world, Mr. Trump argued that the American donations to the fund, which he halted, would beggar the country.\u201cOur withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d Mr. Trump said.That, in short, encapsulates how Mr. Trump\u2019s view of preserving American power differs from all of his predecessors, back to President Harry S. Truman. His proposed cuts to contributions to the United Nations and to American foreign aid are based on a presumption that only economic and military power count. \u201cSoft power\u201d \u2014 investments in alliances and broader global projects \u2014 are, in his view, designed to drain influence, not add to it, evident in the fact that he did not include the State Department among the agencies that are central to national security, and thus require budget increases.It will take years to determine the long-term effects of his decision to abandon the Paris agreement, to the environment and to the global order. It will not break alliances: Europe is hardly about to embrace a broken, corrupt Russia, and China\u2019s neighbors are simultaneously drawn to its immense wealth and repelled by its self-interested ambitions.But Mr. Trump has added to the arguments of leaders around the world that it is time to rebalance their portfolios by effectively selling some of their stock in Washington. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has already announced her plan to hedge her bets, declaring last weekend after meeting Mr. Trump that she had realized \u201cthe times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent, over.\u201dThat may be temporary: It is still possible that Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday will amount to a blip in history, a withdrawal that takes so long \u2014 four years \u2014 that it could be reversed after the next presidential election. But for now it leaves the United States declaring that it is better outside the accord than in, a position that, besides America, has so far only been taken by Syria and Nicaragua. (Syria did not sign on because it is locked in civil war, Nicaragua because it believes the world\u2019s richest nations did not sacrifice enough.)But it is the relative power balance with China that absorbs anyone who studies the dance of great powers. Even before Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, President Xi Jinping had figured out how to embrace the rhetoric, if not the substance, of global leadership.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?Mr. Xi is no free trader, and his nation has overtaken the United States as the greatest emitter of carbon by a factor of two. Only three years ago, it was a deal between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi that laid the groundwork for what became the broader Paris agreement.Yet for months the Chinese president has been stepping unto the breach, including giving speeches at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that made it sound like China alone was ready to adopt the role of global standard-setter that Washington has occupied since the end of World War II.\u201cWhat you\u2019d expect us to do is sustain our position by maintaining our most important relationship around the world and address what the citizens of our allies consider their most important problems: economic growth and an environment that sustains their children and grandchildren,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cInstead, we are absenting the field.\u201dThat sentiment was evident on Thursday in Berlin. Just hours before Mr. Trump spoke, China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, stood alongside Ms. Merkel, and used careful words as he described China as a champion of the accord. China believed that fighting climate change was an \u201cinternational responsibility,\u201d Mr. Li said, the kind of declaration that American diplomats have made for years when making the case to combat terrorism or nuclear proliferation or hunger.China has long viewed the possibility of a partnership with Europe as a balancing strategy against the United States. Now, with Mr. Trump questioning the basis of NATO, the Chinese are hoping that their partnership with Europe on the climate accord may allow that relationship to come to fruition faster than their grand strategy imagined.Naturally, the Chinese are using the biggest weapon in their quiver: Money. Their plan, known as \u201cOne Belt, One Road,\u201d is meant to buy China influence from Ethiopia to Britain, from Malaysia to Hungary, all the while refashioning the global economic order.Mr. Xi announced the sweeping initiative last month, envisioning spending $1 trillion on huge infrastructure projects across Africa, Asia and Europe. It is a plan with echoes of the Marshall Plan and other American efforts at aid and investment, but on a scale with little precedent in modern history. And the clear subtext is that it is past time to toss out the rules of aging, American-dominated international institutions, and to conduct commerce on China\u2019s terms.David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Jane Perlez from Beijing. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting from Paris, and Somini Sengupta from the United Nations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "FeatureAndrew Left sniffs out corporate fraud \u2014 and gets rich doing it.Supported byIn the finance world, Left, 46, is what is known as an \u201cactivist\u201d short-seller. After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company\u2019s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries \u2014 Tesla, Valeant, GoPro \u2014 and though he makes mistakes, he has an unusually high success rate.For a year he had been assembling a file on Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefits manager with $100 billion in revenue. Pharmacy-benefits managers occupy an eye-glazingly complex netherworld in the prescription-drug supply chain, serving as intermediaries between drug makers and insurers. Express Scripts ostensibly exists to keep drug prices low, by negotiating with drug makers on behalf of insurers, but Left believed that the company was actually inflating them, because higher prices meant larger rebates from the drug makers, which meant more profit. He believed that this was true of all pharmacy-benefits managers, but especially of Express Scripts, the most powerful. Its second-largest customer was the Department of Defense; downward pressure on drug pricing from the government could seriously threaten its bottom line.By rights, then, Trump\u2019s threat in the interview should have tanked Express Scripts\u2019 stock. That the price remained unchanged indicated to Left that many people on Wall Street had no clue what a pharmacy-benefits manager does. Trump, he thought as he pulled out of the Madison Club, had given his stale, year-old story a fresh hook. (A spokesman for Express Scripts denied Left\u2019s claims, noting that \u201croughly 90 percent of rebates go directly to our clients.\u201d)Fifteen minutes later, Left was driving west on Interstate 10 in his black Bentley Continental GT. From the car, he placed a call to a hedge-fund manager, a man who was already short Express Scripts and therefore had a stake in providing Left with information. Express Scripts, this man reminded Left, did not disclose the amount it made in rebates, while some of its operating metrics exceeded those of Apple; something seemed wrong.Left heard \u201crebates\u201d and thought \u201ckickbacks.\u201d Express Scripts was, in Left\u2019s mind, \u201cthe man behind the man\u201d; it was \u201cthe mob.\u201d If he went public with a short position tomorrow, he wagered, he could sour Wall Street\u2019s perception of the company, transforming it from a sure thing into a noisy, chaotic mess. That attention might in turn attract regulators, further driving down the share price. He called his web designer, Mike Leznik, and told him that he wanted to buy a domain name to host his research on Express Scripts. An hour later the road snaked above Studio City, and he arrived at Mulholland Estates, his gated community in Beverly Hills.The next morning, Left stood in his home office and put CNBC on the television. The anchors were discussing the \u201cTrump bump,\u201d as the recent stock rally was being called. \u201cThey sit around all day long without ever knowing anything,\u201d Left said. \u201cIt\u2019s so annoying to watch them.\u201d Seated beneath the TV was Leznik, a sweet-natured Angeleno in jeans and blue-suede sneakers. Leznik lacked the macho swagger that made Left, with his money and filthy mouth, the center of a room. Nowhere was this truer than in his office. A giant desk dominated the back half. On the credenza sat cigar boxes from Enron and Madoff Securities \u2014 a short-seller\u2019s version of trophy antlers.\u201cWhat should I register the domain name as?\u201d Leznik asked.\u201cYour mother is a whore dot com?\u201d Left said.\u201cThe real story of \u2014 \u201d Leznik suggested.\u201cThe real story of your mother being a whore?\u201d Left said.Leznik settled on TheRealExpressScripts.com, then asked Left for his credit card to buy the URL.\u201cWhat are you, my wife?\u201d Left said.There were several obvious comebacks to this \u2014 \u201cYou wish\u201d being the absolute minimum \u2014 but none occurred to Leznik, who after fumbling for a moment said, \u201cI could be, if you had enough room.\u201d A whiff. The room was silenced.At 10 a.m., having placed his bet against the stock the night before, Left put out his first tweet, which he misspelled and deleted four times. Such is his mystique in the world of finance, however, that one of his followers assumed that the misspellings and deletions were part of a premeditated scheme to exploit Twitter\u2019s visibility algorithms. Finally the corrected version of the tweet came out from Left\u2019s handle, @CitronResearch, followed moments later by another: \u201cWhen @RealDonaldTrump goes after $ESRX,\u201d it read, using the ticker symbol for Express Scripts, \u201cheads will roll.\u201d We sat back and waited, eyes on CNBC. Twenty minutes passed. Suddenly a news flash interrupted the show. \u201cExpress Scripts shares are falling sharply on a spike in volume,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cCitron Research, run by Andrew Left, tweeted about the stock. They\u2019re now down by 9 or 10 percent, about 9.2 million shares so far.\u201d Left\u2019s tweet appeared in the corner of the screen. In the office, the atmosphere went taut.We watched as the stock came down, dollar after dollar, from 75 to 74 to 73; 72, 71, 70. Left wrote two more tweets, including a promise to appear on television with further revelations. Soon, the phone started ringing \u2014 reporters calling. Linette Lopez from Business Insider texted for quotes. CNBC booked him for 2 p.m. that day. \u201cThe question is,\u201d Left told a journalist from Bloomberg, \u201cis the new administration serious? He\u2019s going to rein in drug pricing. O.K., Mr. Trump, here\u2019s my advice: I know the industry. Go after Express Scripts.\u201d\u201cDo you have a short position?\u201d the reporter from Bloomberg asked.\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Left said.\u201cExpress Scripts, as we\u2019re talking, continues to drop,\u201d the anchor on CNBC said.In 15 minutes, $6 billion of market capitalization vanished. (Five months later, the stock price is still down 13 percent.) Left considered the circus around him. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201csome guys know this stuff better than me. But I know how to put it in [expletive] tweets.\u201dAt any given moment, someone, somewhere, has a short position in whatever stock you can think of \u2014 99 percent of all stocks in the world, by some estimates. Blue-chip stocks like Apple and Google are being shorted. Shake Shack is being shorted to an unhealthy degree: Almost half its shares are borrowed. As you read this, people are short on The New York Times. Almost uniquely among Wall Street maneuvers, short-selling entails what traders call infinite downside. While potential profit is constrained by the distance between the current share price and zero, the potential loss is not, because the shares, once borrowed, can rise in price indefinitely, which means the cost of returning them can, too. It\u2019s unsurprising that short-sellers tend to be aggressive men who are convinced that they see what other people miss and are comfortable with \u2014 or addicted to \u2014 risk.For many years that risk was taken on in secret: Short-sellers would make their bets and passively wait for the market to move in their direction. The figure of the activist, who goes public with his positions, emerged into prominence in recent years. One crucial event in Wall Street history provided the foundation. In 2001, James Chanos, a hedge-fund manager, discovered an accounting scandal at Enron, then a little-known energy company in Texas, and shared his information with journalists from Fortune. The journalists got a best seller, Chanos got his money and Jeffrey Skilling, Enron\u2019s chief executive, got 24 years at the Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Ala.Short-sellers of Left\u2019s generation are following this example but cutting out the middleman. You don\u2019t need an office in a flashy building in the Battery, they have realized, or the validation of the press. If you build enough of a reputation, all you need are some Twitter followers and a website. Left has emerged at the forefront of this new guard. Unlike Chanos, who managed billions of dollars of other people\u2019s money, Left invests his own, which exempts him from disclosing his holdings to the public. And now that his work has brought him national attention, he has found that others are willing to make it easier, by leaking documents to him and passing tips. In many cases, Left\u2019s dossiers against his targets are not wholly his own but built using information from a confidential source. He is, in this sense, a bit like a journalist.He also makes it look easy. One result of Left\u2019s fame is that today\u2019s younger traders believe that they, too, could be him. Wuyang Zhao, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who wrote his dissertation on activist short-selling, told me: \u201cPeople read Andrew Left, and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, my God, it\u2019s not impossibly difficult. It\u2019s not a lot of work, and you can bring down a big company.\u2019\u2009\u201d One of Left\u2019s friends recalled a visit Left made to a university to give a lecture. In the hallways afterward, the students swarmed him. \u201cIt was like he was Mick Jagger,\u201d the friend said.From 2006 to 2015, the number of activist short campaigns rose by 1,300 percent, to 1,289. In the past three years, the number of activist short-sellers working globally has nearly doubled, to 72 from 39. Very few have a positive track record. Left does. On average, the value of companies he writes about drop 10 percent in a year, and some drop as much as 95 percent.One morning last spring, Left and I stood in his lush backyard while he smoked a Marlboro Light. Beyond the swimming pool, the land fell sharply into the valley, and Los Angeles lay prone in the heat. We could see DJ Khaled\u2019s recently purchased house over the fence to our left. Tan and unshaven in loafers, Left possessed the vaguely louche charisma of a club promoter, which is what you might mistake him for were it not for his eyes \u2014 green, wet, melancholy eyes, which, because they cannot but project sincerity, are his greatest tools on television. His eyes are the reason he could stand in his million-dollar lawn and say to me, without irony, \u201cI\u2019m an investigative journalist who trades on his information.\u201dI observed that most investigative journalists could not count DJ Khaled as a neighbor.\u201cThe difference between this and journalism is you can make millions of dollars,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut you can lose millions of dollars, too.\u201dWhen I found him at the airport, he was wearing distressed jeans and a golf shirt, barking into an iPhone. He had just flown back from a vacation in Florida. During the 45-minute drive to his house, Left, never hanging up, floated and discarded a variety of plans. They were: exposing a jewelry chain as a subprime lender in disguise; shorting a maybe-fraudulent media company in Canada; and withdrawing a million-dollar cashier\u2019s check from his bank, made out to a pharmaceutical company, to be offered as a donation to the charity of its choice if it could prove to him the efficacy of a drug for multiple sclerosis, still in trials, which Left had on authority from the \u201crabbi of M.S.\u201d didn\u2019t work.The man on the other end of the line was a hedge-fund manager, this one a very close associate of Left\u2019s, at the center of his circle of sources. His relationship with Left was completely informal. His role was to trade ideas back and forth, sometimes shorting the companies they discussed. In exchange for sharing his insight and institutional muscle, Left\u2019s source avoided the legal liability that came from going public with a position. (A short campaign based on faulty information leaves you open to accusations of market manipulation, something Left has never been charged with in the United States.) Left has a number of sources on Wall Street, and during the months I spent reporting on him, he took care to keep their names from me, lest he burn them.Left also got tips as many journalists do, in large quantities, most of them useless. Business-school wannabes emailed him to get noticed. E-Trade cowboys offered schemes \u201cfor your eyes only.\u201d Hedge funds sent him research and ideas, most often because they wanted him to catalyze a short position they already held, by taking it public. What many of these people failed to grasp was that a bad company wasn\u2019t necessarily a good story. One morning, I watched him read his emails. \u201cGildan T-shirts,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThat idea does nothing for me. Who gives a [expletive] about Gildan?\u201dThen there was a third set of sources he used: tips of no discernible origin. In March 2012, for instance, a package without a return address landed on his doorstep. Inside were 68 pages of research claiming that a Chinese real estate company, Evergrande, was perpetrating an accounting fraud and would collapse. An odd tone pervaded, as if a very strait-laced stock analyst were trying to loosen up and channel Left\u2019s combative voice (\u201cChairman Hui\u2019s pet projects are comically off-strategy ... the endgame is nearing ... a maze of Ponzi-esque debt\u201d). Left hired a fact-checker, became convinced that the claims were accurate, updated some figures and published. The stock instantly dropped 7 percent. He covered a portion of his position two hours later, taking $280,000 in profit.But the profit was only the beginning of the story. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission sued Left for \u201cfalse and misleading claims,\u201d a failure to adequately support his accusations with evidence. The judge found him guilty and barred him from trading on the Chinese markets for five years. (Left objects to the decision on free-speech grounds and is appealing the ruling.) He refused to give up the name of his fact-checker. As to the identity of the anonymous sender, there was nothing to give up: Left had no idea who it was, except someone who almost certainly had a short position in Evergrande and made a fortune off the publication without the hassle of appearing in court. That was the point of using physical paper. Courts can subpoena your emails, but good luck tracing the mail backward from your gated community in Beverly Hills.As careful as Left must be to fact-check, hesitation hurts, too. If you\u2019re slow, other shorts can scoop you, which is exactly what happened with the online postage seller: A competitor had published a version of Left\u2019s thesis on a finance blog, and the stock\u2019s price had fallen too far to short. Back at his home office, Left tried to work, but the atmosphere was lazy, diffuse. He called a source. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he said, asking about the postage stock. \u201cWill it bounce?\u201d The source replied that it would not.Left squinted at CNBC. Then he roared. It began as a self-mocking \u201cWhy me?\u201d exasperation but expanded into something more unhindered, a primal American shriek. \u201cUugghHHAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH\u200bHHHHHHHHHH.\u201dWhen he was through, he said, almost to himself, \u201cThere has got to be an easier way to make money.\u201dRecognizing his ability to dazzle an audience at a young age, Black wanted her son to become a lawyer or a rabbi. Instead, he was accepted at Northeastern and chose political science. Boston confronted him for the first time with people who had always had money. They knew that Beverly Hills was an actual place in California, not a made-up city on TV. They wore black. They didn\u2019t drink Bartles & Jaymes.After graduating in 1993, Left responded to a newspaper ad from an outfit called the Universal Commodity Corporation, offering $100,000 a year for work in what the advertiser knew not to call a boiler room. Boiler rooms are cold-call centers for stocks, where men in bare-walled offices put the screws on unsophisticated marks. (As in: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Mrs. Jones. I\u2019d hate to see your husband miss out.\u201d) Roberta Karmel, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regulator who policed the Long Island boiler rooms in the 1980s, described to me a typical employee. \u201cHe tended to go to lesser schools for college,\u201d she said. \u201cOr not go to college at all. And a lot of them were kind of scrappy personalities who thought: Well, I\u2019m just as smart as the people at the white-shoe firms. I can make a lot of money, too.\u201dMaybe \u2014 if you\u2019re good at it. Left was not. He would meander off script and lose the sale. He quit after nine months, ejecting himself into the mid-\u201990s froth, where there was very little oversight and, almost everywhere you looked, a thick layer of scumminess. These were the years when the future \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d author Jordan Belfort ran a brokerage firm on Long Island, taking small companies public. Left started flipping penny-stock I.P.O.s, including Belfort\u2019s \u2014 he would call up the \u201cbucket shops,\u201d or storefront stock exchanges, ask for shares before a company went public and then sell them later at a profit.At the time, the Long Island bucket shops were pumping obscure stocks to whoever would buy them. The typical scam involved inflating the price by lying to your customers, then selling your own shares as close to the peak as possible before those customers got wiped out. (In 1999, a judge sentenced Belfort to four years for fraud. He served 22 months.) In the back of Left\u2019s mind, a realization glimmered. With the money he had saved from a few successful trades, he started shorting Belfort and the others, covering his positions after the price bottomed out \u2014 in effect profiting from their fraud. He was just getting the hang of it when the market crashed. He moved to California.In the mid-\u201990s, traders were just beginning to publish their theses online. An idea occurred to Left: Take the short positions he wielded against the Long Island companies and aim them up at big companies, the more elite the better, using the internet to disseminate the research. Instead of writing in the mode of a traditional stock analyst, he would distill his arguments down to internet-friendly length. The word \u201cblog\u201d was just starting to enter the lexicon. Left registered a domain name. He decided to stay in California. He would come to talk about frauds the way surfers talk about waves.To its fans on Wall Street, Valeant represented a brand-new model for the drug business. It didn\u2019t spend money on research and development, as most drug companies did. Instead, it bought valuable patents for drugs that others had developed, then jacked up the prices. To critics, Valeant was an abusive acquisition machine that produced nothing of value and would choke on its own debt. Senator Bernie Sanders lambasted it. Shares traded above $200.On Sept. 28, 2015, Left released his first report on the company. \u201cThis article is not for you hedge-fund managers who think that this quarter\u2019s profit is more important than human decency,\u201d it read. \u201cThis article is for the millions of Americans who together can mandate change.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhile the whole country is in an uproar about Turing Pharmaceuticals, a one-drug start-up pharma company attempting to raise prices on a single AIDS drug, the real issue is a $100 billion monster only Wall Street could love \u2014 an extremely leveraged company that set the standard for this type of abuse, while being cheered on by a cadre of Wall Street high-rollers too wealthy to fret over their own personal health care costs, and its posse of hedge-fund operators.\u201d A second report followed, demanding that Congress subpoena Valeant\u2019s executives.Pearson called the comparison \u201cerroneous\u201d and asked the S.E.C. to investigate Left. But as any public-relations agent knows, if you\u2019re denying, you\u2019re already on the back foot. By the time the company announced an emergency news conference the following morning, the stock was down 40 percent. \u201cAndrew erased the idea that buying Valeant was a smart strategy,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI just thought it was a good story. Andrew knew it was a ball of gasoline-soaked rags. He threw a match on it.\u201dAmong those who smelled smoke was the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. In November 2016, he indicted two men on charges of wire fraud and kickbacks: Gary Tanner, a senior executive at Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, the chief executive of Philidor. For all intents and purposes, the indictment alleges, Philidor was not an independent company. That much Left had suspected. What was shocking was the nature of the relationship between the businesses. It was not simple channel stuffing, the indictment alleges, but theft. According to the document, Tanner would sell Davenport millions of dollars of drugs. Then Davenport would share with Tanner the incentive payments he received from Valeant, moving the money through a shell company. Meanwhile Tanner misled his Valeant colleagues into believing that a competitor wanted to buy Philidor. The ultimate goal, the indictment claims, was to inflate Philidor\u2019s value until Valeant acquired it at a huge markup, at which point the two would split the millions that Davenport would earn from the sale as Philidor\u2019s largest stakeholder. (Through a representative, Valeant said it was the victim, not the perpetrator, of the fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note the indictment involved one former employee,\u201d the company wrote, adding that it has increased R.&D. investment by 26 percent.)We rode the elevator to a silent floor, where the receptionist clocked him as he entered. \u201cHey, Andy.\u201d Desks sat empty; the morning crew was here to shoot the 9:30 spots for the New York market, but in Los Angeles the day hadn\u2019t started. A tech came out to lead us to the studio. He was a gentle man in middle age, soft-featured, wearing cargo pants and thick black sneakers, a big brown mustache, warm eyes. He knew Left from the Valeant short and liked to watch him stick it to the Wall Street bosses. All day, people came through the studio rattling off finance acronyms, Ebitda this and Gaap that. Left spoke English.The tech set Left up on a director\u2019s chair. A screen behind his head projected a slightly more outdated version of the skyline than was visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows off-camera to the left and right. Left opened his notes and put his earpiece in. A few seconds into the interview, the anchor fell into a trap. \u201cHow much do you think Express Scripts makes off rebates off a high-priced drug?\u201d he asked.The tech was looking at Left. \u201cYou\u2019re our best guest,\u201d he said. \u201cOur most controversial guest.\u201d\u201cBut not the handsomest,\u201d Left said.\u201cWe\u2019re in West Hollywood,\u201d the tech apologized.

Left rode the elevator down to the lobby and slipped outside, where the blue glass tower dwarfed him.Claire Stovall, a researcher at the industry analyst Activist Shorts, told me that the situation was not necessarily to be feared. \u201cThe market is often quicker than the government at catching frauds,\u201d Stovall said. And most successful activist short campaigns produce no regulatory action anyway. But Zhao took a dimmer view. \u201cIf you create a deregulated boom not supported by fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will have a disaster. The activist short-sellers will make a fortune. But sometimes, as a member of society, you don\u2019t want to have a total collapse.\u201dIn retrospect, it is not coincidental that 2015 was the year Left became famous. His tactics matched our mood. Most of us do not care about a random pharmaceutical company meeting its debt covenants. We care about getting medicine at a price we can afford. We don\u2019t care about organic versus inorganic growth, but we worry that our kids will have no coverage if the Trump administration repeals Obamacare. Left\u2019s very timely gift is to connect our daily human concerns to the convoluted operations of the economy, wrapping financial analysis in a moral, populist language that is calibrated precisely to draw maximum attention in a media environment in which screaming is the only way to be heard.As for those being screamed at, the banks and the business schools that feed them, Left represents at best an interesting character and at worst a nuisance. American high finance is extraordinarily good at absorbing attacks on it. Just a few months ago, Left delivered a keynote speech at Harvard Business School\u2019s annual investment conference, where students who could afford the $72,000 tuition calmly imbibed Left\u2019s strategies, which were once considered fringe. He texted me a photo of himself in Harvard Yard, looking comfortable and middle-aged, smiling, his eyes closed.An article on June 11 about a short-seller referred incorrectly to Daraprim, the drug whose price was increased 56-fold by Turing Pharmaceuticals. The company bought the marketing rights, not the patent, to the drug.Advertisement"}

The law passed by the Hungarian Parliament in April would effectively force the closing of the university because it does not operate a campus in the United States, where it is registered.The law was widely viewed as a crackdown on free expression and liberal values under Mr. Orban, who has called the university a fraud and accused Mr. Soros of fomenting dissent against the government.In his speech Thursday, Mr. Soros denied he was trying to interfere in Hungarian politics, and chastised Mr. Orban for trying to cast him as an enemy.\u201cHe sought to frame his policies as a personal conflict between the two of us and has made me the target of his unrelenting propaganda campaign,\u201d Mr. Soros said of the Hungarian prime minister. \u201cHe cast himself in the role of the defender of Hungarian sovereignty and me as a shady currency speculator who uses his money to flood Europe \u2014 particularly his native Hungary \u2014 with illegal immigrants as part of some vague but nefarious plot.\u201dMr. Soros added, \u201cThis is the opposite of who I am.\u201dMr. Orban\u2019s chief of staff, Janos Lazar, said Thursday that accusations of a \u201cmafia state\u201d apply better to the nongovernment organizations that receive funding from Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations.\u201cThese organizations, financed by George Soros, have operated like mafia,\u201d Mr. Lazar said at a news briefing in Budapest on Thursday, repeating allegations of lack of transparency.Defenders of human rights, refugees and those who promote the fight against corruption that sometimes get support from Mr. Soros have in recent years been the targets of government scrutiny. One such organization, the Hungary branch of Transparency International, which receives less than 10 percent of its funding from grants supported by Mr. Soros, lauded his comments Thursday.Mr. Soros, whose speech was focused more broadly on changes to the European Union, called on the bloc\u2019s institutions to act against the challenges to democracy posed by Hungary and Poland, where the governing party, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, has taken a similar course against N.G.O.s.European legal experts have said that the European Union\u2019s efforts to counter the Hungarian law are unlikely to lead to effective sanctions, or change the course of Mr. Orban\u2019s government.In his speech Thursday, Mr. Soros said, \u201cDemocracy cannot be imposed from the outside; it needs to be asserted and defended by the people themselves.\u201dHe acknowledged that in responding to challenges to its core values, the European Union \u201cis cumbersome, slow-moving and often needs unanimity to enforce its rules.\u201d\u201cThis is difficult to achieve when two countries, Poland and Hungary, are conspiring to oppose it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will require resolute action by European institutions and the active engagement of civil society.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He has boasted of golfing with President Trump, but any hope he had that Mr. Trump\u2019s election might curb the American investigation appears to have been dashed.Mr. Najib\u2019s attorney general, Mohamed Apandi Ali, issued a statement on Friday noting that investigations by Mr. Najib\u2019s government had found no evidence that money was misappropriated.Mr. Najib\u2019s press secretary, Tengku Sariffuddin, suggested the United States\u2019 action was politically motivated. Malaysia is \u201cconcerned by the unnecessary and gratuitous naming of certain matters and individuals that are only relevant to domestic political manipulation and interference,\u201d he said. \u201cThis suggests a motivation that goes beyond the objective of seizing assets.\u201dThe Malaysian government created the fund in 2008 ostensibly to promote economic development. But it borrowed heavily, and much of the money was used in questionable investment schemes.A central player in establishing the fund was Jho Low, a friend of Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson, Riza Aziz.The latest complaint seeks to recover more than $400 million from Mr. Low, including his $250 million yacht, Equanimity. Mr. Low\u2019s location is unknown.Mr. Low used some of the funds to finance a lavish style and befriend celebrities, including hiring them to attend parties, the complaint says.It seeks the recovery of more than $8 million in diamond jewelry that Mr. Low is said to have given to Miranda Kerr, an Australian model, including an 11.72-carat, heart-shaped diamond for Valentine\u2019s Day in 2014. Ms. Kerr could not be reached immediately for comment.Here is the United States Justice Department complaint seeking to recover $540 million in assets that it says were purchased with money stolen from 1MDB, a Malaysian government fund.A spokeswoman for Mr. Low said that the Justice Department\u2019s complaint \u201ccontinues its inappropriate efforts to seize assets despite not having proven that any improprieties have occurred.\u201dThe complaint is also seeking to recover more than $25 million in assets from Mr. Aziz, a co-founder of the Hollywood production company Red Granite Pictures, including the rights to the films \u201cDumb and Dumber To\u201d and \u201cDaddy\u2019s Home.\u201dRed Granite has said that it is cooperating with the Justice Department and that it is seeking to resolve the case. The previous complaint sought the rights to \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d which Red Granite also produced.The complaint claims that Mr. DiCaprio received expensive artwork from Mr. Low and his associates, including a $9.2 million collage by Jean-Michel Basquiat and a $3.2 million painting by Pablo Picasso.A spokesman for Mr. DiCaprio said in a statement that the actor received the gifts to benefit his environmental foundation and that he had initiated their return before the complaint was filed.The complaint says that more than $200 million of the stolen money was spent on jewelry and that some of it found its way to Mr. Najib\u2019s wife, Rosmah Mansor.Ms. Mansor is not named in the complaint, but she is identified as the wife of Malaysian Official 1. She is well known in Malaysia for her interest in luxury goods, including diamonds and a collection of Herm\u00e8s Birkin handbags.According to the complaint, she received the $27.3 million necklace with a 22-carat, pink diamond pendant that was bought with money diverted from the Malaysian fund.During a visit to Los Angeles in 2014, the complaint says, she and her husband had dinner at the Bel-Air hotel. Afterward, she was shown a selection of jewelry and chose 27 gold necklaces and bracelets. They were later paid for with $1.3 million that came from \u201cmisappropriated Deutsche Bank loan proceeds,\u201d the complaint says.Ms. Brown, the acting United States attorney for the Central District of California, said that the participants relied on \u201can extravagant web of lies and bogus transactions\u201d to carry out the scheme.\u201cThis money financed the lavish lifestyles of the alleged co-conspirators at the expense and detriment of the Malaysian people,\u201d said the acting assistant attorney general Kenneth A.

{"Headline": "Senate Health Care Bill Includes Deep Cuts to Medicaid", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, who for seven years have promised a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, took a major step on Thursday toward that goal, unveiling a bill to make deep cuts in Medicaid and end the law\u2019s mandate that most Americans have health insurance.But the measure landed in rough seas ahead of a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wants next week. Four conservative senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, announced that they would oppose it without changes \u2014 more than enough to bring it down.\u201cIt does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs,\u201d the four wrote in a joint statement.Other Republican senators, like Dean Heller of Nevada and Rob Portman of Ohio, expressed their own qualms, as did AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the Association of American Medical Colleges.But the Senate bill would make subsidies less generous than under current law. It would also lower the annual income limit for receiving subsidies to cover insurance premiums to 350 percent of the poverty level, or about $42,000 for an individual, from 400 percent.Older people could be disproportionately hurt because they pay more for insurance in general. Both chambers\u2019 bills would allow insurers to charge older people five times as much as younger ones; the limit now is three times.The Senate measure, like the House bill, would phase out the extra money that the federal government has provided to states as an incentive to expand eligibility for Medicaid. And like the House bill, it would put the entire Medicaid program on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that now exists.The bill, drafted in secret, is likely to come to the Senate floor next week, and could come to a vote after 20 hours of debate.The premise of the bill, repeated almost daily in some form by its chief author, Mr. McConnell, is that \u201cObamacare is collapsing around us, and the American people are desperately searching for relief.\u201dMr. Trump shares that view, and passage of the Senate bill would move the president much closer to being able to boast about the adoption of a marquee piece of legislation, a feat he has so far been unable to accomplish.Democrats and some insurers say Mr. Trump has sabotaged the Affordable Care Act, in part by threatening to withhold subsidies paid to insurers so they can reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for millions of low-income people.And President Barack Obama, who has been hesitant to speak up on political issues since leaving office, waded into the debate on Thursday, saying the Senate proposal showed a \u201cfundamental meanness.\u201dIn a message to his supporters, Mr. Obama urged people to demand compromise from their lawmakers before senators vote on the Republican bill next week.In the Senate, Democrats are determined to defend a law that has provided coverage to 20 million people and is a pillar of Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. The debate over the repeal bill is shaping up as a titanic political clash, which could have major implications for both parties, affecting their electoral prospects for years to come.A real-time count of every senator\u2019s position.Mr. McConnell faces a great challenge in amassing the votes to win Senate approval of the bill, which Republicans are trying to pass using special budget rules that would allow them to avoid a Democratic filibuster. But with only 52 seats, Mr. McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie.Democrats have assailed Republicans for putting the bill together without a single public hearing or bill-drafting session.Republican leaders still must contend with internal divisions that will be difficult to overcome. Numerous Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid are concerned about how a rollback of the program could affect their constituents, and they face pressure from governors back home.Some Republican senators, like Susan Collins of Maine, said they were waiting for an analysis of the bill to be issued soon by the Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper on Capitol Hill.A comparison of the Senate health care with the Affordable Care Act.Under the Senate bill, the federal government would continue paying crucial subsidies to health insurance companies through 2019, alleviating the uncertainty caused by litigation and by mixed signals from the Trump administration. Without this money, many insurers have said, they will sharply increase premiums or pull out of the marketplaces in many states.The Senate bill would also cap overall federal spending on Medicaid: States would receive a per-beneficiary allotment of money. The federal payments would grow more slowly than under the House bill starting in 2025. Alternatively, states could receive an annual lump sum of federal money for Medicaid in the form of a block grant.State officials and health policy experts predict that many people would be dropped from Medicaid because states would not fill the fiscal hole left by the loss of federal money.\u201cThe Senate bill creates an illusion of being less draconian than the House bill, but is arguably more so\u201d on Medicaid, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.The Senate bill would make it much easier for states to opt out of insurance standards in the Affordable Care Act, including the requirement for insurers to provide certain \u201cessential benefits.\u201dRepublicans said the bill would still guarantee access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. But consumers could be exposed to new medical costs if, for example, insurers did not have to cover certain expensive new drugs or medical procedures.\u201cAn individual with a pre-existing condition could be insured, but the services needed to treat that condition might not be covered because of a waiver,\u201d said Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor of health law at Washington and Lee University.The Senate and House bills would both provide tax credits to help people buy health insurance, but Senate Republicans said they tried to direct more of the assistance to lower-income people. Under the House bill, the tax credits would be based mainly on a person\u2019s age. Under the Senate bill, they would be based on a person\u2019s income and age, as well as local insurance costs.The Senate bill, like the House bill, would cut off federal Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for one year. The money reimburses clinics for birth control, cancer screenings and other preventive care. About half of Planned Parenthood patients are on Medicaid.Also like the House measure, the Senate bill would repeal taxes imposed on high-income people by the Affordable Care Act, including a payroll tax increase that helps finance Medicare.The bill would delay a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance \u2014 the so-called Cadillac tax \u2014 to 2026. It is currently scheduled to take effect in 2020. Employers and labor unions detest the tax and would have nearly a decade to try to kill it.The Senate bill would provide $50 billion to help stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums from 2018 through 2021. The money would be distributed by the federal government to insurance companies that apply. The bill would provide $62 billion in grants to states for similar purposes from 2019 to 2026.In addition, the Senate bill would provide $2 billion next year in federal grants to help states respond to the opioid crisis.The bill would generally prohibit consumers from using federal tax credits to help buy insurance that includes coverage for abortions. Democrats plan to challenge this provision as a violation of Senate rules being used to speed passage of the repeal bill.Jennifer Steinhauer and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He also is of Palestinian and Mexican descent. In an interview, he shared his experiences campaigning as an Arab-Latino and his plans to bring SpaceX to San Diego. Here are edited excerpts from an interview in Washington, where he was visiting to hold a fund-raiser.Your mother is Mexican-American and your father is Palestinian-American. In what ways has that influenced you?I think it has helped me in politics and my career by allowing me to understand people who are not like me and their experiences. That made me step outside of my own issues and see people\u2019s lives objectively, for what they were.When I talk to people in my district who say they are an illness away from losing their home, I don\u2019t really care about what their political persuasion is. I think when people really cling to their identities they don\u2019t really have sympathy for other communities and their struggles.What has your experience been like running a campaign as a Latino-Arab under the Trump administration?It\u2019s been challenging but extremely promising. We need to be able to represent everyone, not specific pockets of the country. A lot of Trump supporters are not all racists, or a lot of them aren\u2019t ignorant; they are ignored. I want people to understand, they just need a voice. That is what Trump tapped into. If I lose this race, it won\u2019t be because I played the same partisan game.How do you plan to implement environmentally sustainable practices?We\u2019ve reached out to Elon Musk\u2019s company to make solar farming available to constituents. I also want to bring the SpaceX program to the district. Elon Musk is well on his way to privatizing space travel, and if we could tap into that by creating launch sites here, that would help create jobs.Duncan Hunter Jr., the incumbent, is under investigation for alleged violations of campaign finance laws. When it comes to Hunter, one thing I will say is that he served in our military. People like him fight the wars we wage abroad so people like me can fight the wars within. But at the same time, I am appalled. There is a dereliction of duty. If we learned anything about 2016, people are fed up with political dynasties.How has social media influenced your campaign?I have had the opportunity to multiply my message through social media. The Obama campaign showed us how far-reaching and effective a social media initiative can be. I think it would be a really redemptive thing if I, as an Arab-Latino, could win. That would show us everything that is wrong with America cannot eclipse everything that is right.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)It\u2019s hard to compete with ancient sequoias, soaring granite walls and waterfalls in every direction.So visitors to Yosemite, understandably, might overlook another natural wonder: the people.Orlando Soria was raised in Yosemite Valley.

{"Headline": "In Long Run, There\u2019s No Such Thing as an Einstein Investor", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThere are no easy answers in investing. It is tempting to replicate a successful strategy \u2014 one created by an outstanding investor, like Warren Buffett, or through in-depth statistical analysis of the wisdom of crowds \u2014 and such approaches can actually work for long periods.But paint-by-number portfolios won\u2019t succeed forever. And without deep expertise, it makes little sense to veer much from a simple market portfolio \u2014 one that seeks to match the overall performance of the market, and not beat it.Albert Einstein, who may have been the most famous person ever to be publicly identified as a genius, had a disrespectful attitude toward the dignitaries of the physics profession of his time, and a lonely and unique approach to science.Yet great as Einstein\u2019s theories were, others in the scientific community had been on the verge of discovering them when he came along. In fact, it is possible to argue that large numbers of collegial scholars who do not keep secrets, do not pretend to know everything and share freely will eventually surpass the achievements of a lone genius.Similar debates dominate professional investing. For help in making important financial decisions, some of us are looking for Einsteins, others for communities of scholars or professional money managers with solid ideas.In terms of popular reputation, Mr. Buffett may be investing\u2019s closest approximation of an Einstein. Some investors have done well simply by copying Mr. Buffett\u2019s financial moves.On the other hand, many investors embrace the catchy methods that bubble up from time to time, like \u201csmart beta,\u201d a phrase for a form of systematic investing that claims to outperform the market. There is no universal agreement on what smart beta means, but it typically refers to published theories and replicable statistical analysis, and mechanical procedures aimed at beating them. Smart beta clearly is the epitome of community property, not quirky genius.A lone investor, whether a genius or not, can typically keep a secret better than a community can, and does not have to publish his methods. This difference is important but not absolute, because the Securities and Exchange Commission generally requires large institutional investment managers to file quarterly reports listing their holdings.There are even bigger problems in replicating strategies extracted from the community of scholars who publish not only what they do, but why they do it.The researchers looked at the performance of each of these strategies, assuming you had started right after publication of research papers on them and then continued for years. They found that while the strategies outperformed the market, their success decreased by more than 50 percent after publication.So what\u2019s an investor to do? Both published statistical analyses and published actions and opinions of knowledgeable people, whether geniuses or just smart and well-informed investors, are worth mulling over, if you have a taste for such things. But don\u2019t follow these strategies blindly. We need to exercise our intuitive judgment as well as rely on the wisdom of smart, well-informed people to decide whether to continue to rely on statistical indicators and investment strategies that seemed to work in the past.His reasoning is still valid. We need to use statistical analysis but also respect human intuition and even genius, if we are able to identify it. But do so with caution. No single strategy is likely to beat the market forever.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

As of today large segments of society are subjected to racial discrimination and profound economic inequalities. Justice is often inaccessible to the poor, and government officials are rarely held accountable.Despite the election of progressive presidents, they have lacked a working majority in Congress. This is one of the most damaging legacies of the political system that has been in force for the past two decades. The presidents have been forced to forge coalitions \u2014 often bizarre alliances \u2014 to ensure governability. Archaic and corrupt power groups that are overrepresented in Congress have played a key role in government. Mr. Temer\u2019s P.M.D.B., for instance, has been part of every cabinet since 1985.The Brazilian National Congress is a glaring example of a distorted political representation system. White businessmen control almost 70 percent of the seats. Women hold a mere 10 percent, and Afro-Brazilians another 20 percent, in a country where they are a majority. Campaigns are expensive, and political parties have proliferated (there are 39 now), often \u201cselling\u201d their support and airtime in exchange for benefits from governing parties. Rich corporations that stand to benefit from big infrastructure projects routinely finance candidates to secure their interest. Normally, financial support is given behind the scenes and remains off the books. JBS, the giant meat production conglomerate headed by Mr. Batista, confessed to having financed the campaigns of almost one-third of the members of the current Congress.Where will Brazil go after this new wave of scandals? The fall of Mr. Temer is regarded as almost certain given the amount of evidence against him. But the governing coalition is keeping him in power until it finds a credible replacement, to pursue the austerity measures and to contain the corruption investigations. And yet, the outcome is unpredictable: Tensions are rising fast as large groups in civil society question the legitimacy of Mr. Temer\u2019s administration. Violence and repression have already erupted in urban protests as well as in rural areas of Mato Grosso and Par\u00e1, where peasants have been murdered in land disputes.Given this background, the only way forward is to identify a new leadership with the legitimacy to restore respect to governance and hold direct elections. But Brazil\u2019s Constitution establishes that Congress should conduct an indirect election to replace the president in the event that the post is vacated in the last two years of a presidential term, as is the case. To say the least, empowering Congress with a third of its members already under criminal investigation represents a demoralizing \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 continuation of the corrupt status quo.Legal and political challenges to holding an indirect election had been introduced in the Congress long before this latest crisis. Nevertheless, they have been firmly blocked by the majority of the members, who are unwilling to relinquish power, and by the economic elite, which is scared by the possible return of the left to power in a direct election.The bitter lesson learned is that corruption will remain a systemic threat until there is a thorough review of the electoral law and unless accountability becomes routine for all. Public financing of campaigns and cost caps could contain the overwhelming pressure of economic lobbies. The quality of representation in Congress may further improve from setting up an electoral threshold for congressional and state representation to reflect current demographic distribution. Unfortunately, all those solutions require Congress to take action, and congressmen have repeatedly managed to shun them in the past to prevent weakening their power.Whatever solutions are found in the short or long term, politics in Brazil will continue to suffer from instability until voters are allowed to oust the nation\u2019s broken political leadership, in both the executive and the legislative branches, and regain some control of its democracy.Paulo S\u00e9rgio Pinheiro is a political scientist and the chairman of the United Nations independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic based in Geneva.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arab Nations Demand Qatar Shut Al Jazeera, Cut Islamist Ties and Detail Funding", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia and three other Arab countries that recently cut diplomatic ties with Qatar issued a harsh list of demands on Friday, insisting that the wealthy but tiny Persian Gulf nation shut down the news network Al Jazeera, abandon ties with Islamist organizations and provide detailed information about its funding for political dissidents.The demands, presented to Qatar through mediators from Kuwait, risked pulling other powers deeper into the rift by calling on Qatar to close a Turkish military base and to downgrade its ties with Iran \u2014 a difficult task given that Iran and Qatar share a large gas field that provides much of Qatar\u2019s wealth.Qatari officials did not immediately respond on Friday, but they have denied supporting extremists and said that they would neither negotiate while under a blockade nor submit to demands that undermined the country\u2019s sovereignty.All of the nations involved are allies of the United States, and Qatar and Bahrain host large American military bases. But analysts have accused the Trump administration of sending mixed signals, exacerbating the rift.After the Arab nations announced that they were cutting ties with Qatar, Mr. Trump posted his support on Twitter and even suggested he had been responsible.As the crisis has dragged on, American diplomats have complained that the Arab nations were taking too long to present their demands and raised questions about whether the charges really had to do with any support for terrorism or were driven by other grievances. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said any demands must be \u201creasonable and actionable.\u201dQatar has historically played a maverick role in the Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional group that also includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It maintains ties with a range of Islamist groups throughout the region, relationships that other countries have found useful when negotiating hostage releases but have complained about when those groups challenge their rule.Qatar has also opened its doors to members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates consider a terrorist organization; to members of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group; and to the Afghan Taliban. It has also financed Al Jazeera, which is often critical of Qatar\u2019s rivals.Those stances have rankled others in the region, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which see political Islam as a threat to their monarchies. And Qatar\u2019s support for the Arab Spring uprisings and for the Muslim Brotherhood has angered countries including Egypt.Other nations, like Turkey, have stood up for Qatar. The Turkish defense minister, Fikri Isik, rejected the demand that Qatar close the Turkish military base and suggested that Turkey would enhance its presence there in support.\u201cStrengthening the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the gulf\u2019s security,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. \u201cRe-evaluating the base agreement with Qatar is not on our agenda.\u201dAnalysts said that many of the other demands would be hard for Qatar to meet, especially in the 10-day period the four nations gave it to comply.Downgrading ties with Iran could complicate operations at the large gas field the two countries share, and closing the Turkish base would violate long-term diplomatic agreements, Mr. Stephens said. And Qatar is unlikely to give up Al Jazeera, a channel that has given it an outsize voice in regional politics.More broadly, the list of demands called for undefined \u201ccompensation\u201d and for Qatar to conform politically and economically with the other nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council.If Qatar complies, the four countries said, it will be audited once a month for the first year and quarterly during the second year. It would then be monitored for compliance for the next decade.Mr. Stephens said it was highly unlikely that Qatar would comply. \u201cThat would be a violation of sovereignty that the Qataris will never be able to accept,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article overstated how many of the countries involved in the crisis host large American military bases. Only Qatar and Bahrain host such bases, not \u201cmost\u201d of the countries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Least 12 Killed in Pair of Terrorist Attacks in Iran", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArmed assailants, including some disguised as women, stunned Iran on Wednesday with brazen attacks on the Parliament building and the tomb of its revolutionary founder, the worst terrorist strike to hit the Islamic republic in years.At least 12 people were killed and 46 were wounded in the near-simultaneous assaults, which lasted for hours, clearly took Iran\u2019s elite security forces by surprise and shattered the self-proclaimed image of calm in a turbulent region.The six known attackers also were killed, official news media said, and five suspects were reported detained. Their identities were not made clear.\u201cWe will avenge the blood of those martyred in today\u2019s terrorism attacks,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami, deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the country\u2019s powerful paramilitary force.If the Islamic State\u2019s claim is true, that would be its first successful attack in Iran, which is predominantly Shiite Muslim and regarded by Sunni militants as a nation of heretics. Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria are helping battle the Islamic State.Eleven people died in the Parliament building assault, and one at the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, father of the 1979 revolution, whose shrine is a magnet for visitors. Four of the assailants were killed at the Parliament building, official news media said, and two at the mausoleum. Five were men, and one mausoleum assailant was a woman.The audacity of the assaults, and the hours it took to end them, suggested that Iranian security officials had been caught unprepared \u2014 especially for what seemed like a coordinated plan conceived well in advance.Expressions of sympathy from world leaders for the victims poured in after the assaults. But hours elapsed before a condolence statement was issued by the Trump administration, which has called Iran the leading state sponsor of terrorism.In their public pronouncements, Iranian leaders sought to belittle the assailants and their acts, emphasizing that the Parliament chamber itself had never been breached.\u201cThe Iranian nation is moving forward and advancing; even these firecrackers that were set off today will not impact our nation\u2019s will; everyone must know this,\u201d Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nation\u2019s supreme leader, said on his official website.The speaker of Parliament, Ali Larijani, called the attacks a \u201cminor incident,\u201d saying that \u201csome cowardly terrorists\u201d had infiltrated the legislative complex.But accounts of lawmakers and journalists stuck inside the Parliament building suggested panic and mayhem, and state news media video showed some people escaping through windows.The attacks started around 10:30 a.m., when men armed with assault rifles and suicide vests \u2014 some of them dressed as women \u2014 descended on the Parliament building, killing at least one guard and wounding and kidnapping other people. That standoff lasted until midafternoon.In a sign that elite security forces had trouble containing the situation, one attacker left the Parliament building after an hour, ran around shooting on Tehran\u2019s streets, then returned to the building \u2014 where at least one assailant blew himself up on the fourth floor as others fired from the windows.\u201cI cannot talk, I\u2019m stuck here, and the situation is really dangerous, the shooting is continuing, we are surrounded, and I cannot talk,\u201d an Iranian journalist, Ehsan Bodaghi, said by phone from inside the building during the standoff.Korosh Karmpur, a member of Parliament, said in an account reported by the Tasnim News Agency that he had played dead to avoid getting shot after leaving the hall to receive an arriving guest. He was chatting with a guard, Mr. Karmpur said, when gunfire erupted.\u201cAs soon as one guard fell, a person screaming \u2018Allahu akbar\u2019 started firing on people and a second person followed and kept firing with a Kalashnikov,\u201d Mr. Karmpur said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a weapon, so I dropped to the floor so the terrorists would think I also was hit.\u201dHe said the assailants kept shooting in a failed effort to enter the parliamentary chamber, then headed for lawmaker offices on a different floor.Mohammad Ali Saki, editor of The Tehran Times, said in a phone interview that the Parliament building assailants had \u201ctargeted guards, cleaners, employees of the administrative and finance sections,\u201d but had \u201cnever got near the Parliament chamber itself.\u201dThe assailants were armed with AK-47s and hand grenades and wore what appeared to be explosive vests, he said.Mohammed Abasi, a photographer who arrived as the attack was unfolding, said that he saw security forces \u201cfiring at the attackers from outside\u201d and that some reporters and photographers covering the Parliament session were stuck inside awaiting rescue.\u201cNaturally, for a few hours a terrorist attack like this leaves a shock: Our countrymen were killed, and this was a terrorist attack,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I already see that it is uniting Iranians \u2014 there is a sense of fight.\u201dThe Islamic State released a graphic 24-second video showing a bloodied man lying in the Parliament building while a gunman shouted in Arabic: \u201cThank God! Do you think that we are going to leave? We will remain here, God willing.\u201dThe assault on the Khomeini mausoleum, about 10 miles south of Parliament, lasted for about 90 minutes, state news media reported.Two assailants entered the west wing of the sprawling compound. According to local news agencies, at least one attacker detonated explosives in the western entrance. Another was reported to have committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill, although another account said the militant had been shot to death by security forces.Mohammed Ali Ansari, overseer of the mausoleum, said that militants who appeared to have explosives strapped to them \u201cstarted shooting blindly and without a target.\u201dIn the view of many in Iran, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is inextricably linked to Saudi Arabia. \u201cISIS ideologically, financially and logistically is fully supported and sponsored by Saudi Arabia \u2014 they are one and the same,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst.One Iranian security official said the attacks had been a message from Saudi Arabia meant to teach Iran a lesson. He also said the assaults were intended to test Iran\u2019s reaction.While terrorist attacks have become more frequent in Europe and in much of the Middle East, Iran had remained comparatively safe. During May\u2019s election campaign, President Hassan Rouhani often lauded the country\u2019s security forces and intelligence agencies for their vigilance.For many years, however, the country endured a bitter campaign of attacks by an armed opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq or M.E.K., which for decades had been supported by the former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein.Some Iranian analysts suggested that the M.E.K. may have been connected to the Wednesday assaults, partly because of the targets: M.E.K. leaders had said Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s tomb would be among their first. The use of a female attacker and cyanide pill to commit suicide also smacked of the M.E.K.\u2019s past practices.\u201cThis is not to say that the attack was an M.E.K. operation,\u201d said Rasool Nafisi, an Iranian-American scholar, \u201cbut it is fair to say that the group\u2019s \u2018expertise\u2019 might have been utilized in training those terrorists who targeted Iran.\u201dA previous version of this article misstated the length of a video apparently made during the attack on the Parliament building in Tehran.

{"Headline": "A Tech Executive\u2019s Latest Start-Up Has Cleats, Jerseys and Goals", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byKINGSTON, N.Y. \u2014 It was the most important game in the brief history of Kingston Stockade F.C. First place was on the line. So was the first real chance to draw 1,000 fans.Two hours before kickoff on a hot Saturday afternoon in early June, Dennis Crowley, the team\u2019s founder, arrived at Dietz Stadium, a high school football field covered with artificial turf.Driven by the kind of disruptive innovation he knows from the tech world, Crowley is making a bold attempt to reimagine professional soccer in the United States. It is a grand vision of hundreds of clubs and multiple divisions, of promotion and relegation that will reward investment and success and punish bad decisions and failure. That is the big picture. On a recent Saturday, however, Crowley\u2019s focus was on only one game.For the early June match, Crowley\u2019s S.U.V. was packed with the uniforms he had washed. A bag of balls. Banners. Posters for postgame autographs. Cash boxes for the ticket booth and the merchandise stand. Envelopes to pay the referees and the pizza delivery guy. Clipboards and rosters for the press box. Walkie-talkies for the volunteer staff members.He removed Tupperware containers stuffed with T-shirts \u2014 rolled by his father and the club\u2019s general manager \u2014 along with other items for sale: Stockade jerseys, Stockade caps, Stockade scarves, Stockade winter hats.\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll sell many winter hats in summer, but we\u2019ll try,\u201d he said with a chuckle.Randy Kim, the general manager, walked up and Crowley said, \u201cWould you be able to go to the CVS across the street and buy cups?\u201dWhen Kim returned, having spent $12.19 on cups and a couple of bucks on a chocolate bar, Crowley said, \u201cGood work; keep the receipt.\u201dThis is how the revolution begins: By turning your car into a rolling warehouse. By learning that water can be dispensed more efficiently from five-gallon jugs than from bottles. By keeping track of every cent spent. And by bringing a technology executive\u2019s aptitude for pioneering start-ups to soccer.Crowley\u2019s idea is that profitable and sustainable soccer teams can succeed, not only in the large markets inhabited at the top professional level by Major League Soccer, but in small communities, too, like Kingston, with a population of 23,000 in the Hudson Valley, 90 miles north of New York City.\u201cI think that\u2019s where M.L.S. is going wrong,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThey are tending to produce a standardized product across the country.\u201dCrowley envisions the obscure N.P.S.L. becoming relevant over the next five or 10 years by expanding from 100 to 500 teams, each drawing at least 1,000 fans a game and attracting at least 5,000 viewers online via live-streaming broadcasts of their matches. (M.L.S. currently has 22 teams, but is in the process of expanding to as many as 28 over the next several years.)If the N.P.S.L. can build a much larger geographic footprint than M.L.S., while attracting an audience about 25 percent the size of M.L.S.\u2019s, Crowley argues, this could lead to enhanced sponsorship deals, live-streaming rights contracts, and shared revenue among the league\u2019s teams.Crowley\u2019s plan also envisions the enticing \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 possibility of promotion and relegation, with teams moving up or down through tiers depending on their performance in a given season.The system is the standard in most of the world\u2019s leagues but anathema to American professional sports, where leagues like the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. operate \u2014 like M.L.S. \u2014 as closed systems. That arrangement was built into M.L.S. at its creation in the mid-1990s, and it most likely enticed the financing that founded and sustained the league.But a closed system also mitigates risks for potential new investors: It is unlikely that a prospective owner of an M.L.S. team would spend several hundred million dollars for a team and a stadium if it risked dropping to a lower division a year later, just as no one would buy the Yankees if they might drop to Class AAA after a single poor season. To advocates of promotion and relegation, that safety stifles innovation.That is why the prospect of advancing in soccer\u2019s pecking order is tantalizing to many fans of lower-division clubs. It is also why, instead of changing the American soccer landscape from the top, Crowley is proposing to do it from the bottom.\u201cPeople say, \u2018It\u2019s cute, you\u2019re doing this thing with soccer,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re working on a start-up and that\u2019s cute until you pose a threat to Google or Facebook and then they take you seriously. I understand the journey, the improbable rise of that. I feel like we\u2019re doing the improbable rise again.\u201dIn these online essays, Crowley has been open about strategies that have worked, and others that have failed. He has offered tips: Jerseys are reusable from one season to the next if the sponsor remains the same. It is better to start summer games at 5 p.m. instead of 2 p.m., so fans don\u2019t have to run for shade and players\u2019 feet won\u2019t blister. And if you cannot serve alcohol at a high school stadium, arrange for a beer tent across the street.Crowley also has made the provocative argument that proximity may matter as much as quality of play in drawing fans to a team.\u201cIn sum, we shouldn\u2019t focus our energy on the idea of entirely disrupting M.L.S.,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut rather on creating a world where it\u2019s possible that a critical mass of soccer fans in the USA care more about a D4 league than M.L.S.\u201dCan his plan succeed?\u201cI love the transparency, putting all the numbers down; it\u2019s really cool what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Stefan Szymanski, a professor of sports management at Michigan and the author of \u201cMoney and Soccer: A Soccernomics Guide.\u201d\u201cCertainly, M.L.S. wants to develop the lower tiers; they want to control every level of the game,\u201d Szymanski said. \u201cThe question is, if this guy develops a nice app and a nice system, would M.L.S. try to buy it up lock, stock and barrel? And would he be willing to sell?\u201dSunil Gulati, an important executive in the founding of M.L.S. and the current president of the United States Soccer Federation, said: \u201cYou never discount anyone who\u2019s proven in one aspect of their career. The idea of a community-based, ground-up effort is certainly something to be followed carefully.\u201dBecause Crowley\u2019s plan is long-term, Gulati added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to evaluate and also hard to succeed against everything else that\u2019s going on in the sport. To the extent that this is a disrupter, that\u2019s great if they\u2019re successful. But we only ever hear about the disrupters that are successful. And there\u2019s a whole lot that aren\u2019t.\u201dFor a home match against Boston City F.C. on June 10, Crowley dressed in a cap and T-shirt bearing Stockade F.C.\u2019s logo: fence posts representing the 14-foot-high stockade built by Dutch settlers to protect the original village of Kingston in the 1600s.This summer, Stockade F.C. features a mix of N.C.A.A. players from nearby Marist College and postcollegiate players eager to continue their careers. None of the players are paid. Goalkeeper Steve Skonieczny is a high school math teacher. Jamal Lis-Simmons, the team captain, is the soccer coach at a community college.Crowley\u2019s determination to be transparent with Stockade F.C., he said, stemmed from having worked at Google and feeling \u201cshut out\u201d from decisions he felt he should have included his voice.In Kingston, Stockade F.C. has been welcomed as another sign of the town\u2019s revival, alongside new brick-and-mortar stores, an enhanced dining scene and second-home purchases by New Yorkers in the wake of IBM\u2019s departure in the mid-1990s. (Crowley lives in Manhattan\u2019s East Village but also has a home near Kingston, in Marbletown, N.Y.)\u201cThe soccer team embodies the transition that is going on,\u201d said Zach Lewis, 30, a real estate developer and a member of Stockade F.C.\u2019s drum corps, known as the Dutch Guard. \u201cIt ties up with the age demographic of people who are into soccer.\u201dAgainst Boston City, Stockade F.C. took a 2-0 lead on a penalty kick and a deft shot chipped over Boston\u2019s goalkeeper from 35 yards. When the match ended at 2-1, Stockade claimed first place in the Atlantic White Division. Crowley hugged Kim, his general manager, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going streaking!\u201dThe crowd, though, topped out at 992, eight short of the 1,000 threshold that Crowley had hoped to reach.\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have grabbed random people off the street?\u201d Skonieczny, the goalkeeper, asked with a laugh.Not when a club\u2019s aim is transparency, Crowley said.\u201cIf we get 1,000, we earn 1,000,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even with Donald Trump\u2019s working-class appeal, Clinton could have swept Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.Special elections aren\u2019t normal.

Yet it nonetheless offers a tantalizing lesson for Democrats.The pattern also exists across ethnic groups.

But you shouldn\u2019t be defeatist.Second, keep in mind that turnout is a human-behavior problem. It involves persuading people to change long-established habits. And there is a powerful force uprooting all kinds of habits today: digital technology.Finally, remember that the political left has had some recent successes in raising turnout, and they involved old-fashioned political excitement. Obama won partly through higher turnout among younger and nonwhite voters. Black turnout even exceeded white turnout in 2012, before slipping last year.People who don\u2019t vote regularly aren\u2019t progressive activists in disguise. They tend not to follow politics closely. Although most lean left, they are not doctrinaire, and they\u2019re not looking for white papers. They are looking to be inspired.Obviously, these are tough times for Democrats. They haven\u2019t had much electoral cheer since 2012 \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear whether Ossoff will win.

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Rift Over Medicaid and Opioids Imperils Senate Health Bill", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A growing rift among Senate Republicans over federal spending on Medicaid and the opioid epidemic is imperiling legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act that Senate leaders are trying to put to a vote by the end of next week.And conservative senators, led by Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are determined to hold the line on federal spending, pitting two Senate factions against each other.Senator John Cornyn of Texas emerged from a contentious closed-door lunch with Republican senators on Tuesday saying that he hoped the Senate would be able to meet the deadline of a vote before July 4. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cfailing that, I\u2019ve always said we need to get it done by\u201d the end of July.The emerging Senate bill, like the one approved narrowly by the House in early May, would end Medicaid as an open-ended entitlement program and replace it with capped payments to states, Republicans said. But starting in 2025, payments to the states would grow more slowly than those envisioned in the House bill.Republican senators from states that have been hit hard by the opioid drug crisis have tried to cushion the Medicaid blow with a separate funding stream of $45 billion over 10 years for substance abuse treatment and prevention costs, now covered by the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.How senators have different priorities on health care.But that, too, is running into opposition from conservatives. They have been tussling over the issue with moderate Republican senators like Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Susan Collins of Maine.Without some opioid funding, Mr. Portman cannot vote for the bill, he said, adding, \u201cAny replacement is going to have to do something to address this opioid crisis that is gripping our country.\u201dRepublicans hold 52 seats in the Senate and can afford to lose only two of their members if they hope to pass the bill, which is opposed by all Democrats and the two independents.While the proposed money for drug abuse treatment is relatively modest compared with spending for other items like Medicaid and premium tax credits, without it, hundreds of thousands of addicts would go without treatment, advocates say. The issue holds outsize political importance for senators like Mr. Portman, who has made advocacy for treatment legislation a calling card with voters at home.\u201cThe opioid issue has been a particular concern of mine and has been for years,\u201d said Mr. Portman, who has been leading the efforts with Senator Capito. \u201cThe reality is we have the worst drug crisis that our country\u2019s ever faced, and it\u2019s being driven by opioids.\u201dSenator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, who serves on a group shaping the final bill, said: \u201cWe need to address the opioid crisis in America. I want us to find a bipartisan solution with adequate funding.\u201dBut Republican leaders would not commit to Mr. Portman\u2019s proposal.The Medicaid and opioid issues are far from the only ones dividing Republican senators, who have been kept largely in the dark about a bill they are supposed to finally see on Thursday. Republican leaders are determined to keep their seven-year promise to unravel President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, but the near unanimity they need on a replacement is proving elusive.The House bill would allow per-capita Medicaid payments to states to grow along with the prices of medical goods and services, starting in 2020, with an extra allowance for older Americans and people with disabilities. Senator Toomey and several other conservatives have been pushing for a slower growth rate, to reflect increases in the overall Consumer Price Index, starting in 2025. Medical prices have historically grown faster than the overall index.Several Republican senators, including Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, have indicated they would like to exempt disabled children from the caps.Senator Collins\u2019s concerns cover almost the entire landscape of Republican problems: the loss of care for Medicaid recipients, the worries of states with especially high health care costs, and money for opioid treatment (8 percent of all births in her state, Maine, were to addicted mothers last year, she said). Then there are her complaints about the process.\u201cFirst, we haven\u2019t seen the bill,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cSecond, it has yet to receive a score from the Congressional Budget Office. And third is the process we are using.\u201dThat process \u2014 an arcane budget procedure that Republicans denounced when Democrats used it to pass just a small part of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 could make some provisions vulnerable to Democratic challenges to the bill. Not knowing which provisions will stay and which could be removed on the Senate floor makes evaluating the substance of the bill that much harder.Republican aides speculated that the restrictions on the growth of Medicaid, among other issues, could be altered later by Senate Republican leaders, in a bid to pick up support from the moderates.A bill this large with so much in flux days before it is to receive a vote on the floor is largely without precedent in the Senate.Senior Republican senators said six weeks ago that they would start afresh in writing a bill to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law, but the legislation they are developing is similar in many respects to the bill passed by the House.The Senate bill would eliminate penalties for people who do not have insurance and larger employers who do not offer it to employees \u2014 eviscerating the individual and employer mandates that were hallmarks of the Affordable Care Act. The Senate bill, like the House measure, would provide billions of dollars to states to help stabilize insurance markets, which Republicans say are tottering in many states.The Senate bill would also allow states to opt out of many federal insurance standards. Republican leaders said they wanted to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but it was not immediately clear how they would do so.Democrats stepped up their protests over the secrecy of the bill-writing process on Tuesday, and some Republicans chimed in. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, was a member of a health care working group formed by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, but even he was vexed by the process.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about federal spending on Medicaid and the opioid epidemic misstated, in some editions, the position of Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, on a proposal to spend $45 billion over 10 years for opioid abuse treatment and prevention costs. Mr. Toomey has not discussed that proposal with its supporters and said he is considering plans to increase funding for substance abuse programs; he has not opposed the $45 billion plan.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But he decided it was time to join the street protests against the government that had supported his career.Then the fatal shots rang out.\u201cWhen he fell, I didn\u2019t even know it was him,\u201d said William Hern\u00e1ndez, 19, a friend and fellow musician a short distance from Mr. Ca\u00f1izales during the protests last month. He never expected Mr. Ca\u00f1izales, who had expressed no political views to him, to be at the march. The viola had seemed to be the only thing on his mind.Yet no group has been tested quite like Venezuela\u2019s classical musicians, who for years have been drawn from the country\u2019s working-class barrios.El Sistema\u2019s youth orchestra toured the United States during years of tense relations between the countries. Its young prodigy, Gustavo Dudamel, became an international star and now leads the Los Angeles Philharmonic. A source of national pride, the classical music program was one of the few institutions that seemed exempt from Venezuela\u2019s growing polarization, and was protected by successive governments in return.\u201cIn its 42 years, El Sistema somehow managed to keep an impartial position,\u201d said Ollantay Vel\u00e1squez, the director of Mr. Ca\u00f1izales\u2019s orchestra. \u201cIt has stayed that way until today.\u201dYet the young man\u2019s death is rupturing that neutrality, underlining the kinds of dilemmas faced across Venezuela\u2019s institutions as street protests approach their third month, with at least 67 people dead in the turmoil.\u201cWe must stop ignoring the just cry of the people suffocated by an intolerable crisis,\u201d Mr. Dudamel warned. \u201cI raise my voice against violence. I raise my voice against repression.\u201dIn Venezuela, orchestra members have played memorial concerts for Mr. Ca\u00f1izales, using performances to denounce government officials as traitors. Other musicians say they are now following Mr. Ca\u00f1izales\u2019s example in the streets as well, heading into the front lines of protests with their instruments in tow.On a recent afternoon, Wuilly Arteaga, 23, stood in the center of a crowd of demonstrators, his violin on his shoulder. His case was strapped to his back, his helmet painted with the colors of the Venezuelan flag. He played the national anthem.Explosions of tear gas canisters erupted between the notes he played. Finally, other protesters grabbed him by a shoulder and dragged him back from the security forces.\u201cI remembered my friend Armando,\u201d Mr. Arteaga said afterward. \u201cI have spent ages now playing and living on the streets, and I see that so many talented Venezuelans have had to eat from the trash.\u201dAnthony, another classical musician, now spends his days on the front lines of the clashes with security forces, dodging tear gas canisters and rubber bullets. Some of the instructors have told him not to go, he said.\u201cThey\u2019ve begged us not to become polarized, not to show our political stripes,\u201d said Anthony, who asked that his full name not be used because he feared reprisals. \u201cMany of us go out concealed.\u201dLike most teenagers, Mr. Ca\u00f1izales grew up under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his leftist movement, which took power in Venezuela the year he was born.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, a populist buoyed by oil prices that skyrocketed after he came to power, used the money to reshape the country\u2019s political and economic order, expropriating foreign assets, building thousands of public housing units and schools, and directing profits from Venezuela\u2019s state oil company toward the poor.El Sistema was founded long before Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s movement, in 1975, by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abreu, a conductor working with an initial class of 11 students in a parking garage. But Mr. Ch\u00e1vez soon saw it as a driver of change in the country\u2019s poorest neighborhoods and a way to raise Venezuela\u2019s cultural profile abroad.\u201cRevolutionary Venezuela is aware of the infinite value of music as a bastion in the fight for equality and happiness,\u201d Mr. Ch\u00e1vez wrote in a 2011 letter to Mr. Abreu.Around age 10, Mr. Ca\u00f1izales took up the viola. Though he had planned to be a doctor one day, the instrument became an obsession for him \u2014 no less than \u201chis life,\u201d recalled Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez, his El Sistema professor.He loved Beethoven, said those who knew him. He practiced Georg Philipp Telemann, a Baroque composer whose Viola Concerto Mr. Ca\u00f1izales once played in a recital, perhaps with a bit of stage fright, missing a few notes.\u201cHe played for the love of it,\u201d said Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, the orchestra conductor.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013, replaced by a handpicked but much less popular successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who soon was saddled by falling oil prices. By 2015, basic foods, once imported by the government cheaply on oil dollars, had become scarce, demoralizing the country.El Sistema was beginning to suffer as well.Salaries of teachers were eroded by inflation, which reached triple digits. Basic maintenance of the main concert hall in the capital, Caracas, was neglected, and it suddenly flooded one night in 2016. Cascades of water dripped on the timpani drums stored there.\u201cJust to put strings on a viola became impossible,\u201d recalled Mr. P\u00e9rez, the teacher.Yet Mr. Ca\u00f1izales \u201cwas a boy of few words,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said. The teenager kept his own counsel, and few said they had known he was considering joining the street protests when they began to erupt in late spring.There is no record of the shooting. The next clip recorded by the journalist, Luis Olavarrieta, shows the young musician being rushed into an ambulance.\u201cNo, Armando, no!\u201d someone screams.Mr. P\u00e9rez, his viola teacher, learned of the news when he saw his student\u2019s name suddenly appear on Twitter that day.\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine it,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw \u2018Trending Topic, Armando Ca\u00f1izales,\u2019 and I said to my wife, \u2018What was Armando doing there?\u2019\u201dMr. Vel\u00e1squez, the orchestra conductor, was himself out protesting that day when he got a call. \u201cThey asked me if the boy was in my orchestra,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt impotent, like I had lost my son.\u201dIn the weeks since, the government and its rivals have pointed fingers at each other for Mr. Ca\u00f1izales\u2019s death, with opposition members blaming security forces. The government has suggested that a stray bullet from a protester was the cause.Mr. Olavarrieta, the journalist, said the shots had come from the side of the national guardsmen.\u201cThe discharge came from in front of him, and there was no one else there\u201d besides government forces, he said.Hundreds turned out for Mr. Ca\u00f1izales\u2019s funeral in May. Members of his orchestra set up their music stands in the cemetery to play. Someone held a Venezuelan flag.Mr. Ca\u00f1izales\u2019s mother, M\u00f3nica Carrillo, went up to the teacher, Mr. P\u00e9rez, and handed him her son\u2019s viola.\u201cI can\u2019t describe what I felt when I opened the case and took Armando\u2019s viola into my hands,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a pressure on my chest so strong, I just wanted to cry, it was so terrible.\u201dHe added: \u201cHis mother said, \u2018I want that Armando\u2019s viola gets played today.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

The students were beaming, and they would see about a dozen white dolphins during the recent all-day survey of the waters near Lantau, Hong Kong\u2019s largest island. (Despite their name, the dolphins often appear pink, thanks to blood vessels just under their skin.)Marine biologists say, however, that the long-term survival of the white dolphin \u2014 the official mascot of this former British colony\u2019s handover to China in 1997 \u2014 is in doubt.\u201cIt\u2019s such a terrible image for Hong Kong that we cannot protect our dolphins because we want even more money,\u201d said Samuel Hung, a biologist who has been studying the estuary\u2019s dolphins for decades and has battled the third runway project \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 in court.But critics call the third runway project a white elephant, in part because it is unclear how much airspace mainland aviation authorities will allocate to Hong Kong in the coming decades, or whether the city airport can even hope to compete over the long term with its mainland Chinese counterparts.Albert Cheng, an aircraft engineer and former Hong Kong legislator, said the city should not bother investing in a third runway because it had already been \u201cmarginalized by China in every aspect\u201d and would eventually lose its cachet as Asia\u2019s aviation hub, lowering demand for flights.Another issue is whether the project\u2019s proponents have accurately conveyed its environmental risks and whether the government should have allowed it to go forward.HSBC has been advising the Airport Authority \u201con the preparation of the environmental information that financing banks will need, when selected, in order to evaluate this project as lenders in accordance with the Equator Principles,\u201d Adam Harper, a spokesman for the bank, said in response to emailed questions about the runway project and the bank\u2019s corporate due diligence process. \u201cWe are committed to the Equator Principles.\u201dBut biologists say the proposed park would not protect the dolphins from construction-related noise between now and 2023, or cover critical dolphin habitats in Lantau\u2019s southwestern waters.\u201cThe saddest thing is that the experts from the airport say, \u2018It\u2019s O.K. for them to leave. They\u2019ll come back later,\u2019\u201d said Mak Hei Man, one of several researchers who conduct dolphin surveys off Lantau as part of a government-financed research project that began in the 1990s.\u201cBut in mainland waters, it\u2019s even worse,\u201d she said, referring to pollution and disturbances.\u201cMany people criticize this as unfair because most of the proponents either have a very strong interest in government, or they\u2019re actually government departments themselves,\u201d he said.The department disputed this, saying by email that the process allowed both the public and the Advisory Council on the Environment to inspect projects twice.Mr. Wang said that at some point, the dolphins could become so stressed and confused by the noise in the estuary that they would stop swimming away from noise sources, leading some observers to assume they were unbothered.\u201cPeople will misunderstand that, saying, \u2018Oh, they\u2019ve acclimatized, they\u2019re O.K. now,\u2019\u201d he said, standing on the deck of the survey boat. \u201cNo. They\u2019ve just given up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gone Since 9/11, Greenmarket Returns to World Trade Center", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt had been nearly 16 years since this part of Lower Manhattan had seen a farmers\u2019 market like this. Bunches of dried and fresh lavender. Vodka made from locally grown purple potatoes. Hand-spun maple syrup cotton candy. And rows and rows of geometrically stacked root vegetables: watermelon radishes, turnips, red beets, yellow beets, rainbow chard, mustard leaf, at least three different varieties of kale.The morning of June 20 was the first since Sept. 11, 2001, that vendors officially returned to the area where the once-renowned World Trade Center market operated. To the dozens of office workers passing through the plaza where the new market is, just east of 1 World Trade Center and on the north side of the Oculus, it looked like just another artisanal greenmarket.But among the colorful, trendy and, at times, fanciful offerings stood several farmers who had witnessed the attack, and who knew well the magnitude of the market\u2019s reopening here.Kernie Kernan, 47, a fourth-generation farmer at Kernan Farms in Bridgeton, N.J., recalled that he arrived early on Sept. 11, anticipating a typical day: rush hour sales between 7 and 9:30 a.m., another rush at lunch, then one more in the afternoon. He would usually cap his day by getting a slice at Pronto Pizza on Liberty Street, taking a bag of tomatoes to the counter guys.The World Trade Center market was one of the first to open in New York City; Mr. Kernan\u2019s father was there for the first day in 1984, and as a teenager Kernie was always energized by the \u201chustle and bustle,\u201d he said, of the scene at the World Trade Center. \u201cIt was a different kind of market,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cThe other ones felt like work; this was always my favorite.\u201dAt 8:46 a.m. on Sept. 11, Mr. Kernan was facing the twin towers and talking to his fianc\u00e9e when he heard a noise that sounded like a bomb, but he could not see what was happening. \u201cPapers on fire were flying down from the sky,\u201d he said.Ron Samascott, 63, of Samascott Orchards in Kinderhook, N.Y., who was also there that day, recalled his last shift at the World Trade Center market.\u201cWe got there at 6 a.m. with a big setup,\u201d he said as he unloaded mounds of snap peas and bunches of asparagus. \u201cSeptember is the biggest time for farmers\u2019 markets. Summer vacation is over and there\u2019s a lot of produce available. Our truck was full of produce, we had a big display and I heard jet engines, like we were on a runway. It sounded like the pilot was too close and that he was accelerating.\u201dMr. Samascott said his first reaction was to run, but he didn\u2019t know where to go.\u201cI could see the tower on fire, flames were coming out already and within less than a minute debris was all around us; insulation was covering our apple display,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure what was happening. Some people said it was a missile, but people came out of the building and wanted to buy corn and apples, and we were selling stuff for the next 15 minutes or so and then we heard the next plane. And I thought, \u2018Oh, man, this is not the place to be.\u2019\u201dHe grabbed the $1,500 he made before the attacks and started walking north with thousands of others. \u201cThere were farmers that stayed and tried to pack everything up, and they couldn\u2019t get their truck out anyway,\u201d Mr. Samascott said. \u201cAnd they were there for all that dust. I never thought the buildings would fall.\u201dThe market at the trade center he said, \u201cwas right at the base of the south tower, and those buildings went down in a straight line and everything was just crushed and destroyed.\u201d But all of the farmers and vendors got out, he said.In the years that followed, he and community organizers tried to reboot the market in other downtown locations. They set up shop in Zuccotti Park and City Hall Park, but neither could match the scope of the old greenmarket. There were not enough customers to make a profit. Construction prevented consistent foot traffic, and new downtown security regulations made it nearly impossible to drive a truck to the locations. Soon those attempts petered out.\u201cThe community really wanted this market back,\u201d said Jessica Lappin, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business improvement district.Now that the market is indeed back, Mr. Samascott and Mr. Kernan are cautiously optimistic about its future. They worry about the foot traffic and whether tourists will be interested in buying Swiss chard or turnips.The market had faced security challenges after the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center. Now, once again, it has adjusted. Farmers are required to go through multiple security checks with waist-high barriers just to get to the plaza to unload their goods. They have to pass three identification points as well, and their trucks have to drive underground for a full X-ray.She set up her cotton-candy spinning machine, a metal contraption that she had alerted security about. And that security was noticeable around the market: officers from the New York Police Department and the Port Authority police force, and employees of private companies.But on opening day none of that seemed to affect the traffic at the greenmarket, which will be open every Tuesday through November. Office workers and construction foremen browsed the goods. One woman who said she worked in finance bought strawberries and apple-cider doughnuts to share with office mates and asparagus to cook at home. A budget analyst for the city picked up her morning muffin and juice on the way to work, with plans to return for lunch.\u201cIt\u2019s a little eerie coming back, but I love it,\u201d Mr. Kernan said. \u201cIf people know we\u2019re here, we could do well again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Bridges: Rising High, but Buried in Debt", "Date": "2017-06-10", "News": "China has built hundreds of dazzling new bridges, including the longest and highest, but many have fostered debt and corruption.Supported byCHISHI, China \u2014 Soaring over a lush valley in southern China, the Chishi Bridge is a 1.4-mile-long marvel of concrete and steel. Four piers, like graceful tuning forks as tall as skyscrapers, secure cables suspending a four-lane expressway 610 feet above fields of corn and rice.Squinting up from a dirt road below, Gu Tianyong, a 66-year-old farmer, pondered the colossus, which is a shortcut linking southwestern China with the east coast.\u201cThe government wouldn\u2019t have built it if it was useless,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does nothing for me, but must be useful for the country.\u201dThe Chishi Bridge is one of hundreds of dazzling bridges erected across the country in recent years. Chinese officials celebrate them as proof that they can roll out infrastructure bigger, better and higher than any other country can. China now boasts the world\u2019s highest bridge, the longest bridge, the highest rail trestle and a host of other superlatives, often besting its own efforts.The eye-popping structures have slashed travel times in some areas, made business easier and generated a sizable slice of the country\u2019s economy, laying a foundation, in theory at least, for decades of future growth.But as the bridges and the expressways they span keep rising, critics say construction has become an end unto itself. Fueled by government-backed loans and urged on by the big construction companies and officials who profit from them, many of the projects are piling up debt and breeding corruption while producing questionable transportation benefits.Leaders defend the infrastructure spree as crucial to China\u2019s development.Indeed, the new roads and railways have proved popular, especially in wealthier areas with many businesses and heavy commuter traffic. And even empty infrastructure often has a way of eventually filling up, as early critics of the country\u2019s high-speed rail and the Pudong skyscrapers in Shanghai have discovered.But if the jury is still out on the bridges\u2019 benefits, one can still admire their engineering prowess.Of the world\u2019s 100 highest bridges, 81 are in China, including some unfinished ones, according to Mr. Sakowski\u2019s data. (The Chishi Bridge ranks 162nd.)A primary motive is economic growth: Infrastructure spending surged as part of a huge stimulus program after the 2008 global financial crisis. Each bridge can cost billions and employ hundreds of workers for several years.But the endless construction has also created a self-perpetuating gravy train, feeding corruption and distorting priorities.And as gleaming expressways and majestic bridges spread into less populated areas, the cost-benefit ratio of each new mile of asphalt drops sharply.They were certainly roads to riches for Mr. Chen and his colleagues. In the past six years, anticorruption inquiries have toppled more than 27 Hunan transportation officials.The Chishi Bridge was among the tainted projects. But the bridge and hundreds like it \u2014 overpriced, underused and sinking in debt \u2014 are squeezing governments across China.The projects are often financed by loans from state-owned banks to companies owned by local governments, which collect tolls to repay the loans. But on many routes in less populous inland regions, tolls are not keeping pace with the costs, setting off a spiral of mounting debt and rising expenses.But provincial officials say they are trapped. They cannot afford to lower tolls to attract more drivers to the Chishi Bridge and the 70-mile expressway it connects, but raising tolls would reduce traffic.Thanks to government backing, the state-owned company building the bridge is unlikely to default or go bankrupt. But bridges like Chishi leave local governments and developers struggling with debt, and those who live below nonplused.\u201cIf you don\u2019t build roads, there can\u2019t be prosperity,\u201d said Huang Sanliang, a 56-year-old farmer who lives under the bridge. \u201cBut this is an expressway, not a second- or third-grade road. One of those might be better for us here.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Killed Half a Million Indians?", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTuberculosis has killed many more Indians in a year than decades of insurgencies and incidents of sectarian violence. Of the 10.4 million people in the world who had TB in 2015, three million were Indians. Across the globe, 1.8 million patients died from TB in 2015, and almost half a million of them died in India. A staggering number of Indians \u2014 over 400 million \u2014 are estimated to be infected with TB.Within three decades of its conception, India\u2019s Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (R.N.T.C.P.) has become one of the world\u2019s largest public TB programs. It aspires to provide free TB treatment to all Indians. To do so, it has established a network of laboratories and clinics throughout the country as well as a robust community health worker program to provide rapid testing and standardized treatment for TB.The R.N.T.C.P. is familiar with unfunded mandates, and despite the stretching of every rupee, bills rack up quickly in TB programs. Take the program\u2019s intention of modernizing the country\u2019s TB testing, for instance. Diagnosing TB using microscopy is a common technique that dates to the 1880s. Unfortunately, microscopy requires specialized labor and is prone to error. Incubating sputum in the laboratory is more sensitive but takes weeks.Tests like the Xpert MTB/RIF could theoretically decentralize and accelerate TB diagnostics in India and help turn the tide of the epidemic. But each test cartridge costs roughly $10. Even if testing is extremely targeted to, say, the three million Indians most at risk, that\u2019s $30 million. What if we have to test 10 people to diagnose one case? That would be $300 million, exceeding the entirety of India\u2019s 2016 TB budget.To eradicate TB, finding active cases is necessary along with rapid initiation of TB treatment and ensuring the completion of therapy. Additionally, contacts of TB patients must be located, tested and treated if necessary. Enlarging India\u2019s corps of community health workers will be important for these activities.Millions of Indians have died of TB, and millions more have seen the disease stifle their hopes of a better tomorrow. It is time for the Indian government to cough up the money needed to end the suffering.Pranay Sinha is a physician in his final year of residency in the department of internal medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital.

{"Headline": "Australian Politics Is Open to Foreign Cash, and China Has Much to Gain", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 As the United States investigates Russia\u2019s efforts to sway last year\u2019s presidential election, Australia is engaged in a heated debate over how vulnerable its own political system is to foreign influence \u2014 and whether China is already meddling in it.One of the donors is said to have withdrawn a large contribution last year because of a political party\u2019s position on the disputed South China Sea, suggesting a back-room effort to shift public discussion of a delicate policy issue in Beijing\u2019s favor.But the nation is now asking how a multicultural society should police a Communist power that has a record of mobilizing, and sometimes bullying, ethnic Chinese overseas to support its goals \u2014 and how it can do so without succumbing to racist xenophobia that treats everyone of Chinese descent as suspects.China\u2019s attempts to translate its economic might into political influence have caused unease in many countries. But the challenge is acute in Australia.Many Australians view good ties with China as critical to their future prosperity, and Australia is an especially enticing target for Beijing because of its strategic value in the Pacific \u2014 and because foreign donations are both legal and difficult to track in its loose, opaque campaign finance system.By contrast, such donations are largely banned in the United States, Canada and throughout most of Europe.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that China is more active but that Australia is more receptive in some respects and more vulnerable,\u201d said John Fitzgerald, a professor at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, who studies civil society in China.Concern about the influence of Chinese money has been building for years and erupted again with new disclosures about the two businessmen, both billionaire property developers: Chau Chak Wing, an Australian citizen, and Huang Xiangmo, a resident who has applied for citizenship.But the Liberal Party and its governing coalition partners, as well as the opposition Labor Party, continued to take the money. The news organizations found that the men and their associates had made at least $5 million in political donations in Australia in recent years, including more than $820,000 since Mr. Lewis\u2019s warning.The most striking disclosure, though, revolves around a donation that did not occur. As a general election approached last year, Mr. Huang pledged to give an additional $300,000 to the Labor Party. But weeks before the vote, the report said, he rescinded the offer and made clear why: He was upset about a party official saying Australia should send naval patrols to challenge Beijing\u2019s claims to the South China Sea.The Pentagon has urged Australia to join it on such patrols, but the government has resisted.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was preparing legislation to ban foreign political donations. \u201cJust as modern China was based on an assertion of national sovereignty, so China should always respect the sovereignty of other nations, including our own,\u201d he said.But the broader problem may be the role of big money in Australian politics. Campaign financing is largely unregulated, with no limits on fund-raising, donations or spending, and critics say that has resulted in a culture of soft corruption that Chinese donors have learned to exploit alongside other corporate interests in Australia.At the federal level, it takes seven to 19 months for the public to learn how much parties have raised and from whom, and donors are identified only if they have contributed more than 13,500 Australian dollars, or about $10,000. As a result, individuals, and corporations, can anonymously make multiple donations below that threshold. At the same time, Australian politicians are not required to explain what they do with the money.\u201cWhat we have is a thick shroud of secrecy regarding political donations at the federal level,\u201d said Joo-Cheong Tham, an associate professor at Melbourne Law School. \u201cI think that clearly gives rise to the perception, at the very least, of corruption and undue influence.\u201dSecretary of State Rex W. Tillerson hinted at Washington\u2019s concern after meetings in Sydney on Monday. \u201cWe cannot allow China to use its economic power to buy its way out of other problems,\u201d he said.But defining what a \u201cChinese connection\u201d is and when it should matter is contentious. More than 4 percent of Australia\u2019s population is of Chinese ancestry, and Chinese-Australians often confront suspicion when they invest or become involved in politics.\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to be so careful with what we mean by \u2018foreigner,\u2019 because if we mean by \u2018foreigner\u2019 people who are born overseas, that includes many Australians, including myself,\u201d Professor Tham said. \u201cIt disenfranchises people who are legitimately members of this community.\u201dOne of the donors flagged by Australian intelligence, Dr. Chau, immigrated decades ago. He has long maintained that his campaign contributions are benign and unrelated to the Chinese government. But his profile suggests close ties with the Chinese authorities, and his political contacts in Australia would enhance his stature in China.\u201cThe Chinese realize that they need to make their voices heard in the political circle so as to seek more interests for the Chinese,\u201d he told reporters recently.In a statement on Tuesday, though, he denied linking his donations to foreign policy. \u201cI expect nothing in return,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile some seek to reinforce negative stereotypes about Chinese involvement in Australia, I am committed to more positive pursuits.\u201dChen Yonglin, a former Chinese consular official in Australia who defected in 2005, said the donations disclosed so far were \u201cvery small compared to the transactions completed under the table,\u201d including free trips to China and other gifts to politicians that can be impossible to track.China\u2019s growing leverage over academia has also come under scrutiny as universities have become increasingly dependent on tuition paid by Chinese students and, in some cases, donations from Chinese benefactors. The fear is that Beijing is using this leverage to stifle critical views.Dr. Chau, for example, gave $15 million to the University of Technology Sydney for a building that bears his name, and Mr. Huang\u2019s money helped establish the Australia-China Relations Institute at the university, overseen by a former foreign minister, Bob Carr.Mr. Carr argues that the institute is independent of Beijing\u2019s influence. But Feng Chongyi, a professor at the university who has criticized the Communist Party\u2019s suppression of dissent, said the institute had repeatedly brushed off his efforts to get involved.Professor Feng said Australia must decide whether money or values defined its politics. \u201cThe question is whether you\u2019re willing to make sacrifices to fight these illiberal tendencies,\u201d he said, in his tiny office near the gleaming Dr. Chau Chak Wing Building on campus. \u201cIf you don\u2019t maintain your core values, it\u2019s all just business.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research from Beijing and Xiuzhong Xu from Melbourne.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Has Busy Day in Vortex of Middle East Relations", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rarely has the Trump administration spoken of Iran other than to condemn it as the world\u2019s chief sponsor of terrorism and an aspiring nuclear weapons state. So when the White House woke on Wednesday to images of a possible Islamic State attack on Tehran, it prompted a sharp quandary: How does President Trump condemn the violence without seeming to embrace the victims?Several administration officials said it took most of the day for the White House to work out the terse, curt wording of a statement that sought to show sympathy for the Iranian public even as it pointedly suggested that the behavior of Tehran\u2019s clerical leaders made its people a target.\u201cWe grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cWe underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.\u201dThe statement capped a day during which Mr. Trump thrust himself into the messy politics of Persian Gulf states, trying to also play peacemaker in a bitter dispute between Qatar and other Sunni Muslim neighbors that threatens to splinter a Middle Eastern alliance fighting the Islamic State.For the administration, Wednesday served as a reminder that the world does not operate in the black-and-white terms that Mr. Trump used on the campaign trail and on Twitter, one in which the Sunni-dominated Islamic State and Shiite Iran are part of a continuum of \u201cradical Islamic extremism.\u201d\u201cThis is an illustration of the competing priorities and contradictions facing this administration, which will prove hard to reconcile,\u201d said Robert Malley, the top Middle East policy official for the Obama administration. \u201cYou can\u2019t be all-out against Iran, all-out against ISIS and terrorism, and maintain \u2018America First\u2019 \u2014 another way of saying keeping a light footprint in the region.\u201dThat call followed several by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who knows the Sunni gulf leaders from his days as chief executive of Exxon Mobil. He asked Saudi officials to list the demands they want Doha to meet in return for an end to the dispute, and lift a newly imposed embargo against Qatar by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and several other states.Inside the administration, Mr. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis repeatedly noted that the United States could not afford a rupture between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. There are roughly 11,000 American troops at Al Udeid Air Base, outside Doha, where the air war against the Islamic State is managed.The Qataris were shocked at the contradiction between evenhanded statements from the State Department and Pentagon, and Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets castigating the tiny Gulf state. They began asking American officials whether their longtime alliance was in peril.By Wednesday, Mr. Trump offered to invite both sides to the White House and suggested Mr. Tillerson as a mediator. The president also called the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, to repeat his urgings on Twitter to cut off financing of extremist groups. While Qatar\u2019s support for those groups \u2014 including the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Saudis and the Egyptians consider a serious threat \u2014 is without question, the same charge could be leveled at the Saudis, who have allowed funds to flow to other Sunni extremists.Analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s public support for Saudi Arabia emboldened the kingdom and sent a chill through other Gulf states, including Oman and Kuwait, that fear that any country that defies the Saudis or the United Arab Emirates could face ostracism as Qatar has.\u201cEveryone in the region is looking over their shoulder, thinking, \u2018This is potentially us,\u2019\u201d said Gerald M. Feierstein, a former ambassador to Yemen who was the State Department\u2019s second-ranking diplomat for Middle East policy from 2013 to 2016.Mr. Feierstein, now the director for gulf affairs at the Middle East Institute, said that \u201cthe bottom line for us is, we have to come out of all this with a consensus on combating terror finance and not blowing the G.C.C. to smithereens,\u201d he said, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council, the loose association of Sunni Arab states.Among the Saudi complaints about Qatar \u2014 mostly that it finances extremists and hosts Al Jazeera, the Arab news channel that is frequently critical of the Saudis \u2014 is its episodic cooperation with Iran. That may add to Mr. Trump\u2019s suspicions about Qatar.Ultimately, Mr. Trump told the Saudi and Qatari leaders that the campaign against the Islamic State would be more effective with a unified alliance. Mr. Trump also spoke on Wednesday with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi in the U.A.E., underscoring G.C.C. unity to promote regional stability, \u201cbut never at the expense of eliminating funding for radical extremism or defeating terrorism,\u201d according to an administration statement.Mr. Trump\u2019s hesitant response to the terrorist attack in Iran underscored that the hurdles to pursuing a unified strategy come from Washington as well.The Trump administration is divided about how to deal with Tehran, and two White House reviews of Iran policy have been grinding ahead for weeks.The carefully bifurcated White House statement about the onslaught in Iran, which killed 12 and wounded 46, was issued shortly before 4 p.m. in Washington. More than three hours earlier, the State Department issued its own statement to stoutly condemn the attacks.\u201cWe express our condolences to the victims and their families, and send our thoughts and prayers to the people of Iran,\u201d said a State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert. \u201cThe depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful, civilized world.\u201dOne faction in the National Security Council has been pressing to find ways to sanction Iran, hoping to reimpose economic penalties against Tehran that were lifted after the 2015 nuclear agreement between world powers and the Islamic republic. But that strategy risks blowing up the accord, which others in the administration \u2014 including Mr. Mattis and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 want to preserve to keep Iran from quickly developing a nuclear weapon. To date, Iran has complied with the agreement.But there appears to be no chance, administration officials say, that the Trump administration will try to find common cause with Tehran on fighting the Islamic State. Nor does there appear to be a strategy yet for managing the growing competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran for dominance of the Middle East.The result is that while the Trump administration now finds itself in the middle of the Saudi-Qatari dispute, it may soon find itself caught between the Saudis and Iran. On Wednesday, Tehran accused the Saudis of likely being behind the terrorist attack against the Parliament in Tehran, despite no evidence of such responsibility so far.\u201cIt\u2019s in U.S. interests to try and compel Tehran and Riyadh to address their differences and cooperate against ISIS,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cAcrimony and distrust between Iran and Saudi Arabia only causes more civilian casualties in Syria and Yemen, more refugees pouring into Europe, and more Sunni and Shia radicalism.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Day-to-day management was left to a committee of more than 10 executives, but that wasn\u2019t enough for the investors, who had pumped millions of dollars into the embattled company.The investors included some of the most prominent venture capitalists, led by Benchmark\u2019s Bill Gurley, who sits on the Uber board, as well as the mutual fund manager Fidelity Investments. The investors own more than a quarter of Uber\u2019s stock and about 40 percent of voting power because their stock gives them an outsize number of votes.The Saudis hope to offer 5 percent of the company to foreign investors, raising as much as $100 billion in what could be the biggest I.P.O. in history. The highly secretive company, which has been valued at between $400 billion to $2 trillion, has underpinned the Saudi economy for decades, but as oil prices collapsed, it became more difficult to provide financing for the government.Investment funds representing $1.6 trillion will be under heavy but informal pressure to start buying Chinese shares next year, leading to $17 billion in fresh money being pumped into the stock markets. Foreign investors own just less than 1.5 percent of Chinese stocks.Many investors measure the performance of money managers against MSCI indexes: That puts pressure on active managers to buy the shares in the index, and then add or subtract stocks to beat it. China\u2019s inclusion could make the indexes more attractive.The Chinese government has long lobbied for inclusion because it could help establish Shanghai and Shenzhen as global financial centers and could push money managers to pay more attention to corporate governance in the country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Faith and Family, in Transition", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "An evangelical minister reassesses his Brooklyn ministry when his father, also a minister, comes out as a transgender woman.Supported byJonathan Williams was three months into his ministry when his father called to say they needed to talk. Paul Williams, Jonathan\u2019s father, was prominent in the evangelical Christian world, chairman of an organization that started independent churches around the country. One of those churches was Jonathan\u2019s, Forefront Brooklyn, a new congregation that met in a performance space downtown. Paul Williams\u2019s organization, Orchard Group, had helped it raise $400,000 and assemble a staff.Paul Williams had never felt entirely comfortable with who he was. When he was very young, he thought he would someday get to choose his gender, probably before kindergarten, and at that point he would choose to be what he felt, a girl. And when the figure he thought of as the gender fairy never materialized, he soldiered on.He followed his own father into ministry, preaching as a guest in some of the country\u2019s largest evangelical churches; he married a minister\u2019s daughter, fathered three children and became a successful executive in a conservative Christian organization. From their home on Long Island, he loved to take Jonathan hiking or mountain biking. He was an alpha male, the head of a religious home. Whatever else was going on in his mind, he decided, was a secret that he would take to his grave.Then, sometime before his call to Jonathan in late 2012, he decided that he couldn\u2019t do that any longer.Jonathan, who is now 40 and favors rumpled shirts and faded jeans, came to ministry without strong positions on sexual or gender issues. He knew few openly gay people, and no transgender people. \u201cAbortion I didn\u2019t have an opinion on,\u201d he said recently at the Whole Foods Market near his home in Brooklyn. \u201cPremarital sex, same thing. My wife and I waited until we got married. It was something we valued at the time. The evangelical culture told you that that\u2019s what you do, and we did it.\u201dAt Forefront, when people asked him if his church welcomed gay congregants, his answer was always the same, he said: Yes, of course, everyone is welcome and loved. \u201cAnd then later on if they were asking, \u2018Well, are you going to hire someone who\u2019s gay?\u2019 at the time I would say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to hire someone who\u2019s gay, because we\u2019re under the Orchard Group umbrella, and they take a stance that says this.\u2019 It was an easy excuse for me, \u2019cause I wasn\u2019t sure at the time what I thought, so it was convenient. There was a line I couldn\u2019t cross, and I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to cross it, either, at that point.\u201dIn December 2012, when his father flew in from his home in Colorado to talk with him, Jonathan thought that his parents might be splitting up, or that his father had cheated on his mother. Maybe, he thought, his father was going to say he was gay.Then his father said that he wanted to live as a woman. \u201cShe said transgender,\u201d Jonathan said, inadvertently using the female pronoun, though at the time his father still used the male.\u201cI was relieved for a split second, not really knowing or understanding what it was,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cThis was before Caitlyn Jenner or \u2018Transparent.\u2019 Then within minutes, going: \u2018Oh, wait a second \u2014 wait a second. This is a way bigger deal. I would rather you be gay or be splitting up from Mom.\u2019 It was this weird wave of emotion. We had a church Christmas party that night, so I get this information and I have to go to the church Christmas party and pretend everything\u2019s O.K. I drank too much and did my best to put on a happy face, but it was pretty brutal.\u201dAt Whole Foods, he managed a wry smile at the strangeness of that day: how unprepared he was, how it set in motion events that shape his church today.His father had been his male role model and daily counselor in his ministry, as well as his entry into the evangelical world that financed his church.Now, he said: \u201cI felt betrayed, lied to. I didn\u2019t want to know my dad\u2019s new name for six, seven months after it happened. Then she said, \u2018Paula,\u2019 and I said, \u2018O.K., it\u2019s not that bad.\u2019 But I was still feeling angry.\u201dPaula Williams, 66, is 6-foot-3, with light brown ringlets, a soft voice and an affinity for phrases like, \u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d She is still married to Jonathan\u2019s mother, and they share a Christian counseling practice, but they no longer live together. \u201cOur therapist basically said, \u2018You\u2019re a lesbian and she\u2019s not,\u2019\u201d Ms. Williams said.On a warm afternoon last month, she was at the West End Collegiate Church in Manhattan for a conference of female evangelical church leaders. The conference happened to begin on her birthday, and that morning she had received a birthday email telling her that it was not too late for her to turn back to God and live as a man. She received other messages, too, that were not as mild, and some that were not mild at all.For months after she told her son about wanting to make the transition, the secret remained within the family. Paul still lived as a man within Orchard Group; Jonathan worked on establishing Forefront Brooklyn, with guidance and financial support from pastors at other conservative churches.For Jonathan, the secret threatened both his father\u2019s career and the fledgling church. People had committed their lives to making Forefront Brooklyn work, or looked to the church for moral guidance. Did he owe it to them to confide that there was a storm coming that might blow the church away?\u201cI couldn\u2019t say anything to anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cHere I am going, \u2018Let\u2019s be authentic, let\u2019s be a community that loves one another,\u2019 and I\u2019m not being authentic. I\u2019m not telling people what\u2019s going on in my life.\u201cI\u2019d be upstairs crying before church. Like, this is miserable. My dad was my hero, and my dad\u2019s not my dad any longer. I\u2019d stop crying and come down and I\u2019d preach and be really glad and say hi to everybody, and then I\u2019d get home and go to sleep. My wife would be like, \u2018You\u2019re superdepressed,\u2019 and I\u2019d go, \u2018I know, I\u2019m superdepressed, I don\u2019t know what to do about this.\u2019 I got counseling about three months after I found out. And I went to him for three, four years dealing with it.\u201dIn 2013, Paul Williams told Orchard Group that he could not live as a man any longer. He expected the board to keep him on for another two years to complete projects he had started. After all, Ms. Williams said, the Bible was mostly silent on transgender issues, except for one verse, Deuteronomy 22:5 (sometimes written, \u201cThe woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman\u2019s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God\u201d), which struck her as no more binding than biblical proscriptions against trimmed beards or long hair.Friends felt angry or betrayed, Ms. Williams said. Some prayed for her, others cut off all ties. She recalled that one young leader told her, \u201cYou were my only example of an alpha male who was gentle.\u201dThe words hit her hard. \u201cI was an alpha male and I was gentle,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cAnd I began to realize to how many of these young pastors I had been a father figure.\u201dIn Brooklyn, Jonathan Williams was still dependent on the good will of people who considered gender reassignment contrary to God\u2019s wishes. He told congregants that Forefront was a place for questions, not for answers, but many days he found himself at sea.Despite his pedigree, he had taken a circuitous route to the ministry. He stopped attending church at age 18 because it was \u201ctoo judgmental\u201d and returned six years later only because a woman said she would not date him unless he did (the two are now married, with two children). Instead of pursuing a divinity degree, he earned a master\u2019s in multicultural and urban education, and for seven years he taught fifth grade in a poor neighborhood in West Philadelphia.His parents were more supportive than he expected, he said. \u201cThey said, \u2018O.K., you\u2019re asking a lot of questions, and we feel some of the same ways you feel,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhen I look back now, I think, Was my dad going through some of his struggles with his identity, and my mom having her own struggles as well?\u201d As for his time away from church, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t miss it.\u201dWhen Paula visited for the first time in September 2013, after some hormone replacement and cosmetic surgery \u2014 she declined to discuss the details of her transition, saying it would be inconsiderate of people who cannot afford surgery \u2014 Jonathan worried that people would look at her funny or make comments. He became protective of his father, who had always protected him. But when he saw that she passed as a tastefully dressed professional woman, he found the normalcy even harder to assimilate. \u201cI\u2019m like, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. So after that I don\u2019t think I talked to her again for like another six months. Before that we talked every day, so to not talk for six months was huge.\u201d He kept his father away from his daughters, not wanting them to see their grandfather as a woman.\u201cThat was my lowest point, probably,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really depressed, not doing well, really struggling. My staff said: \u2018What\u2019s going on? You\u2019re in bad shape.\u2019\u201dStefany Fontela, 32, was an original member of Forefront Brooklyn who became close to Jonathan Williams during this period. Like him, she had also spent her early adult years estranged from the church. On a recent Sunday at the performance space Roulette, where the church meets, Ms. Fontela bounded down an aisle in a denim jacket, hugging friends from the congregation, which on this day numbered about 100, mostly in their 20s and 30s. In college in California, Ms. Fontela had been asked to leave her church and Christian sorority because she was a lesbian, and she ultimately dropped out of school.\u201cI felt that the church gave up on me,\u201d she said recently over lunch near the tech company where she works as a designer. \u201cIf anything, me not going to church forced me to develop a personal relationship with God that helped me at that moment in a way I needed it to. I was really upset. I was depressed. So I really leaned into faith. In those moments that are really dark, and you can\u2019t go to church, I could pray, I could read Scripture and try to focus.\u201cBut it was one of the darkest times of my life. The girl that I fell for abandoned me. The church abandoned me. Certain friends abandoned me because of coming out. I would sleep and listen to sad music and go to work so I could pay the rent, and that was it.\u201dWhen she got to New York and started visiting churches that described themselves as \u201cgay affirming,\u201d meaning that gay people could participate in all aspects of church life, including marrying within the church, some were too small, some not theologically rigorous enough for her. She saw an internet listing for Forefront in Manhattan, which predated the Brooklyn branch, and decided to give it a try. Though the website did not say the church was gay-affirming, there were no statements opposed to same-sex marriage, and a Google search of the pastors did not turn up any antigay remarks. At a brunch with some members, when the topic of same-sex marriage came up, Ms. Fontela waited for someone to say something that would force her to leave, she said. But everyone supported it, she said.\u201cI\u2019m sitting in this big table of Christians, and they\u2019re all completely for this thing that I\u2019ve been hiding and afraid of sharing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt got to my turn to chime in, and I could barely get the words out. I said: \u2018I don\u2019t think you guys realize how important all the things you\u2019re saying are to me right now, because I\u2019m gay and I\u2019ve been afraid to tell you guys. I feel safe.\u2019 They just embraced me even more.\u201dMs. Fontela was energetic and vivacious, eager to get more involved in the church. But Forefront was \u201cgay welcoming\u201d rather than \u201cgay inclusive\u201d or \u201cgay affirming,\u201d meaning that she could attend but not participate except from the seats. When a local blog wrote about the church \u2014 a potential boon for a new congregation seeking members \u2014 Mr. Williams and his staff did not publicize the article because Ms. Fontela talked about being a lesbian. \u201cWe could lose our support,\u201d she said.Such conflicts were making Mr. Williams increasingly restless in the church network. Ms. Fontela had become a close friend, sometimes an overnight guest, and strong in her faith. Was she really unfit to lead? What about other gay men and lesbians who might be part of the church? In summer 2014 his father visited again, and this time they had a five-hour airing of grievances \u2014 \u201cI said things like, \u2018You were a bad parent when I was 16,\u2019\u201d Mr. Williams recalled \u2014 after which he introduced his father to his two daughters, who were ages 4 and 6.\u201cI said: \u2018Girls, you\u2019re going to meet Grandpa, but it\u2019s no longer Grandpa. Grandpa is a woman. Grandpa feels she\u2019s been a woman her whole life, and now she\u2019s going to start living as a woman. So now your Grandpa\u2019s going to look different.\u2019 They walk into the house and she\u2019s there and she says hi, and after about 15 seconds my 4-year-old goes, \u2018Do you have a penis?\u2019 And we all just erupted laughing. And then it was normal.\u201dGrandpaula, they called her.On that visit, Mr. Williams remembers watching his father with the girls, holding their hands on the street. \u201cAnd that was a really big moment for me, because I was like, \u2018This is how God sees my dad,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe way my kids see my dad is the way God sees my dad. They\u2019ve got nothing but love, nothing but joy. At that point I was like, O.K., we\u2019re going to publicly talk about this now, as a church.\u201d It hurt him, he said, that his father would be a second-class member of the church. At a staff meeting in 2015, he told his core group that the church would move toward full participation for gay, lesbian and transgender members.\u201cWe took a tour of everybody who\u2019s done this in the evangelical world,\u201d seeking advice, Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt was not a big tour.\u201dDoug Pagitt in Minneapolis was one stop on the tour. Mr. Pagitt is the pastor of Solomon\u2019s Porch church and the founder of the Organizing Progressive Evangelical Network, a loose association of churches that strives for greater inclusiveness. He estimated that several dozen evangelical churches have officially affirmed gay members in recent years, with many more moving in that direction. But the path was risky, he said. Mr. Pagitt warned Mr. Williams that churches that have taken it, including EastLake Community Church near Seattle and GracePointe Church near Nashville, lost up to 70 percent of their members and large shares of their revenues. \u201cIt\u2019s not the smartest growth model,\u201d Mr. Pagitt said.\u201cIn mainline churches, clergy tend to be more progressive than their congregations,\u201d Mr. Pagitt added. \u201cIn evangelical churches, clergy tend to be more conservative than the people in the pews. And people like it that way. So when the pastor becomes more progressive, that shocks the system. Even people who are themselves O.K. with gay people in churches, something shocks them about their pastor changing. Having that conservative anchor is something they find very freeing.\u201dGo easy with the congregation, Mr. Pagitt told Mr. Williams. Make sure the people who were uncomfortable with the change did not feel indicted or unwelcome.When Mr. Williams told people that his father was transgender, reactions were divided. His childhood friends from Long Island, after their initial shock, told him that his father was happy and that he should accept that. \u201cAnd in the church world people were like, \u2018We love you, how can we support you, how can we help you,\u2019 but with an undertone of: \u2018We know your dad\u2019s wrong. We think that he should talk to so-and-so, who\u2019s a great Christian counselor.\u2019 I don\u2019t think anybody out-and-out said, \u2018Your dad is wrong.\u2019 But there was an undertone of: \u2018This isn\u2019t right. We\u2019re sorry you have to go through this thing that\u2019s not right.\u2019\u201dBecause Orchard Group is a church-planting organization and not a denomination, it provides support for a limited time, after which the churches go their own way. At Forefront Brooklyn, Mr. Williams was expected to become financially independent by 2016, four years after its start. Until then, he said, he was under the group\u2019s aegis, including restrictions against affirming gay members.Orchard Group\u2019s chief executive, Brent Storms, declined to comment for this article. Jonathan Williams emphasized that he maintained a \u201cvery strong\u201d relationship with the organization and close friendships with his associates there.But he was moving Forefront Brooklyn toward affirming gay members. He invited a gay speaker to talk about his faith and told the congregation, \u201cYou might not all agree with this, but we\u2019re not after uniformity, we\u2019re after unity, and this is the church we\u2019re going to be now.\u201d He encouraged people of divergent views to stay in the church and shape the conversations.Finally, in April 2016, Mr. Williams told his congregants that the change was official: They could now fully participate in the church whatever their sexual orientation.Ultimately, about a quarter of the congregation, 30 to 50 people, left. \u201cI had people I thought I was really good friends with leave the church,\u201d Ms. Fontela said. \u201cI had no idea they had a problem with me being gay and the church saying it was O.K. I was hurt. I know it hurt Jonathan as much as it hurt me.\u201dSarah Ngu, a new member, said she knew gay congregants who left because they thought the church was becoming too progressive, straying too far from the Bible.But new people joined the church, some referred by gay evangelical organizations. Affirming gay members distinguished Forefront from similar churches. Though finances are tight, Mr. Williams said the church has grown stronger.\u201cWe\u2019re a more transparent church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe say a lot of times that we\u2019re way more interested in asking good questions than having the answers. And I think people were able to open up with a lot of questions, not necessarily related to that. Like, I don\u2019t know if Christianity works for me, but I\u2019m still here. Or, I\u2019m battling bipolar disorder, but I\u2019m here. It opened us up to talk through our struggles.\u201dFor Paula Williams, a surprise of coming out as transgender was discovering the extent of misogyny and male privilege within the church, and the degree to which she had benefited from these in her male past. Churches that once welcomed her in the pulpit would no longer permit her to preach, not because she was transgender, but because she was female.For the family, she said, the hardest part was not having a chance to mourn Paul. He was the head of the household, and one day he was gone \u2014 not dead or estranged, but a pronoun they no longer used.Jonathan Williams said he worked to keep sexual issues from dominating Forefront\u2019s identity. He had started the church with an emphasis on service and social justice, and he wanted to maintain this.\u201cI\u2019m very clear that we\u2019re a Christian church,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere we plant our flag is in Jesus Christ. We just happen to be inclusive and affirming. But we\u2019re not the gay church. And that\u2019s something I\u2019ve said from the stage: No, we\u2019re a Jesus-believing church.\u201dOn a spring Sunday at Roulette, Ben Grace, Forefront Brooklyn\u2019s worship director, led the congregation through a light rock song welcoming \u201ca rainbow of race and gender and color\u201d and claiming \u201cfor everyone born, the right to be free.\u201d Mr. Williams in his sermon made no mention of sex or gender, hewing instead to themes of social justice.He told a story about Jesus healing lepers and restoring them to their communities, then segued to Colin Kaepernick, the pro football quarterback who was criticized for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police violence. \u201cWe struggle with people who upend social structures,\u201d Mr. Williams said, contrasting this to the \u201cneat, tidy Jesus\u201d envisioned by many Christians. \u201cNo, Jesus is crazy, he\u2019s upending social structures.\u201d\u201cThis is the Jesus that we want to follow,\u201d he added.It was not polished, and he seemed most comfortable describing his own stumbles on his way to ministry, breaking down the distinction between the minister and the congregation. But in this crowd, on this day, it did the trick. As the music came up for communion, the congregants lined both aisles.Ashley Austin Morris, a comedy writer and performer who was attending the service after some time away, said she appreciated the church\u2019s acceptance of disorder.She had left because she wanted a church that would force her to change herself, she said, but then returned because experiences at the ones she found were too painful.\u201cAt one the pastor said, \u2018I really don\u2019t know how you can be a Christian and be in entertainment,\u2019\u201d Ms. Morris said. \u201cI internalize that and say, \u2018I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m bad.\u2019 I fell apart over that. When really, you\u2019re not supposed to just hang out in a church with other Christians. You\u2019re supposed to be loving wherever you work. I really got that at Forefront. I felt more accepted there, and people didn\u2019t have answers.\u201dShe did not know if she would remain at Forefront, but she was glad to be there.\u201cI don\u2019t like when people have answers,\u201d she said, sounding a lot like Mr. Williams. \u201cI don\u2019t have answers. I have a lot of questions. And for me, that\u2019s what practicing your faith means.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with the continuation of an article about Jonathan Williams, the pastor of Forefront church in Brooklyn, whose father recently came out as a transgender woman, referred incorrectly to the man in the center of the photograph shown wearing a plaid shirt. He is a member of the congregation; he is not Mr. Williams.Advertisement"}

The company said she had been ill but did not specify the cause.But the house, which at its height was a rare fully female fashion dynasty, had humble origins. Founded in 1925 in Rome by Adele and Edoardo Fendi as a small leather goods store (and secret fur workshop), the business was a home away from home for the couple\u2019s five daughters, Carla, Paola, Anna, Franca and Alda, who grew up on the shop floor playing and sleeping amid its samples and handbags.While Paola, Anna, Franca and Alda Fendi later became important creative forces in the evolution of the brand, it was Carla, born in Rome on July 12, 1937, who was the mastermind of its commercial and marketing strategies.She had no children, although the other sisters went on to have 11 among them and more than 30 grandchildren. It was a measure of the sisters\u2019 importance to Italy that a special government dispensation was granted to allow their descendants to adopt their maternal surname.However, to best ensure the future of the company \u2014 and to preserve familial relations \u2014 the sisters decided in 2001 to sell a controlling stake to LVMH.\u201cFive sisters was too much,\u201d Mr. Lagerfeld, who has often been referred to as the sixth Fendi child, said after the deal was announced. \u201cAnd they were not speaking.

Like so very many things involving this administration, it\u2019s a controversy in which the most positive interpretation is that he had no idea what the hell he was doing.In December Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, the head of a Russia bank, to talk about setting up a special communication system, apparently so he could talk without American intelligence overhearing.It had to be disastrous in some way, since Mike Flynn was involved. Among the possible explanations:A) The incoming administration had directed a 36-year-old real estate developer with no government experience to solve the Syrian crisis while keeping the whole thing secret from everybody except Vladimir Putin.B) Jared was trying to do a favor for his sister-in-law Lara by setting up a channel to smuggle abused beagles out of Russia.C) This is something about Russian money backing Trump businesses.I am of course going for the beagles. But feel free to be cynical.\u201cWe know Kushner\u2019s business operations are in constant need of loans and investors. It\u2019s highly suspicious,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer of the good-government group Democracy 21. He used to specialize in campaign finance reform, but now Wertheimer lives in a world where a president\u2019s daughter joins Dad at a dinner with the Chinese president the very same day she receives trademark rights for selling Ivanka Trump glitz in China.And speaking of sleazy contacts with foreign investors, last week Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley called for an investigation into \u201cpotentially fraudulent statements and misrepresentations\u201d made by a Chinese company promoting deals that seemed to involve U.S. visas for financiers who made big investments in a luxury condo project in New Jersey.The condos are being developed by Kushner Companies and were being marketed by Jared\u2019s sister.

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Broken Ladder of Social Mobility", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In Britain\u2019s universities, some half-million students have exchanged the fear and adrenaline of final examinations for the fear and adrenaline of starting their working lives. These students have been encouraged to believe in meritocracy. They were at school when the then prime minister, David Cameron, asserted that what mattered wasn\u2019t where you came from, but where you were going. They are graduating under a new prime minister, Theresa May, who says her mission is to ensure that everyone can go as far as their talents will take them.These are fine words. They are not true. New graduates are entering a working world that is pitched as never before in favor of the well-connected, the socially knowledgeable and the rich.The problems start before school, with poor, bright children starting to fall behind richer, dimmer ones by the age of 3. The class divide widens over the next 15 years. Less-well-off children are much more likely to do badly in examinations. Children from affluent backgrounds are nearly four times more likely to go to one of Britain\u2019s 24 top universities than those from the poor ones.Successive governments have believed that the answer lies in making sure that poor children are taught to both aspire and achieve, all the way through to university. It is regarded as the ultimate success story when a young person from a working-class family gets into one of Britain\u2019s two elite institutions, Oxford and Cambridge. The assumption is that if only they reach \u201cOxbridge,\u201d their struggle for social mobility will be over; they will be part of the elite, and doors will open for them.That is a devastating myth. Ambition and talent are not enough to succeed in today\u2019s Britain. Hidden high barriers remain.Joe, as I shall call him to preserve his privacy, is a living example. He is one of the brightest young men I know, but in November, he was sitting alone in a spare bedroom in a depressed town in northern England, where he knew hardly anyone, in despair at his inability to start a career. The year before, Joe graduated from Oxford with a top degree and then won a scholarship to study music for the next year. After that, he planned to find a job in London, perhaps as a law trainee, a management consultant or a researcher \u2014 just like his prosperous middle-class friends.Nobody explained to Joe that his assumptions were wrong. That he needed to do what his richer peers were unobtrusively doing, spending holidays in prestigious unpaid internships in the firms where they hoped to get work. That he ought to apply for graduate posts midway through his final year, so that top employers would be bidding for him. That to follow his friends and peers to one of Britain\u2019s prosperous cities, especially London, he would either need parents prepared to house and subsidize him, or thousands of pounds to cover the initial costs of rent, transport, work clothes and job hunting.But Joe did not have those resources and that social capital. Whom did he know who could offer him an internship, put him up at no cost in London, give or lend him money to make the move? His student loan debt of some \u00a350,000 (about $64,000) had exhausted his capacity to borrow. He didn\u2019t even have a family home to go back to because his mother had lost her apartment and was living with her parents.The dream of transformation that Oxford had promised seemed a mirage; its glittering prizes were not on offer to people like him. Without capital or connections, he could afford to live only in a rundown town doing dead-end jobs.This changed only by sheer chance when the parent of an Oxford friend heard about his situation and offered to pay for a move to the capital and a few months\u2019 rent. That was the lucky break Joe needed. Within two weeks, he had found a share in a flat, and within a month, he had a graduate researcher\u2019s job.His existence is frugal, but Joe is happy \u2014 at last, he has prospects. But there are hundreds of thousands of young people like him, new and recent graduates, who will not be so lucky.The richer parts of Britain, particularly London and the southeast, have become so expensive that only those who are already rich or already have homes can afford to make their lives there. Average house prices are way beyond the reach of those on an average wage. There is a huge division between those people whose parents are part of that soaring wealth and can help out and those cut out from it. Homeownership rates for the under-30s have halved in a generation, to 31 percent, as a result.This financial exclusion places a crippling limit on ordinary people\u2019s ambitions, keeping them out of the places where politics, finance, law, media, technology and the arts all flourish. It makes a mockery of the very idea of social mobility, the promise that those with talent who work hard can compete on equal terms.The problem is not just the government\u2019s to fix. Universities must stop selling students the fiction that a good education is an automatic passport to a good job. A big institutional effort goes into getting poorer students into university, which is admirable, but almost none goes into planning how they might benefit from it.Britain has a cultural aversion to spelling out techniques for success; it\u2019s considered vulgar. That must change. The convention serves brilliantly to preserve wealth and power for those born into it. Colleges should run classes that coach students about internships, social networks, career paths, the codes of professional behavior and how to write a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 why not?Rather than reserving bursaries or scholarships for students when they arrive, universities could award them to high achievers from poor families when they leave. The government could also step in by extending student loans to cover a \u00a34,000 (about $5,000) graduating grant (about what Joe needed to get started). Universities could also harness the energy and good will of their alumni to provide mentoring or internship opportunities, or even help with short-term accommodation.These initiatives won\u2019t, on their own, solve the enormous problems of growing inequality and stalled social mobility, but they would do something to help the next generation of Joes get a hold on the first rung of the ladder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Streamlined Way to Build Projects Runs Into New York Politics", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut even on an issue that they do agree on, the governor and the mayor still cannot seem to get in sync. Take an unexciting, but important, streamlined approach to designing and building infrastructure that can save time and money.Mr. Cuomo had proposed expanding that design-build authority to all state agencies and counties \u2014 except for New York City \u2014 in his executive budget in January. State lawmakers agreed to renew it only for the state entities that already had it and to extend its use to eight specific state building projects, including a theme park and a state police forensic laboratory.Meanwhile, the city received nothing, despite a direct request from Mayor de Blasio during a budget hearing before state lawmakers in February. \u201cWe have been asking for this authority since Day 1,\u201d said Freddi Goldstein, a spokeswoman for the mayor. \u201cThis should be a no-brainer.\u201dThe design-build process has raised concerns among some state labor leaders and construction industry groups who have influence over Albany lawmakers. Expanding its use, they have said, could result in a more subjective selection process for contracts and less government oversight and could displace union members as more work is contracted out by government agencies rather than done in-house.For some political observers and transportation advocates, however, the larger fight has already been lost. Douglas Muzzio, a political scientist at Baruch College, said the governor and mayor, both Democrats, were yet again unable to put aside their differences to present a united front.\u201cIf they had worked together, something would have happened,\u201d Mr. Muzzio said. \u201cThey played a lose-lose game, and they both didn\u2019t get what they wanted.\u201dJon Weinstein, a spokesman for the governor, said New York City had not been included in the governor\u2019s executive budget because state lawmakers had been reluctant in the past to expand design-build authority to the city. But during later budget negotiations, he added, the governor indicated that he was willing to include the city.\u201cGovernor Cuomo is the single biggest proponent of expanding design-build in New York State because it has consistently saved time and taxpayer money on major infrastructure projects,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said. \u201cIn the past, the legislature has rejected expansions of design-build for local governments, and unfortunately they did so again this year.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m dumbfounded that we are not able to have this option when we can see \u2014 it has been demonstrated in all 50 states \u2014 that it works,\u201d said Feniosky Pe\u00f1a-Mora, the commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Design and Construction.Polly Trottenberg, the city transportation commissioner, said using design-build for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway project would save $113.4 million in taxpayer dollars and shorten construction by two years.\u201cI think we\u2019re making a good case, and everyone in the city and the state can now see great examples of design-build,\u201d she said.A spokesman for Assembly leaders said they were reviewing the proposals. Assemblyman Michael Benedetto, a Bronx Democrat who is sponsoring them, said he was hopeful. \u201cWe think we can get basic agreement,\u201d he said.But the State Senate may be tougher, since Mr. de Blasio has strained relations with Republican Senate leaders after working unsuccessfully to end their majority in 2014. A spokesman for Senate leaders did not respond to inquiries.\u201cIn Albany, things often get linked together,\u201d said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, a government watchdog group. Still, he added, one or both of the design-build bills could pass in the last-minute torrent of legislation Albany insiders call \u201cthe big ugly.\u201dMitchell L. Moss, the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, said that such infrastructure issues \u2014 though critically important \u2014 tended to be seen as unglamorous and took a back seat to more pressing political issues such as the mayor\u2019s effort to retain control of the city school system.\u201cDoing nothing is the way Albany operates,\u201d he said, \u201cso to get something done, you have to be constantly fighting for this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Michel Temer of Brazil Is Charged With Corruption", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 President Michel Temer was charged with corruption by Brazil\u2019s prosecutor general late Monday. He was accused of taking a $152,000 bribe via an intermediary, an act that, according to the prosecutor general, Rodrigo Janot, \u201chelped to compromise the image of the Federal Republic of Brazil.\u201dMr. Janot said Mr. Temer had agreed to the $152,000 payment from Mr. Batista in exchange for helping to resolve a problem that a Batista company was having with a power plant it owned. He also said Mr. Temer should pay $3 million in moral damages.According to the charges, a further $11 million in bribes was promised, according to the charges, to Mr. Temer and Rodrigo Rocha Loures, a close aide to the president who was filmed taking delivery of a suitcase that the authorities say contained the payment. He was then arrested.Mr. Temer\u2019s fate is now in the hands of Brazil\u2019s Congress. If two-thirds of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, votes to accept the corruption charges or any others that may be coming, and the Supreme Court agrees, he will be suspended for up to 180 days and put on trial.Analysts said he should have enough support in Congress to survive the vote \u2014 for now.Elections are looming next year, and many lawmakers are facing their own corruption investigations. They may well feel safer siding with the government, even one as shaky as Mr. Temer\u2019s, said Marcus Melo, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Pernambuco.\u201cHe is a lame duck, but incredible as it sounds, he can count on this base because they, too, are implicated in many things,\u201d Mr. Melo said.But if the prosecutor general does bring separate charges against Mr. Temer, each one will have to be voted on separately, said Roberto Dias, a professor of constitutional law at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cThe tendency is that each time there is an indictment offered, that the political support that Temer has will be reduced,\u201d he said.None of this bodes well for Mr. Temer\u2019s legislative agenda, an ambitious package of austerity measures that he says is needed to revive Brazil\u2019s economy.Financial markets regard the measures, which include an unpopular overhaul of Brazil\u2019s generous pension system, as crucial to restoring the country\u2019s battered fiscal credibility.So does Mr. Temer, as he made clear on Monday, before the widely anticipated charges were revealed. \u201cThere is no Plan B. We have to keep going,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing will destroy us. Not me nor our ministers.\u201d He has vehemently denied all of the accusations against him, and has often pointed out that Mr. Batista received a generous plea bargain in exchange for cooperating with prosecutors.Mr. Temer did not immediately comment on the charges. Yet the constant flow of allegations has made it difficult for the government to operate, let alone carry out far-reaching plans.Executives at JBS, a Batista company, testified that Mr. Temer had negotiated millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations for his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. In still another case, he faces scrutiny over claims that he negotiated a $40 million bribe for the party in 2010.But so far, Mr. Temer has been able to escape those and other allegations.Mr. Temer will need 172 federal deputies to either abstain from voting or vote against accepting the charge brought by Mr. Janot.Sylvio Costa, the founder of Congress in Focus, an independent monitoring site, said the president\u2019s support was weakening. He said it could be further compromised if there were more revelations, or any sign that Brazil\u2019s economy, which has been showing some faint signs of recovery, is stumbling again.Mr. Temer can count on around 200 to 250 of the 512 deputies in the lower house, compared with about 400 a year ago, Mr. Costa said.A poll released last weekend found that 7 percent of Brazilians approved of Mr. Temer\u2019s administration, 76 percent thought he should resign, and 47 percent felt ashamed to be Brazilian.Datafolha, the polling company, interviewed 2,771 people in 194 cities from June 21 to 23. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.A visit by Mr. Temer to Russia and Norway last week, intended to distract from his problems at home, seemed to highlight them instead.First, his itinerary announced that he would be visiting the Soviet Union. Then the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, told him that Brazil must address its corruption problem, and Norway halved its contribution to an Amazon rain forest fund because deforestation was increasing.Some lawmakers from the center-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a key partner in Mr. Temer\u2019s coalition, have already argued that they should leave the government. On Monday, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former president and elder statesman of the party, said in a newspaper column that Mr. Temer should make a \u201cgrand gesture\u201d and cut short his mandate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nordstrom to Explore Deal to Go Private as Retail Sector Reels", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an industry reeling from bankruptcies, vacant storefronts and plummeting sales, Nordstrom is one of the few department store chains to show promise.The higher-end clothing retailer invested in its e-commerce business early on and was judicious about not opening too many new stores, avoiding many of the pitfalls that are driving other retailers to ruin.But even from a position of relative strength, Nordstrom is struggling to navigate a broad upending of the retail industry, as shopping malls lose their appeal and more customers choose to buy goods online.On Thursday, members of the family that founded Nordstrom in Seattle a century ago \u2014 and who still own a substantial portion of its shares \u2014 said they were exploring ways to shift the company into private ownership.The decision signals the Nordstrom family\u2019s commitment to its core retail business at a time when investors and lenders are deserting the industry in droves.It also reflects optimism that a private equity firm or a sovereign wealth fund would be willing to invest in a large retailer, after many major investors got burned in debt-fueled buyouts that went bust.\u201cNordstrom is the best of the breed,\u201d said David Shiffman, a managing director and a head of the retail group at Peter J. Solomon Company, an investment banking advisory firm. \u201cThis is not a laggard throwing in the towel.\u201dStill, considering going private is an acknowledgment that the public stock market is not a friendly place for companies needing to make costly changes as they compete with online giants like Amazon.By making such a move, Nordstrom would duck the glare of public shareholders and the pressure to constantly produce short-term profits.\u201cThis is a clear signal that the changes that retailers need to make are much more extensive and expensive than public shareholders have the appetite for,\u201d said Joel Bines, a managing director focused on retail at AlixPartners, an advisory firm.Traditional retailers are in a free fall, as physical stores fade as enjoyable, dynamic places to spend an afternoon. On Thursday, the Canadian company that owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor said it would cut 2,000 jobs.Department stores have tried to increase their focus on e-commerce, but many are still weighed down by costly real estate holdings they took on by moving into suburban malls across the United States during better times.How the retail industry evolves has big implications for the economy. The sector employs one in 10 Americans and occupies millions of square feet of commercial real estate.Nordstrom invested in online sales and marketing earlier than many of its peers, while proceeding carefully in opening new stores. The brand is also known for investing in customer service, as other retailers look to cut costs in unprofitable stores, said Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse.\u201cThey are a big exception,\u201d Mr. Buss said.Shares in Nordstrom were up 10 percent on Thursday on the news that a move to private ownership was being considered, giving the company a market value of $7.5 billion.Nordstrom shares had fallen 2.8 percent in the 12 months before that announcement \u2014 far less than other department stores\u2019 shares. But analysts complain that investors have lumped the company in with significantly troubled retailers, leaving its stock undervalued.That could be another motivation for finding a private partner.\u201cThe family is saying they have conviction in the business and see value far beyond where the street is willing to own the stock,\u201d Mr. Shiffman said.Nordstrom was co-founded by the Swedish immigrant John W. Nordstrom, who had moved out West and, eventually, to Alaska in search of gold. He settled in Seattle, where he teamed up with a shoemaker, Carl F. Wallin. They opened their first store in 1901.Members of the Nordstrom family have had the retail business in their blood from the start, and their name has left an indelible mark on Seattle. A medical office tower in the city bears the Nordstrom name, as do lecture and recital halls at Seattle\u2019s downtown art museum and symphony hall.In a city where fleece and T-shirts are more common among workers, employees at Nordstrom\u2019s downtown headquarters stand out for their chic attire, which they are encouraged to buy using employee discounts from the company\u2019s stores.Yet the Nordstroms\u2019 civic profile has been overshadowed to some degree by the area\u2019s newer business icons, including Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, whose company is expected to become the largest apparel retailer in the country this year.It seems unlikely that members of the Nordstrom family, who collectively own about 31 percent of the company\u2019s shares, could buy out the other shareholders without an investment partner like a private equity firm or a large pension fund.The company carries just $2.7 billion in long-term debt, far less proportionally than rivals like Neiman Marcus. That leaves plenty of room for the Nordstroms and any backers they line up to add more debt as part of a going-private deal. The company could also borrow against its real estate to help finance a transaction.The family members exploring the buyout are actively involved in managing the company. They include the co-presidents, Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom, and Erik B. Nordstrom; the president of stores, James F. Nordstrom Jr.; the chairman emeritus, Bruce A. Nordstrom; and Anne E. Gittinger.A Nordstrom spokeswoman declined to comment.Others have had a rougher time. TPG and Leonard Green teamed up with Millard S. Drexler, J. Crew\u2019s chief executive, to take the onetime fashion darling private again for about $3 billion.Other high-end department stores have not fared much better.Neiman Marcus, which has had two sets of private-equity owners in the past decade, planned to return to the public markets. But earlier this year, amid declining sales, it withdrew its plans to go public.Additional reporting by Nick Wingfield.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public-Private Projects Where the Public Pays and Pays", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFaster, better, cheaper.As President Trump prepares to deliver a speech on Wednesday about infrastructure, his administration is promoting the benefits of having local governments work with private corporations to build, repair and manage the nation\u2019s ailing roads, bridges and airports.Public-private partnerships, as they are known, have many potential benefits. Companies can complete projects quicker and more cheaply than governments can, proponents say. Letting private industry take the lead can also limit the amount of debt that cities and states need to take on.Yet in the United States, public-private partnerships represent a tiny fraction of infrastructure spending. On toll roads, for instance, where they have been used the most, they accounted for just 1 percent of all spending between 1989 and 2011, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office.And whatever the advantages of giving the private sector a stake in public works \u2014 rather than leaving the government in control \u2014 experts agree that while some public-private partnerships may result in near-term savings, there is little hard evidence that they perform better over time.\u201cThere is a significant misunderstanding of the way public-private partnerships actually work,\u201d said David Besanko, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. \u201cTaxpayers or users are going to need to pay for private infrastructure just as they need to pay for public infrastructure. You\u2019re going to need to get revenues from somewhere.\u201dWhether through fees like parking meters and tolls on a road, or through government payments to the contractors, such projects are ultimately supported by taxpayers.Variations of public-private partnerships \u2014 known as P3 deals on Wall Street \u2014 are more common in Canada and some European countries than in the United States.There is a reason for that. America is one of the few nations that exempt the interest on local and state bonds from federal taxes. As a result, the nation\u2019s municipal bond market is bigger and more developed than in most other countries, and that makes public financing of infrastructure much more attractive, lessening the need for private partnerships.In the United States, \u201cthe P3 market is in its infancy,\u201d said Scott Zuchorski, a senior director in Fitch Ratings\u2019s global infrastructure group, adding that there have already been \u201csome growing pains.\u201dInitially the toll road, which opened in 1995, was a success: Drivers paid for a faster road, and it employed cutting-edge technology, allowing for automated collections and congestion pricing.The 35-year lease agreement included a noncompete clause that barred the state from making any other road repairs and improvements \u2014 like adding a lane and improving public transit \u2014 that might lure motorists away from the toll road.Orange County Transportation Authority spent a decade in court before having to buy the express lanes outright for $207 million in 2003 so that it could go ahead with a highway and public transit overhaul.Mildred Warner, a professor at Cornell University, pointed out that private firms and local governments can have fundamentally different interests.The government has broad concerns, like improving overall regional transportation, reducing traffic and curbing pollution.The companies have a narrower concern \u2014 maximizing financial returns.\u201cIs there a reason for there to be public control,\u201d she asked. \u201cIs there a public good?\u201dNationwide, Virginia has among the most extensive experience with public-private partnerships. Beginning two decades ago, it turned to firms including Fluor and Transurban, an Australian company, to build and operate high-occupancy tolls lanes along the Beltway to and from Washington, D.C.The Beltway project has helped reduce congestion, and the state government avoided taking on more debt.Since the financial crisis, the private equity industry has become hugely influential. Here\u2019s how it plays out in your daily life.Consumers still pay tolls, however. And if the number of car-poolers is too high \u2014 thus depriving Fluor and Transurban of tolls \u2014 the state is required to reimburse the companies.Arrangements like this in which local governments essentially guarantee their private partners substantial payments are not uncommon, and leases that extend beyond the life of the project can also divert extra revenue from the public to the private sector.The state of Indiana had to pay the private operators of a troubled toll road \u2014 one of the first big public-private partnership deals in the country \u2014 nearly $450,000 because it waived tolls during a flood emergency in order to speed escaping residents.\u201cYou can make money when there\u2019s a flood,\u201d Ms. Warner said, criticizing the payment, \u201cbut the government looks to save lives.\u201dAs part of the arrangement, the Port Authority of New York and Jersey has agreed to pay the Macquarie consortium about $56.5 million a year for about 40 years once the bridge opens, regardless of how much traffic it handles.Macquarie is working on other projects around the country. In 2014, Kentucky tapped the company to oversee the installation and maintenance of 3,400 miles of high-speed fiber optic cable throughout the state.Construction has been delayed by a year as the Macquarie group works to obtain the rights to install some of the fiber optics on existing utility poles and \u201cuncertainty regarding the magnitude of costs,\u201d according to Fitch. This led Fitch to issue a negative outlook on $300 million in bonds issued by a state entity to finance some of the upfront costs.The delays on the project might well have occurred even if the government were in charge, and Macquarie said public-private partnerships helped local governments avoid taking on too much debt.\u201cPPPs have proven themselves to be an efficient and cost-effective project-delivery method, allowing state and local governments to access private-sector financing while effectively transferring risk,\u201d said Geoff Segal, manager of government advisory and affairs for Macquarie Capital.Aaron Renn, a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute who has studied a number of public-private partnerships, said one problem with them is that the public officials negotiating these arrangements sometimes lack the financial sophistication and advice to fully understand the deals.\u201cThe most important question,\u201d he said, \u201cis who bears the revenue risk if certain things happen?\u201dThough local governments can wind up on the hook for billions, sometimes it is private firms and their investors that get burned.That is what happened with perhaps the nation\u2019s best-known public-private partnership, a 2006 deal in Indiana to lease an aging toll road to an investment group led by Macquarie and Cintra, a Spanish infrastructure firm, for $3.8 billion, which the state used primarily for other road projects.Eventually the investment consortium had to file for bankruptcy in 2015.Now, most of that $3.8 billion has been spent, and the new operator of the toll road is continuing to collect fees from drivers. In June, tolls more than doubled for many drivers after a state subsidy that was put in place when the lease deal was signed expired in May.And just this week another road project in Indiana fell into disarray, with state officials announcing on Monday that Indiana was trying to take control of the job from a public-private partnership that led by a Spanish company.Private money is beginning to line up to take advantage of new deals now that Mr. Trump appears to throwing his backing behind such arrangements.Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is leading a White House business advisory group, which lists infrastructure work as one of its topics for discussion.\u201cUS needs to invest in infrastructure to keep up!\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel Sets Collision Course With Trump Ahead of G-20", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 A combative Chancellor Angela Merkel set herself on a collision course with President Trump and his \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda on Thursday, predicting \u201cvery difficult\u201d talks over climate change and trade when she hosts a summit meeting of 20 global leaders next week.\u201cWhoever believes the problems of this world can be solved by isolationism and protectionism is making a tremendous error,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, in what will most likely be her final address before Parliament before closing out her third term in office.In the midst of an election campaign, the chancellor has been criticized by her main opponent for not standing up more forcefully to the American president. Her tough tone to some degree served as domestic political posturing, intended to enhance her appeal as a global leader uniquely qualified to guide Germany after more than 11 years in office.Those divisions are likely to be full display during the Group of 20 summit meeting that begins July 7 in the German city of Hamburg, where Ms. Merkel will welcome not only Mr. Trump but also President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and other leaders from industrialized and emerging nations.Global trade, as well as measures to halt climate change, migration, terrorism and international pandemics are all on the agenda. For the chancellor, however, the most important single message of the gathering is ensuring multilateral cooperation through international institutions. Those include the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, both of which will are taking part in the meeting.Combating climate change is an issue close to the chancellor\u2019s heart, and on Thursday she saved some of her most pointed language to address her differences with the Trump administration. \u201cSince the decision by the United States of America to quit the Paris climate accords, we are more determined than ever to make it a success,\u201d Ms. Merkel told lawmakers.\u201cWe will and must take on this existential challenge,\u201d she said, \u201cand we cannot and will not wait until every last person in the world can be convinced of climate change by scientific evidence. In other words: The climate treaty is irreversible and is not negotiable.\u201dMs. Merkel said she would not pretend that differences with Washington on this stance do not exist. \u201cIt would be disingenuous if we tried to gloss over it,\u201d she said. \u201cAt any rate, I will not do that.\u201dThe Group of 20 summit meeting took place in the German city of Hamburg. What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet? See how much you know.The decision to cut the secretary off midsentence \u201chad nothing to do with the content of the speech \u2014 we were just running behind schedule, and we told that to our contact on the American side,\u201d said Klaus-Hubert Fugger, a spokesman for the council.On Thursday, the German government rejected a request by Mr. Erdogan to hold a rally while he is in the country for the gathering.Hamburg is home to about 90,000 Turkish immigrants and their descendants, many of them ethnic Kurds, and security officials in the port city are seeking to prevent any clashes between Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters and opponents in Germany. Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to descend on Hamburg during the summit meeting, taking part in mass demonstrations that have been planned surrounding the event.On Wednesday, Germany\u2019s highest court ruled that city officials had to allow demonstrators to camp in city parks. The police had sought to prevent such tent cities, arguing they could harbor protesters planning violence. Protesters say the camps are necessary to allow them to demonstrate an alterative, anticapitalist style of living.In closing her address to Parliament, the chancellor acknowledged the right to protest but urged those taking part to show restraint.\u201cWe know that there will be protests, and that is more than legitimate in a democracy,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, adding her hope \u201cthat these demonstrations will be peaceful.\u201dAlison Smale and David Shimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did the Jack Welch Model Sow Seeds of G.E.\u2019s Decline?", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor Fortune magazine in 1999, Jack Welch, then General Electric\u2019s chief executive, wasn\u2019t just the country\u2019s best executive, or the manager of the year, but nothing less than the best manager of the 20th century, \u201cfar and away the most influential manager of his generation.\u201dMr. Welch himself was more circumspect. \u201cMy success will be determined by how well my successor grows it in the next 20 years,\u201d he said at a management conference that year.Eighteen years later, with this week\u2019s announcement that Mr. Welch\u2019s handpicked successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, would step down as G.E.\u2019s chief executive, the verdict would appear to be in.\u201cGiven how horrendous the stock performance has been for so many years, the most amazing thing is why the board didn\u2019t act sooner\u201d to replace Mr. Immelt, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Mr. Welch brought much needed energy and charisma to the chief executive\u2019s job and streamlined G.E.\u2019s bloated bureaucracy. Had he stayed on through the financial crisis, perhaps he would have recaptured the growth that eluded Mr. Immelt.But hardly anyone considers Mr. Welch, now 81, a management role model anymore, and the conglomerate model he championed at G.E. \u2014 that with strict discipline, you could successfully manage any business as long as your market share was first or second \u2014 has been thoroughly discredited, at least in the United States.No wonder, given the performance of the company\u2019s stock over the past 10 years. G.E. shares dropped 25 percent during that period, in contrast with a 59 percent rise for the S.&P. 500. The rival industrial conglomerate Honeywell\u2019s stock has more than doubled, and Danaher\u2019s has tripled. United Technologies gained 67 percent.Nonetheless, Mr. Immelt remained one of the country\u2019s highest-paid executives: $21.3 million in 2016, $33 million in 2015, and $37 million in 2014. Even without a formal severance package, Mr. Immelt, 61, will get an additional $211 million when he retires, Fortune estimates.\u201cI\u2019m a long-term G.E. shareholder,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cThe bottom line is, I did poorly and he did very well.\u201dSpeaking of his tenure as G.E.\u2019s leader, Mr. Immelt pointed to the increased strength of the company\u2019s industrial businesses, their competitiveness and large market shares.\u201cI\u2019ll say that will stand the test of time,\u201d he said in an interview on Monday with my colleague Steve Lohr. \u201cLet other people make their own judgments.\u201dMr. Immelt\u2019s defenders have pointed out that he had to contend with the collapse of the tech bubble, the Sept. 11 attacks and the financial crisis, all circumstances beyond his control. But so did the chief executives of every other major company.\u201cAbout the best that can be said is that he enabled G.E. to survive through a difficult time,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, professor of finance and asset management at Columbia. \u201cBut he never really understood how to create value through growth.\u201dAnd he inherited \u201ca highly inflated stock price,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said, thanks to Mr. Welch\u2019s aura and lofty expectations that probably no one could have met.As Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, put it, \u201cIt\u2019s always tough to follow a legend.\u201d\u201cJeff Immelt brought his best every day for 16 years,\u201d Mr. Welch said in a statement. His office said he was not available to comment about his own legacy.Mr. Immelt tacitly repudiated the Welch model himself, moving to dismantle parts of the sprawling G.E. empire by getting rid of NBCUniversal and the once-too-big-to-fail GE Capital. The problem, many critics said, is that he didn\u2019t do so nearly fast enough.\u201cI don\u2019t think Jack Welch was ever as good as he was made out to be,\u201d said Mr. Damodaran, who has spent years trying to value G.E. During Mr. Welch\u2019s tenure, \u201che benefited from the growth of financial services in the American economy and the growth of GE Capital,\u201d Mr. Damodaran added. \u201cThat\u2019s what made it untouchable for so long.\u201dMr. Damodaran said he warned G.E. executives in 2005 that complexity could become a problem. \u201cIf you wanted to create a valuation hell, it would be G.E.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was too complex by design, growing through numerous acquisitions. I told them back then, \u2018You\u2019re getting away with this now, but if there\u2019s ever a crisis, it will come back to haunt you.\u2019\u201dMr. Greenwald, the Columbia professor, agreed that much of G.E.\u2019s success, and then its problems, stemmed from an overreliance on its huge financial services business. \u201cIt was contributing 60 percent of profits, and Jack Welch could always tweak the earnings by turning to GE Capital,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it had no stable source of deposits\u201d to fall back on in the financial crisis.That is the main reason G.E.\u2019s rivals have fared so much better, Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cThey were never the broad conglomerate G.E. was, with huge financing businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re much more focused on industrial production.\u201dBoth Mr. Greenwald and Mr. Damodaran said the Welch conglomerate model had been thoroughly repudiated, so much so that there is a widely recognized \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d applied by investors to the stock prices of companies consisting of businesses with no obvious synergies. Activist investors have pounced on this to urge the breakup of disparate operations, and G.E. itself has been the target of the activist investor Nelson Peltz.\u201cSpecialization is something that provides real value,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a conglomerate, by definition you\u2019re not specialized.\u201dEven companies like Honeywell and United Technologies \u201caren\u2019t trying to do everything,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have areas of specialization.\u201dMr. Damodaran said few of the world\u2019s conglomerates, if any, are superstars.\u201cThey may be doing better than G.E., but they all suffer from similar problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not nimble and adaptable. It\u2019s much harder to be a conglomerate today than it was 20 or 30 years ago. The Welch model is certainly dated. Maybe it\u2019s still used in a few old-line manufacturing businesses, but not in the rest of the economy, where a start-up can destroy your business.\u201dEven though Mr. Immelt deserves praise for abandoning the Welch model, Mr. Damodaran said, he did it much too late. \u201cThey\u2019d be much better off if they\u2019d started sooner,\u201d he said.In a statement, a General Electric spokeswoman said, \u201cToday, G.E. is a more focused industrial company with strong growth opportunities in the long term.\u201dThat left investors salivating for more divestitures or spinoffs. \u201cDoes anyone really think there are any synergies between medical equipment and jet engines?\u201d Mr. Greenwald asked. \u201cA complicated, specialized business like medical equipment would be much better on its own.\u201dMore divestitures may well result in pretty much the same G.E. that Mr. Welch inherited, which is \u201ca boring, mature company,\u201d Mr. Damodaran said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a company that\u2019s going to work miracles. Even if well run, about the best G.E. can hope for is to grow at the rate of the economy. But that may be the best-case scenario. If it tries to rediscover its youth, that would make me nervous.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, overwhelmingly affects boys and causes muscles to deteriorate, killing many of them by the end of their 20s.\u201cI\u2019m cycling between rage and just sadness,\u201d their mother, Alison Willis Hoke, said recently, on the day she learned that an appeal for coverage had been denied. For now, the company that sells the drug, Sarepta Therapeutics, is covering the treatment\u2019s costs, but Mrs. Hoke does not know how long that will last.The story of Exondys 51 raises complex and emotionally charged questions about what happens when the F.D.A. approves an expensive drug based on a lower bar of proof.

The pharmaceutical industry has been in hot pursuit of an increasingly enticing demographic target: An estimated 30 million people in the United States \u2014 about 10 percent of the population \u2014 are living with one of roughly 7,000 rare diseases.Another insurer, Premera Blue Cross, went so far as to tie coverage to an invasive procedure \u2014 a muscle biopsy \u2014 but then rescinded the requirement.The New York Times would like to hear from people about their experiences paying for prescription drugs.The conditional green light granted to Exondys 51 is part of an accelerated pathway that allows the agency to clear much-needed drugs based on early, if inconclusive, evidence of efficacy.Skeptics argued that the small clinical trials did not demonstrate meaningful improvement, showing just a minuscule increase in dystrophin. But others, including parents of boys on the drug, insist that it is working \u2014 or at the very least, that it can\u2019t hurt to try.Mr. Denger\u2019s treatment was being paid for by Sarepta while he appealed. On Wednesday, he learned that Maine Care, the state Medicaid program, would cover his treatment.He believes his condition has stabilized, affording him the luxury of contemplating a future. Mr. Denger, who uses a wheelchair, drives his own van and works part time at a supermarket doing administrative work. He recently graduated from the University of New England, near his home in Biddeford, Me.In addition to Anthem, Express Scripts, which manages the drug benefits for insurers and large employers, excluded the medication from its national coverage list. Other insurers, including UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana, will cover it only under limited circumstances \u2014 if the boy is under 14, for example, or can walk a certain distance. After six months, in many cases, the insurers require evidence that the drug appears to be working.Mrs. Hoke, who is a pharmacist near her home in Fayetteville, near Syracuse, noted that many new cancer drugs offer little long-term hope but are still covered. \u201cIt extends their life for three months, and that\u2019s covered,\u201d she said. \u201cMy kids can live for years with this drug.\u201dWhether Exondys 51 can indeed give boys more years to grow up remains an unknown. Sarepta has a lot riding on the drug. It is the biotech\u2019s only approved product, and the company must prove to investors that sales will be enough to finance a pipeline of drugs that could treat a wider range of boys with Duchenne.Perhaps that\u2019s why Sarepta\u2019s executives have claimed in statements that the average price for Exondys 51 is $300,000 per patient per year.\u201cThat\u2019s not accurate,\u201d said David Lassen, the chief clinical officer at Prime Therapeutics, which manages the drug plans for more than 20 million Americans. \u201cBased on just the few claims that we\u2019ve evaluated, we think that\u2019s low.\u201d He cited a range from $750,000 to $1.5 million a year, far greater than breakthrough drugs like, for instance, cystic fibrosis treatments sold by Vertex that cost more than $250,000 a year.Sarepta contends that the $300,000 estimate is a net price, accounting for discounts to insurers and the fact that not everyone will follow the weekly regimen. It also includes the assumption that younger boys who weigh less will begin taking the drug.\u201cWhat we have seen is that for some of the older, sicker boys who have been using it, the price is more,\u201d said Dr. Ed Kaye, the chief executive of Sarepta.In the end, they say, they have no choice.\u201cWe need something to stop as much progression as possible, until something better can come along,\u201d said Michelle Lessner-Gonzales, whose 14-year-old son, Nicolas Gonzales, is waiting for the Illinois Medicaid program to decide how it will cover Exondys 51. In the meantime, her son is losing his ability to walk, a common prerequisite for coverage.Several insurance companies noted the lack of clinical evidence that the drug works, especially in older boys or those who cannot walk. Anthem, which has said the clinical benefit from Exondys 51 \u201chas not been demonstrated,\u201d said that it relied on outside experts to reach its decision, and that it \u201ceagerly awaited\u201d the results of future studies.Craig Burns, vice president for research at America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, said his members were in a difficult spot. \u201cThere\u2019s more about this drug that we don\u2019t know than we do know,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where payers are really struggling.\u201d\u201cI think the insurance companies do worry; they are worried about their bottom line, and trying to make sure they are very thoughtful about the money they spend,\u201d Dr. Kaye said. But when faced with individual stories, \u201cit\u2019s hard to say \u2018No, you can\u2019t do it,\u2019 because there are no alternatives.\u201dBrian Denger, Patrick\u2019s father, said he had hoped for more when Exondys 51 arrived as a treatment. He lost another son, Matthew, to Duchenne in 2013, at age 20.\u201cI just believed that it was going to be more celebratory,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re back to the point where it seems like we\u2019re fighting again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spurned by Trump, Senate Democrats Take a Harder Line", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor their part, Republicans believed that Mr. Trump\u2019s win in nine states where Democratic senators are up for re-election next year would scare those lawmakers into acceptance of a Republican agenda, perhaps even voting to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.Neither has come to pass.Democrats, watching Republicans careen around in search of a health care solution, honored the demand of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, that they stick together in their refusal to lift a finger to help until repeal was taken off the table.And perhaps most important, Mr. Trump has rarely bothered to ask.\u201cI am ready to work with President Trump on things like infrastructure. I happen to agree with him on the water rule,\u201d she added, referring to a regulation that Mr. Trump is seeking to roll back. \u201cThese are just lower priorities for them, I guess.\u201dAll this has undermined the notion, born just six months ago, that Mr. Trump\u2019s surprising win had rewritten the political map, as Ronald Reagan did in 1980, in a way neither party could ignore. Confident that the political order is largely intact, Democrats have been emboldened to oppose his agenda, and Republicans, who adamantly refused to help Mr. Obama, are learning what turnabout feels like.\u201cEarly in new administrations, members look to work together where they can,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, who served in senior roles for several Democrats and committees in the Senate over the past decade. \u201cThere was a postelection moment where this president might have reached toward the center, delivered on priorities like infrastructure that cut across party lines and reconfigured the electoral math. Instead, he made little effort to collaborate, lurched rightward to his base while taunting the center and the left, and is now feeling the consequences. You reap the discord you sow.\u201dSome Democrats, including Mr. Schumer, tried to appeal to Mr. Trump early on.\u201cI told him infrastructure and tax reform should have been the first thing out of the box,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, whom both parties expected to be an early ally of Mr. Trump. But, Mr. Manchin said, the president chose a more partisan agenda. \u201cSomeone got to him,\u201d he said.Mr. Manchin spoke with the president early in his administration \u2014 leading to speculation that he might even land a job within it \u2014 but has since been largely ignored by White House officials and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who has mostly iced out Democrats in this Congress.\u201cBoth Bushes were very deeply experienced, as were their cabinet officials,\u201d Mr. Baucus said in a telephone interview from Paris on Wednesday, noting that the White House had courted him on every measure he ultimately supported. \u201cJim Baker took the cake,\u201d Mr. Baucus said, referring to George H. W. Bush\u2019s chief of staff, who called him to wheel and deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cDonald Trump and his people have no public policy experience, and it shows.\u201dCongressional leaders, emboldened by the total Republican control of Washington, are now pursuing a partisan agenda largely through methods that require no help from Democrats. Senate committees, where bipartisan bills have historically been forged, are not developing big bills right now, which have been left to leadership teams instead.Mr. Baucus, who served in leadership roles on the Senate Finance Committee, met with his Republican counterpart, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, \u201cevery Tuesday at 5:30 for 12 years, even if it was just to talk about our kids,\u201d Mr. Baucus said, and that helped pave the way for bipartisan legislation.The most successful bills have historically come out of committees, because successful committee votes provide evidence of a policy\u2019s ability to pass the full Senate, and pressure members of both parties to participate. \u201cI know this sounds corny,\u201d Mr. Baucus said, referring to votes for bills that cross party lines, \u201cbut if you do what\u2019s right, it\u2019s a terrific shield against critics.\u201dAt the same time, Democrats have sought a parallel unity, coming up with their own infrastructure and child care plans to lay down markers if the White House decides to bargain on bills that, unlike health care and the next item up, tax reform, will need 60 votes, and therefore the support of at least some Democrats, to pass.\u201cWe Democrats have set the goal posts,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIf President Trump is going to talk the talk on these issues, then we look forward to him working with us and walking the walk.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why France Is Taking a Lesson in Culture From Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "Supported byA new start-up incubator in Paris symbolizes France\u2019s tech ambitions, but can the land of the 35-hour workweek overcome its cultural and regulatory barriers to surpass London and other tech hubs? PARIS \u2014 One thousand start-ups in a refurbished train depot as long as the Eiffel Tower lying down. Rooms scattered with Legos and beanbag chairs. Elevated walkways bridging cargo-container offices and open-air desks. Graffitied railway cars transformed into cafes. The vast project in the heart of Paris, Station F, is a symbol of France\u2019s ambitions to be the start-up capital of Europe. Under an arc of glass and curved concrete, it aims to amass the largest group of entrepreneurs, venture capital firms, incubators and accelerators anywhere in the world.The ambitious effort would seem an expensive, even quixotic undertaking for France, a country better known for a 35-hour workweek and rigid labor laws. And plenty of countries are trying to emulate Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem, with varying degrees of success. Mr. Niel sees Station F as a way to help France steal Britain\u2019s crown as Europe\u2019s premier start-up hub. Raised in a gritty suburb of Paris, he is also trying to empower would-be entrepreneurs, especially marginalized youths. And he wants to capitalize on France\u2019s strength as a producer of math and engineering whizzes. \u201cWhen people talk about France, they don\u2019t see it as a small-league player anymore.\u201dTo get into Station F, start-ups had to have a business prototype and a path to growth. A group of 1,000 companies are expected to move into the space by early July. Here are three of them.Artificial intelligenceFood techHigh-tech fabricsTech leaders say France has significant potential. In 2016, French start-ups attracted record levels of investment from business angels, venture capital, growth equity funds and corporate investors \u2014 on par with Israel and in reach of Britain. Back then, the French start-up culture was virtually nonexistent. There was no ecosystem of incubators and funding. He and his co-founders relied on money from family and friends for six years before venture capital funds stepped in.Today, BlaBlaCar is one of four French \u201cunicorns\u201d (start-ups valued over $1 billion), with 45 million users in 22 countries and a global staff of 500. In France, \u201centrepreneurs used to be seen as people with nothing left to lose,\u201d said Mr. Mazzella, sitting in his company\u2019s sleek new headquarters near the Paris Bourse, a couple of floors down from Facebook\u2019s France operations. \u201cNow it\u2019s become acceptable, even desirable, to be a start-up.\u201d Failure is often stigmatized in French society \u2014 so much that the government started a campaign to persuade people that it\u2019s O.K. to take risks. More than three quarters of workers hold so-called jobs for life, and unions protest when businesses demand workplace flexibility. Taxes are high to fund France\u2019s social welfare system, and the 3,400-page labor code introduces new regulatory requirements on companies as they get larger.It is a culture sometimes at odds with entrepreneurial drive. But Mr. Oumnia has struggled to scale up. When he wanted to offer stock options to lure and retain engineers and designers, the French rules were so complex that he dropped the plan. Social\u00a0taxes pushed his employee costs to nearly twice what they would be in the United States.\u00a0The financial infrastructure isn\u2019t fully developed, either. France has around 4,500 angels, investors who take risks on first-stage start-ups, compared with 18,000 in Britain. While more venture capital is flowing into France, the levels still lag Britain, Germany and Israel.\u201cFrance has plenty of talent to create start-ups,\u201d Mr. Oumnia said. \u201cThe problem is to grow them to midsize companies that create jobs in a country where unemployment is high.\u201d \u201cRegulations and taxes have still not evolved enough to allow start-ups to flourish once they get off the ground,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped President Macron would change things. \u201cSo it\u2019s fine to say, let\u2019s create a thousand start-ups. The question is, \u2018Are you creating the environment for them to become champions after?\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe answer is, \u2018Not yet.\u2019\u201d The biggest vote of confidence in Station F is from Facebook.

{"Headline": "Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of Harassment", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "Supported byTheir stories came out slowly, even hesitantly, at first. Then in a rush.One female entrepreneur recounted how she had been propositioned by a Silicon Valley venture capitalist while seeking a job with him, which she did not land after rebuffing him. Another showed the increasingly suggestive messages she had received from a start-up investor. And one chief executive described how she had faced numerous sexist comments from an investor while raising money for her online community website.What happened afterward was often just as disturbing, the women told The New York Times. Many times, the investors\u2019 firms and colleagues ignored or played down what had happened when the situations were brought to their attention. Saying anything, the women were warned, might lead to ostracism.Now some of these female entrepreneurs have decided to take that risk. More than two dozen women in the technology start-up industry spoke to The Times in recent days about being sexually harassed. Ten of them named the investors involved, often providing corroborating messages and emails, and pointed to high-profile venture capitalists such as Chris Sacca of Lowercase Capital and Dave McClure of 500 Startups.Most recently, the revelations about Mr. Caldbeck of Binary Capital have triggered an outcry. The investor has been accused of sexually harassing entrepreneurs while he worked at three different venture firms in the past seven years, often in meetings in which the women were presenting their companies to him.The chain of events has emboldened more women to talk publicly about the treatment they said they had endured from tech investors.The women\u2019s experiences help explain why the venture capital and start-up ecosystem \u2014 which underpins the tech industry and has spawned companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 has been so lopsided in terms of gender.Most venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are men, with female entrepreneurs receiving $1.5 billion in funding last year versus $58.2 billion for men, according to the data firm PitchBook. Many of the investors hold outsize power, since entrepreneurs need their money to turn ideas and innovations into a business. And because the venture industry operates with few disclosure requirements, people have kept silent about investors who cross the lines with entrepreneurs.Some of the entrepreneurs who spoke with The Times said they were often touched without permission by investors or advisers.At a mostly male tech gathering in Las Vegas in 2009, Susan Wu, an entrepreneur and investor, said that Mr. Sacca, an investor and former Google executive, touched her face without her consent in a way that made her uncomfortable. Ms. Wu said she was also propositioned by Mr. Caldbeck while fund-raising in 2010 and worked hard to avoid him later when they crossed paths.\u201cThere is such a massive imbalance of power that women in the industry often end up in distressing situations,\u201d Ms. Wu said.After the publication of this article, Mr. Sacca contacted The Times again to amend his original statement, adding: \u201cI dispute Susan\u2019s account from 2009.\u201dMany of the women also said they believed they had limited ability to push back against inappropriate behavior, often because they needed funding, a job or other help.In 2014, Sarah Kunst, 31, an entrepreneur, said she discussed a potential job at 500 Startups, a start-up incubator in San Francisco. During the recruiting process, Mr. McClure, a founder of 500 Startups and an investor, sent her a Facebook message that read in part, \u201cI was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.\u201dMs. Kunst, who now runs a fitness start-up, said she declined Mr. McClure\u2019s advance. When she later discussed the message with one of Mr. McClure\u2019s colleagues, she said 500 Startups ended its conversations with her.500 Startups said Mr. McClure, who did not respond to a request for comment, was no longer in charge of day-to-day operations after an internal investigation.\u201cAfter being made aware of instances of Dave having inappropriate behavior with women in the tech community, we have been making changes internally,\u201d 500 Startups said. \u201cHe recognizes he has made mistakes and has been going through counseling to work on addressing changes in his previous unacceptable behavior.\u201dThey put up with the comments, Ms. Renock said, because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine a world in which that $500,000 wasn\u2019t on the table anymore.\u201d Ms. Renock declined to name the investor. Wethos raised the $500,000 from someone else and is still fund-raising.Wendy Dent, 43, whose company Cinemmerse makes an app for smart watches, said she was sent increasingly flirtatious messages by a start-up adviser, Marc Canter, as she was trying to start her company in 2014. Mr. Canter, who had founded a software company in the 1980s that became known as Macromedia, initially agreed to help her find a co-founder. But over time, his messages became sexual in nature.In one message, reviewed by The Times, he wrote that she was a \u201csorceress casting a spell.\u201d In another, he commented on how she looked in a blue dress and added, \u201cKnow what I\u2019m thinking? Why am I sending you this \u2014 in private?\u201dMr. Canter, in an interview, said that Ms. Dent \u201ccame on strong to me, asking for help\u201d and that she had used her sexuality publicly. He said he disliked her ideas so he behaved the way he did to make her go away.Some entrepreneurs were asked to not speak about the behavior they experienced.At a start-up competition in 2014 in San Francisco, Lisa Curtis, an entrepreneur, pitched her food start-up, Kuli Kuli, and was told her idea had won the most plaudits from the audience, opening the door to possible investment. As she stepped off the stage, an investor named Jose De Dios, said, \u201cOf course you won. You\u2019re a total babe.\u201dMs. Curtis later posted on Facebook about the exchange and got a call from a different investor. He said \u201cthat if I didn\u2019t take down the post, no one in Silicon Valley would give me money again,\u201d she said. Ms. Curtis deleted the post.In a statement, Mr. De Dios said he \u201cunequivocally did not make a defamatory remark.\u201dLindsay Meyer, an entrepreneur in San Francisco, said Mr. Caldbeck put $25,000 of his own money into her fitness start-up in 2015. That gave Mr. Caldbeck reason to constantly text her; in those messages, reviewed by The Times, he asked if she was attracted to him and why she would rather be with her boyfriend than him. At times, he groped and kissed her, she said.\u201cI felt like I had to tolerate it because this is the cost of being a nonwhite female founder,\u201d said Ms. Meyer, who is Asian-American.But even after she reached out to a mentor, who alerted one of Binary\u2019s investors, Legacy Venture, to Mr. Caldbeck\u2019s actions, little changed. Legacy went on to invest in Binary\u2019s new fund. Binary and Mr. Caldbeck declined to comment.\u201cWe failed to follow up on information about Mr. Caldbeck\u2019s personal behavior,\u201d Legacy said in a statement. \u201cWe regret this oversight and are determined to do better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With C.E.O. Change, G.E. Will Seek Out More Growth Overseas", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAs worldwide upheaval confronts chieftains of multinational companies, Mr. Flannery has been dealt a better hand. Mr. Immelt took over a G.E. addicted to finance, willing to prostitute the stellar credit ratings of its world-class manufacturing and engineering capabilities for a quick buck. Over his tenure, which started ominously on Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Immelt did wean the company off $260 billion of financial assets, but only after the crisis forced his hand. He also divested appliances, plastics and media.For all this reimagining of G.E., which included moving the headquarters to Boston from Connecticut and a plunge into the industrial internet, Mr. Immelt has been dogged by a poorly performing stock. G.E. returned $143 billion in dividends to shareholders under his stewardship, but the shares also have tumbled by some 30 percent.Although Mr. Flannery most recently has been running the company\u2019s subscale health care division, he has pranced across G.E.\u2019s landscape. His corporate biography begins in evaluating risk for leveraged buyouts. Since then, it has been a global grand tour, running businesses across Asia and in India and Argentina. This is evidence of how G.E.\u2019s growth resides in places where the thirst for power, transportation, energy and health care \u2014 all of which G.E.\u2019s products aim to sate \u2014 will be in greater demand, even as Mr. Immelt professed last year that protectionist tendencies worldwide meant \u201ccompanies must navigate the world on their own.\u201dMr. Flannery will have the difficult task of reassuring executives running G.E.\u2019s divisions, many of whom probably fancied themselves Mr. Immelt\u2019s rightful successor, that their future is peachy. Mr. Immelt\u2019s ascension to replace Jack Welch led to defections. Mr. Flannery will also need to reassure shareholders, including Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian Partners, whose arrival probably greased the skids for his appointment.To satisfy these and other constituents, Mr. Flannery may have to mine the more radical elements of Mr. Immelt\u2019s strategy. A merger and spinoff of the oil and gas division with Baker Hughes, for example, creates a separate and listed enterprise where G.E. calls the shots. That blueprint could have wider application. As the company embarks on localizing geographically, it also could become more of a federation operationally. In that sense, Mr. Immelt\u2019s murky legacy may be dependent on Mr. Flannery.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Higher Education Seeks Answers to Leaner Years", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn uncertain futureWith an important source of revenue down and the flow of customers flattening out, one of the biggest businesses in Georgia \u2014 its public university system \u2014 is turning to a strategy of consolidations and mergers to improve efficiency and cut costs.The universities are putting some of the resulting $24 million in savings into efforts to reduce the number of dropouts. That beefs up the bottom line, too: It\u2019s cheaper to help a student stay in school than to recruit a new one.Dramatic changes like these are essential, Chancellor Steve Wrigley told his Board of Regents in April. \u201cWe inherited a system largely conceived in the 1960s,\u201d Mr. Wrigley said. \u201cBut times, society and students have all changed dramatically.\u201dThat is not only true in Georgia. Other colleges and universities across the country are also responding (albeit sometimes slowly) to challenges threatening their traditional role in society if not their survival.Because of a dip in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds, among other reasons, for example, enrollment has been dropping for five years, meaning that there are about 300,000 fewer undergraduates to divvy up among America\u2019s campuses than there used to be.To fill seats, colleges are engaged in an arms race of discounts that they increasingly cannot afford \u2014 discounts so deep that, while their sticker prices appear to be rising ahead of the inflation rate, the schools are actually seeing their net tuition revenue decline. Many small, private nonprofit colleges are giving away a record 51 percent of their tuition income in the form of discounts, according to new figures from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.All of these pressures mean something has to give, and that includes upkeep. Colleges and universities face a combined shortfall of $30 billion for needed repairs and renovations, according to the APPA, formerly the Association of Physical Plant Administrators.But in another bid to attract students, they keep building more, spending $11.6 billion last year on new construction, the private firm Dodge Data and Analytics says. That is adding not only more space the universities will have to maintain, but billions of dollars in debt on which someone will have to pay the interest.\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental lack of understanding about the strains that higher education is under,\u201d said Susan Fitzgerald, who tracks them as a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s.James Soto Antony, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who focuses on education leadership, said that people imagine that all universities look like the one where he works. \u201cThey see this $36 billion endowment and the manicured lawns and they impute that onto all colleges and universities,\u201d Mr. Antony said. \u201cAnd most of them are not like that. They are dramatically struggling for enrollment.\u201dHere\u2019s how thin: Thanks to rising discounts, small colleges reported an average revenue increase per freshman of just two-tenths of a percent last year, which means they lost ground when inflation is accounted for.Ken Redd, director of research and policy analysis at the business officers association, said: \u201cAre there enough students out there? Is there enough money out there in a time of declining enrollment to support all of those schools. Based on what we see now, you\u2019d have to say the answer is no.\u201dChief business officers on campuses agree with him. More than four in 10 don\u2019t think their current financing models are sustainable. \u201cHearing that from the chief business officers is very telling,\u201d Mr. Redd said.So universities and colleges are getting serious about other kinds of reforms. Some, as in Georgia, are dramatic \u2014 and controversial. Several campus mergers there were announced only days before they were voted on by the Board of Regents, without enough notice for the public to sign up to comment. A similar proposal was put on the table in April by the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (which does not include the University of Connecticut) in the wake of an enrollment drop and state budget cuts, only to be protested by faculty and students.\u201cChange is not easy, particularly when you\u2019ve got institutions that have been around for 100 years\u201d said Charlie Sutlive, vice chancellor for communications and governmental affairs at the University System of Georgia.That \u201cis tied as directly as possible to institutional financial health,\u201d said George L. Mehaffy, vice president for academic leadership and change at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, which is involved in the project. \u201cIf you increase the number of students you retain and graduate, it dramatically affects your bottom line.\u201d\u201cWe know what works,\u201d said Travis Reindl, senior communications officer at the Gates Foundation, \u201cand we know there is a core set of diverse institutions with pockets of solutions and innovations going on, but they\u2019ve never been brought together like this.\u201dRichard D. Legon, president of the association, said that fixing higher education \u201crequires a collaborative partnership that benefits from some of the creativity and ingenuity board members bring to the table, working with institutional leadership to ensure that students, who are really in a customer mode, want to shop at your place.\u201dNot everyone is doing this work. \u201cThere are some colleges that are very realistic about the challenges they\u2019re facing,\u201d said Ms. Fitzgerald of Moody\u2019s. \u201cThere are others that still have their heads in the sand and think that things are going to get better.\u201dBut the activity that is underway represents \u201ca sea change,\u201d Mr. Mehaffy said. \u201cThere was an era when institutions sort of just moved on. The funds were relatively good, the students were standing in line. And today\u2019s environment is dramatically different.

{"Headline": "How Donald Trump Misunderstood the F.B.I.", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "FeatureSince Watergate, the bureau has come to view itself as an essential, and essentially independent, check on the president.Supported byMindermann joined the F.B.I. 50 years ago, after a stint with the San Francisco police force, whose corruption he was happy to leave behind. He was soon transferred to the bureau\u2019s Washington field office, housed in the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 the same 19th-century edifice that is now a Trump hotel. On the afternoon of Saturday, June 17, 1972, he was in the shower at home when the phone rang.An F.B.I. clerk told him that there had been a break-in overnight at the Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate complex. He was to go to the Metropolitan Police Department headquarters and see the detective on duty. Then, lowering his voice, the clerk confided that the bureau had run a name check on one of the burglars, James McCord. It revealed that McCord had worked at both the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. He would later be identified as the chief of security at the Committee to Re-elect the President, the Nixon campaign operation known as Creep.Mindermann met the detective, who was wearing a loud sports jacket and smiling widely. The detective strode into the walk-in evidence vault and, wearing latex gloves, produced nearly three dozen crisp new $100 bills, each in a glassine envelope. He fanned them out on a desk, like a magician performing a card trick. They had been seized from one of the burglars. Mindermann noticed the consecutive serial numbers. \u2018\u2018That alone told me that they came from a bank through a person with economic power,\u2019\u2019 Mindermann told me. \u2018\u2018I got this instant cold chill. I thought: This is not an ordinary burglary.\u2019\u2019McCord had been carrying wiretapping gear at the Watergate. This was evidence of a federal crime \u2014 the illegal interception of communications \u2014 which meant the break-in was a case for the F.B.I. Wiretapping was standard practice at the F.B.I. under J. Edgar Hoover, who had ruled the bureau since 1924. But Hoover died six weeks before the Watergate break-in, and L. Patrick Gray, a lawyer at the Justice Department and a staunch Nixon loyalist, was named acting director. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t believe he could bring himself to suspect his superiors in the White House \u2014 a suspicion which was well within the Watergate investigating agents\u2019 world by about the third or fourth week,\u2019\u2019 Mindermann said.A month after the break-in, Mindermann and a colleague named Paul Magallanes found their way to Judy Hoback, a Creep accountant. The interview at her home in suburban Maryland went on past 3 a.m. By the time Mindermann and Magallanes stepped out into the cool night air, they had learned from Hoback that $3 million or more in unaccountable cash was sloshing around at Creep, to finance crimes like the Watergate break-in. Both men sensed instinctively that \u2018\u2018people in the White House itself were involved,\u2019\u2019 Magallanes, who is now 79 and runs an international security firm near Los Angeles, told me. Mindermann said he felt \u2018\u2018a dark dread that this is happening in our democracy.\u2019\u2019 By 10:45 that morning, the agents had typed up a 19-page statement that laid out Creep\u2019s direct connections to Nixon\u2019s inner circle.Mindermann, the young ex-cop with five $27 department-store suits to his name, remembers the president\u2019s men who stonewalled the investigation throughout 1972 and early 1973 as \u2018\u2018Ivy Leaguers in their custom-fitted finery \u2014 these privileged boys born to be federal judges and Wall Street barons. They were gutless and completely self-serving. They lacked the ability to do the right thing.\u2019\u2019 By late April 1973, however, the stonewalls were crumbling. On Friday, April 27, as Nixon flew off to Camp David for the weekend, mulling his dark future, the F.B.I. moved to secure White House records relevant to Watergate.At 5:15 p.m., 15 agents arose from their dented metal desks in the Old Post Office building and marched in tight formation, fully armed, up Pennsylvania Avenue. On Monday, a highly agitated Nixon returned to the White House to find a skinny F.B.I. accountant standing watch outside a West Wing office. The president pushed him up against a wall and demanded to know how he had the authority to invade the White House. Mindermann laughed at the memory: \u2018\u2018What do you do,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018when you\u2019re mugged by the president of the United States?\u2019\u2019Trump, Comey said, had asked his F.B.I. director for his loyalty \u2014 and that seemed to shock Comey the most. The F.B.I.\u2019s stated mission is \u2018\u2018to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States\u2019\u2019 \u2014 not to protect the president. Trump seemed to believe Comey was dutybound to do his bidding and stop investigating the recently fired national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. \u2018\u2018The statue of Justice has a blindfold on because you\u2019re not supposed to be peeking out to see whether your patron is pleased or not with what you\u2019re doing,\u2019\u2019 Comey said. \u2018\u2018It should be about the facts and the law.\u2019\u2019Trump might have been less confused about how Comey saw his job if he had ever visited the F.B.I. director in his office. On his desk, under glass, Comey famously kept a copy of a 1963 order authorizing Hoover to conduct round-the-clock F.B.I. surveillance of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It was signed by the young attorney general, Robert F. Kennedy, after Hoover convinced John F. Kennedy and his brother that King had Communists in his organization \u2014 a reminder of the abuses of power that had emanated from the desk where Comey sat.One of history\u2019s great what-ifs is whether the Watergate investigation would have gone forward if Hoover hadn\u2019t died six weeks before the break-in. When Hoover died, Nixon called him \u2018\u2018my closest personal friend in all of political life.\u2019\u2019 Along with Senator Joseph McCarthy, they were the avatars of anti-Communism in America. Hoover\u2019s F.B.I. was not unlike what Trump seems to have imagined the agency still to be: a law-enforcement apparatus whose flexible loyalties were bent to fit the whims of its director. In his half-century at the helm of the F.B.I., Hoover rarely approved cases against politicians. In the 1960s, he much preferred going after the civil rights and antiwar movements and their leaders, and his agents routinely broke the law in the name of the law.In 1975, however, Congress, emboldened by Watergate and newly attuned to its watchdog responsibilities, began its first full-scale investigation of this legacy, and of similar abuses at the C.I.A. Edward Levi, Gerald Ford\u2019s attorney general, gave the F.B.I. an unprecedented assignment: investigating itself. Fifty-three agents were soon targets of investigations by their own agency, implicated in crimes committed in the name of national security. Mark Felt, the agency\u2019s second-in-command (who 30 years later revealed himself to have been Bob Woodward\u2019s source \u2018\u2018Deep Throat\u2019\u2019), and Ed Miller, the F.B.I.\u2019s intelligence director, were convicted of conspiring to violate the civil rights of Americans. (President Ronald Reagan later pardoned them.) The F.B.I.\u2019s rank and file felt it was under attack. \u2018\u2018Every jot of wrongdoing \u2014 whether real, imagined or grossly exaggerated \u2014 now commands an extraordinary amount of attention,\u2019\u2019 Clarence Kelley, the F.B.I. director under Presidents Nixon, Ford and Jimmy Carter, said in 1976. The American people, he argued, could not long endure \u2018\u2018a crippled and beleaguered F.B.I.\u2019\u2019The Iran-contra scandal provided the bureau with its first great post-Watergate test. On Oct. 5, 1986, Sandinistas in Nicaragua shot down a cargo plane, which bore an unassuming transport-company name but was found to contain 60 Kalashnikov rifles, tens of thousands of cartridges and other gear. One crew member was captured and revealed the first inklings of what turned out to be an extraordinary plot. Reagan\u2019s national-security team had conspired to sell American weapons to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and, after marking up the price fivefold, skimmed the proceeds and slipped them to the anti-Communist contra rebels in Nicaragua. This was a direct violation of federal law, as Congress had passed a bill cutting off aid to the rebels, which made Iran-contra a case for the F.B.I.In a major feat of forensics, F.B.I. agents recovered 5,000 deleted emails from National Security Council office computers, which laid out the scheme from start to finish. They opened a burn bag of top-secret documents belonging to the N.S.C. aide Oliver North and found a copy of elaborately falsified secret testimony to Congress. They dusted it for fingerprints and found ones belonging to Clair George, chief of the clandestine service of the C.I.A. In short order, an F.B.I. squad was inside C.I.A. headquarters, rifling through double-locked file cabinets. Almost all the major evidence that led to the indictments of 12 top national-security officials was uncovered by the F.B.I.George H.\u2009W. Bush pardoned many of the key defendants at the end of his presidency, on Christmas Eve 1992 \u2014 just as Reagan pardoned Mark Felt and Ford pardoned Nixon. This was the limit of the agency\u2019s influence, the one presidential power that the F.B.I. could not fight. But over the course of two decades and five presidents, the post-Hoover relationship between the F.B.I. and the White House had settled into a delicate balance between the rule of law and the chief of state. Presidents could use secrecy, and sometimes outright deception, to push their executive powers to the limit. But the F.B.I., through its investigative brief, retained a powerful unofficial check on these privileges: the ability to amass, and unveil, deep secrets of state. The agency might not have been able to stop presidents like Nixon and Reagan from overreaching, but when it did intervene, there was little presidents could do to keep the F.B.I. from making their lives very difficult \u2014 as Bill Clinton discovered in 1993, when he appointed Louis J. Freeh as his F.B.I. director.Freeh was an F.B.I. agent early in his career but had been gone from the agency for some time when he was named to run it \u2014 so he was alarmed to discover, shortly after he started his new job, that the F.B.I. was in the midst of investigating real estate deals involving the Clintons in Arkansas. Freeh quickly turned in his White House pass. He saw Clinton as a criminal suspect in the Whitewater affair, in which the F.B.I. and a special prosecutor bushwhacked through the brambles of Arkansas politics and business for four years \u2014 and, through a most circuitous route, wound up grilling a 24-year-old former White House intern named Monica Lewinsky in a five-star hotel. The bureau, through the White House physician, had blood drawn from the president to match the DNA on Lewinsky\u2019s blue dress \u2014 evidence that the president perjured himself under oath about sex, opening the door to his impeachment by the House of Representatives.\u2018\u2018He came to believe that I was trying to undo his presidency,\u2019\u2019 Freeh wrote of Clinton in his memoir. Clinton\u2019s allies complained after the fact that Freeh\u2019s serial investigations of the president were not just a headache but also a fatal distraction. From 1996 to 2001, when Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden bombed two American Embassies in Africa and plotted the Sept. 11 attacks, the F.B.I. spent less time and money on any counterterrorism investigation than it did investigating claims that Chinese money bought influence over President Clinton though illegal 1996 campaign contributions \u2014 an immense project that eventually became a fiasco on its own terms. One of the F.B.I.\u2019s informants in the investigation was a socially promi\u00adnent and politically connected Californian named Katrina Leung. At the time, Leung was in a sexual relationship with her F.B.I. handler, James J. Smith, chief of the bureau\u2019s Los Angeles branch\u2019s China squad. Smith had reason to suspect that Leung might be a double agent working for Chinese intelligence, but he protected her anyway.The F.B.I. buried the scandal until after Clinton left the White House in 2001. By the time it came to light, Freeh was out the door, and President George W. Bush had chosen Robert Mueller as the sixth director of the F.B.I.Mueller had already earned the respect of the F.B.I. rank and file during his tenure as chief of the criminal division of the Justice Department. When he started work at the Justice Department in 1990, the F.B.I. had been trying and failing for two years to solve the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. \u2018\u2018The F.B.I. was not set up to deal with a major investigation like this,\u2019\u2019 Richard Marquise, an F.B.I. intelligence analyst who became the leader of the Lockerbie investigation under Mueller, said in an F.B.I. oral history. \u2018\u2018I blame the institution.\u2019\u2019Mueller used his power under law to obliterate the F.B.I.\u2019s byzantine flow charts of authority in the case. \u2018\u2018We literally cut out the chains of command,\u2019\u2019 Marquise said. \u2018\u2018We brought in the C.I.A. We brought the Scots. We brought MI5 to Washington. And we sat down and we said: \u2018We need to change the way we\u2019re doing business. .\u2009.\u2009. We need to start sharing information.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 It was a tip from the Scots that put Marquise on the trail of the eventual suspect: one of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s intelligence officers, whose cover was security chief for the Libyan state airlines. Qaddafi\u2019s spy, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, was indicted in 1991. It took until the turn of the 21st century, but he was convicted.It meant a great deal to Mueller, in the Lockerbie case, that the evidence the F.B.I. produced be deployed as evidence in court, not justification for war. In a speech he gave at Stanford University in 2002, concerning the nation\u2019s newest threat, he spoke of \u2018\u2018the balance we must strike to protect our national security and our civil liberties as we address the threat of terrorism.\u2019\u2019 He concluded: \u2018\u2018We will be judged by history, not just on how we disrupt and deter terrorism, but also on how we protect the civil liberties and the constitutional rights of all Americans, including those Americans who wish us ill. We must do both of these things, and we must do them exceptionally well.\u2019\u2019These views made Mueller something of an outlier in the Bush administration; five days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Vice President Dick Cheney was warning that the White House needed to go over to \u2018\u2018the dark side\u2019\u2019 to fight Al Qaeda. Among the darkest places was a top-secret program code-named Stellar Wind, under which the N.S.A. eavesdropped freely in the United States without search warrants.By the end of 2003, Mueller had a new boss: James Comey, who was named deputy attorney general. Comey was read into the Stellar Wind program and deemed it unconstitutional. He briefed Mueller, who concurred. They saw no evidence that the surveillance had saved a single life, stopped an imminent attack or uncovered an Al Qaeda member in the United States. In the first week of March, the two men agreed that the F.B.I. could not continue to go along with the surveillance programs. They also thought Attorney General John Ashcroft should not re-endorse Stellar Wind. Comey made the case to Ashcroft.In remarkable congressional testimony in 2007, Comey would describe what happened next: Hours later, Ashcroft keeled over with gallstone pancreatitis. He was sedated and scheduled for surgery. Comey was now the acting attorney general. He and the president were required to reauthorize Stellar Wind on March 11 for the program to continue. When Comey learned the White House counsel and chief of staff were heading to the hospital of the night of March 10 to get the signature of the barely conscious Ashcroft, Comey raced to Ashcroft\u2019s hospital room to head them off. When they arrived, Ashcroft lifted his head off the pillow and told the president\u2019s men that he wouldn\u2019t sign. Pointing at Comey, he said: \u2018\u2018There is the attorney general.\u2019\u2019Bush signed the authorization alone anyway, asserting that he had constitutional power to do so. Mueller took meticulous notes of these events; they were partly declassified years later. On March 11, he wrote that the president was \u2018\u2018trying to do an end run around\u2019\u2019 Comey, at the time the nation\u2019s chief law-enforcement officer. At 1:30 a.m. on March 12, Mueller drafted a letter of resignation. \u2018\u2018I am forced to withdraw the F.B.I. from participation in the program,\u2019\u2019 he wrote. If the president did not back down, \u2018\u2018I would be constrained to resign as director of the F.B.I.\u2019\u2019 And Comey and Ashcroft would go with him.Seven hours later, with the letter in the breast pocket of his suit, Mueller sat alone with Bush in the Oval Office. Once again, the F.B.I. had joined a battle against a president. Mueller\u2019s notes show that he told Bush in no uncertain terms that \u2018\u2018a presidential order alone\u2019\u2019 could not legalize Stellar Wind. Unless the N.S.A. brought Stellar Wind within the constraints of the law, he would lose his F.B.I. director, the attorney general and the acting attorney general. In the end, Bush relented \u2014 it took years, but the programs were put on what Mueller considered a defensible legal footing.For the Watergate veterans John Mindermann and Paul Magallanes, the news of recent weeks has come with a certain amount of professional gratification. When I spoke with them on June 14, both agents said they wanted the bureau\u2019s role as a check on the president to be in the public eye. For years, they felt that their own work had gone unacknowledged. \u2018\u2018We never got an \u2018attaboy\u2019 letter from our superiors,\u2019\u2019 Mindermann said. \u2018\u2018But we changed history, and we knew it.\u2019\u2019 Magallanes had always been bothered by how, in the collective American memory, Nixon\u2019s downfall was attributed to so many other authors: Woodward and Bernstein, crusading congressional committees, hard-nosed special prosecutors. To the agents who were present at the time, it was first and foremost an F.B.I. story. \u2018\u2018We were the people who did the work,\u2019\u2019 Magallanes told me. \u2018\u2018It was we, the F.B.I., who brought Richard Nixon down. We showed that our government can investigate itself.\u2019\u2019Tim Weiner was a reporter for The Times from 1993 to 2009.

{"Headline": "Corruption Crackdown Intensifies in Tunisia, and the People Cheer", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTUNIS \u2014 The Tunisian prime minister has embarked on a sweeping crackdown against organized crime, arresting nearly a dozen mafia bosses and smuggling barons in recent weeks in an effort to stamp out what has become a nearly existential threat to the young democracy.The drive has surprised nearly everyone for its vigor, but it is not without risks, as the mafia bosses have become so powerful that financial and political analysts say they present a threat as dangerous as terrorism.\u201cIt is a war, not a one-off battle,\u201d Mr. Chahed, 41, a soft-spoken agricultural engineer, who worked for several years on development programs at the United States Embassy in Tunis, said in an interview this month. \u201cWe are going to continue to the end. It is very important for the Tunisian economy, for the security of the territory.\u201dThe popular uprising in 2010 that overthrew the 23-year dictatorship of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was fueled by the venality of his family and the relatives of his wife, Leila Trabelsi.Yet since then the problem of corruption has only worsened. Whereas it used to benefit just a tight circle around the president, it now encompasses a wider circle of thousands.Over the last several years it has infected large portions of the public sector in what has become known as the \u201cdemocratization of corruption,\u201d as crime bosses have paid for influence in the media, political parties and the police and judiciary.Mr. Chahed declared a war on corruption when he took over the government in August, with little evident progress. But now he is casting the problem as a security issue.\u201cWe are persuaded there is a link between smuggling, terrorism financing, cross-border activities and also capital flight,\u201d Mr. Chahed said, promising more arrests ahead.Already they are piling up. This month, Moncef el Materi, a close associate linked by marriage to the former president and his wife, was arrested in France, apparently at the request of the Tunisian authorities. He had been wanted since 2011.One of the biggest smuggling barons, Chafik Jarraya, was arrested May 23 and charged with treason and intelligence links to a neighboring country \u2014 widely understood to be Libya. He is in military custody and will appear before a military tribunal.At least nine others have been detained under the country\u2019s state of emergency law. Preliminary charges include smuggling, the illegal registration of real estate and failure to report income, according to news agency reports.Human Rights Watch, among others, has criticized the government\u2019s use of a military tribunal and state of emergency laws to try civilians, but the prime minister insisted that everything was within the law.\u201cWe are not targeting people but the whole system,\u201d he added. \u201cOur aim is to dissect the systems of trafficking, to break the smuggling networks and to reveal the financing and sites of this phenomenon.\u201dCorruption has been suffocating Tunisia\u2019s economy, which was already battered by a wave of bloody terrorism attacks in 2015 and 2016. Corruption in public contracting alone is costing the country nearly $1 billion a year, according to Chawki Tabib, the head of the anticorruption agency.The most serious abuse is within public institutions, and involves hundreds of civil servants and members of the administration, as well as officials in Tunisia\u2019s maritime ports and customs areas. Already, 21 customs officials have been removed from their posts, and 35 others have been referred to a disciplinary tribunal.Mr. Chahed, who will visit the United States next month to push for more security assistance and investment in Tunisia, has been under growing pressure from international financial institutions to take on the problem. Yet it may have been startling revelations from one of the biggest criminal bosses that left him with little choice but to act.Mr. Trabelsi, 42, is already behind bars, sentenced to 108 years for various charges of embezzlement and fraud for his business activities during the dictatorship, but his videotaped testimony from prison shocked the country.For the first time, a member of Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s family circle openly described how he had built his business empire by bribing customs officials and using his presidential connections to monopolize import concessions and flout legal and financial regulations.\u201cIf you have someone at the customs, you have no problem,\u201d Mr. Trabelsi said. \u201cI was generous with the customs officials. They knew that I paid four or five times more than the others.\u201dHe fingered some of his partners in crime, and said even high-level bureaucrats had been quick to help, adding that corruption was still going on.\u201cThere has been a revolution, but nothing has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to what I hear, the same system is still operational.\u201dThree days later, the prime minister acted, arresting, among others, several former business associates of Mr. Trabelsi.\u201cI think they seized this opportunity to do what they had not dared,\u201d said Sihem Bensedrine, the president of the Truth and Dignity Commission, which has a mandate to uncover human rights and financial abuses during nearly 60 years of authoritarian rule. \u201cMaybe this is a first step, it is good that they started.\u201dImmediately after the revolution, the government confiscated property and businesses owned by Mr. Ben Ali and his family. A commission to investigate corruption in and embezzlement by the former government, led by an eminent law professor, Abdelfattah Amar, produced a 300-page report, with documents found in the presidential palace, and referred 459 cases to the courts.Yet according to Mr. Tabib, the head of the anticorruption agency, only 40 of those cases have been brought to a successful conclusion. Successive governments failed to provide a budget for the commission, bringing work to a standstill. The judiciary, nominally independent, has been accused of delays and corruption.Mr. Chahed\u2019s government has been promising more action, yet it has been sending mixed signals. It passed a law for access to information, and another to protect whistle-blowers, but also supports a reconciliation law for businessmen under investigation that opponents say would whitewash their crimes.Mr. Chahed insists that steady work is going on, of which the arrests are just part. Mr. Tabib now has 30 investigators in his anticorruption commission, and money is being put into training 500 more magistrates.The prime minister is discovering that there is popular support for his drive. In a recent survey by the International Republican Institute, 89 percent of Tunisians described the economy as being in a bad way and 85 percent said they felt that action against corruption was the solution.\u201cPeople are telling him if you do it you\u2019ll become a national hero,\u201d said Achraf Aouadi, president of I-Watch, an anticorruption advocacy movement in Tunis. \u201cIt\u2019s the jackpot.\u201dLilia Blaise contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Carl Reiner and His Fellow Nonagenarians, Death Can Wait", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe title of Carl Reiner\u2019s most recent book is \u201cToo Busy to Die,\u201d and this 95-year-old comedy legend can thank his vivid dreams for inspiring many of the (sometimes wacky) ideas that keep him going.\u201cMy mind keeps popping,\u201d Mr. Reiner, who created \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show\u201d and directed the movies \u201cOh, God!,\u201d \u201cThe Jerk\u201d and \u201cDead Men Don\u2019t Wear Plaid,\u201d said in a phone interview from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cSo I\u2019ll keep going as long as it lets me.\u201dIt\u2019s stereotype-shattering nonagenarians like Mr. Reiner who inspired the documentary \u201cIf You\u2019re Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast,\u201d which debuts Monday, June 5, on HBO. The film, directed by Danny Gold, takes its name from Mr. Reiner\u2019s daily activity of checking the death notices to make sure it\u2019s safe to go about his business.A look into those leading vital lives well into their 90s, the documentary is also a toast to Mr. Reiner\u2019s career and to those of his famous peers. He serves as narrator and plays something of a host throughout: There he is interviewing Kirk Douglas and Dick Van Dyke and enjoying freewheeling, reflective conversations with the longtime friends and colleagues Mel Brooks and Norman Lear.Mr. Brooks said the thought of him slowing down in older age is heresy. \u201cThere is living and dying; there\u2019s no retirement,\u201d Mr. Brooks said in an interview.\u201cIf we die, then we can\u2019t do much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as long as we\u2019re alive, we can still tap dance, we can still crack a joke, we can still sing a song, we can still tell a story.\u201dFor Mr. Lear, 94, participating in the film is a continuation of a mission to buck the stereotype of the elderly as \u201cdecrepit and weak and foolish.\u201dMr. Lear, the creator of \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d \u201cThe Jeffersons\u201d and \u201cSanford and Son,\u201d has been having a bit of resurgence lately. A remake of his 1970s and \u201980s sitcom \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d will be returning for a second season on Netflix, and he reviews scripts and attends nearly every casting session and show taping. He also hosts a weekly podcast, \u201cAll of the Above,\u201d talking comedy with guests like Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Amy Poehler.\u201cThe culture has an impression of aging that is not realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get the laughs, it paints a picture of older people as infirm, as whiny, and as incapacitated and foolish. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s who we are.\u201dGeorge Shapiro, the film\u2019s producer (with Aimee Hyatt) and Mr. Reiner\u2019s nephew, agreed. He\u2019s been thinking about such a documentary since 2010, when he started a paper file marked \u201cVitality After 90.\u201d Last year, with Mr. Reiner\u2019s blessing, he went ahead and self-financed the documentary, tapping Mr. Gold to direct after Ms. Hyatt showed him the filmmaker\u2019s recent documentary \u201c100 Voices: A Journey Home,\u201d which tells the history of Jewish culture in Poland. (Mr. Shapiro, a longtime talent manager whose clients include Mr. Seinfeld, declined to disclose the budget.)Mr. Reiner wanted the documentary to land at HBO, and it found a receptive audience there. Sheila Nevins, the president of HBO Documentary Films, said she\u2019s overseen \u201ca lot of sorrow onscreen\u201d in her career, particularly as it relates to older people. Most documentaries featuring older subjects \u201care about elder abuse or diseases,\u201d she noted. \u201cTo suddenly be able to laugh is a very rare thing in a documentary.\u201dEarly in the film, Mr. Reiner asks a rhetorical question: \u201cHow come we got the extra years? Was it luck, good genes, modern medicine? Or are we doing something right?\u201dThe film then sets out to answer that question and attempts to serve as something of a how-to guide, proposing the maintenance of close friendships and passions for hobbies as paramount.Mr. Seinfeld, who appears in the film to offer a perspective on aging and reveals he often wakes up depressed every morning thinking about yet another day of tasks, first met Mr. Reiner as an 8-year-old seeking an autograph at the Westbury Music Fair. Mr. Seinfeld said he\u2019s a firm believer in remaining dynamic in one\u2019s later years. \u201cThat song \u2018Young at Heart,\u2019 I don\u2019t believe in that,\u201d he said with a laugh, referring to the Frank Sinatra hit. \u201cYou gotta do something! You may start with a philosophy, but you got to actually act on it. It doesn\u2019t happen just because you have a sunny disposition. You actually have to do some work.\u201dMr. Shapiro said he\u2019s already booked the 63-year-old Mr. Seinfeld for a 100th-birthday comedy show at Caesars Palace, in Las Vegas, in 2054. \u201cWe even have a hold-the-date certificate,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said with a laugh. \u201cHe will be there. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be there.\u201dMr. Reiner admits to still being surprised on occasion by his contemporaries. During his research for the book about films from his youth he learned that Olivia de Havilland, who, in 1938, starred alongside Errol Flynn in \u201cThe Adventures of Robin Hood,\u201d was still alive and living in France at 100.\u201cIt makes me so happy,\u201d Mr. Reiner said. \u201cTo know you can go on like that and still have your wits about you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How G.O.P. Leaders Came to View Climate Change as Fake Science", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump RulesWASHINGTON \u2014 The campaign ad appeared during the presidential contest of 2008. Rapid-fire images of belching smokestacks and melting ice sheets were followed by a soothing narrator who praised a candidate who had stood up to President George W. Bush and \u201csounded the alarm on global warming.\u201dThe Republican Party\u2019s fast journey from debating how to combat human-caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist is a story of big political money, Democratic hubris in the Obama years and a partisan chasm that grew over nine years like a crack in the Antarctic shelf, favoring extreme positions and uncompromising rhetoric over cooperation and conciliation.\u201cMost Republicans still do not regard climate change as a hoax,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist who worked for Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cBut the entire climate change debate has now been caught up in the broader polarization of American politics.\u201d\u201cIn some ways,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s become yet another of the long list of litmus test issues that determine whether or not you\u2019re a good Republican.\u201dSince Mr. McCain ran for president on climate credentials that were stronger than his opponent Barack Obama\u2019s, the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases from fossil fuels to the dangerous warming of the planet has grown stronger. Scientists have for the first time drawn concrete links between the planet\u2019s warming atmosphere and changes that affect Americans\u2019 daily lives and pocketbooks, from tidal flooding in Miami to prolonged water shortages in the Southwest to decreasing snow cover at ski resorts.That scientific consensus was enough to pull virtually all of the major nations along. Conservative-leaning governments in Britain, France, Germany and Japan all signed on to successive climate change agreements.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement drew immediate reaction from big-city mayors, governors and Congress members.Yet when Mr. Trump pulled the United States from the Paris accord, the Senate majority leader, the speaker of the House and every member of the elected Republican leadership were united in their praise.But in Republican political circles, speaking out on the issue, let alone pushing climate policy, is politically dangerous. So for the most part, these moderate Republicans are biding their time, until it once again becomes safe for Republicans to talk more forcefully about climate change. The question is how long that will take.\u201cWith 40 percent of Florida\u2019s population at risk from sea-level rise, my state is on the front lines of climate change,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida. \u201cSouth Florida residents are already beginning to feel the effects of climate change in their daily lives.\u201dThe effort picked up steam the next year after the House of Representatives passed what is known as cap-and-trade legislation, a concept invented by conservative Reagan-era economists.The idea was to create a statutory limit, or cap, on the overall amount of a certain type of pollution that could be emitted. Businesses could then buy and sell permits to pollute, choosing whether to invest more in pollution permits, or in cleaner technology that would then save them money and allow them to sell their allotted permits. The administration of the first President George Bush successfully deployed the first national cap-and-trade system in 1990 to lower emissions of the pollutants that cause acid rain. Mr. McCain pushed a cap-and-trade proposal to fight climate change.\u201cI thought we could get it done,\u201d recalled Henry A. Waxman, a retired House Democrat who led the cap-and-trade push in 2009. \u201cWe just had two candidates from the Republican and Democratic parties who had run for president and agreed that climate change was a real threat.\u201dConservative activists saw the legislative effort as an opportunity to transform the climate debate.Myron Ebell, a senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, worked behind the scenes to make sure Republican offices in Congress knew about Mr. Horner\u2019s work \u2014 although at the time, many viewed Mr. Ebell skeptically, as an extremist pushing out-of-touch views.As Congress moved toward actually passing climate change legislation, a fringe issue had become a part of the political mainstream.\u201cThat was the turning point,\u201d Mr. Horner said.Unshackled by the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision and other related rulings, which ended corporate campaign finance restrictions, Koch Industries and Americans for Prosperity started an all-fronts campaign with television advertising, social media and cross-country events aimed at electing lawmakers who would ensure that the fossil fuel industry would not have to worry about new pollution regulations.Their first target: unseating Democratic lawmakers such as Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Perriello of Virginia, who had voted for the House cap-and-trade bill, and replacing them with Republicans who were seen as more in step with struggling Appalachia, and who pledged never to push climate change measures.But Americans for Prosperity also wanted to send a message to Republicans.Until 2010, some Republicans ran ads in House and Senate races showing their support for green energy.\u201cAfter that, it disappeared from Republican ads,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cPart of that was the polling, and part of it was the visceral example of what happened to their colleagues who had done that.\u201dWhat happened was clear. Republicans who asserted support for climate change legislation or the seriousness of the climate threat saw their money dry up or, worse, a primary challenger arise.\u201cIt told Republicans that we were serious,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, \u201cthat we would spend some serious money against them.\u201dEven for congressional veterans, that message was not missed. Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who once called climate change \u201ca serious problem\u201d and co-sponsored a bill to promote energy-efficient light bulbs, tacked right after the 2010 elections as he battled to be chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee against Joe Barton, a Texan who mocked human-caused climate change.Mr. Upton deleted references to climate change from his website. \u201cIf you look, the last year was the warmest year on record, the warmest decade on record. I accept that,\u201d he offered that fall. \u201cI do not say that it\u2019s man-made.\u201d\u201cIn my own campaign, there were people who felt strongly enough about my views on climate change to use it to help defeat me, and other Republicans are very sensitive to that possibility,\u201d Mr. Lugar said in an interview. \u201cSo even if they privately believe we ought to do something about it, they\u2019re reticent, especially with the Republican president taking the views he is now taking.\u201dAfter winning re-election in 2012, Mr. Obama understood his second-term agenda would have to rely on executive authority, not legislation that would go nowhere in the Republican-majority Congress. And climate change was the great unfinished business of his first term.To finish it, he would deploy a rarely used provision in the Clean Air Act of 1970, which gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to issue regulations on carbon dioxide.The result was the Clean Power Plan, which would significantly cut planet-warming emissions by forcing the closing of hundreds of heavy-polluting coal-fired power plants.The end run around Congress had consequences of its own. To Republican (and some Democratic) critics, the Clean Power Plan exemplified everything they opposed about Mr. Obama: He seemed to them imperious, heavy-handed, pleasing to the elites on the East and West Coasts and in the capitals of Europe, but callous to the blue-collar workers of coal and oil country.\u201cIt fed into this notion of executive overreach,\u201d said Heather Zichal, who advised Mr. Obama on climate policy. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a good enough job on managing the narrative.\u201dRepublicans who had supported the climate change agenda began to defect and have since stayed away.\u201cOn the issue of climate change, I think it\u2019s happening,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a CNN podcast interview last April. But, he said, \u201cThe president decided, at least in the last couple years if not more, to rule by edict.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s political opponents saw the climate rules as a ripe opportunity. \u201cWhen the president went the regulatory route, it gave our side more confidence,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cIt hardened and broadened Republican opposition to this agenda.\u201dStarting in early 2014, the opponents of the rule \u2014 including powerful lawyers and lobbyists representing many of America\u2019s largest manufacturing and industrial interests \u2014 regularly gathered in a large conference room at the national headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, overlooking the White House. They drafted a long-game legal strategy to undermine Mr. Obama\u2019s climate regulations in a coordinated campaign that brought together 28 state attorneys general and major corporations to form an argument that they expected to eventually take to the Supreme Court.They presented it not as an environmental fight but an economic one, against a government that was trying to vastly and illegally expand its authority.West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, led the session, \u201cThe Dangerous Consequences of the Clean Power Plan & Other E.P.A. Rules,\u201d which included, according to the agenda, Scott Pruitt, then the attorney general of Oklahoma; Ken Paxton, Texas\u2019 attorney general; and Geoffrey Barnes, a corporate lawyer for Murray, which had donated $250,000 to the Republican attorneys general political group.When Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, he did not appear to have a clear understanding of the nation\u2019s climate change policies. Nor, at the start of his campaign, did he appear to have any specific plan to prioritize a huge legal push to roll those policies back.This ad appeared in The New York Times in December 2009, urging President Barack Obama to push a global climate change pact being negotiated in Copenhagen. Donald J. Trump and members of his family supported the ad, along with other business leaders.However, it did not go unnoticed that coal country was giving his presidential campaign a wildly enthusiastic embrace, as miners came out in full force for Mr. Trump, stoking his populist message.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about miners all over the country,\u201d he said, eliciting cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put miners back to work.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t used to have all these rules and regulations that make it impossible to compete,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it all off the table.\u201dThen an official from the West Virginia Coal Association handed the candidate a miner\u2019s hat.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers embraced the miners as emblematic of the candidate\u2019s broader populist appeal.\u201cThe coal miners were the perfect case for what he was talking about,\u201d Mr. Bennett said, \u201cthe idea that for the government in Washington, it\u2019s all right for these people to suffer for the greater good \u2014 that federal power is more important than your little lives.\u201dMr. Trump took on as an informal campaign adviser Robert E. Murray \u2014 chief executive of the same coal company that had been working closely for years with the Republican attorneys general to unwind the Obama environmental legacy.Mr. Murray, a brash and folksy populist who started working in coal mines as a teenager, is an unabashed skeptic of climate science. The coal magnate and Mr. Trump had a natural chemistry, and where Mr. Trump lacked the legal and policy background to unwind climate policy, Mr. Murray was happy to step in.\u201cI thank my lord, Jesus Christ, for the election of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Murray said soon after his new friend won the White House.Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Ebell, the Competitive Enterprise Institute fellow who had worked for years to undermine the legitimacy of established climate science, to head the transition team at E.P.A. Mr. Ebell immediately began pushing for an agenda of gutting the Obama climate regulations and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.When it came time to translate Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to coal country into policy, Mr. Murray and others helped choose the perfect candidate: Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump wanted to be seen delivering on the promises he had made to the miners. As controversies piled up in his young administration, he sought comfort in the approval of his base.Meanwhile, a battle raged at the White House over whether to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, urged him to remain in, cautioning that withdrawing could be devastating to the United States\u2019 foreign policy credentials.But these voices did not have clout in Washington, either in Congress or at the White House, when it comes to energy policy.Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, backed by Mr. Pruitt, told the president that pulling out of the deal would mean a promise kept to his base.Dr. Bolin helped steer the conference to its conclusion: \u201cIt is now believed that in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man\u2019s history,\u201d he wrote in the conference\u2019s 500-page report.While the politics of climate change in the United States has grown more divided since then, the scientific community has united: Global warming is having an impact, scientists say, with sea levels rising along with the extremity of weather events. Most of the debate is about the extent of those impacts \u2014 how high the seas may rise, or how intense and frequent heavy storms or heat waves may be.But in Congress, reluctance to embrace that science has had no political downsides, at least among Republicans.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have an example of where someone has paid a political price being on that side of it,\u201d said Michael Steel, who served as press secretary for the former House speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and the current House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, during his 2012 run as Mitt Romney\u2019s vice-presidential choice.Instead, the messages of Mr. Pruitt still dominate.\u201cThis is an historic restoration of American economic independence \u2014 one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said on Thursday, stepping to the Rose Garden lectern after Mr. Trump. \u201cWe owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.\u201dBut most public opinion polls find that voters rank the environment last or nearly last among the issues that they vote on. And views are divided based on party affiliation. In 2001, 46 percent of Democrats said they worried \u201ca great deal\u201d about climate change, compared with 29 percent of Republicans, according to a Gallup tracking poll on the issue. This year, concern among Democrats has reached 66 percent. Among Republicans, it has fallen, to 18 percent.Until people vote on the issue, Republicans will find it politically safer to question climate science and policy than to alienate moneyed groups like Americans for Prosperity.\u201cThis is a local issue for me,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cEven conservatives in my district see the impact. It\u2019s flooding, and it\u2019s happening now.\u201dMr. Curbelo is confident that as the impact of climate change spreads, so will the willingness of his Republican colleagues to join him.Outside of Congress, a small number of establishment conservatives, including a handful of leaders from the Reagan administration, have begun pushing Washington to act on climate change. Earlier this year, James A. Baker III, one of the Republican Party\u2019s more eminent senior figures, met with senior White House officials to urge them to consider incorporating a carbon tax as part of a broader tax overhaul package \u2014 a way to both pay for proposed cuts to corporate tax rates and help save the planet. A Reagan White House senior economist, Art Laffer; a former secretary of state, George P. Shultz; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., George W. Bush\u2019s final Treasury secretary, have also pushed the idea.\u201cThere are members from deep-red districts who have approached me about figuring out how to become part of this effort,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cI know we have the truth on our side. So I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll win \u2014 eventually.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when the Supreme Court stayed the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which regulated emissions from coal-fired power plants. It was in February 2016, not April.Henry Fountain contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Then his father called.\u201cHe came to me with a serious face and said, \u2018I heard you\u2019re good at math,\u2019\u201d Mr. Suzuki, 37, said. \u201cWe have a small problem. We need your help.\u201dHis father, Toshio Suzuki, was the chef and co-owner of the restaurant Sushi Zen, which had been a Midtown Manhattan institution for more than 30 years. And his problem wasn\u2019t so small. \u201cWhen I looked at the books it wasn\u2019t healthy,\u201d his son said.But the son wanted to help. \u201cI thought it was a great opportunity to try out what I could do,\u201d he said. \u201cI stared at everything from auditing, to regular food purchases, to how consistently everyone was cutting the fish.\u201dAnd in the process, he found himself working in a sushi restaurant. Five years later, Sushi Zen is closed, but father and son are continuing the family business in a new venture called Suzuki. There, the tables are turned, with the son running the business so his father can just make sushi.\u201cWhen I was operating Sushi Zen, it was my duty solely to keep the business afloat and keep the guests happy,\u201d the elder Mr. Suzuki, 71, said through a translator. \u201cIn the new place, financing and management are covered by my son. I wanted to focus on training and bringing up my younger staff.\u201dConversations about family business succession are as complicated as families themselves, but since the businesses are usually the primary driver of wealth in the family, it is essential to have such discussions, uncomfortable or not. That doesn\u2019t mean they go smoothly, or even happen when they should.\u201cThe business and the family are usually so intertwined,\u201d said Karen Reynolds Sharkey, national business owner strategist at U.S. Trust, the banking company. \u201cThe business is really another member of the family as they grow up.\u201dThe Suzuki family transition has been smooth so far. (A younger brother has not expressed interest in the business.) But advisers say that when transitions go smoothly, there has been a lot of planning, a bit of luck or both.\u201cThe challenges are, oftentimes, the kid doesn\u2019t know anything about the business,\u201d said Carl Genberg, national director of business transition planning for Wells Fargo Private Bank. \u201cDoes the kid want to work in the business? To what extent is the kid humoring the parents about wanting to work in the business?\u201dEntrepreneurs who have built companies that touch multiple generations share what they have learned along the way.Jose Der emigrated from Cuba nearly 60 years ago and set up Der Dau, his custom boot-making business, in New York. It counts celebrities and fashion-conscious urbanites as clients.His son Joseph, 44, said he had been groomed since age 8 to take over the business. \u201cI grew up becoming a cobbler and learned all the trades from him,\u201d he said.His two sisters, by contrast, were not interested in the boot-making business, which made the succession decision easier.Still, taking something that his father created and making it his own wasn\u2019t easy at first. \u201cHe\u2019s very old school, very traditional,\u201d Joseph Der said of his father. \u201cI like fashion. I brought out a lot of funny colors, and it took off.\u201dMr. Der said that early on, when he wanted to make the family\u2019s boots less traditional and more fashionable to attract clients like Madonna, he clashed with his father.When his father, who is in his 90s, let him do that, he said he learned a valuable lesson: \u201cIf two people work together and they can kind of compromise with each other, they can work as a great team.\u201dFor a family business to be passed on to a son or daughter, the critical factor is the desire of the child to be involved. \u201cAt the end of the day, it starts with what the second generation wants,\u201d Mr. Genberg said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make something work that doesn\u2019t work?\u201dLiza Towell Boyd, a top equestrian, had success riding other people\u2019s horses since age 10. Her father, Jack Towell, said the family joked that her nickname was \u201ccash machine.\u201d\u201cPeople would send me horses, and she\u2019d ride them and make them famous and I\u2019d sell them,\u201d said Mr. Towell, who owns Finally Farm in Camden, S.C. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get paid, but I could.\u201dWhile Ms. Boyd, now in her late 30s, continues to compete on the national hunter jumper circuit, she has taken on more responsibilities with the family business, from training horses to teaching children and up-and-coming riders.\u201cHe\u2019s my biggest cheerleader in competitions, but also on the business side, too,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need someone there to teach you the ropes and to be honest and to work really hard and be dedicated.\u201dMarried with children of her own, Ms. Boyd said that collaborating with a parent is a life\u2019s work. \u201cThe toughest part is it never ends,\u201d she said. \u201cMy phone is ringing over and over and over again for a question\u201d from her father.\u201cWhen I married my husband I said, \u2018You\u2019re marrying my father too,\u2019\u201d Ms. Boyd recalled. \u201cHe\u2019s the first person to call in the morning and the last person I talk to at night.\u201dDennis Shah started working in his father\u2019s high-end wallpaper business, Chambord Prints, in Hoboken, N.J., straight out of business school in the 1980s. He had a good 20-year run before he realized he needed to take it in a different direction.\u201cWe were a factory, and business started to die out,\u201d said Mr. Shah, 52. \u201cWallpaper was going out of style by 2005. I still had faith in the product.\u201dSo he contracted with several artists to create custom wallpaper, to reinvigorate the company\u2019s product line. \u201cOne of the big things is my father\u2019s way of being able to trust me and being able to delegate and to think strategically,\u201d Mr. Shah said.His father, now 86, said he appreciated his son\u2019s ability to inject a modern perspective. \u201cWorking together, we get ideas from each other,\u201d said H. K. Shah. \u201cI\u2019m a 16th- century person. He\u2019s a 21st-century person. It helps us get better and better.\u201dIn some instances, the child needs to push back. Yuta Suzuki said his father\u2019s vision for their new restaurant was to have a 10-seat sushi bar where he used only the best 30 percent of a fish and served it to be eaten immediately. His son pointed out that this was probably not the best way to turn a profit.So they compromised. The elder Mr. Suzuki controls the sushi bar, but there are two other restaurants within the space \u2014 traditional kaiseki dining and a sit-down sushi space \u2014 to offer different dining experiences and bigger margins.Daisy Medici, a managing director at GenSpring, a wealth management firm, says she encourages families that run businesses to develop voluntary governance policies. \u201cThey need to put policies in place with how they\u2019re going to work together,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have risk management policies, a code of conduct, trust distribution policies, vacation home policies.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a legal document,\u201d Ms. Medici said. \u201cIt\u2019s a morally binding document.\u201dThe likelihood of friction is high, but so is the opportunity to grow closer. The younger Mr. Suzuki, for instance, said that going into the restaurant business helped him understand what his father had been doing all those years. \u201cI never experienced that father-son relationship because he worked six days a week, and then on Sunday he slept because he was so exhausted,\u201d he said. \u201cI got to experience the day with him and the chefs.\u201dNow that he is overseeing Suzuki restaurant, he said, he feels the pride of running something that helps his whole family. Where he struggles is calling himself his father\u2019s boss. \u201cI never pictured that I\u2019d be hiring my father,\u201d he said. \u201cI try not to think of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As for Mr. Almod\u00f3var\u2019s throwdown, it had some unpleasant implications.

Once the movie was shown correctly, it earned an ovation and attendant critical praise on social media.While Netflix garnered controversy without actively seeking it, Amazon quietly took Todd Haynes\u2019s new movie, \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d to the competition. As of this writing, there was no news of either company\u2019s having made major acquisitions at the festival.Efe Cakarel, the founder and chief executive of the streaming service Mubi, which rides hard for cinephile art house fare, told me I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised by this.\u201cThe first few years I came to Cannes, all I did was explain to film producers what streaming video on demand even was,\u201d he told me in a phone interview just after this year\u2019s festival (his 10th). \u201cAnd if you even broached the idea of acquiring rights to first-run movies for streaming, they looked at you like you were crazy.

The 53-story tower, which opened last year, features amenities such as a poker room and an outdoor swimming pool with views of Manhattan.The project was financed with about $190 million in loans, including $50 million through the EB-5 visa program. That program gives foreign investors preferential treatment in obtaining permanent residency, in exchange for investments of at least $500,000 in American development projects.Kushner Companies must repay a $140 million construction loan from CIT Group, which is due in September. It also wants to pay off its EB-5 loans, which are all from Chinese investors, although the loans are not due for several years.A company spokesman confirmed that it was seeking a $250 million loan.A White House official has said Mr. Kushner shed his interests in projects expected to require large transactions with parties that had not yet been identified. It is unclear why he did not divest his stake in the Jersey City building, with the hoped-for refinancing appearing to present similar issues.His stake in various Kushner family projects, with some other investments, could exceed $600 million, according to the government ethics filing. It lists a trust that owns a company called 65 Bay L.L.C., which has an indirect ownership in the building.The money the Kushners seek would allow them to repay lenders and partners and keep about $30 million in cash. The tower was built with only about $30 million in equity from the Kushners and their partners, according to a 2015 presentation by the firm that helped the Kushners secure EB-5 visa funding.The building is now valued at $340 million to $360 million, with more than half the apartments rented, according to a deal summary circulated to prospective lenders in recent weeks.On projects like Trump Bay Street, longer-term financing \u2014 with lower rates \u2014 is typically not available until the building reaches at least 50 percent occupancy, which this one now has.\u201cWe have received overwhelming interest, at our ask, from the pool of lenders that has been tapped,\u201d Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies, said in a statement. \u201cThis is a very successful rental building, which is in high demand in the lending community.\u201dMr. Kushner did divest his stake in Kushner Companies\u2019 troubled headquarters building at 666 Fifth Avenue, which carries $1.4 billion in debt, according to financial data published by Vornado Realty Trust, a partner in the deal.Talks over a possible $4 billion investment in that property with Anbang Insurance Group \u2014 a Chinese conglomerate with political connections to Beijing \u2014 ended in March after Democratic lawmakers wrote to the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and the Treasury secretary, expressing concern that such a deal could breach federal ethics rules.

{"Headline": "After Terror Attacks, Britain Moves to Police the Web", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byLawmakers from across the political spectrum are promoting some of the widest-ranging plans anywhere in the western world to rein in the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter, setting up a likely standoff.On one side are British policy makers and law enforcement officials, who want to crack down on how extremist messaging and communication are spread across the internet. On the other are privacy and freedom of speech groups \u2014 alongside the tech giants themselves \u2014 who say that the government\u2019s proposals go too far.Similar debates are popping up around the world.Now the country\u2019s politicians want to go further.In its electoral manifesto and in speeches by senior politicians, the governing Conservative Party outlined proposals to offer security officials more ways to keep tabs on potential extremists. Theresa May, the prime minister, raised the issue at a recent Group of 7 meeting and in talks with President Emmanuel Macron of France.But if the proposals are pushed through, there will be costs.The Conservatives now rule with a minority in Parliament, and will most likely have to rely on other parties for support. That may necessitate compromise or horse trading.Part of that plan is to demand that companies such as Apple and Facebook allow Britain\u2019s national security agencies access to people\u2019s encrypted messages on services like FaceTime and WhatsApp.These services use so-called end-to-end encryption, meaning that a person\u2019s message is scrambled when it is sent from a device, so that it becomes indecipherable to anyone but its intended recipient.British officials, like their American counterparts, would like to create a digital backdoor to this technology.Yet an opening for intelligence agencies, experts warn, would also allow others, including foreign governments and hacking groups, to potentially gain access to people\u2019s digital messages.It would also most likely induce terrorist groups to move to other forms of encrypted communication, while leaving everyday Britons \u2014 and others traveling in the country \u2014 susceptible to online hacks.\u201cIf the British government asks for a special key like this, what stops other governments from asking for the same access?\u201d said Nigel Smart, a cryptology professor at the University of Bristol. \u201cYou need end-to-end encryption because it stops anyone from listening in.\u201dBritish lawmakers say law enforcement and intelligence agencies need such access to foil potential terrorist plots.But Facebook and others respond that they already provide information on people\u2019s online activities, when required, including the I.P. address \u2014 a pseudo fingerprint for digital devices \u2014 of machines from where messages are sent.And in a letter sent to British politicians in late 2015 \u2014 just as an earlier debate about tech regulation was bubbling to the surface \u2014 Apple made its views clear.\u201cI\u2019d like to see the industry go further and faster in not only removing online terrorist content, but stopping it going up in the first place,\u201d Amber Rudd, the country\u2019s home secretary, said before meeting with tech executives this year. At the time, she called on them to take further steps to counter such extremist material.The British government\u2019s stance has put tech companies in the difficult position of having to determine what should, and should not, be allowed online.Britain\u2019s freedom of expression laws are not as far-reaching as those in the United States, allowing British lawmakers to push for greater control over what is circulated across the web.In recent months, companies like Facebook and Twitter say that they have taken additional steps to remove illegal extremist material from their social networks, and are giving users ways to flag potentially offensive content.Some other European lawmakers have warned that too-strict limits on what can be shared across the web may hamper freedom of speech, a touchy subject for many people who grew up behind the Soviet-era iron curtain.\u201cFor me, freedom of expression is a basic fundamental right,\u201d Andrus Ansip, the digital chief at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said in an interview this year. \u201cNobody wants to see a Ministry of Truth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Reaches Debt Deal for Greece Worth 8.5 Billion Euros", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUXEMBOURG \u2014 European Union officials agreed on Thursday to unlock loans of 8.5 billion euros for Greece, to ensure it meets huge payments on its debt next month.The agreement included formal participation by the International Monetary Fund, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance minsters.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said she was prepared to recommend joining the bailout even though work remained on how to ease Greece\u2019s debt burden. \u201cI hope that the discussion over specific debt relief measures can soon be brought to conclusion,\u201d she said.Ms. Lagarde said she would formally recommend participation in the bailout of as much as $2 billion on what she described as a standby basis.The difficulty in completing a deal has centered on a long-running showdown among creditors. On one side, several eurozone countries led by Germany want Athens to carry out what they view as reforms before specifying debt concessions that could take effect next year at the earliest. On the other, the I.M.F., with policy makers in Brussels and the Greek government, has been pushing for immediate commitments on the details of eventual debt relief.The standoff has highlighted the problems of managing the sprawling 19-nation area that uses the euro, and is occurring despite recent signs that regional leaders had tamed crises that have plagued the monetary union for much of the last decade.On Thursday, Greece was offered bailout money above its immediate needs to service its debt. It also received some clarity about eventual measures to ease its debt burden in the medium term.Those measures included extending the final due dates on some Greek debt for as long as 15 years, to around midcentury, to make it easier to pay.In another concession, the Eurogroup formally agreed to a longer-term French plan to link the scale of Greek bond repayments to the country\u2019s economic growth, though it said details still needed to be fleshed out.While eurozone leaders appear to have avoided the short-term threat of a Greek default, much remains at stake politically for the Greek and German governments.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy and its de facto leader, will hold national elections in September, and its leaders, including the hard-line finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, have shown little desire to be specific about what concessions Greece was promised. Along with their counterparts in the Netherlands, German politicians are wary of the domestic consequences of appearing to ask German taxpayers to foot the bill for largess to Greece.As a result, forgiving even part of Greece\u2019s debt is off the table. Further adjustments to repayments, such as extending the deadline, remain extremely unlikely this year.Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, told a news conference on Thursday that he had agreed to the deal because it offered a degree of guidance on how Greece would bring its debt under control.\u201cIs it as much clarity as the Greek people deserve after all the reforms that have been carried out, and all the sacrifices that have been made?\u201d Mr. Tsakalotos said. \u201cPerhaps not. But we recognize that we do not want the perfect to be the enemy of the good.\u201dCrucially, Greek leaders now want their country\u2019s debt to be eligible for the European Central Bank\u2019s huge bond-buying program. That effort, known as quantitative easing, has sought to inject cash into the eurozone economy and bolster growth. Including Greece\u2019s bonds in the list of loans eligible to be purchased would help restore investor confidence in those bonds.The European Central Bank has said it will consider buying Greek bonds only if it concludes that Greece\u2019s debt load is sustainable.The central bank has not said how it defines sustainable, but a stamp of approval from the I.M.F. is probably a prerequisite.The agreement on Thursday \u201cis a first step toward securing debt sustainability,\u201d said Peter Ehrlich, a spokesman for the European Central Bank. Mr. Ehrlich declined to say when the bank might decide about including Greece in the asset-buying program.Over time, I.M.F. involvement has become a crucial issue, and the fund remains concerned that Greece may never be able to repay its enormous loans, which are equivalent to about 180 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. The fund had been withholding its participation in the latest bailout until European countries offer concrete promises of debt relief.Berlin has dug in its heels against such a promise. It is wary that offering concessions could slow the pace of economic reform in Greece, and fears that such moves could have political consequences in Germany.The debate has increased tensions between Greece and Germany.Ms. Lagarde, the I.M.F. managing director, said her decision on Thursday to approve the money in principle \u201callows for more time for negotiations to be concluded on the required debt relief.\u201dDisbursement of the money would follow only with final agreement on the manageability of Greece\u2019s debt, she said. The pledge by the I.M.F. was important in avoiding \u201cthe crisis that we would have otherwise had mid-July, had this not happened today,\u201d she said.Ms. Lagarde said Greece still had a \u201ccontinued promise of debt relief.\u201d The standby arrangement was \u201ca second-best solution \u2014 and it\u2019s not a bad solution,\u201d she said.James Kanter reported from Luxembourg, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.

{"Headline": "In Texas, Some Rare Good News About Cities With Pension Woes", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDetroit. Stockton. Puerto Rico. The list of places bankrupted by ballooning pension obligations and other debts is growing. But now comes some good news about two cities, Dallas and Houston, that have pulled back from the brink.But instead of going to bankruptcy court, Mr. Rawlings went to Austin, the state capital, to lobby for state pension laws that would stop the bleeding. So did the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, who faced other pension problems and had persuaded the city\u2019s labor groups to agree to concessions worth $1.3 billion over the next 30 years.The resulting legislation \u2014 which essentially averts crises in Texas\u2019 biggest and third-biggest cities \u2014 was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday.Each city had its own bill, because each had its own unique problems. But both bills involve measured reductions in pension accruals for workers and retirees \u2014 mainly in secondary benefit categories like inflation adjustments and lump-sum payouts. In exchange, the pension funds will receive more money from the cities to protect the core benefits.Most important, both bills establish financial benchmarks for the coming years. If the pension funds do not meet them, there will be more benefit cuts, some of which could be steep. The point of this is to keep elected officials from giving the can one good kick down the road now, then declaring victory and turning their backs while the same intractable problems are festering under the surface.\u201cThe key to all this is, not one retiree\u2019s pension check is going to be reduced one penny,\u201d said Ray Hunt, the president of the Houston Police Officers Union. \u201cIt just means that future increases are slowed or stopped. I believe the majority of our members think this is the responsible way.\u201dAs happy as the resolution may seem, the steps that Texas took are illegal in other places where public pensions are imperiling the finances of cities and states. Illinois, California, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Kansas are among the states where, by law, public pensions cannot be reduced \u2014 not even the pensions that current workers hope to earn in the future.That doctrine, known as the California Rule, explains why California cities like Vallejo and Stockton reduced their payments to other creditors when they went into bankruptcy but did not touch their workers\u2019 costly pension plans.Of all labor groups in the public sector, police and firefighters\u2019 unions tend to be the California Rule\u2019s most ardent champions. When Memphis recently tried to scale back pensions, for example, half the police force called in sick and hundreds of others resigned.Police unions in California are now pushing a critical test of the California Rule through the courts, after a lower court ruled that they did not have \u201can immutable entitlement\u201d to the best pension they could hope for, but \u201conly to a \u2018reasonable\u2019 pension.\u201d Final adjudication appears to be many months away.Against that forbidding backdrop, Dallas and Houston show there is still room for compromise (although Houston\u2019s firefighters did withdraw their support for the bill that was just signed into law).Those developments \u2014 and Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy \u2014 have shown that Washington will not bail out government pension funds that go bust; officials had to patch together money from other sources, and even then, the retirees of Prichard, Central Falls and Detroit had their benefits cut. Cuts are expected soon in Puerto Rico, too.Seeing that, and knowing that the doomsday clock was also ticking in Dallas and Houston, made labor leaders in those cities conclude that fighting concessions to the finish would not, in the end, protect their members. The Dallas pension fund was on track to run out of money in 10 years, and Houston\u2019s in less than 15.And in both cities, the police and firefighters have opted out of Social Security, something state and local workers often do in hopes of avoiding the Social Security payroll tax. Federal law allows that, but if a government pension fund collapses, older adults are left without a backstop.\u201cWe have to have a fair pension system, both for us and for taxpayers,\u201d said Mr. Hunt of the Houston police union. \u201cIt\u2019s either that or take a 100 percent pension cut in the future, when you have no pension fund.\u201dJosh McGee, the chairman of the Texas Pension Review Board, a state oversight body, called Houston\u2019s overhaul \u201cone of the most comprehensive I\u2019ve seen in the country,\u201d and all the more notable because the mayor who pushed it through is a labor-friendly Democrat.As for the Dallas pension measure, Mr. McGee called it a good first step.\u201cDallas waited until they were in crisis before they did anything, so it\u2019s really, really painful, and it\u2019s going to take more actions in the future to solve the problem,\u201d he said.Dallas\u2019s measure includes raising the retirement age, slowing benefit accruals, ending most cost-of-living increases and raising each worker\u2019s required pension contribution to 13.5 percent of pay, from 8.5 percent.Importantly, the new law for Dallas also bans the kind of big, one-time withdrawals that caused last year\u2019s run, in which retirement-age police and firefighters stripped about $500 million out of their pension fund, leaving it tattered almost beyond repair.Such lump-sum withdrawals were allowed under a fairly common program known as a DROP, for deferred retirement option program, but they caused a stampede after workers learned that the pension fund had been overstating its assets.The workers started to grab cash for fear that it would not be there later if they waited. Hundreds of people qualified for payments over $1 million each, in addition to their regular pensions.The changes approved Wednesday are not expected to turn the fund around, only to stabilize it. The law calls for Dallas to stress-test the fund in seven years and to make more cuts if it fails. City officials have warned that they may still claw back some of the money people took during last year\u2019s run.On Thursday, Fitch, the credit-rating agency, said it would review Dallas\u2019s rating. The city had been on a watch list for likely downgrades because of pension risks.Houston had different pension troubles, dating to 2001, when officials decided that the bull market of the 1990s justified big benefit increases. The dot-com crash quickly showed that the decision was a mistake, but instead of revoking the increase, the city coped by not making its yearly contributions to the fund.Under the new law, Houston reduces certain secondary pension benefits, like a DROP feature and cost-of-living increases, in exchange for better funding.If costs still keep rising too sharply, the law calls for further reductions. And if that does not work, the system automatically shuts down the defined-benefit plan and switches to a hybrid, called a cash-balance plan.\u201cThat caps the city\u2019s downside risk,\u201d said Mr. McGee, of the Texas Pension Review Board.Advertisement"}

The government now owns about 99 percent of its shares.On Monday, the Irish government said it expected to price the offering of Allied Irish Banks from \u20ac3.90 to \u20ac4.90 a share. That would imply a market capitalization of \u20ac13.3 billion at the upper end of the range.\u201cA successful transaction would represent an important milestone in our journey to dispose of our banking investments and ultimately recover all the money the Irish state has invested in A.I.B.,\u201d Mr. Noonan said.He said earlier that it could take a decade for the bank to be fully privatized.The bank would be the latest in Europe to return, at least partly, to private ownership after needing a government rescue.All proceeds from the Allied Irish offering will go to repay the Irish government. If an overallotment of shares is fully exercised, the offering could raise as much as \u20ac3.8 billion.

{"Headline": "The Past 50 Years of Israeli Occupation. And the Next.", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Six-Day War at 50JERUSALEM \u2014 Three months after the 1967 war, Israel\u2019s ruling Mapai Party held a discussion on the future of the newly conquered territories. Golda Meir, who would become Israel\u2019s leader a year and a half later, asked Prime Minister Levi Eshkol what he planned to do with the more than one million Arabs now living under Israeli rule.\u201cI get it,\u201d Mr. Eshkol jokingly replied. \u201cYou want the dowry, but you don\u2019t like the bride!\u201d Mrs. Meir responded, \u201cMy soul yearns for the dowry, and to let someone else take the bride.\u201dOn this 50th anniversary of the war, it is clear that over the half-century that followed, Israel managed to fulfill Mrs. Meir\u2019s wish, keeping control of the land indefinitely without wedding itself to the inhabitants. This resilient and eminently sustainable arrangement, so often mischaracterized as a state of limbo assumed to be temporary, has stood on three main pillars: American backing, Palestinian weakness and Israeli indifference. Together, the three ensure that for the Israeli government, continuing its occupation is far less costly than the concessions required to end it.Each pillar, in turn, draws support from a core myth promoted by leaders in American, Palestinian or Israeli society. For Americans, the myth that the occupation is unsustainable is a crucial element in maintaining and excusing the United States\u2019 financial and diplomatic abetting of it. From the halls of the State Department to editorials in major newspapers and the pronouncements of pro-peace organizations like J Street, Americans are told that Israel will have to choose, and very soon, to give Palestinians either citizenship or independence, and choose to either remain a democracy or become an apartheid state.Yet none of these groups calls on the United States to force this supposedly imminent choice, no matter how many times Israel demonstrates that it prefers a different, far easier option \u2014 continued occupation \u2014 with no real consequences. The only real fallout from continued occupation are major increases in American financing of it, with Israel now receiving more military assistance from the United States than the rest of the world does combined. Mistaking finger-wagging for pressure, these groups spend far too much time on phrasing their criticism of settlements and occupation, and far too little asking what can be done about it.What supports the fiction that Israel cannot continue subjugating the Palestinians \u2014 and therefore that the United States will not be complicit in several more decades of subjugation \u2014 is a seemingly endless parade of coming perils, each of which, it is claimed or hoped, will cause Israel to end its occupation in the near future.Initially, the threat was of an attack by the Arab states. But that soon crumbled: Israel made a separate peace with the strongest one, Egypt; the Arabs proved incapable of defending even sovereign Lebanon from Israeli invasion; and in recent years, many Arab states have failed to uphold even their longstanding boycott of Israel.Then there was the demographic threat of a Palestinian majority arising between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. But official Israeli and Palestinian population statistics indicate that Jews have been a minority in the territory Israel controls for several years now, and with no repercussions: A majority of the world\u2019s nations still speak of undemocratic rule by a Jewish minority as a hypothetical future, not an unacceptable present.A standoff as Palestinians and Israeli soldiers await the arrival of Palestinian police officers in Gaza in 1994.Later came the threat of renewed Palestinian violence. But Israel, with the strongest army in the region, has repeatedly demonstrated that it can endure and outlast whatever bursts of resistance the divided and exhausted Palestinians can muster.The next threats, too, came up empty. The rise of nominally pro-Palestinian powers like India and China has, to date, had no negative effect on Israel, which has strengthened ties with both countries. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, though noisy on some American campuses, has yet to make a dent in Israel\u2019s economy or its citizens\u2019 self-reported level of life satisfaction, among the highest in the world.Advocacy among some Palestinian intellectuals and their allies for enfranchisement in a single state, the so-called one-state solution, has not been endorsed by a single Palestinian faction and is a long way from drawing majority support in the West Bank and Gaza. If the proposal ever gathered momentum, Israel could easily counter it by withdrawing from the West Bank, as it did from Gaza in 2005.The latest, though surely not the last, in this list of threats is the prospect of political changes within America and its Jewish community. Israel has become a more partisan issue, and polls show a majority of Democrats in favor of some economic sanctions or other action against Israeli settlements. Among American Jews, a growing rate of intermarriage with gentiles is lessening attachment to Israel, and Jewish organizations are increasingly divided over support for the country. Despite such vexation, mainly among liberal Jews, surveys over nearly four decades have shown overall American backing for Israel over the Palestinians only increasing, and none of the hand-wringing has translated into changes in American policy.For American politicians, electoral and campaign finance incentives still dictate a baseline of unconditional support for Israel. The United States has given more than $120 billion to the country since the occupation began, spent tens of billions of dollars backing pro-Israel regimes ruling over anti-Israel populations in Egypt and Jordan, and provided billions more to the Palestinian Authority on condition that it continue preventing attacks and protests against Israeli settlements. And those expenditures do not reckon the cost to American security interests of Arab and Muslim resentment toward the United States for enabling and bankrolling the oppression of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.For the most part, the Palestinians themselves have done much to support the status quo. The myth upheld by leaders of the Palestinian government is that cooperating with Israel\u2019s occupation \u2014 which, in fact, makes the occupation less costly, more invisible to Israelis and easier to sustain \u2014 will somehow bring it to an end. This will happen, the theory goes, either because Palestinian good behavior will generate pressure from the contented Israeli public or because Israel, once deprived of excuses, will be forced by the United States and the international community to grant Palestinians their independence.This is the myth underlying the continued support of the Oslo arrangements long after they were set to expire in 1999. It was also the basis for the two-year plan of former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to build the institutions of a Palestinian state, and for the 12 years of quiescence and close security cooperation with Israel under President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank.A counterpart to this myth, propounded by Israeli officials and regurgitated by American policy makers, is that Israel will not make concessions if pressured but will do so if it is warmly embraced. The historical record demonstrates the opposite.Severe pressure from the United States, including the threat of economic sanctions, forced Israel to evacuate Sinai and Gaza after the 1956 Suez crisis. It also compelled Israel to commit to a partial Sinai pullout in 1975. It made Israel acquiesce to the principle of its withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war, including the West Bank, in the 1978 Camp David accords. And it obliged Israel to reverse its incursions into southern Lebanon in 1977 and 1978.By the same token, it was Palestinian pressure, including mass demonstrations and violence, that precipitated every Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territory. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who agreed to the first Israeli pullouts from parts of the West Bank and Gaza, made his initial proposals for Palestinian self-government in 1989, when he was the defense minister attempting to quash the first intifada. Even Yitzhak Shamir, then the prime minister and a vehement opponent of ceding territory to the Arabs, put forward an autonomy plan for Palestinians later that year.As the intifada developed into an increasingly militarized conflict in 1993, and Israel sealed off the occupied territories in March that year, Israeli negotiators held secret meetings with Palestinians near Oslo. There, they asked for an end to the intifada and soon agreed to evacuate the military government and establish Palestinian self-rule. In 1996, the clashes and riots known as the tunnel uprising led directly to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s promise to negotiate a withdrawal from most of Hebron, which Israel formally committed to do several months later.As bloodshed diminished, though, Israel\u2019s sense of urgency about the Palestinian problem dissipated. No serious proposals for unilateral withdrawal were made again until the level of violence in the West Bank and Jerusalem escalated in late 2015.Finally, for Israel, the most pervasive myth is that there is no Palestinian partner for peace. Palestinians are irredeemably rejectionist, runs this argument; they will not give up on their impossible goals and have never made real compromises, in spite of every generous Israeli proposal. The truth is that the history of the Palestinian national movement is one long series of military defeats and ideological concessions. Each of those slowly moved the Palestine Liberation Organization from rejection of any Israeli presence to acceptance and recognition of Israel on the pre-1967 lines, compromising 78 percent of historic Palestine. For years, the international community bullied and cajoled the P.L.O. to accept a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, the remaining 22 percent.When the P.L.O. finally did so, in 1988, the rug was pulled out from under it. Palestinians woke up to find that 22 percent of the homeland had been redefined as their new maximalist demand. Shimon Peres was among the few Israeli leaders to recognize the magnitude of the Palestinians\u2019 concession. He called it Israel\u2019s \u201cgreatest achievement.\u201dIn the last quarter-century of intermittent American-led negotiations, the powerlessness of the Palestinians has led to still further concessions. The P.L.O. has accepted that Israel would annex settlement blocs, consented to give up large parts of East Jerusalem, acknowledged that any agreement on the return of Palestinian refugees will satisfy Israel\u2019s demographic concerns and agreed to various limitations on the military capabilities and sovereignty of a future state of Palestine.During that time, Palestinians were never presented with what Israel offered every neighboring country: full withdrawal from occupied territory. Egypt obtained sovereignty over the last inch of sand in Sinai. Jordan established peace based on the former international boundary, recovering 147 square miles. Syria received a 1998 proposal from Prime Minister Netanyahu (on which he subsequently backtracked) for a total evacuation from the Golan Heights. And Lebanon achieved a withdrawal to the United Nations-defined border without granting Israel recognition, peace or even a cease-fire agreement.The Palestinians, though, remain too weak, politically and militarily, to secure such an offer, and the United States and the international community won\u2019t apply the pressure necessary to force Israel to make one. Instead, the United States and its allies pay lip service to the need to end the occupation, but do nothing to steer Israel from its preferred option of perpetuating it: enjoying the dowry, denying the bride.This is the first in a series of articles that will examine the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, a half-century on.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Sign of Hope From Mr. Tillerson", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWhen the State Department rolled out its annual human rights report in March, cataloging abuses in countries around the world, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was nowhere to be found. Unlike his recent predecessors, he didn\u2019t introduce the findings at a press briefing; in fact, there was no briefing, just an anonymous senior official taking questions by telephone.Whether this means Mr. Trump himself will now give greater priority to human rights remains to be seen. Still, it seemed a hopeful sign that Mr. Tillerson and Ms. Trump chose to put their own political weight behind the report, and more broadly, the American effort to press other governments to improve anti-trafficking laws and prosecutions. Human trafficking is a 21st-century scourge, enslaving millions of vulnerable people, including many children, in sex networks and forced labor.Such reports, which rank countries in four groups according to their success in combating trafficking, inevitably involve political calculations as officials calibrate the costs of criticizing other governments. This year, the State Department\u2019s least defensible decisions involved excluding Myanmar, Iraq and Afghanistan from an auxiliary list of countries banned under a special law from certain American military assistance because their armed forces recruited child soldiers. Iraq and Myanmar were on the list in 2016; Afghanistan was not. The text of the report mentioned violations by all three countries. In the overall trafficking rankings, the report gave better marks to Afghanistan and Myanmar, while still acknowledging their failings; Iraq was downgraded.Despite the report\u2019s message to China and other offenders and Mr. Tillerson\u2019s and Ms. Trump\u2019s words, the administration\u2019s broader human rights record has been miserable, largely because of the man in the Oval Office. Start with Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of autocrats from Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, blamed for the deaths of journalists and political opponents; Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has jailed thousands of dissidents; and the Philippines\u2019 Rodrigo Duterte, who has killed thousands of Filipinos in a murderous crackdown on drug addicts and dealers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Banks Set to Pay Out Largest Dividends in a Decade", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe passing grades show that the American banking system has sufficiently rebuilt its capital levels since the crippling losses of the 2008 financial crisis while also learning how to effectively plan for another financial catastrophe.The test also paves the way for the banks to pay the largest dividends in almost a decade, a boon for shareholders who have suffered years of sagging returns.The banks have the option of returning up to 100 percent of their profits to shareholders, up from 65 percent last year.Such lavish payouts are exactly what investors had been hoping banks would deliver under a Trump presidency. While the administration has no direct role in the stress test, this year is the first that a Republican Fed governor, Jerome H. Powell, has overseen the process.Mr. Powell, a former private equity executive, has said he wants to phase out the qualitative aspect of the test for certain banks. The industry has complained that this process is overly subjective.This year, only 13 of the 34 banks that participated in the stress test had to undergo the qualitative exam.Previously, banks that had been through some type of scandal leading up to the test often seemed to fail \u2014 like Citigroup, which failed the test in 2014 after costly problems in its Mexican unit.One theory was that the Fed wanted to fail at least one bank every year to keep the industry on its toes.European banks also received good news. Santander Holdings USA, the American unit of the giant Spanish bank, passed after flunking three years in a row. Deutsche Bank, which has also had trouble on previous stress tests, passed as well.America\u2019s biggest banks breezed through the final phase of the Fed\u2019s annual test.The banks wasted no time in rewarding their shareholders.Bank of America, for example, said it planned to increase its quarterly common stock dividend by 60 percent, to 12 cents a share, starting in a few weeks \u2014 a huge increase for a bank whose dividend used to equal one penny in the years after the crisis.The nation\u2019s 34 largest banks have $1.2 trillion of capital cushion \u2014 as measured by their common equity capital \u2014 an increase of $750 billion since 2009.Some of this year\u2019s success may also have to do with practice. The banks have essentially been working for years on how to pass \u2014 planning their capital in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s exam, which tests their ability to weather a major financial shock by running their balance sheets through a series of scenarios.\u201cAfter seven years, at some point, you have to get it right,\u201d said David Wright, a managing director in the bank regulatory practice of Deloitte Advisory. \u201cThis is quite a victory for the Fed to get everyone close to a perfect score.\u201dThis year\u2019s results come during a broad effort in Washington to roll back financial regulation. Banks have argued that micromanaging by regulators, including the Fed, has limited their ability to lend.The Treasury Department and Congress have proposed loosening some stress test rules, including limiting the number of banks that must undergo the tests and giving it every two years instead of annually.\u201cI view this somewhat as a political decision,\u201d Nejat Seyhun, a finance professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said of the stress test results. \u201cPresident Trump wants to reduce the influence of the Federal Reserve.\u201dThe stress tests do not include another important segment of lenders \u2014 so-called nonbank financial institutions, which have taken on a greater role in the mortgage market in the aftermath of the financial crisis.In the last year, there has been discussion among some federal housing agencies, such as Ginnie Mae, to begin testing these nonbank firms to assess their ability to deal with a potential crisis. But the plans have not moved much beyond the discussion stage.Similarly, in a recent report to Congress, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has recommended it be given the authority to examine nonbank mortgage servicing firms that do business with Fannie and Freddie.Some regulators worry that as nonbank firms grow in size, a potential hole is developing in the oversight of the financial system.Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

On either side, the awnings are in Chinese, yellow characters on red and red on yellow, but above Bep Ga, there is only a rectangle of ballerina pink, so pale in the noon sun, it\u2019s almost white.Peer at it long enough, and outlines of old letters start to manifest under the paint: \u201cBubble Tea, Vietnamese Sandwich, Rice Roll, Dumpling.\u201d Trucks unload along this block of tenements overlooking the skinny island of Sara D. Roosevelt Park in Chinatown, leaving buckets of dishwashing powder and boxes of eggs on the curb. But inside Bep Ga, it is pink and quiet.The restaurant, all two tables of it, opened in March. It follows Bep, which started out in 2009 as a Mondays-only pop-up at a coffee shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and now runs five nights a week. Where Bep (which means kitchen) serves a small number of Vietnamese classics, Bep Ga is wholly devoted to chicken (ga). \u201cI like how in Vietnam, you want one dish, you go to one place,\u201d said the chef An Nguyen Xuan, who works the stoves at both spots, Bep Ga by day and Bep by night.A Frenchman, Mr. Xuan spent years in finance before becoming a chef. His parents \u2014 his father is from Thanh Hoa in northern Vietnam, his mother from the city then known as Saigon \u2014 settled in Paris, home to the largest population of Vietnamese in the West, in the late 1960s.Every dish at Bep Ga begins with chicken poached in a hot bath of ginger (\u201clots of ginger, the grandmothers say,\u201d Mr. Xuan said), then slipped in the steamer. The poaching liquid becomes the base for pho, loaded with the rest of the chicken (head, feet), spices that blur the line between flavor and fragrance, and enough fish sauce to give it a satisfying undertone of murk.In intensity, pho ga cannot rival pho bo, which is made with roasted beef bones, demands longer simmering and is, at its best, deeply animal. Set that expectation aside: Mr. Xuan\u2019s version is restorative, light in body and frank in flavor, testifying to the use of the more obscure chicken parts. The noodles are supple, the herbs bountiful, cilantro alongside more emphatic culantro. A hard-boiled quail egg discloses a yolk as heavy as cream. On the side come corners of lime, tiny wheels of Thai bad chiles with clinging seeds and Thai basil, to be creased between the fingers before tossing in.Mr. Xuan\u2019s aunt taught him to make com ga Hoi An, a relative of Hainanese chicken rice, with more herbs and heat. Here, it is a sprawl of turmeric-tinged rice \u2014 cooked in pho broth with kaffir lime leaves for brightness and a spoonful of chicken fat \u201cfor shine,\u201d Mr. Xuan said \u2014 and delicate chicken under whorls of pickled red onions, crispy garlic shards and rau ram leaves with their sunny tang. This is pretty, but the alchemy lies in the humble saucer of nuoc cham, chunky with garlic and ginger. It\u2019s meant to be poured over the rice; I mourned the last drop.The two remaining dishes are salads: pho ga kho, essentially pho with the broth on the side, the noodles and chicken veiled in a sauce in which soy is subjugate to fish sauce and ground ginger, and goi ga, shredded cabbage attended by more rau ram and cilantro, nuoc cham and a squeeze of lime that lets in a little pulp. Both are subdued, but refreshing.All may be chased with cafe sua da, coffee black as coal churned with condensed milk until it tastes of smoke and chocolate, and soda chanh, lime and seltzer with a preserved, shriveled plum sinking to the bottom, leaking salt.The space, once a bakery selling banh mi, has its original floor tiles, studded with pebbles. Diners sit on the kind of faded red plastic stools found everywhere in Chinatown. Vines creep down from above. When the door is open, the breeze catches paper napkins and makes them fly.Under the register, a shelf is lined with bottles of fish sauce (\u201cour salt,\u201d Mr. Xuan said) and muoi chanh ot, a potent blend of lime, salt, chile and sugar, made in Nha Trang, on the coast of southern Vietnam. It\u2019s not to be used recklessly; Mr. Xuan said that he would daub a little on the side to eat with rice. But he offers it because Americans \u201cwill put sauce with anything,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially hot sauce.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of a salad at Bep Ga.

Hong Kong could have only a form of democracy that is acceptable to China\u2019s leaders.More democracy has brought greater transparency, accountability and social justice to our citizens.

As summer recess neared, the legislature\u2019s finance committee had approved only about half of the budgeted projects for the 2017-18 fiscal year.The dysfunction of Hong Kong\u2019s legislature may also be a reflection of frustrations with high-speed growth, which appears to be breeding more inequality.

{"Headline": "Trump Said to Pick Nominees for 2 Positions on Fed Board", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has selected candidates for at least two of the three open positions on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors, according to people with direct knowledge of the decision.The expected nominees include Randal K. Quarles, a Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration, and Marvin Goodfriend, a former Fed official who is now a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University.In picking Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend, President Trump is seeking to install conservative counterweights to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. Both men have expressed reservations about the Fed\u2019s aggressive efforts to revive economic growth since the 2008 crisis.Mr. Quarles would also become a leading figure in the administration\u2019s efforts to roll back financial regulation. He would be nominated to serve as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, with responsibility for overseeing the Fed\u2019s regulatory responsibilities.It is not clear when the administration intends to announce the nominations, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential conversations. Until that happens, it remains possible that Mr. Trump could decide to reopen the search process.Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend did not return calls requesting comment. \u201cWe have no announcement at this time,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman.Mr. Quarles was a lawyer for the financial industry before joining the Bush administration in 2002, first as assistant secretary for international affairs and then as under secretary for domestic finance. After leaving the administration in 2006, he became a partner at the Carlyle Group before helping to found Cynosure in 2014.At the Fed, Mr. Quarles would take the place of Daniel Tarullo, who led the Fed\u2019s push to tighten financial regulation after the 2008 crisis, though he was never formally nominated to serve as the vice chairman for supervision.Mr. Quarles is regarded as significantly more sympathetic than Mr. Tarullo to the industry\u2019s concerns that regulation is overly restrictive, limiting economic growth.One of Mr. Quarles\u2019s major tasks at the Fed would be overseeing the annual \u201cstress test\" of large banks, intended to make sure that they can weather a crisis.But his influence would be constrained, at least in the short term, because Ms. Yellen played a key role in developing those regulations. Ms. Yellen\u2019s term ends in February 2018, creating the next Fed personnel decision confronting Mr. Trump.He left the bank in 2005 to join the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University.Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend have expressed support for the idea that the Federal Reserve should adopt a more formulaic approach to policy-making. House Republicans have proposed legislation that would require the Fed to articulate a policy rule \u2014 a mathematical approach to determining the level of interest rates \u2014 that would limit the role of human judgment in monetary policy.Mr. Goodfriend is also a critic of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases in the wake of the financial crisis. The Fed amassed more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Goodfriend has said that the Fed should not purchase mortgage bonds, because doing so promotes economic growth in a particular sector \u2014 the kind of judgment that should be left to those who determine fiscal policy.The Fed has operated in recent years without a full complement of seven governors. The board oversees regulatory policy, and the governors also hold permanent votes on the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.By law, the Fed\u2019s board must include at least one person with community banking experience, and two of the people with direct knowledge of the process said that a number of candidates with that background have been interviewed in recent weeks. It is not clear, however, where a decision on filling the community-banking governor opening now stands.Binyamin Appelbaum reported from Washington, and Kate Kelly from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Provocative Moves, U.S. Risks Unraveling Gains With China", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 President Xi Jinping of China likes to call his core foreign policy strategy \u201cwin-win.\u201d And President Trump likes to win.So at a steakhouse in a sleek, new hotel in Beijing on Friday, there was a celebration of the most tangible result of the unexpected cooperation that emerged in the first months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency: the lifting of a ban on American beef imports.The event, which included a ceremonial carving of a slab of bone-in rib-eye flown in for the occasion, might have symbolized the promise of a constructive era \u2014 except the Trump administration seemed to forget that the \u201cwin-win\u201d part requires reciprocation, not retaliation.A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, said those actions contradicted the agreements that emerged from Mr. Xi\u2019s meetings with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago in April, among them the decision to lift the beef ban, which had been in place since December 2003. If not reversed, they could have consequences, he said.\u201cWe hope the United States administration could correct its mistakes and bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track of healthy, stable and long-lasting development, so as not to affect bilateral cooperation in other important fields,\u201d he said.The arms sale to Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, was a violation of international law that \u201churt China\u2019s sovereignty and security,\u201d Mr. Lu said, adding that China resolutely opposed it.While administration officials said Mr. Trump had grown increasingly frustrated with China for not putting more pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs, the response showed that officials here, too, were frustrated by Mr. Trump\u2019s lurching strategy and cavalier style of tweeting new policy.The latest steps, analysts said, felt retaliatory, and thus could prove counterproductive.\u201cThe United States has stabbed us in the back,\u201d said Wang Dong, an assistant professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University. He said the sanctions \u2014 the first against a Chinese company for trading with North Korea since 2006 \u2014 would undermine China\u2019s willingness to help resolve the nuclear issue.China has repeatedly said it shares the goal of halting North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, or more broadly ensuring the entire Korean Peninsula is without nuclear weapons. It has also repeatedly maintained that it complies with trade sanctions that the United Nations Security Council imposed in an effort to isolate the North from resources to finance its nuclear and missile programs.The extent of its cooperation, however, is disputed in Washington, even within the new administration. \u201cThe Chinese tried to gauge what were the minimal steps they could take to comply with the resolutions and show they were serious about North Korea\u2019s program,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cAnd they miscalculated.\u201dOfficials in Beijing, however, have puzzled over what they view as conflicting signals from Mr. Trump, like his harsh words on the campaign trail and the personal bonhomie toward Mr. Xi to persuade him to apply a new round of pressure. Analysts have pointed to a widespread confusion over the United States\u2019 approach to North Korea, among other issues.The sanctions against the two Chinese companies were announced in Washington by Mr. Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, only hours before the agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, arrived in Beijing to promote \u201ctasty, wholesome, healthy, safe U.S. beef.\u201d The ban, ostensibly imposed because of concern over mad cow disease, was officially lifted in May and the first shipments have begun to arrive in Chinese supermarkets and restaurants.\u201cWe think there\u2019s an opportunity for agriculture to lead the way in the future relationship of commerce between our two wonderful countries,\u201d Mr. Perdue, the former governor of Georgia, said as he appeared with the new American ambassador, another former governor, Terry E. Branstad, and a handful of hat-wearing cattlemen at a restaurant called Char.The new sanctions targeted the Bank of Dandong and Dalian Global Unity Shipping \u2014 as well as two Chinese businessmen \u2014 who were accused of supporting North Korea through money laundering or illicit trade.The bank, which could find itself cut off from the international banking system, is not among China\u2019s biggest, raising the prospect that the administration could single out larger ones. A woman who answered the phone at the bank\u2019s headquarters refused to respond to a request for comment.Although an outright breach in relations remains unthinkable, given the depth of economic ties, the outward warmth Mr. Trump once showed Mr. Xi seems to have worn out its welcome in China. And it happened much sooner than officials here expected.Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions returned the relationship to normal: strained, with deep issues dividing the two countries.Under Mr. Trump, he said, there was even less room for cooperation than under his predecessor, Barack Obama, who sought to work with China on climate change, for example.\u201cThe latest situation has also illustrated that Trump is a leader without patience,\u201d Mr. Shi said.Javier Hern\u00e1ndez contributed reporting, and Owen Guo and Yufan Huang contributed research.Follow Steven Lee Myers on Twitter and Facebook at @stevenleemyers and Sui-lee Wee at @suileeAdvertisement"}

He invited his neighbors to a barbecue.\u201cHowever, there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritized accordingly,\u201d the police said in a statement. \u201cThe other named man, Rachid Redouane, was not known.\u201dEven so, Prime Minister Theresa May found herself on the defensive on Monday, as rivals challenged her record on security after the third terrorist episode in three months.Mrs. May, who is leading her Conservative Party into a national election on Thursday, held the portfolio in charge of security for six years before replacing David Cameron as prime minister in July, and she oversaw a reduction in police forces, including armed officers, during that time.The Metropolitan Police released photographs on Monday of Mr. Butt, 27, and Mr. Redouane, 30.Mr. Redouane had claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, the police said, and also sometimes used a pseudonym, Rachid Elkhdar.

Then he said, \u2018Look, Ken, where did you get your van from? How much did you pay? Do they do it in automatic?\u2019 \u201dMr. Chigbo knew Mr. Butt only as Abs, the nickname everyone seemed to call him. He had recalled how \u201che would always be in a religious gown to his shins, with tracksuit bottoms and trainers underneath.\u201d But on Monday Mr. Chigbo identified Mr. Butt in a photograph released by police as the same man.The two men met barely a week after Mr. Chigbo moved into the complex three years ago. \u201cHe invited me and everyone to a barbecue in the block\u2019s shared garden green area a week ago,\u201d Mr. Chigbo said. \u201cHe\u2019s a neighbor. I trusted him, we got on.\u201dSarah Sekyejwe, who lives with her husband and children in the newly built row of houses next to the Elizabeth Fry Apartments, said Mr. Butt had moved to the street in 2014 and befriended the local children. \u201cMy daughter says he\u2019s the one who on Halloween would open the door and give them lots of sweets,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd in the summer he put out a table-tennis table and taught the kids how to play.\u201dMr. Chigbo said small groups of three or four \u201cMuslim guys\u201d used to regularly visit Mr. Butt\u2019s apartment. \u201cI found them quite intimidating, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were always in religious robes and wearing red and white checkered scarves wrapped around their heads.\u201dTwelve people were arrested in the investigation into the terror attack, and homes in East London were raided. But on Monday night, the police said that all those in custody had been \u201creleased without charge.\u201dAlthough there has been widespread praise for the professionalism and courage of the armed officers who shot and killed the assailants within eight minutes of being called Saturday night, the country\u2019s broader antiterrorism strategy was questioned.Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, when asked by a reporter if he would support calls for Mrs. May\u2019s resignation over the falling number of police officers, replied, \u201cIndeed, I would.\u201dStung by the criticism just days before a national election that will decide her political future, Mrs. May responded at a news conference. \u201cWe have protected counterterrorism policing budgets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also provided funding for an increase in the number of armed police officers.\u201dA focus on security would normally be expected to help the prospects of Mrs. May\u2019s Tories in the approaching election. But as the investigation builds, so does speculation of potential security lapses that could have been prevented, possibly along with Saturday night\u2019s attack.Late on Sunday, Mr. Corbyn criticized the decrease in the number of police officers since 2010. \u201cYou cannot protect the public on the cheap,\u201d he said.The total number of officers in England and Wales fell more than 19,500 from September 2010 to September 2016, according to the Home Office. Authorized firearms officers declined to 5,639 in March 2016 from 6,976 in March 2010.The government says, however, that the number of armed officers is to increase by more than 1,000 in the next two years, that additional specialist teams are being set up outside London and that there will be 41 additional armed response vehicles.Mr. Corbyn also accused the government of failing to publish a report, undertaken in early 2016, on foreign financing of extremist groups, for fear of upsetting foreign governments, although he himself is vulnerable on security issues.Also on Monday, Mrs. May came to the defense of Mayor Sadiq Khan of London, who has been accused of being soft on terrorism by President Trump. Mrs. May said that she was working closely with the mayor and that he was doing \u201ca good job,\u201d adding, in answer to persistent questioning by reporters, that it was \u201cwrong to say anything else.\u201dOn Monday night, Mr. Khan led a brief vigil for the victims at Potters Fields Park, near the River Thames.\u201cI want to send a clear message to the sick and evil extremists who commit these hideous crimes. We will defeat you,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cas a proud and patriotic Muslim I say this: You do not commit these acts in my name.\u201dRukmini Callimachi, David D.

{"Headline": "Trump Backers \u2018Furious\u2019 That Senator Stood Against Health Care Bill", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Dean Heller\u2019s biting denunciation of the Republican health care bill last week infuriated the White House and helped unravel his party\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act days before a vote was expected in the Senate.America First Policies, a nonprofit group created to back President Trump\u2019s agenda, suspended its advertising campaign against Mr. Heller after he agreed to attend a West Wing meeting on the health bill and after a group of Republican senators in attendance complained about the commercials. But Mr. Heller, perhaps the most vulnerable Republican senator on the ballot next year, has by no means escaped the wrath of Mr. Trump and his vocal supporters, including two billionaire casino magnates, Sheldon G. Adelson and Steve Wynn.On the other hand, Mr. Heller faces enormous grass-roots pressure to stand his ground against the bill. He has clung tightly to his state\u2019s popular Republican governor, Brian Sandoval, a staunch opponent of the repeal who accepted the Medicaid expansion dollars in the Affordable Care Act. More than 200,000 Nevadans have gained insurance through Medicaid since the passage of the health law.What angered the Republican rank and file about Mr. Heller\u2019s critique was not so much his unease with the compromise Senate legislation \u2014 a measure that many on the far right are also displeased with \u2014 but that he would so purposefully undermine the president\u2019s agenda.And it is not just party activists who are displeased with the senator.Mr. Adelson and Mr. Wynn, two of Las Vegas\u2019s leading gambling titans, each contacted Mr. Heller at the request of the White House last week to complain about his opposition to the Republican-written health overhaul, according to multiple Republican officials.One ally of Mr. Heller\u2019s acknowledged that Mr. Adelson and Mr. Wynn were unhappy with the senator at the moment and that their relationship needed some repair work.Both billionaire donors are close to Mr. Trump, a fellow tycoon. Mr. Adelson played a pivotal role in Mr. Trump\u2019s election, showering Republican groups last year with tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Wynn is the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee and oversaw a fund-raiser on Wednesday at the president\u2019s Washington hotel that Mr. Trump said had raised about $7 million for the party committee and his re-election campaign.Earlier that day, America First Policies held a donor meeting for those who were in the capital for that evening\u2019s fund-raiser. Every contributor who raised the issue of the anti-Heller campaign \u2014 an extraordinary offensive against a vulnerable senator in one\u2019s own party \u2014 expressed approval of the attacks, according to an attendee.Ronald M. Cameron, a major Republican donor who gave the maximum $5,400 donation to Mr. Heller\u2019s re-election campaign this year, said he would consider investing in primary race challenges to Republican lawmakers who oppose the health care bill or other White House legislative priorities.\u201cI might support a challenger, and would certainly withhold support from someone that I thought was against Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Mr. Cameron, an Arkansas poultry magnate who donated more than $2 million to committees supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and attended the Wednesday fund-raiser for his re-election.Mr. Cameron \u2014 who was solicited by America First but said he had not donated to the group \u2014 said that he was not familiar with the group\u2019s ads against Mr. Heller, but that he did not object to the idea of publicly calling out lawmakers who oppose the health care bill.They should \u201cshape up or get out of the way,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump himself, while acknowledging the complaints of the Republican senators at the White House meeting, has in other private sessions with his aides and allies made clear that he very much approved of the onslaught against Mr. Heller. At the wedding of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last Saturday and then again in the White House this week, he told advisers that he supported the ad blitz, according to multiple Republican officials who have spoken to the president.Officials with America First insist that Mr. Trump and the White House staff all supported their decision to target Mr. Heller. But there has been some unease in the administration over the strategy, which created a significant rift with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and other Republican senators at the very moment they were trying to forge consensus around the repeal bill.At least one White House official sought to halt the attacks out of fear that alienating Mr. Heller would carry adverse ramifications well beyond the health debate. The Nevada senator is a crucial vote not only in the chamber \u2014 where Republicans have a bare two-seat majority \u2014 but also on the finance and banking committees. The two panels have jurisdiction over legislative priorities like tax cuts and presidential appointments.Close advisers to Mr. Heller say he is open to eventually supporting the legislation, if significant changes are made.Megan Taylor, a spokeswoman for Mr. Heller, did not respond to questions about his call with the casino magnates or the prospect of a primary race next year.In a statement, she said Mr. Heller \u201ccontinues to engage with his colleagues, leadership and the administration to discuss what Nevada needs to see in this bill.\u201d But, she said, \u201cit\u2019s not about Senator Heller getting to a yes; it\u2019s about improving the legislation so that it achieves his goals of lowering costs and protecting Nevada\u2019s most vulnerable.\u201dThe day after Mr. Trump was revealed to have boasted on that tape about sexually assaulting women, a pair of Republican lawmakers in Nevada made a show of abandoning their party nominee at a rally outside Las Vegas. In doing so, Representative Joe Heck, who was running for the Senate, and Representative Cresent Hardy, who was seeking re-election, enraged Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.Both lost their campaigns, making Nevada a rare bright spot in an otherwise lackluster year for Democrats.To Nevada conservatives, it was an instructive moment \u2014 and one they said Mr. Heller appears not to have learned a lesson from.\u201cHe\u2019s making a tragic mistake that I thought had already been learned by the G.O.P. delegation in Nevada,\u201d said Wayne Allyn Root, a conservative talk show host and columnist in Las Vegas. \u201cWhen you abandon Trump, you don\u2019t get one Democrat, but you lose Republicans.\u201dBoth Mr. Root and Chuck Muth, another Nevada-based conservative activist, said they had been inundated with emails and calls from grass-roots Republicans who are angry about Mr. Heller. But whether that fury translates into a viable primary race challenge is far from certain. The senator will have significant financial support from his allies in Washington, and there is no obvious Republican opponent on the horizon. Mr. Tarkanian said he was also eyeing another run for the House seat he narrowly lost last year.Another potential challenger, the state treasurer, Dan Schwartz, said he was likely to run for governor and has signaled to Mr. Heller through intermediaries that he will not take on the senator.\u201cHe will pay some price, but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said, citing the money needed to challenge Mr. Heller. \u201cHe\u2019s in a tight spot, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dire.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financially Ailing CUNY Spent Over $1 Million a Year on Parades and Charities", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat payment, officials said, will be the last in a remarkable spending spree in which the university frequently paid more than $1 million a year to sponsor parades, buy tables at charity galas and civic association breakfasts, and make donations to cultural institutions and other groups.Now, after an internal review, officials at CUNY say the spending was unjustified and conducted without proper safeguards.In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2015, CUNY, the nation\u2019s largest public urban university system, spent $109,925 on sponsorships for parades like the Puerto Rican Day Parade and the Bronx Dominican Day Parade, according to a CUNY spokesman, Frank Sobrino. It also spent $1.3 million for a variety of activities including buying tables at charity galas, making donations to organizations like the New-York Historical Society and Lincoln Center, and attending breakfasts held by the Association for a Better New York or Crain\u2019s New York Business.Since mid-2013, the spending has totaled $4.3 million, according to a summary provided by the university. Most of that spending has now been halted, Mr. Sobrino said.\u201cIt was done without the checks and balances that should have existed,\u201d said William C. Thompson Jr., who became chairman of the CUNY board of trustees last year. Mr. Thompson said that it was acceptable to spend money to promote the university or do outreach at community events and similar activities, but that \u201cspending over a million dollars on things was outrageous, and it made no sense.\u201d\u201cIt was excessive and wasteful,\u201d he added.The changes that the board will consider on Monday, Mr. Thompson said, would put in place more rigorous spending controls, eliminate supplemental salary payments to presidents of CUNY colleges, institute clear accounting requirements for similar payments to other administrators or faculty members and change the way CUNY foundations are managed.\u201cAll of this starts to put us in a place where CUNY can be held up as a national model of transparency and accountability,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re attempting to do.\u201dHe said Jay Hershenson, a CUNY administrator for more than three decades, had been involved in many of the decisions related to spending on activities like parade sponsorships, participation in charitable events and donations.Until November, Mr. Hershenson was senior vice chancellor for university relations and secretary to the board. He is now the vice president of communications and marketing of Queens College, a CUNY school, and a senior adviser to the college\u2019s president.Mr. Hershenson said the parade sponsorships and other activities had been part of a successful outreach effort.\u201cThis contributed to record enrollments at a time when admission standards were raised and concerns were high about access to CUNY for diverse communities,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. He said CUNY\u2019s budget office and the chancellor\u2019s office had approved the spending.CUNY, with a budget of $3.4 billion, has 24 community, undergraduate and graduate colleges with about 272,000 students.Mr. Hershenson led outreach efforts at CUNY for years, with a focus on the immigrant and ethnic populations that make up a large portion of the student body. He also maintained strong relationships with many of the politicians who were crucial to budgeting decisions affecting the university, which receives most of its financing from the state and city.Donations from CUNY when he was an administrator included $35,000 in gifts in the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years to the Feminist Press, a nonprofit publisher affiliated with CUNY. Mr. Hershenson\u2019s wife, Rebecca A. Seawright, a state assemblywoman from Manhattan, is the chairwoman of the Feminist Press.Other donations that came to light during the university\u2019s internal review included a total of $109,000 to the New-York Historical Society in the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years and $15,000 to Lincoln Center in 2015 fiscal year.Research Foundation funds were also used for contributions to other foundations operated by some of the CUNY colleges, officials said. They refused to provide a comprehensive list of the spending, and it was not clear who had approved the use of money from the Research Foundation.The foundation is primarily used to receive and distribute about $370 million annually in federal and state research grants, which have strict rules on how they can be spent. The foundation also receives revenue from interest and rental income on property it owns.The CUNY chancellor has frequently served as the chair of the Research Foundation board of directors, and James B. Milliken was named chairman after he was appointed chancellor of CUNY in 2014. After The Times reported on the link between the Research Foundation and Ms. Coico\u2019s expense payments, Mr. Milliken installed his senior adviser for fiscal policy, Marc V. Shaw, as chairman of the Research Foundation, and subsequently created a task force to recommend financial and management changes, Mr. Sobrino said.Spending on outreach and community relations is common at universities; it is the dimension of the spending at CUNY that has drawn scrutiny.Officials at CUNY said the university would stop sponsoring parades. (The sponsorship of the Pride parade and a $25,000 sponsorship of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade this month were paid before the internal review was completed, the officials said.)Other parades that had regular CUNY sponsorship included Dominican Day parades in the Bronx and Manhattan, the West Indian American Day Parade, the African-American Parade and the Disability Pride Parade.Officials said some activities would continue in a reduced way, like buying a few tickets, rather than a table, for CUNY officials to attend a charity or civic association event. They said spending for those types of activities would be about $682,000 in the fiscal year that ends this month, and about half that in the next fiscal year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toshiba Misses Its Deadline for a Deal for Its Microchip Unit", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company\u2019s admission that it had not completed a deal with its chosen buyers \u2014 a consortium of investors from Japan, the United States and South Korea \u2014 came as an ugly conflict with a rejected bidder, the American company Western Digital, deepened.Toshiba had hoped to present a signed deal to its shareholders at its annual meeting on Wednesday. Instead, executives faced angry investors empty-handed.\u201cOnce again, I apologize deeply from my heart for causing so many problems,\u201d Toshiba\u2019s chief executive, Satoshi Tsunakawa, told hundreds of shareholders who gathered at a convention center outside Tokyo. Reporters were not allowed inside the meeting hall, but some shareholders recorded the proceedings on their phones and provided video to Japanese television networks.Reporters were allowed to listen to an audio feed of the meeting provided by Toshiba. It suggested widespread dissatisfaction with management.\u201cThis has become a third-rate company, but you have no sense of crisis,\u201d one male shareholder, who was not identified, told executives during a question-and-answer period.The buyers Toshiba chose last week include a Japanese government-controlled investment fund, the Innovation Network Corporation; the Development Bank of Japan, a state-owned bank; and the American buyout firm Bain Capital. The South Korean technology company SK Hynix is to provide financing for the deal.The company needs a deal to fill a vast hole in its balance sheet. The losses at its American nuclear power division, Westinghouse Electric, have cast \u201csubstantial uncertainty\u201d over the century-old company\u2019s ability to stay in business, Toshiba has said in financial statements.That has threatened the survival of a sprawling technology giant that has long been a pillar of Japanese industry.\u201cWe are continuing to negotiate with the consortium,\u201d Toshiba said in a news release on Wednesday, \u201cbut coordinating with its various members is taking time, and we have not reached an agreement.\u201dOne factor complicating the chip sale has been Western Digital. The company is an owner, with Toshiba, of a NAND production operation in Japan that is part of Toshiba\u2019s larger microchip subsidiary. Western Digital argues that Toshiba cannot sell the subsidiary to an outside party without its approval.On Wednesday, Western Digital said it had made a renewed offer with its partner in the bid, the American investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. It did not disclose terms, except to say that it was willing to provide Toshiba with debt financing.\u201cWestern Digital continues to believe it is the best partner to advance Toshiba\u2019s legacy of technology innovation in Japan,\u201d Western Digital said in a statement.Two people familiar with the sale process who were not authorized to speak to the news media have said Western Digital is offering less money than the consortium Toshiba favors. That has left Toshiba with a dilemma: accept a lower offer, or take the higher one and risk what could be a long and costly legal fight with Western Digital.Western Digital has asked a California state court to block any sale while also pursuing arbitration in the International Court of Arbitration, based in Paris. A hearing is scheduled for July 14.Toshiba\u2019s countersuit, announced Wednesday, asks the Tokyo District Court to issue an injunction against \u201cacts of unfair competition\u201d by Western Digital and seeks damages of about $1 billion. Toshiba accused Western Digital of improperly obtaining trade secrets from their joint venture and of \u201cintentionally interfering\u201d with the sale of the microchip unit by spreading \u201cfalse claims\u201d about the nature of its contracts with Toshiba.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Cup Rematch Gets a Shot of Youth", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal SportsHAMILTON, Bermuda \u2014 No major international sports event has a longer history than the America\u2019s Cup, which began in 1851. Through all those years of tacks and jibes and sea changes, no helmsman younger than Jimmy Spithill has won the trophy.His record is in danger, however, because Spithill, long the brash leader of the new generation, now represents the old guard in the Cup match that \u2014 wind willing \u2014 was set to begin in Bermuda\u2019s Great Sound on Saturday.But it will also be a new-look duel between Spithill, the 37-year-old Oracle skipper, and Peter Burling, the 26-year-old helmsman for Team New Zealand.\u201cThe skill level of these two is extraordinary,\u201d Ken Read, a former America\u2019s Cup helmsman, said on Friday in Bermuda. \u201cI don\u2019t think pressure will be a factor. Both know how to deal with it, even at Burling\u2019s young age.\u201dThat Spithill is an Australian and Burling a Kiwi gives the competition more edge: Australians and New Zealanders, separated only by the Tasman Sea, relish the chance to get the better of each other in a sporting context.Spithill has had bragging rights for the last four years after leading Oracle to one of the most dramatic comebacks in any sport. Trailing by 1-8 in 2013, Oracle was just one defeat away from losing the Cup, but with the fiery Spithill refusing to acknowledge what appeared obvious to everyone else in San Francisco, Oracle won eight straight races to retain the trophy.The consequences have been far-reaching.Instead of Team New Zealand returning in triumph to Auckland and staging the 35th edition of the Cup in the familiar waters of the Hauraki Gulf, it was forced into a collective soul search, a major budget reduction and a near-total shake-up of its core sailing team, with the emphasis on youth.\u201cThe fact that we are even here is really testimony to resilience as much as anything else,\u201d said Grant Dalton, Team New Zealand\u2019s chief executive.Exit the popular longtime helmsman Dean Barker, who had spent most of his career steering slower monohull yachts. Enter Burling and his Olympic teammate Blair Tuke, who grew up racing extreme, high-performance yachts and who won the Olympic gold medal in 2016 in the 49er men\u2019s class.Burling and Tuke were also in San Francisco for the last Cup as part of New Zealand\u2019s Red Bull Youth America\u2019s Cup team. But they left after the first two races of the match and followed the rest of the regatta and New Zealand\u2019s demoralizing defeat from France, where they were taking part in the 49er world championships.\u201cWe\u2019d watch the coverage at night on television, and you almost went to bed more stressed than you were when you were out racing yourself,\u201d Burling said in a recent interview. \u201cIt was a bit of a shame we couldn\u2019t finish it off, but by the end it definitely felt like it was Oracle\u2019s to lose in those last couple races with how much quicker they were going.\u201cI don\u2019t think any Cup is won by a slower boat, so that\u2019s why all of us have been working super hard this time to try and create a boat that is fast enough to be competitive. That\u2019s all we ask as a sailing team, to have a boat that is fast enough that we can go racing and take on the challenge. As a sailing team, we really back our skills, if we do have an even boat, to go and win it.\u201dIt remains unclear whether one boat will have a decisive speed edge this time. Oracle won both head-to-head races with Team New Zealand in the qualifiers in Bermuda. Finishing first in the qualifiers gave Oracle a 1-point advantage heading into the America\u2019s Cup match. But Cup syndicates, with their large and skilled shore teams, have proven adept at improving their yachts over the course of a 12-day regatta. As Oracle proved in San Francisco, today\u2019s deficit is not necessarily tomorrow\u2019s.\u201cI think you have two of the best teams in the world going head-to-head in a really heavyweight battle,\u201d Spithill said Friday. \u201cAfter this weekend, I think we\u2019ll have somewhat of a read, but I\u2019m expecting it\u2019s going to be one hell of a fight.\u201dTeam New Zealand will start at minus 1, Oracle at zero. The winner will be the first to reach 7 points. In the last Cup, Oracle started at minus 2 after being sanctioned by an arbitration panel. Two races are scheduled for Saturday, and two more for Sunday.\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to matter too much who went into the last Cup a couple points down,\u201d Burling said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t imagine it will matter too much this time.\u201dThe weather could play a role depending on which team turns out to have made the right call on setting up its boat for the prevailing conditions. But Oracle still seems the rightful favorite. It was the first team to set up a base in Bermuda, the remote island group it surprisingly chose as the site for this regatta, largely because of financial incentives. Although Oracle\u2019s owner, the American billionaire Larry Ellison, is no longer as willing to invest vast sums to try to make the Cup a mainstream sporting event, he has been willing to fully finance his team and remains a strong backer, in particular of Spithill, who has faced some resistance from others inside the syndicate.Spithill has been a helmsman in the Cup since age 20, when Syd Fischer, a demanding Australian yachtsman, hired him to lead his Young Australia team. In 2010, Spithill became, at age 30 with Oracle, the youngest helmsman to win the Cup after making the transition from steering monohulls to steering multihulls. He has now had to make another transition to foiling catamarans, which are frequently sailed with both hulls out of the water and can reach speeds approaching 50 knots.Burling has been foiling since he was a teenager. He could have the advantage in reflexes, while Spithill, with his deep experience and gladiatorial instincts, may have the edge in pre-start maneuvering.Off the water, the two men are a contrast in personalities. The red-haired Spithill is an extrovert who embraces news-conference banter and likes to train by boxing. Burling is a more understated figure with the cameras rolling, much more earnest than playful. But he has grown noticeably more confident in his new public role during this regatta.\u201cGood to get a question,\u201d Burling said at Friday\u2019s news conference after a reporter directed one his way after Spithill had fielded several in a row.Burling smiled at Spithill before he answered. Spithill smiled back. But this Cup rematch, for anyone who knows the history, is no lighthearted matter.Advertisement"}

One could tell the Americans and the Europeans at first glance \u2014 the hosts in their shirts and light summer dresses, and the guests wearing sweaters and windbreakers against the ferocious air-conditioning. The main conference room was huge. Not big enough, though. There was a blond elephant inside, and he didn\u2019t go away. His name was Donald Trump.Forty years is a long time. Coming often to the United States, I thought I\u2019d experienced every national mood. I was wrong. I have never seen Americans so self-absorbed. It\u2019s a strange time to be a European in America. Everyone was nice, and some trans-Atlantic topics were on the agenda. But the Americans\u2019 minds were elsewhere \u2014 a few miles to the east, around the White House. They are still trying to come to terms with their new president \u2014 friends and foes, for different reasons. The debate on the future of the European Union, on the third day of our conference, created as much excitement as a math class on a Friday afternoon.Whatever you think of Mr. Trump, he\u2019s an exceptional man, hard to pin down. He\u2019s using his November windfall to do whatever comes to his mind. He\u2019s utterly unpredictable. His supporters enjoy this; his opponents don\u2019t. But everyone is mesmerized. I had thought, perhaps na\u00efvely, that by now the country would have settled down, or at least its most plugged-in citizens. Wrong \u2014 the people I met were every bit at sea as they were seven months ago.We met as President Trump announced he would quit the Paris accord on climate change, and days after he failed to express support for NATO\u2019s Article 5, the commitment to consider an attack on one as an attack on all. Some voters in Arkansas may not care, but most of us at the conference did.I tried to relay what Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric sounds like to a European. Americans may debate the appropriateness of the phrase \u201cAmerica First,\u201d with its quasi-fascist echoes, but Europeans care less about word choice than about the intent behind it. If America is first, will Europe be in second or third place? Or even farther down the list?A new American exceptionalism? More likely, a recurrent American delusion: to be self-sufficient. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that \u201cthe world is not a \u2018global community\u2019 but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage.\u201d Really? How do you think America and Europe \u2014 together \u2014 defeated Nazism and Communism? How they developed and created wealth for their citizens? Helping each other or \u201ccompeting for advantage in an arena\u201d?Maybe this is just rhetoric, and maybe Europeans\u2019 response is more emotional than rational. But when you\u2019ve known someone for 40 years \u2014 it could be a partner, a friend or a friendly nation \u2014 feelings are important. When I think about those feelings, that trans-Atlantic ideal of unity, I think back to the months between Sept. 11 and the ill-fated invasion of Iraq. The NATO nations went into Afghanistan together, stood together against a challenge to our collective security and, more important, values.That feeling faded, but I have always hoped it would return in the face of a challenge: When you share so much \u2014 history and democracy, freedom and the rule of law \u2014 and the world is messy, it\u2019s important to stick together. Traveling in the United States today, I worry that feeling is gone. But then I remember \u2014 I\u2019ve been coming here a long time, for a good reason.The final evening I was talking with a few of my new American friends. \u201cThe United States of America, from time to time, forgets good old Europe and falls in love with new parts of the world,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was Japan in the 1980s, Russia in the 1990s, China in 2000s. Go ahead, have your affairs! But don\u2019t forget \u2014 you\u2019re married to us.\u201dBeppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of 7, the magazine of Corriere della Sera; the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\u201d; and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trauma, Taxes and Trump", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the middle of his speech trashing the climate accord, President Trump suddenly blurted out that his \u201ctax bill is moving along in Congress.\u201d This was something of a surprise since, A) there is no tax bill and, B) nothing is moving along in Congress.\u201cThe most diplomatic thing you could possibly say was, \u2018Wow, that was a real head-scratcher,\u201d said Ron Wyden of Oregon, the leading Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. Diplomatically.The House and Senate come back to Washington on Monday and it\u2019s time to be on guard. I know it\u2019s hard for you to focus on the nation\u2019s legislature when we have an administration that refuses to reveal whether the president believes the globe is warming. But attention must be paid.You\u2019d think the first priority would be passing Obamacare repeal and a new health insurance plan, but it looks like that puppy is never leaving the kennel. This is a wild guess, based mainly on the fact that there are 100 senators, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s been heard saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how we get to 50.\u201dAlso, everybody is going to be sort of distracted, what with the fired F.B.I. director testifying before Congress about whether the president asked him to go easy on the fired national security adviser.So productivity will be less than high. The one thing the Republicans really, really want to do is cut taxes. Well, that and raise the debt limit so the government doesn\u2019t plunge into a giant, calamitous, deadly financial whirlpool and ruin the economy.Of these two priorities, Congress prefers thinking about the tax one. There is bipartisan agreement in Washington that the current tax system, which Wyden likes to call \u201ca dysfunctional, rotting economic carcass,\u201d is \u2026 imperfect.In theory, everyone could get together and come up with a plan to lower corporate tax rates while eliminating special-interest loopholes, make the system simpler for the average citizen and raise the rates on those who have the most ability to pay.O.K., forget the last one.Also, the chances that there will be a big bipartisan deal are somewhat smaller than a premature baby gnat. The last time Congress actually managed that was in 1986. (Really, 1986. It was a great year. Lady Gaga was born. \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d debuted in London. The Dow was hovering around 4,000. Democrats and Republicans went out for drinks together after work.)The Trump administration, however, does have its own plan, which balances tax cuts with the closing of tax loopholes. We know this because Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin testified about it before the Senate Finance Committee last week. So far it\u2019s only one page long, and Mnuchin answered a great many questions by saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question.\u201dPerhaps Mnuchin would have had more detail if he had some help. He doesn\u2019t have a deputy \u2014 there still isn\u2019t a nominee. The last one, Goldman Sachs executive Jim Donovan, withdrew his name from consideration, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.Also, we have a president who refuses to release his tax returns. Totally unfair to keep carping on that now that the election\u2019s over. Except for the part about having a president who refuses to release his tax returns.That was the budget from last week! You remember, the one that counted the same $2 trillion twice? But it presumed the tax cuts wouldn\u2019t add to the deficit, and now that\u2019s apparently back on the table. (The table, Wyden said in a phone interview, \u201cis gonna collapse like some overloaded Thanksgiving banquet.\u201d)The officials who are working for this administration, when they\u2019re not contemplating the ruination of their careers, keep insisting that something great is coming. The tax plan will be \u201cvery detailed\u201d and actually drafted, as opposed to written on the back of a napkin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn told the Fox Business Network. And it will be ready \u2026 \u201cby the end of the summer.\u201dSo what about the thing that\u2019s supposed to be, um, \u201cmoving along\u201d? Could it be just a dumb tax cut for the wealthy? \u201cReform is still part of our agenda,\u201d Cohn insisted.Yeah, and tomorrow the president is going to release his tax returns, after a speech detailing the evolution of his thinking about climate change.Let\u2019s look at this in the brightest way possible. The bad news is that Trump, in a desperate lunge to accomplish something, will try to ram through a quick-and-dirty tax cut that will aid the rich and increase the deficit. Republican administrations that were much saner than this one did exactly that.The good news is that this crowd is so inept it might not work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conglomerates Didn\u2019t Die. They Look Like Amazon.", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThe conglomerate was supposed to be dead, a relic of a bygone era of corporate America. Investors, we have been repeatedly told, want smaller, nimbler, more focused companies.And yet there is Amazon.Amazon is just one of these new-economy conglomerates. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is another. Facebook is quickly becoming a conglomerate, too.That is very likely true of today\u2019s tech-enabled conglomerates, too, which are spending, and often losing, tens of billions of dollars annually on all sorts of projects and acquisitions that may or may not turn out to be successful. But investors are seemingly willing to give these new behemoths a free pass in the name of growth and innovation \u2014 until they aren\u2019t.If there is any lesson from the last breed of industrial conglomerates, it is that there is a natural life cycle to most of them.The model begins like this: A company that is successful in one area turns itself into a conglomerate by using its free cash flow to finance the development or acquisition of businesses in other areas \u2014 at first, ones that are similar to their current business, and later often ones that are farther afield. And then the company does this again and again.When such an economic machine works, it works extraordinarily well. But when any one of the major levers in the machine breaks or even stalls, the entire enterprise comes under pressure. Shareholders start complaining that the sum of the parts would be worth more separately than together.The company\u2019s $13.4 billion deal for Whole Foods is the latest signal of Amazon\u2019s ambitions to have a hold on nearly every facet our lives \u2014 like the computer servers that power our favorite websites and the food we eat.\u201cYou look at companies that got really big in the world, the record is not very good,\u201d Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway \u2014 the world\u2019s largest conglomerate \u2014 told investors several years ago.His business partner, Warren Buffett, stunned shareholders this year when he suggested that he expected shares of Berkshire to rise immediately after his death because of speculation that the company would be broken up and thus would be worth more. (He and Mr. Munger both believe that Berkshire is better off intact, but Mr. Buffett thinks investors\u2019 knee-jerk reaction will be to believe the opposite.)When it comes to Amazon (or Alphabet, or any of the new conglomerates), the question is whether there is something fundamentally different about these businesses given their grounding in digital information \u2014 especially as they expand into complex brick-and-mortar operations like upscale supermarkets.In an age of big data and artificial intelligence, are businesses that look disparate really similar? And can one company\u2019s leadership really oversee so many different businesses? When does it become too big to manage?Google\u2019s own internal list of top-10 principles seems to include an anti-conglomerate provision: \u201cIt\u2019s best to do one thing really, really well.\u201dLeaving aside the question of whether that maxim may have been more suitable to the Google of a decade ago, it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped the company from jumping into all sorts of businesses outside its flagship search and advertising business. Some of these businesses \u2014 which include Android, YouTube, Waze, Nest Labs, self-driving cars and internet distribution \u2014 have been more successful than others. Most of these were brought under the Google umbrella through acquisition, evidence of how the company has used the enormous proceeds of its advertising business to subsidize its entrance into all sorts of other enterprises.Facebook, too, is expanding its offerings through acquisition, buying Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR. And for now, there are no obvious signs that looking after a wider array of businesses is weakening the management at Alphabet, Facebook or, for that matter, Amazon.\u201cThe economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote. \u201cUnder these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational \u2014 even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.\u201dEven more provocatively, she contends that Amazon\u2019s role as both a distributor and cloud provider for many of its competitors gives it an unfair advantage. \u201cThis dual role also enables a platform to exploit information collected on companies using its services to undermine them as competitors,\u201d Ms. Khan wrote.Amazon has thus far been left alone by regulators because it has helped reduce prices of most products. It is not a natural monopoly. \u201cCan prices ever be \u2018too low\u2019?\u201d the Federal Trade Commission asks on its website. \u201cThe short answer is yes, but not very often.\u201dThat may be true. But in Amazon\u2019s case, it has the potential to become so dominant in so many areas that its impact could be more than simply lowering prices for consumers; it could put large companies out of business.Were that to happen, this new breed of Silicon Valley conglomerates may become more powerful \u2014 and resilient \u2014 than the 20th-century conglomerates of yore.If Amazon were to use its acquisition of Whole Foods, along with the profits from its other businesses, to lower prices so much that it put out of business a company like Walmart, with its 1.5 million United States employees, would that be a good outcome? Or is that just a natural part of capitalism?The view of Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is clear. The man who is assembling the 21st century\u2019s most fearsome new conglomerate once explained his view of competition this way: \u201cYour margin is my opportunity.\u201dAn earlier version of this column incorrectly included a distinction awarded to Michael C. Jensen, a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School. He is not a Nobel laureate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amid Subway Crisis, Cuomo Taps an Old Hand to Head M.T.A.", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe surprise, after-hours announcement was approved late on Wednesday by the State Senate after its Finance Committee voiced its support at an impromptu meeting in the Capitol, during which Mr. Lhota \u2014 speaking over Skype \u2014 expressed his frustration with problems with the city\u2019s subways.\u201cI know the M.T.A. can do a lot better,\u201d he said.As New Yorkers reach a breaking point over the constant subway delays, Governor Cuomo has moved this week to strengthen his grip on the transportation authority, which runs the city\u2019s transit system.But there is a catch: Mr. Cuomo already controls the agency, and has been calling the shots there for some time.Board members urged Mr. Cuomo to focus on more pressing issues, including releasing a comprehensive plan to fix the creaky subway system and securing funding for the improvements.Instead of an increase in the governor\u2019s power, the board needs independence, Ms. Vanterpool said.\u201cWe need to ensure the decisions we\u2019re making are on behalf of the public that we serve and not caught up in this political process that we\u2019re often hampered by,\u201d Ms. Vanterpool said.James E. Vitiello, a board member from Dutchess County, said he did not understand why Mr. Cuomo was suddenly trying to change the board\u2019s structure when he had dallied for so long \u2014 nearly five months \u2014 in naming a permanent leader to run the agency.\u201cThat just makes no sense to me,\u201d Mr. Vitiello said.Scott Rechler, a new board member appointed by the governor, defended Mr. Cuomo\u2019s legislation. Mr. Rechler said the governor wanted to take full responsibility for the agency \u2014 and its challenges. \u201cLet him put 100 percent of his political capital, his expertise, his energy, his relationships into fixing something that is immensely broken,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Cuomo has already exerted a great deal of influence over the authority. He took an active role in the completion of the Second Avenue subway and presided over its lavish opening. He has pressed for electronic tolling at bridges and tunnels and a project to add a track on the Long Island Rail Road.But only recently has he started focusing to a significant degree on the dismal performance of the subway system as riders have begun to accuse the governor of ignoring their plight.The authority\u2019s last chairman and chief executive, Thomas F. Prendergast, stepped down in January. The agency\u2019s interim executive director, Veronique Hakim, interviewed for the top job, but Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office apparently opted to go with a proven asset in Mr. Lhota. It was not clear if Mr. Cuomo still intended to create a separate position of chief executive, and if so, if Ms. Hakim would be considered for it.Ms. Vanterpool said board members were often left out of key decisions, including the Long Island Rail Road\u2019s recent move to offer discounts to riders who are diverted during repairs at Pennsylvania Station in New York this summer. The railroad announced the discounts on Tuesday, a day after Mr. Cuomo called for them in a speech.On Wednesday, Ms. Trottenberg said that the governor had already been \u201chands-on\u201d at the authority and that the city and the mayor also wanted to have a voice in the transit system. She declined to comment on the governor\u2019s push to add two board members, but she had urged Mr. Cuomo to pick a leader for the authority.Hours later, the governor chose Mr. Lhota, who said he wanted to hire an executive director to run the agency on a daily basis.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of basic work we have to get done,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He spoke about his earliest days in the business and why he forced himself to learn every country and its capital (\u201cI started worrying about Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d). These are edited excerpts from the conversation.In \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d you manage to find humor in comas and 9/11. What\u2019s so funny about great pain?Well, in stand-up, there\u2019s that idea that comedy comes from a dark place, but it\u2019s not a rule. There are so many brilliant people that have functional, normal childhoods, you know? Seinfeld is the No. 1 exception to all those rules about comedy, that you have to have a neglectful parent or something. Having said that, the rule works for me [laughs].

Do you remember your worst night?Oh, there are so many of them. In the beginning, there are endless amounts of worst nights. But there was one, after \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d had been on for a year, out at the University of Florida\u2019s Gator Growl. It\u2019s in the stadium, like, 30,000 people, Dave Chappelle, Larry the Cable Guy and me. Five minutes in, I heard a woman yell out, \u201cYou better start getting funny.\u201dAnything you miss about those early days?There was something gratifying about going up onstage in front of a room full of total strangers. They\u2019ve never seen you in their life, and they\u2019re kind of like, who is this guy? And then you win that crowd over. That will never happen again, only because somebody in the audience has seen me. Seinfeld said, they give you the first 10 minutes if you\u2019re well known. But you still gotta be funny.Are there stand-ups now where you go, \u2018Wow, I wish I could do that?\u2019Yes. Dave Attell. Louis C.K. I just wish I had the balls to do some of the stuff they do, and be able to make it funny. There would be times when I was coming up with a bit and I\u2019d do it onstage, and I could just feel that, mmm, that\u2019s not me. I\u2019ll have to give that to Dave Attell. You\u2019re doing more roles that mix drama and comedy. Who do you think does that well?If you want to pick the biggest turn of all, it\u2019s Bryan Cranston, who went from \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d to \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d I just saw \u201cWakefield,\u201d where he\u2019s hiding from his family in his attic for a year. Who\u2019s done a bigger twist than that, right? And then Louie Anderson in \u201cBaskets,\u201d playing Zach Galifianakis\u2019s mother.Your character in \u201cGet Shorty\u201d is a largely unsuccessful producer who still has specific ideas on how to make it in Hollywood. What\u2019s the worst advice you\u2019ve gotten about the business?In the beginning of \u201cRaymond,\u201d I think someone said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just write it yourself?,\u2019 as opposed to shopping it around and finding [showrunner] Phil Rosenthal. If I had followed that advice, we\u2019re not here.When you first started taking on dramatic roles, what was your biggest worry?You wonder, are you any good? It\u2019s just doubt, that\u2019s the biggest thing. The desire is there. But then I also want to be a pro golfer, and that\u2019s never gonna happen.You still have worries like that?Oh yeah.

{"Headline": "What a Bipartisan Paid Leave Plan Might Look Like", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWork-Life BalancePaid parental leave seems as if it has at least a chance of becoming reality in the United States for the first time. But agreeing on the policy\u2019s details would require many compromises from all involved.The plan, which the group presented to Ivanka Trump at the White House on Monday, would give all new parents, including fathers and gay and adoptive parents, eight weeks of job-protected paid leave. They would receive 70 percent of their pay up to $600 a week, financed partly by a small increase in payroll taxes and partly by cuts in government spending.The group\u2019s directors were Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank, and Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow at Brookings, a center-left think tank.They\u2019re doing it now because paid leave has become a paradox: Large majorities of Americans say they support it, yet legislation has never gone anywhere in Congress. Now could be different because for the first time, a Republican administration is backing it. The group\u2019s final proposal is a rare bipartisan compromise: less generous that what Democrats in Congress have proposed or what many other countries offer, and more generous that what Republican lawmakers have proposed.The administration considered its proposal to be a first step, and is meeting with members of Congress and outside groups on both sides of the issue to devise a final policy, a White House spokesman said. Ms. Trump and her aides said in the meeting Monday that they were not committed to financing it through unemployment insurance reform and were open to other methods, according to the experts who attended.The sticking point, though, is likely to be whether a leave policy raises workers\u2019 taxes.The group of experts said the most realistic option to keep the plan budget-neutral would be a combination of a tax increase on employees and cuts in government spending in areas that benefit high earners, though many of them initially rejected the tax increase.In general, Republicans \u201csimply didn\u2019t want a new payroll tax or a new entitlement, but they came on board if we said this will be matched by spending cuts elsewhere,\u201d Ms. Mathur said. Also, they supported the idea of workers paying to earn the benefit.The research group considered those ideas and others, but most members rejected them for various reasons, including:The group\u2019s final proposal would cover only new parents, not people who need to recover from an illness or care for a family member, as proposals in Congress would do.Though there\u2019s general agreement in Congress on the need for paid leave, there is still a lot of ground between the two parties\u2019 ideas for it. The Democrat-backed Family Act would provide 12 weeks of family and medical leave by raising payroll taxes for employers and employees by about $2 a week for a typical worker. The Republican-backed Strong Families Act would give tax credits to companies that provided at least two weeks of paid leave.\u201cNobody\u2019s entirely happy with the entire plan, but it\u2019s the only thing everybody could come on board for,\u201d Ms. Mathur said. \u201cThere are two ends and we tried to find a middle ground.\u201dFinding a middle ground in Congress, however, often proves to be more difficult.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reviving a Lost Language of Canada Through Film", "Date": "2017-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHIELLEN, British Columbia \u2014 Speaking Haida for the first time in more than 60 years looked painful. Sphenia Jones\u2019s cheeks glistened with sweat, and her eyes clenched shut. She tried again to produce the forgotten raspy echo of the Haida k\u2019, and again she failed. Then she smiled broadly.\u201cIt feels so good,\u201d Ms. Jones, 73, said. \u201cMainly because I can say it out loud without being afraid.\u201dLike 150,000 indigenous children across Canada, Ms. Jones was sent far from home to a residential school to be forcibly assimilated into Western culture. There, any trappings of her native culture were strictly forbidden. When a teacher caught Ms. Jones learning another indigenous language from two schoolmates, Ms. Jones said, the teacher yanked out three fingernails.It worked: Ms. Jones spoke nothing but English, until recently, when she began learning her lines in the country\u2019s first Haida-language feature film, \u201cEdge of the Knife.\u201dWith an entirely Haida cast, and a script written in a largely forgotten language, the film reflects a resurgence of indigenous art and culture taking place across Canada. It is spurred in part by efforts at reconciliation for the horrors suffered at those government-funded residential schools, the last of which closed only in 1996.Restoring the country\u2019s 60 or so indigenous languages, many on the verge of extinction, is at the center of that reconciliation.The loss of one language, said Wade Davis, a University of British Columbia anthropology professor, is akin to clear-cutting an \u201cold-growth forest of the mind.\u201d The world\u2019s complex web of myths, beliefs and ideas \u2014 which Mr. Davis calls the \u201cethnosphere\u201d \u2014 is torn, just as the loss of a species weakens the biosphere, he said.A Haida glossary dedicates three pages to words and expressions for rain.\u201cEnglish cannot begin to describe the landscape of Haida Gwaii,\u201d the Haida homeland, Mr. Davis said. \u201cThere are 10,000 shades of nuance and interpretation. That really is what language is.\u201dFewer than 20 fluent speakers of Haida are left in the world, according to local counts. For the Haida themselves, the destruction of their language is profoundly tied to a loss of identity.\u201cThe secrets of who we are are wrapped up in our language,\u201d said Gwaai Edenshaw, a co-director of the film, who like most of the cast and crew grew up learning some Haida in school but spoke English at home.\u201cIt\u2019s how we think,\u201d he continued. \u201cHow we label our world around us. It\u2019s also a resistance to what was imposed on us.\u201dMr. Edenshaw was a co-writer of the script for the 1.8 million Canadian dollar ($1.3 million) film, which is set in Haida Gwaii \u2014 an archipelago of forested islands off the west coast of Canada \u2014 during the 1800s. It tells an iconic Haida story of the \u201cwildman,\u201d a man who is lost and becomes feral living in the forest. In this version, the wildman loses his mind after the death of a child, and is forcibly returned to the fold of his community in a healing ceremony.The script was translated into two remaining, distinct dialects of the language: Xaad Kil and Xaayda Kil. None of the stars are conversant in either dialect. The crew held a two-week language boot camp in April so cast members, who also have little or no acting experience, could learn to pronounce their lines before filming started in May.\u201cI\u2019m not used to using my mouth like that,\u201d said William Russ, 37, who sat on the floor of a long house.At his feet was a black speaker, which replayed the recording of a Haida elder saying a line that in English seemed to capture his predicament: \u201cYou are so careless, Aditsii. Everything is crumbling around you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like we learned from the ravens and birds \u2014 all those clicking sounds,\u201d Mr. Russ said.But that political and cultural resurgence has not spread to the Haida language, despite many grass-roots efforts.\u201cThe language was dying before me,\u201d said Diane Brown, 69, the archipelago\u2019s best-known language advocate, who started to teach Haida in schools in the 1970s. \u201c The elders would say: \u2018What will we call ourselves, if we don\u2019t speak Haida? Who is going to talk to the ancestors?\u2019\u201dIn 1998, Ms. Brown helped found the Skidegate Haida Immersion Program to teach the southern dialect, but the program\u2019s focus quickly shifted to preservation, drawing elderly speakers to record commonly used phrases and lessons onto thousands of audiotapes.Each death meant one fewer person to practice with. But tentative learners have also faced local resistance, said Jaskwaan Bedard, who has worked for 14 years to be \u201capproaching fluency.\u201d She is finishing her degree to teach Haida-as-a-second-language classes in local high schools.\u201cHow the language was lost was very traumatic,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the barriers \u2014 working through the trauma.\u201dUnrelated to any other language, its grammar is complex and its structure polysynthetic; a verb conveys not just action but a wealth of other information. Then there is basic pronunciation. Haida has some 35 consonants and two tones. There are 20 sounds that do not exist in English.\u201cIf you don\u2019t speak it, you lose the hollow in the side of your cheek,\u201d Ms. Jones said, inserting the lid of a pen into her mouth so she could produce the Haida \u201chl.\u201dBut the casts of \u201cAtanarjuat\u201d and of Mr. Kunuk\u2019s subsequent films were fluent in Inuktitut, one of three indigenous languages still widely spoken in Canada.\u201cWe financed enough to produce the film,\u201d said Jonathan Frantz, the producer and director of photography, who works for Mr. Kunuk\u2019s production company, Kingulliit Productions. \u201cThere\u2019s no extra money for language-learning. That is a $100,000 multiyear project on its own.\u201dIf delivering the lines proves too difficult for some cast members, he will resort to adding them in later, he said. But ultimately, the movie is \u201cabout sustaining the language and culture through authentic representation.\u201dIn Haida Gwaii, the film is a desperately needed boost to the economy on the reserves, where unemployment is estimated at 70 percent.Local builders constructed a long house on the site of an old traditional village where the film is being shot. Local weavers made the costumes. A Haida artist tattooed clan crests on the chests and arms of willing actors in the traditional stick-and-poke fashion.A local musician, Vern Williams, was hired to create songs for the film. During the evenings of the language camp, he pulled out his guujaaw \u2014 drum \u2014 and filled the long house with his low, mournful voice.Mr. Williams, 58, spent seven terrible years in a residential school.\u201cI don\u2019t call this reconciliation,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething was taken. We are taking it back.\u201dThe commission called on the government to invest heavily in the revitalization of indigenous languages, noting it spends just 9.1 million Canadian dollars on programs supporting dozens of them each year, compared with 348.2 million Canadian dollars on the country\u2019s two official languages, French and English.In December, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government increased annual funding for indigenous languages to 23 million Canadian dollars and promised to introduce an Indigenous Languages Act to protect them. To date, that has not happened.\u201cThis is fundamental to our survival as indigenous people,\u201d said Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, which represents 634 reserves in Canada. He was optimistic that the law would be introduced in summer next year, and come with \u201cas much resources to promote the languages as they did to kill them.\u201dAfter a long day of stumbling over pronunciation, Mr. Russ, one of the actors, sat by the wood stove with his script open on his lap, enjoying Mr. Williams\u2019s music for a moment. He had circled every line he found difficult, which were all 37.His relaxation did not last long. \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel overwhelmed,\u201d he said, heading outside to practice.Two weeks was not enough to learn pronunciation, let alone memorize his lines. Then, he had to learn how to act.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Playing Tricks With Dodd-Frank", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWhen President Trump vowed in January to do \u201ca big number on Dodd-Frank,\u201d the post-crisis law passed in 2010 to rein in Wall Street, it was possible to hope, however na\u00efvely, that he would offer alternative bank reform. During the campaign, he denounced Wall Street for having \u201crobbed our working class,\u201d a reference to the jobs, wages, savings and home equity wiped out in the financial crash. In addition, both Mr. Trump and the Republican platform called for a modern version of Glass-Steagall, the law, repealed in 1999, that had separated staid commercial banking from risky investment banking.The review calls for weakening many of the law\u2019s central provisions and offers no alternatives. The rollbacks include loosening restrictions on bank traders, easing up on annual stress tests of a bank\u2019s ability to withstand financial shocks, and advising regulators to rethink capital levels that big banks find onerous but that should be higher to make sure banks can absorb losses without bailouts.The new proposals will bolster the profitability of banks, at least in the short run, because riskier products and practices generate higher returns.The report also notes that Dodd-Frank has imposed high compliance costs on smaller banks that played no role in the crisis but must adhere to many of the law\u2019s provisions. True, but it is not necessary to roll back the rules on big banks to give small banks relief.The Treasury report has none of those proposals\u2019 analytical rigor. Rather, it is designed to please the banks. The Americans for Financial Reform, a watchdog group, plans to release a paper showing that the Treasury review endorses almost two-thirds of specific deregulatory requests submitted to the Treasury in May by the Clearing House Association, a big bank lobby.Only Congress can repeal Dodd-Frank, and while House Republicans have passed a bill to undo much of the law, it is unlikely to pass in the Senate, where it would need Democratic support. But the administration can weaken Dodd-Frank by neutering the rules that carry it out. We went from the repeal of Glass-Steagall to the financial crisis in less than 10 years. It is, sadly, safe to say that we can start counting down to the next crisis now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Helmut Kohl, Chancellor Who Reunited Germany, Dies at 87", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHelmut Kohl, a towering postwar figure who reunified Germany after 45 years of Cold War antagonism, propelled a deeply held vision of Europe\u2019s integration and earned plaudits from Moscow and Washington for his deft handling of the fall of the Berlin Wall, died on Friday at his home in Ludwigshafen, Germany, the Rhine port city where he was born. He was 87.\u201cWe mourn,\u201d his party, the Christian Democratic Union, said on Twitter in announcing his death.With his diplomacy, resolve and readiness to commit huge sums to ending his country\u2019s division, Mr. Kohl was remembered by many as a giant of epochal times that remade Europe\u2019s political architecture, dismantled the minefields and watchtowers of the Iron Curtain and replaced the eyeball-to-eyeball armed confrontation between East and West with an enduring, if often challenged, coexistence between former sworn foes.A physically imposing man \u2014 he stood 6 feet 4 inches and weighed well over 300 pounds in his leadership years \u2014 Mr. Kohl pursued his and his country\u2019s political interests as Germany\u2019s chancellor with persistent, even stubborn, determination. He could be \u201can elephant in a china shop,\u201d as he described himself, and he overcame European opposition to unification the same way he handled political opposition at home: by the force of a jovial yet dominating personality.Germany in particular faced the challenge of engaging with a formerly dictatorial, Soviet-backed East and welding it to a prosperous West that drew its support from Western allies. Between the two lay a gulf of mistrust.Unlike many Germans, Mr. Kohl never shied from expressing pride in what he often called \u201cthis, our Fatherland,\u201d even when the phrase unsettled many who had suffered at his country\u2019s hands in World War II. In dealing with the legacy of Germany\u2019s Nazi past, Mr. Kohl, who was a 15-year-old member of the Hitler Youth when the war ended, invoked what he called \u201cthe absolution of late birth\u201d so often as to offend some listeners.A politician most of his adult life, Mr. Kohl was chancellor for 16 years starting in 1982, longer than any German leader since Bismarck. He ruled the Christian Democratic Union as if it were his fief.His political career ended with defeat, however, in elections in 1998, and his legacy was later clouded by disgrace over a party fund-raising scandal.Even so, that was not the image that emerged in the many tributes offered on Friday.\u201cWe feel that a life has ended and he who lived it will go down in history,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel said, her voice shaking. \u201cIn this moment, I am thinking with great respect and great gratitude on that life and work.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt will take some time before we realize what we have truly lost.\u201dIn his later years Mr. Kohl was seen as a diminished figure, infirm and in a wheelchair after a fall resulted in a head injury in 2008 that made speech difficult for him. Far from focusing on his achievements as one of Europe\u2019s dominant statesmen, critics raked over his private life. His first wife, Hannelore Kohl, committed suicide in 2001, ostensibly because of a rare allergy to light, which had forced her into a nocturnal existence.In 2008, shortly after his fall, Mr. Kohl announced his intention to marry a companion, Maike Richter, 35 years his junior and a former economic adviser in the chancellery. She was later accused of limiting access to him and his archives.After the war, he spent his entire political life in the new Christian Democratic Union of Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhard. Like them, he made his overriding goal the rebuilding of Germany within a united Europe.Aware that Germany could be reunified only with the support of both the United States and the Soviet Union, Mr. Kohl formed close ties with the elder President George Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He also befriended President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of France, who helped him overcome the apprehensions of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain.In a memoir, Mr. Kohl quoted Mrs. Thatcher as saying just after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: \u201cTwice we defeated the Germans! Now they\u2019re back again.\u201dIn 1985, to mark the 40th anniversary of the Nazis\u2019 defeat, Mr. Kohl insisted that President Ronald Reagan visit a German military cemetery in Bitburg, even after it was discovered that members of the Waffen-SS, the Nazi paramilitary force that carried out the Holocaust, had been buried there alongside ordinary German soldiers.American officials sounded out Mr. Kohl about letting the president off the hook, to no avail, according to former Secretary of State George P. Shultz.\u201cPresident Reagan was deeply affected by the strength and vehemence of Kohl\u2019s views,\u201d Mr. Shultz wrote in his memoirs. \u201cKohl was adamant. He had a choice, Kohl said: President Reagan could go to Bitburg, or he could cancel and see the Kohl government fall.\u201dThe president went to the former Nazi concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen and then, without regrets, to Bitburg. But Mr. Shultz observed, \u201cKohl\u2019s unbending iron will did seem to demonstrate a massive insensitivity, on the one hand, to the troubles he was causing Ronald Reagan and, on the other, to the trauma this episode caused in the Jewish community around the world and, beyond the Jewish community, to all who remembered the Holocaust and its horrors.\u201dMr. Kohl was a German leader who could identify with the young men, some buried at Bitburg, who had been swept up by the Nazi war machine, and he was proud of his provincial roots in the nearby Palatinate region, close to the French border. After rising to the chancellor\u2019s office in 1982, he won four elections in a row \u2014 two as chancellor of West Germany and two after it absorbed the Communist German Democratic Republic. But he lost the fifth, in 1998, when the Social Democrats returned to power under Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.A year later, German prosecutors discovered a network of secret bank accounts and charged Mr. Kohl with using them to hide illegal contributions to his party. Expressing regret for \u201cmistakes,\u201d Mr. Kohl refused to disclose the names of any donors, even after a parliamentary inquiry was begun. In early 2001, Mr. Kohl paid a fine of more than $100,000 to end a criminal case against him and left Parliament the next year.Months earlier, though, potential successors had begun to circle, sensing that the scandal had stripped away Mr. Kohl\u2019s hallmark mantle of political invulnerability. In December 1999, Ms. Merkel, one of his Christian Democratic Union prot\u00e9g\u00e9s from the formerly Communist part of Germany, wrote in the daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that it was time for Mr. Kohl to withdraw from politics and \u201cmake way for the successors, the younger generation.\u201dMs. Merkel took over the Christian Democrats in 2000 and became chancellor in 2005, the first woman to hold the office.Well into his retirement, Mr. Kohl, who had once referred to Ms. Merkel as \u201cdas m\u00e4dchen\u201d \u2014 the girl \u2014 continued to snipe at her from the wings, questioning her handling of European politics. In 2016, he urged her to show restraint after Britain voted to leave the European Union. But by then, Ms. Merkel was eyeing a fourth run at the chancellery in 2017 \u2014 potentially equaling or even surpassing her one-time mentor\u2019s record in Germany\u2019s highest office.Helmut Joseph Michael Kohl was born in Ludwigshafen on April 3, 1930, the third and last child of C\u00e4cilie E. and Hans Kohl, a civil servant and tax expert who had been a soldier in World War I.When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Mr. Kohl\u2019s father answered the call to arms and did not return home until 1945. His elder brother, Walter, also volunteered and was killed in action in 1944. By then, Ludwigshafen was under almost daily attack from Allied bombers, and young Helmut, who, like most boys his age, had become a member of the Hitler Youth, was pressed into service to dig charred corpses from the ashes. Later, he fed ammunition to antiaircraft guns in the Bavarian Alps.In the spring of 1945, after surviving a heavy Allied bombing of Berchtesgaden and its environs in the Bavarian Alps, where Hitler had a retreat, Mr. Kohl decided the war was over for him. With a few friends, he set off on foot for his hometown, 250 miles away.\u201cStill in our Hitler Youth uniforms and without papers of any kind, we avoided the roads, on which truck after truck of American troops were rolling, and ran along the rail lines or over the crossties,\u201d Mr. Kohl wrote years later.After the Nazis capitulated in May, the group fell into the hands of Polish laborers, who gave them a beating. When he finally got home, in early June, he found Ludwigshafen three-quarters destroyed but the Kohl family home still standing.There, as a student preparing for university studies, he met a refugee from East Germany, Hannelore Renner, whom he married in 1960.Ms. Kohl projected a public image of traditional middle-class respectability, but after her suicide in 2001, Heribert Schwan, a journalist who had ghostwritten three volumes of Mr. Kohl\u2019s autobiography and claimed to have had close access to his wife, depicted her as a tragic figure who had worn the trappings of a political spouse \u201clike armor\u201d to shield her unhappiness in the role. She had been profoundly disturbed by his refusal to identify anonymous donors in the party financing scandal that ended his political career, Mr. Schwan said.With his second marriage, critics said Mr. Kohl appeared to be in thrall to his wife, Maike. She was credited both with tending to him assiduously in his infirmity and limiting access to him by his former associates, including Juliane Weber, his onetime office manager and confidante for three decades.Der Spiegel, an influential newsmagazine that acknowledged a troubled relationship with Mr. Kohl, said in 2012 that the \u201clink between political history and the physical frailty of this once-powerful man\u201d had \u201cturned his twilight years into a tragedy that is being closely watched in Germany.\u201dBesides his second wife, Mr. Kohl\u2019s survivors include his sons, Walter and Peter. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.Mr. Kohl went to college in Frankfurt and later in Heidelberg. He joined the Christian Democratic Union when he was only 17. His doctoral thesis in history, submitted a decade later, was on the rebirth of political parties in his home region after the war. The next year he was elected to the legislature of the postwar federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and in 1967 he became the state premier.But his ambition was to be his party\u2019s national leader. He realized that goal in 1973, a year before Willy Brandt, the Social Democratic chancellor who had begun a hotly contested policy of gradual reconciliation with Communist East Germany and the Soviet Union, resigned after it was discovered that a Communist spy had infiltrated his office. Mr. Kohl ran against Brandt\u2019s successor, Helmut Schmidt, in 1976, came surprisingly close to victory, and moved to Bonn to lead the opposition in the national Parliament.He became chancellor in 1982 when Mr. Schmidt\u2019s coalition partners, the Free Democrats, switched their support to Mr. Kohl\u2019s party. But despite having run campaigns with the slogan \u201cFreedom or Socialism,\u201d he left mostly unchanged the Brandt-Schmidt policy of gradual opening to the Communist East.In office, he occupied a villa behind his Bonn office on the Rhine during the week and liked to dine at unprepossessing Italian restaurants. He commuted home to Ludwigshafen by helicopter on weekends, when he could indulge in his favorite German dish, stuffed sow\u2019s belly, often inflicted on foreign visitors invited down for an evening at his home.After he won the 1987 elections, Mr. Kohl was host of the first visit to Bonn by an East German Communist leader, Erich Honecker, who was seeking billions of West German marks to prop up his ailing economy. His cordiality puzzled those who had long thought of Mr. Kohl as staunchly anti-Communist, and long after East Germany disappeared, he successfully resisted attempts to open secret files that Communist intelligence had maintained on his activities.Mr. Kohl and Mr. Gorbachev had their first meeting in Moscow in October 1988. But by then communism had begun to unravel all over Eastern Europe, and it became clear that Mr. Gorbachev was not ready to use Soviet military might to keep that from happening.By the summer of 1989, tens of thousands of people were fleeing East Germany through Hungary and Czechoslovakia to West Germany, and Mr. Kohl saw that reunification might be within reach.After Mr. Honecker was deposed and his successors opened the Berlin Wall on the night of Nov. 9, 1989, Mr. Kohl surprised his allies with a prompt 10-point plan for a German confederation.But the enthusiastic crowds he encountered in subsequent visits to East Germany convinced him that confederation was not enough. Confident of support in Washington, he made a 52-hour visit to Moscow and a retreat in the Caucasus Mountains in July 1990 and secured Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s acquiescence in the unification of the two German states in the Federal Republic, within NATO.\u201cWe did not take part in the war directly, we do not have it on our conscience,\u201d Mr. Kohl wrote of Mr. Gorbachev, \u201cbut we still remember the war in our mind\u2019s eye, we have seen its horrors, we have experience that others do not have. And we must bring all of it to bear to advance civilization.\u201dThat Oct. 3, Mr. Kohl celebrated reunification with a fireworks demonstration in Berlin. It was the apogee of his career.East Germany, thought to have had the strongest economy of any European Communist country, turned out to be bankrupt. Mr. Kohl gave eastern Germans the deutsche marks they had long craved, though at a 1:1 exchange rate, which left their inefficient state-run industries unable to compete on Western economic terms. Many collapsed.But in the first postwar all-German elections, in December 1990, he campaigned on the promise that unity would bring a flowering in the East, and won with 43.8 percent of the vote for his party.Within a year, though, more than a million people in the East were out of work. Leftist demonstrators in Halle, in the East, spattered Mr. Kohl with eggs, calling him a \u201cliar.\u201d Mr. Kohl went after them with clenched fists before being restrained. In the West, taxpayers felt taken advantage of when government spending to rebuild eastern Germany\u2019s shattered infrastructure sunk the deficit toward $400 billion. Inflation accelerated, and when the central bank pushed up interest rates, it was blamed for causing recession in much of Western Europe.The prospects for European unity also suffered. At the end of 1991, Mr. Kohl and his fellow leaders, meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, had agreed to an ambitious plan for European economic, monetary and political union. But almost immediately the project became bogged down in the economic difficulties and squabbling over Europe\u2019s failure to end the war in the Balkans. Some blamed the Kohl government for the start of the war, saying it had been hasty in recognizing Croatia, a German ally during World War II, when it broke away from Yugoslavia.\u201cI\u2019ve been wrong about some things since 1990, but who hasn\u2019t been?\u201d Mr. Kohl said in 1994, when polls were predicting yet again that his era was ending. He won elections that year, too, but the government\u2019s majority was razor-thin.Mr. Kohl began warning that the German welfare state, with its robust mark, 35-hour workweek and five-week vacations, was becoming uncompetitive in the global economy. Unemployment soared to nearly 4.7 million \u2014 12.2 percent of the work force \u2014 within two years.Unemployment like this had been unknown in Germany since the 1930s, when it contributed to the rise of the Nazis. Mr. Kohl\u2019s party had created the welfare state in part to prevent such horrors from ever happening again. But now, he told his compatriots, belt-tightening and budget-cutting would be the order of the day, with the hope that a united Europe with a common currency would eventually bring renewed prosperity.Long an advocate of a single European currency, Mr. Kohl was accused of ignoring what turned out to be one of its most stubborn challenges after it came into circulation: Without a political and fiscal union to buttress it, the currency, the euro, remained prey to crises, like the turmoil that drove Greece to the brink of economic collapse in the mid-2010s.At the close of the 20th century, Mr. Kohl had resisted pressures to turn over the party leadership to somebody younger. Instead, he decided to prove his critics wrong and run for chancellor again in 1998 against Mr. Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Social Democrats, who argued that after 16 years it was time for a change. Mr. Kohl\u2019s party went down to defeat.Mr. Schr\u00f6der was no more successful in solving the unemployment problem than his predecessor, but Ms. Merkel eventually reaped the benefits of an overhaul introduced under Mr. Schr\u00f6der.In recent years, with European unity shaken by recession, Mr. Kohl was outspokenly critical of his successors for, as he put it, \u201cruining my Europe.\u201d Among other things, he faulted them for insisting on financial austerity in response to the global recession that began in 2007.But he denied dismissing them as imbeciles, as he was quoted as doing in \u201cLegacy: The Kohl Transcripts\u201d (2014), a book by Mr. Schwan and Tilman Jens that drew on hundreds of hours of confidential interviews that Mr. Schwan said he had done in ghostwriting Mr. Kohl\u2019s memoirs. One quotation had him saying that Ms. Merkel \u201cdidn\u2019t even know how to properly use a knife and fork.\u201dMr. Kohl disputed the accuracy of that and 115 other quotations and sued the authors and their publisher, a subsidiary of Random House, for violation of privacy. In April 2017, a court in Cologne awarded him damages of a million euros ($1.1 million), a record. The defendants appealed.Later in 2014 he published \u201cWith Concern for Europe,\u201d a book written with his wife. \u201cHave we lost our minds \u2014 and our sense of responsibility, too?\u201d he wrote.For all the rancor surrounding Mr. Kohl at home, however, his standing among former allies on the world stage remained largely intact.\u201cIn more than size, he was the largest figure on the European continent in decades,\u201d former President Bill Clinton wrote in his memoir, \u201cMy Life,\u201d in 2004. And in a statement on Friday, the elder former President Bush called Mr. Kohl \u201ca true friend of freedom, and the man I consider one of the greatest leaders in postwar Europe.\u201dAn obituary on Saturday about Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor of Germany, omitted credit for two reporters. The obituary was written by Craig R. Whitney and Alan Cowell, not just by Mr. Whitney; and Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Dismantles Ukraine\u2019s \u2018Paper Curtain\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Petro O. Poroshenko, the Ukrainian president, called it the collapse of the \u201cpaper curtain.\u201dMore than 20,000 Ukrainians have already seized on the rule change, some stepping out of airports at their destinations pumping their fists to celebrate putting the bureaucratic headache of visas behind them. On peak days, Ukraine\u2019s border service says, about 5,000 of its citizens leave for the European countries.They are not permitted to work, and can be required to show a return ticket. Still, the change is a rare bright spot for Ukraine, a country mired in war with Russia, plagued by economic woes and struggling to gain a sympathetic hearing from the Trump administration, which has sought closer ties with Moscow.\u201cIt was all quite quick and comfortable,\u201d Timofey Matskevich, a small-business owner, said of transiting with his wife, Daria, through an airport serving Barcelona.\u201cThey asked no questions, they stamped our passports and said, \u2018Welcome to Spain,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Matskevich said in an online chat from the apartment where he was staying, which he said had a marvelous view of the beach and the Mediterranean beyond.\u201cIt\u2019s a change in mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have more freedom to go somewhere, to see things. For the mentality of the country to change, to get rid of the Soviet legacy, you need to see other parts of the world.\u201dWhile the visa waiver for Ukrainians is the largest shift of the kind for former Soviet countries, most of Ukraine\u2019s 45 million people cannot afford to go on vacation abroad. Citizens of Georgia and Moldova already qualified for short-term visa-free travel to most of Western Europe, and those of the Baltic countries, which are members of the European Union, can come and go as they please.Mr. Poroshenko celebrated the change by opening a symbolic \u201cdoor to Europe\u201d that had been set up on a stage at a border crossing with Slovakia. To help illustrate what lay to the west, the door was surrounded by walls depicting the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum in Rome, Dutch windmills and other European tourist sights.Mr. Poroshenko called the visa waiver \u201ca final exit of our country from the Russian Empire,\u201d and he joked that \u201cthe words \u2018Back in the U.S.S.R.\u2019 would be heard only listening to The Beatles.\u201dThe European Union has kept pressing the government in Kiev to adhere to European norms, not only on technical matters such as agricultural standards but also by curbing corruption, to little effect.In newspapers, disheartened Ukrainians read daily about members of Parliament or finance officials lining their pockets with public money.The visa-rule change allowed Mr. Poroshenko to claim credit for one popular achievement of Ukraine\u2019s shift toward the West, in the hopes more substantive measures will follow, said Kadri Liik, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cIt greatly empowers the forces in society that push reforms,\u201d she said.\u201cVisa-free travel is the first thing people received from the Association Agreement,\u201d Mr. Matskevich said. \u201cIt\u2019s a step by our country into the normal world, into normal society.\u201dThe opening went smoothly, with a few exceptions. A woman who had no passport for her 8-year-old son tried to smuggle him over a land border with Poland in a suitcase. They were discovered, fined and deported.Mostly, though, the change led to excited Ukrainians posting about their European vacations on Facebook.\u201cHurray! It works!\u201d one Ukrainian traveler, Ivetta Delikatnaya, wrote after sliding through passport control in Toulouse, France.Andriy Homanchuk, a veteran of the war in eastern Ukraine, posted on Facebook that he was, somehow, able to eke out a weekend in Brussels for less than $100, his first trip to Western Europe.\u201cThe visa-free regime works,\u201d he wrote excitedly from Belgium. \u201cYou don\u2019t need documents, or even knowledge of any language. You can go for a weekend.\u201dIuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The President Wants to Keep Us in the Dark", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLast Friday, CNN sent a man with colored pencils into the West Wing of the White House to cover the news.But the truth is that the decision to prevent the press secretary\u2019s comments on the day\u2019s most pressing matters from being televised is an affront to the spirit of an open and participatory government. It\u2019s especially chilling in a country governed by a Constitution whose very First Amendment protects the freedom of the press.Unfortunately, the slow death of the daily press briefing is only part of a larger assault by the Trump administration on a precious public resource: information.Our government does millions of things each day. It purchases medicine for Veterans Affairs hospitals, it inspects agricultural products for safety, it counts trucks on interstate highways. Each of these actions creates a data record and, in aggregate, these records help us as citizens gain detailed information about the operations of government.Such data is a crucial tool for understanding and improving the way our government functions. However, under President Trump, the collection and publication of public data has been substantially undermined.But this is just the tip of a rapidly melting iceberg.Legislative action in Congress is intensifying the crackdown on publicly available data. On June 8, the CHOICE Act passed in the House of Representatives. In addition to gutting many core aspects of Dodd-Frank meant to prevent another financial crisis, the law would block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from publishing complaints against banks by consumers. This would be a travesty: It was through such reports that the Wells Fargo fake account scandal surfaced and it remains a crucial way for consumers to have their voices heard.All of this is a sharp reversal of what had been a long-term trend under Republican and Democratic leadership toward a more transparent and open government. In 1966, the landmark Freedom of Information Act required that federal agencies make their records available to the public upon request, unless they have a compelling reason not to. In 1971, the Federal Election Campaign Act required campaign finance disclosures from candidates running for office. And in 1995, the Lobbying Disclosure Act extended transparency further into the role of money in politics.The last several years have in some ways seen an even more meaningful expansion of public access to public information. In 2013, President Obama signed an executive order mandating that federal agencies publish all of their data in open and machine-readable formats, allowing them to be analyzed and used in ways that scanned paper documents cannot be. In one of the few laws to be passed in recent memory with overwhelming bipartisan support, the DATA Act in 2014 was a watershed piece of legislation that requires every government contract and payment to be published in modern data formats, providing unprecedented transparency into trillions of dollars of public expenditures.Differences of belief and opinion are inseparable from the democratic process, but when the facts are in dispute or, worse, erased altogether, public debate risks breaking down. To have a free and democratic society we all need a common and shared context of facts to draw from. Facts or data will themselves never solve any problem. But without them, finding solutions to our common problems is impossible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Single-Payer Party? Democrats Shift Left on Health Care", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Republicans savaged Democrats for supporting the Affordable Care Act, branding the law \u2014 with some rhetorical license \u2014 as a government takeover of health care.Now, cast out of power in Washington and most state capitals, Democrats and activist leaders seeking political redemption have embraced an unlikely-seeming cause: an actual government takeover of health care.In a sign of shifting sympathies, most House Democrats have now endorsed a single-payer proposal. Party strategists say they expect that the 2020 presidential nominee will embrace a broader version of public health coverage than any Democratic standard-bearer has in decades.RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United and the California Nurses Association, powerful labor groups that back single-payer care, said the issue had reached a \u201cboiling point\u201d on the left.Supporters of universal health care, including activists with Ms. DeMoro\u2019s union, repeatedly interrupted speakers at the California Democratic Party\u2019s convention in May, challenging party leaders to embrace socialized medicine. Demonstrators waving signs with single-payer slogans have become a regular feature at town hall meetings hosted by members of Congress.\u201cThere is a cultural shift,\u201d said Ms. DeMoro, who was a prominent backer of Mr. Sanders. \u201cHealth care is now seen as something everyone deserves. It\u2019s like a national light went off.\u201dRepresentative Rick Nolan of Minnesota, a populist Democrat whose district voted for President Trump by a wide margin, said he had rarely seen core Democratic voters as enthusiastic about an issue as they were about single-payer health care. Mr. Nolan said he would support creating a state-level system in Minnesota, but believed the party\u2019s goal should be a national law.He warned Democrats against being too cautious on health care or trusting that they could passively reap the benefits of Republican missteps, saying that his party needed a more boldly \u201caspirational\u201d health care platform.Rank-and-file Democrats, Mr. Nolan said, \u201care energized in a way I have not witnessed in a long, long time.\u201dAt this point, state and federal single-payer proposals appear mainly to embody the sweeping ambitions of a frustrated party, rather than to map a clear way forward on policy. A handful of legislators in Democratic states \u2014 some positioning themselves to run for higher office \u2014 have proposed single-payer bills, including in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Only in California does the legislation appear to have at least a modest chance of being approved this year.Even there, State Senator Ricardo Lara, an author of the bill, said his legislation would not clear the State Assembly without detailing how expanded coverage would be financed. The proposal currently lacks a complete funding plan.Should California enact a single-payer law, it would still require a waiver from Washington to redirect federal funding to the state program \u2014 which might be difficult with Trump appointees running the Department of Health and Human Services.But Mr. Lara said that Mr. Trump\u2019s election, and subsequent Republican efforts to unwind the Affordable Care Act, had upended the conversation about health care among Democrats. He said he would have been unlikely to press for single-payer under a Democratic president.\u201cI no longer have the luxury of going step by step,\u201d Mr. Lara said. \u201cWe need to do a single-payer or we\u2019re going to be in a position where millions of people are going to lose coverage.\u201dThere remains considerable skepticism among senior Democrats about a single-payer plan, and party strategists fear that proposing a potentially divisive health care agenda would offer Republicans a welcome diversion from their own tortured wrangling over the Affordable Care Act.At a briefing with reporters last month, the House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, replied with a flat \u201cno\u201d when asked if Democrats should make single-payer a central theme in 2018. She said state-level action was more appropriate, though she said she supported the idea in concept.\u201cThe comfort level with the broader base of the American people is not there yet,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.Democrats were unable to pass either of those measures into law the last time they controlled Congress and the White House, in 2010, because they failed to draw unanimous support from both liberal and centrist Democrats. Mr. Obama never tried to create a full single-payer system, and Mrs. Clinton described the idea as unachievable during the 2016 campaign.Karen Politz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation who has tracked the single-payer debate for years, said it would be difficult to persuade the country to move to an all-government health care system \u2014 a disruptive process that would likely lead to higher taxes in place of the premiums people now pay to insurance companies.Even if most consumers paid less over all, as single-payer proponents claim, Ms. Politz said, morphing premiums into taxes would be culturally and politically challenging. \u201cIt does involve big government, and it\u2019s kind of baked into the American psyche that we resist that,\u201d she said.Still, Democrats acknowledge that there is a palpable appetite on the left for comprehensive government health care. A number of the party\u2019s potential 2020 presidential contenders, including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, have signaled support for some version of universal government care, though neither Mr. Booker nor Ms. Harris has endorsed the single-payer proposal in his or her home state.The Conyers proposal would effectively void the current private health insurance system and impose new taxes on wealthy people and on certain kinds of income to pay for benefits. In May, the bill won a symbolically telling endorsement from Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the Democratic caucus and a leading possible successor for Ms. Pelosi.Mr. Crowley said his support for the bill was \u201cpart practical, part aspirational,\u201d conceding that there was no immediate path to making it law.\u201cYou can\u2019t do this with 110 votes,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It would be the billionaire\u2019s personal volunteer project. And he told students he would finance any projects they wanted to help make Presidio the \u201cbest school in the universe.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018You guys, are you willing to make a list?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d Mr. Benioff recounted in an interview.Mr. Benioff, for one, has committed $100 million over a decade to the San Francisco Unified School District through his company\u2019s nonprofit arm. Separately, with his adoption of Presidio Middle School, Mr. Benioff said he was trying to provide a model for younger tech executives to personally work with schools.After Mr. Benioff\u2019s announcement, Thomas Ekno, the principal of the middle school, duly polled the student body. Their wishes: personal computers, better cafeteria food and a \u201cfunner environment,\u201d Mr. Ekno said.Students worked for months with the design firm to develop ideas.Once the plans are finalized, Mr. Benioff said, he intends to pay for construction of the playground.\u201cI encourage every C.E.O. in this room to adopt a public school,\u201d Mr. Benioff said last fall to an audience at a tech industry conference. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to walk down there, meet the principal and ask one question: \u2018How can I help improve this school?\u2019\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)It was 1967, the year of the Summer of Love, and hippies were streaming into San Francisco.Substance abuse was a growing problem, and some felt the medical establishment was failing to confront it.That prompted Dr. David Smith, a young physician who worked in San Francisco\u2019s public health department, to start a clinic that would provide treatment, in a deliberately nonjudgmental way, to vulnerable patients.Right away, volunteer caregivers were treating more than 200 patients a day, said Dr. Smith \u2014 \u201cIt was like a MASH unit.\u201dBut funding was scarce. The clinic survived, barely, with the help of benefit concerts by bands like Big Brother and the Holding Company and Creedence Clearwater Revival.Later, drug-addicted veterans returning from Vietnam began to seek help, leading to an era of government support for addiction treatment services.Did Dr. Smith ever think his free clinic idea would spread so far? No, he said on Tuesday.\u201cBut you know,\u201d he added, \u201cthe spirit of the Summer of Love lives on.\u201dThe California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "A Very British Radical", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe next Donald Trump \u2014 the next populist insurgent, the next outsider riding a wave of anti-establishment discontent, the next dangerous extremist with a chance to grab the reins of state \u2014 was supposed to be Marine Le Pen. In the Western press and Western capitals, there was a summons to the barricade when Le Pen reached the French presidential runoff. The liberal order was in the balance, the whiff of fascism was in the air, the entire French political system was expected to do its duty and keep her out of power.All this even though Le Pen never came within 16 points of her rival, Emmanuel Macron, in any poll between the first round and the runoff, and ultimately lost by nearly 33.First there is the matter of anti-Semitism. Le Pen\u2019s party was an heir to anti-Dreyfusard tendencies and included enough Holocaust-minimizers that one was briefly chosen as the party\u2019s acting leader. If you are troubled by this, good, you should be.Second there is the matter of historical and ideological associations. Le Pen aspired to be Gaullist, but her party retained a Petainist taint, a connection to fascism and a tendency to minimize its crimes, plus the inevitable far-right links to Putin and his nationalist international.In the wake of the recent Manchester horror and London attack, the Labour leader has been hitting May from the tough-on-terror right for not adequately funding the police. All\u2019s fair in love and the last week of a campaign, but still it\u2019s a little audacious, since Corbyn clearly has an old revolutionary\u2019s soft spot for a certain kind of terrorist.Now, one can concede all this and still cobble together a case that Le Pen would have been more dangerous to existing European institutions than Corbyn. She\u2019s a French chauvinist; he\u2019s a lefty internationalist. She wanted France out of the European Union; Britain has already taken that leap (and a Prime Minister Corbyn would probably make Brexit somewhat softer). She traded in clash-of-civilizations rhetoric about Islamic immigration; he\u2019s fluent in the pieties of multiculturalism.Again, I don\u2019t think it would be a better world if Corbyn were being met with Le Pen-level fear and loathing. The entire populist phenomenon, left and right, is happening because our establishment is in need of serious unsettlement, and that can\u2019t happen unless movements and ideas with extreme or disreputable associations are allowed into the conversation.Nonetheless \u2014 in allowing the extremes in, we should not be blind to where their worst tendencies can lead. No such blindness is likely where the right\u2019s populists are concerned, since the entire media-intellectual-academic complex of the West has its fascist radar set to \u201chigh.\u201dWhere the far left is concerned, though, a haze of elite sentimentality can still settle over ideological impulses that killed people and wrecked countries on an extraordinary scale.So with Corbyn closer to power than Le Pen ever got, spare a thought for the far left\u2019s actual 20th-century record, and remember that when history\u2019s arc bends away from liberalism and consensus, sometimes there\u2019s a commissar waiting at the end of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Empowering Women to Break the Jihadi Cycle", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Husnul Khotimah Tuban had no previous business experience when she started her roadside shop selling sandals and dolls in Jatirogo, East Java. She had to work to support her two children and picked the trade almost at random. Business was fine. She could put food on the table. After she attended free entrepreneurship training last year, though, she picked up one useful idea: print some of the sandals with the phrase \u201cThis belongs to the mosque.\u201d That simple tweak, she said, has turned local mosques into major clients, because it deters visitors from making off with the specially designated \u201csterile\u201d shoes available there.\u201cWe must constantly innovate products so that consumers do not get bored,\u201d she told me, like a seasoned entrepreneur \u2014 which she is not.Instead, Tuban had to go to work because her husband is a jailed terrorist, charged in 2014 with illegal arms possession and militant activity. Her business training came from an innovative University of Indonesia program that targets jihadists\u2019 wives in an attempt to stop extremism at the family level.Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority country, is well-known for its diverse, tolerant religious climate. But when jihadism arises \u2014 and it does \u2014 it tends to spread like wildfire among tight family networks. Generations of Indonesian jihadi cells have sprung up and evolved by now, from Darul Islam to Jemaah Islamiyah to today\u2019s sympathizers with the Islamic State. For children born into such families, whose fathers are often incarcerated, the chances of forging a different path can seem nil. So imprisoned jihadists\u2019 wives face the enormous stress of being their families\u2019 sole breadwinners and, effectively, single parents.Since 2015, the University of Indonesia\u2019s Police Research Center has run the Entrepreneurship and Proselytization Empowerment Program to help the wives of jailed extremists through counseling and business training. It was created by Prof. Sarlito Sarwono, a psychologist with an abiding interest in extremism and terrorism who died last November. The program, continuing without him, has just wrapped up its first cycle of workshops for jihadists\u2019 wives and has reported highly positive results from its 18 participants.Another nongovernmental agency, the Institute for International Peace Building, also gives loans and business training to extremists\u2019 wives, focusing on those whose husbands have been released from jail. It has now helped three such families get back on their feet despite the stigma that follows former extremists.A key member of the 16-person Police Research Center\u2019s team, who has taken a greater role since Sarwono\u2019s death, is Nasir Abas, a former terrorist. Abas fought against Russian forces with the Afghan Mujahedeen in the 1980s, and then was prominent in Al Qaeda\u2019s Southeast Asia affiliate, Jemaah Islamiyah, until he served a prison term from 2003 to 2006 and effectively switched sides. Now he advises the Indonesian government on counterterrorism. He has been instrumental in locating and speaking with imprisoned male extremists and persuading them to allow their wives to work with the Police Research Center\u2019s program.Three people visit every jihadist\u2019s wife who enrolls in the program: a psychologist, a Muslim religious teacher known as an ustadh and a policewoman. After two or three visits to break the ice, the women can enroll in the program\u2019s workshop.\u201cWe need these women to be part of counterterrorism because they\u2019re the missing link in the rehabilitation equation,\u201d Abas told me. \u201cWhen militant jihadists return from jail, we need another person in their lives to be a positive force.\u201d Otherwise, he says, they face insurmountable odds in resuming a productive life.The agency held workshops last year across Java, Indonesia\u2019s most populous island. In addition to group discussion on the challenges of having your husband in jail and raising children alone, the women also receive business training from Sutie Rahyono, an entrepreneurship professor.After attending the training, Tuban said, \u201cI was able to start my business even though I had no prior experience.\u201d Her business success has given her confidence as a homesteader \u2014 and to talk frankly with her husband, who is still in jail.\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic because my husband has promised that he will not repeat his behavior or rejoin Islamic radical groups when he\u2019s out of prison,\u201d she said.Judith Jacob, a researcher at the London School of Economics, explained that \u201cthe family unit, broadly conceptualized, is important to Islamist militant networks in Indonesia.\u201d It is, she added, \u201cnot unlike what royal families in Europe did to secure alliances.\u201d She cites Abas as an example: His sister is married to one of the masterminds of the infamous 2002 Bali bombings.While these kinship ties are an important pathway to radicalization, she said, they could also function as the opposite, because \u201cfamilies are also obviously a support structure when militants are released from prisons.\u201dThe program represents a potential sea change emerging in counterextremism circles toward more practical, less ambitious goals.\u201cOur target has shifted over the years from deradicalization to disengagement,\u201d the late Professor Sarwono told me last November. \u201cThis means we don\u2019t try to change someone\u2019s ideology \u2014 there is, after all, no way to truly know what\u2019s in someone\u2019s mind. We want to reduce the possibility of re-engagement with extremism. And families are instrumental for that.\u201dAnother released terrorist\u2019s wife in East Java received two cows so they could get started in the cattle trade, and the third, in West Java, received training and equipment to start a fried-duck stall.They are all now repaying their loans in installments.\u201cWomen are more reliable,\u201d says Dete Aliah, International Peace Building\u2019s managing director. \u201cWhen male jihadists go to jail, the entire burden of running a family is handled by the wife alone. And on top of all that, there\u2019s the community and family stigma. They bear the consequences of their husbands\u2019 ideology.\u201d But that is exactly why they are in a good position to get their families back on track, she says.Aliah has interviewed 60 wives of imprisoned terrorists, and said 85 percent of them want their husbands never to re-engage with violent extremism.According to a midterm evaluation from its 18 participants, all viewed the Police Research Center\u2019s job training program positively, and together they gave it an 85 percent approval rating. Among both projects, all of the women who started or helped to start their husbands\u2019 businesses are still afloat, and none of their children have reported an engagement with extremism.But both of these projects are still tiny. One reason is that Indonesia has a relatively low number of terrorists, especially considering the size of its population \u2014 250 million. Abas estimates that between 400 and 500 terrorists, most of them men, are in jail. The projects themselves, though, are hobbled by two factors. Extremists are highly suspicious of the government, so nonstate agencies have to cultivate their networks and funding with discretion. But donors are hard to find.Aliah echoed the sentiment, saying that B.N.P.T. \u201care considered infidels, trying to weaken the jihadi spirit.\u201d That is one reason that the two organizations aiding wives are both privately funded. They feel that they can\u2019t, in good conscience, utilize government funding.Nevertheless, private funding is hard to come by, because many potential donors are leery of engaging with terrorists in any way, and harbor doubts that reintegration can succeed.\u201cDonors are very hesitant to give money,\u201d said Aliah. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to inadvertently finance terrorists.\u201d She said some prisoners\u2019 wives in East Java are clamoring for training for a batik fabric business, but don\u2019t yet have any money to start one.Antarctica is the only continent that remains untouched by extremism in the 21st century, and no country has yet found a good solution for returned jihadists. If these two Indonesian programs are replicable, they may be a valuable blueprint. So it will be worthwhile to track their progress in preventing recidivism.\u201cOur challenges are countless: limited funding, social stigma and even the simple geography of Indonesia,\u201d said Abas. \u201cBut terrorists returning to society is a fact of life in many places now. I strongly believe this is the best long-run approach.\u201dKrithika Varagur is a freelance journalist based in Jakarta who focuses on fundamentalism and extremism.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Did Health Care Get to Be Such a Mess?", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe problem with American health care is not the care. It\u2019s the insurance.Both parties have stumbled to enact comprehensive health care reform because they insist on patching up a rickety, malfunctioning model. The insurance company model drives up prices and fragments care. Rather than rejecting this jerry-built structure, the Democrats\u2019 Obamacare legislation simply added a cracked support beam or two. The Republican bill will knock those out to focus on spackling other dilapidated parts of the system.An alternative structure can be found in the early decades of the 20th century, when the medical marketplace offered a variety of models. Unions, businesses, consumer cooperatives and ethnic and African-American mutual aid societies had diverse ways of organizing and paying for medical care.Physicians established a particularly elegant model: the prepaid doctor group. Unlike today\u2019s physician practices, these groups usually staffed a variety of specialists, including general practitioners, surgeons and obstetricians. Patients received integrated care in one location, with group physicians from across specialties meeting regularly to review treatment options for their chronically ill or hard-to-treat patients.Individuals and families paid a monthly fee, not to an insurance company but directly to the physician group. This system held down costs. Physicians typically earned a base salary plus a percentage of the group\u2019s quarterly profits, so they lacked incentive to either ration care, which would lose them paying patients, or provide unnecessary care.This contrasts with current examples of such financing arrangements. Where physicians earn a preset salary \u2014 for example, in Kaiser Permanente plans or in the British National Health Service \u2014 patients frequently complain about rationed or delayed care. When physicians are paid on a fee-for-service basis, for every service or procedure they provide \u2014 as they are under the insurance company model \u2014 then care is oversupplied. In these systems, costs escalate quickly.Unfortunately, the leaders of the American Medical Association saw early health care models \u2014 union welfare funds, prepaid physician groups \u2014 as a threat. A.M.A. members sat on state licensing boards, so they could revoke the licenses of physicians who joined these \u201calternative\u201d plans. A.M.A. officials likewise saw to it that recalcitrant physicians had their hospital admitting privileges rescinded.The A.M.A. was also busy working to prevent government intervention in the medical field. Persistent federal efforts to reform health care began during the 1930s. After World War II, President Harry Truman proposed a universal health care system, and archival evidence suggests that policy makers hoped to build the program around prepaid physician groups.A.M.A. officials decided that the best way to keep the government out of their industry was to design a private sector model: the insurance company model.In this system, insurance companies would pay physicians using fee-for-service compensation. Insurers would pay for services even though they lacked the ability to control their supply. Moreover, the A.M.A. forbade insurers from supervising physician work and from financing multispecialty practices, which they feared might develop into medical corporations.With the insurance company model, the A.M.A. could fight off Truman\u2019s plan for universal care and, over the next decade, oppose more moderate reforms offered during the Eisenhower years.Through each legislative battle, physicians and their new allies, insurers, argued that federal health care funding was unnecessary because they were expanding insurance coverage. Indeed, because of the perceived threat of reform, insurers weathered rapidly rising medical costs and unfavorable financial conditions to expand coverage from about a quarter of the population in 1945 to about 80 percent in 1965.But private interests failed to cover a sufficient number of the elderly. Consequently, Congress stepped in to create Medicare in 1965. The private health care sector had far more capacity to manage a large, complex program than did the government, so Medicare was designed around the insurance company model. Insurers, moreover, were tasked with helping administer the program, acting as intermediaries between the government and service providers.With Medicare, the demand for health services increased and medical costs became a national crisis. To constrain rising prices, insurers gradually introduced cost containment procedures and incrementally claimed supervisory authority over doctors. Soon they were reviewing their medical work, standardizing treatment blueprints tied to reimbursements and shaping the practice of medicine.It\u2019s easy to see the challenge of real reform: To actually bring down costs, legislators must roll back regulations to allow market innovation outside the insurance company model.Both Democrats and Republicans could learn from this lost history of health care innovation.Christy Ford Chapin is an associate professor of history at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University and the author of \u201cEnsuring America\u2019s Health: The Public Creation of the Corporate Health Care System.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Michael Flynn\u2019s Disdain for Limits Led to a Legal Quagmire", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Michael T. Flynn was a man seething and thwarted. In the summer of 2014, after repeatedly clashing with other Obama administration officials over his management of the Defense Intelligence Agency \u2014 and what he saw as his unheeded warnings about the rising power of Islamic militants \u2014 Mr. Flynn was fired, bringing his military career to an abrupt end.Mr. Flynn decided that the military\u2019s loss would be his gain: He would parlay his contacts, his disdain for conventional bureaucracy, and his intelligence career battling Al Qaeda into a lucrative business advising cybersecurity firms and other government contractors. Over the next two years he would sign on as a consultant to nearly two dozen companies, while carving out a niche as a sought-after author and speaker \u2014 and ultimately becoming a top adviser to President Trump.\u201cI\u2019ve always had that entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d Mr. Flynn said in an interview in October 2015. In the military, he added, \u201cI learned that following the way you\u2019re supposed to do things isn\u2019t always the way to accomplish a task.\u201d\u201cHe got out of the service and had a passion to reform the intelligence community, where he saw some deficiencies,\u201d said Todd Wilcox, a former Green Beret and C.I.A. officer who founded Patriot Capital, a Florida-based defense contractor that named Mr. Flynn to an advisory board in 2015.But Mr. Flynn also became entangled with controversial clients. One company that paid him, OSY Technologies, is part of a cyberweapons company whose software has been used to hack Mexican activists and an opposition leader in the Middle East. Another, a Boston company selling a technology to replace lie detectors, is accused by its former chief scientist of marketing a counterfeit version of his technology to foreign clients.Dozens of interviews and a review of public documents suggest that Mr. Flynn\u2019s business was as scattershot as it was ambitious \u2014 and that there were few opportunities he would pass up. His clients ranged from a drone manufacturer in Florida to major software companies; at one point, Mr. Flynn took a $5,000 gig as an expert witness in a personal injury case. Some of his clients came through a tight-knit circle of Iranian-Americans, one of whom became a key partner in Mr. Flynn\u2019s businesses.Mr. Flynn declined to comment for this article, and his lawyer, Robert Kelner, declined to answer questions from The New York Times. But in an interview not long ago, Mr. Flynn expressed pride in his moneymaking skills. \u201cI\u2019m a capitalist at heart,\u201d Mr. Flynn said in October. \u201cIf I\u2019ve discovered anything, it\u2019s that I\u2019m a good businessman.\u201dIn the fall of 2014, Mr. Flynn registered his new company, Flynn Intel Group, from an Alexandria, Va., townhouse owned by Stanley A. McChrystal, a friend and fellow general-turned-consultant. Among his first clients was Palo Alto Networks, a rising Silicon Valley firm seeking to win more government contracts. A few months later, he inked a deal with the software giant Adobe, which paid him a six-figure fee to provide \u201cperiodic counsel to Adobe\u2019s public sector team,\u201d according to a company spokeswoman.But Mr. Flynn also joined the board of a little-known company called GreenZone Systems, which marketed secure mobile communications systems. GreenZone was run by Bijan R. Kian, an Iranian-American businessman who served until 2011 as a director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank. A friend of Mr. Kian, the businessman Nasser Kazeminy, also hired Mr. Flynn as an adviser.Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kian soon found a third partner: Philip Oakley, a former Army intelligence analyst, longtime Flynn friend, and owner of two small companies that provided software for defense and intelligence clients. They restarted Flynn Intel Group in June 2015, according to Delaware corporate records, pitching themselves as a premier private intelligence and cybersecurity advisory firm.None of the partners responded to repeated attempts to contact them. But their business interests were closely intermingled. Beginning in 2015, Mr. Oakley\u2019s firms employed Mr. Flynn as an adviser and paid him $90,000 in salary over 11 months.Jim McGuire, a business partner of Mr. Kazeminy, said in an email that Mr. Flynn had provided guidance on public sector business opportunities.Mr. McGuire declined to say whether GreenZone had won any government business during Mr. Flynn\u2019s tenure as an adviser, which ended last fall. If Mr. Oakley thought joining with Mr. Flynn would turbocharge his business, he may have been disappointed: Mr. Oakley\u2019s companies do not appear to have received any new contracting work directly from the federal government, though government databases do not reliably include subcontractors.Mr. Flynn continued to collect advisory board memberships, however: His credentials were a marketable asset. Fledgling contractors like Patriot Capital, Mr. Wilcox said, use advisory boards to \u201cbuild some gravitas.\u201dYet even as Mr. Flynn consulted for American cybersecurity companies, he was developing closer financial ties to Russia, a country whose own intelligence apparatus was moving aggressively to penetrate United States government systems. In 2015, Mr. Flynn accepted a payment from Kaspersky Lab, a Russian research firm that works to uncover Western government spyware and whose founder has long been suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence services.Both payments were for unspecified \u201cservices\u201d provided by Mr. Flynn, according to a letter sent to the White House in March by Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, which is examining Mr. Flynn\u2019s financial dealings. Kaspersky has said that Mr. Flynn was paid for remarks he delivered at a 2015 cybersecurity forum in Washington.In December 2015, Mr. Flynn traveled to Moscow for a paid speaking engagement on behalf of RT, the Kremlin-financed news network that American intelligence agencies say is a Russian propaganda outlet. RT paid Mr. Flynn $45,000 for the trip, which also included an invitation to a lavish anniversary party for the network, where he was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V. Putin.The three payments from Russian companies are among the issues being investigated by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the Justice Department inquiry.Mr. Flynn believed that Moscow could be cultivated as an ally against Islamist militants. As director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he had even visited the headquarters of the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence service.His colleagues in the American intelligence community took a less favorable view, especially when he continued to push for closer ties after Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea in 2014. They believed Mr. Flynn was willing to be used by Russia if he could advance his views on forging a united front to battle the Islamic State.By early 2016, Mr. Flynn\u2019s public profile was rising. He had signed a book deal and began hitting the public speaking circuit. The rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria seemed to validate his criticism of Obama administration policy, and Mr. Flynn soon become a regular adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s insurgent presidential campaign.But behind the scenes, his client list was also expanding.That May, Mr. Flynn joined the advisory board of OSY Technologies, part of the NSO Group, a secretive cyberweapons dealer founded by former Israeli intelligence officials. He also consulted with Francisco Partners, an American private equity firm that controls NSO Group.The same year, the company\u2019s products were linked to an attempt to hack the cellphone of Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. They were also used to harass public health advocates of a Mexican soda tax, who began receiving threatening text messages.In a statement, NSO said it \u201conly develops the software, and is not involved in any way, shape or form in operating the system.\u201dSteve Eisner, the general counsel of Francisco Partners, suggested that Mr. Flynn had served the company in a relatively limited advisory role.\u201cWe routinely engage consultants to help us understand industries that we are investing in,\u201d Mr. Eisner said. Mr. Flynn was paid a little more than $40,000 by OSY, and \u201cless than $100,000\u201d by Francisco, Mr. Eisner said.Another client was Brainwave Science, a tiny Massachusetts company that purports to have technology that can scan the brain to determine if someone is lying.Dr. Lawrence A. Farwell, the company\u2019s former chief scientist and inventor of its technology, said in an interview that Brainwave was using a counterfeit version of his work and was the target of a federal investigation related to its product. He declined to provide further details.Mr. Kota denied in an interview that he had served on the board of Brainwave; Dr. Farwell said Mr. Kota was actually the principal investor. A lawyer for Brainwave declined to answer questions about the dispute with Dr. Farwell or Mr. Flynn\u2019s work for the company.Dr. Farwell added that he had warned Mr. Flynn against getting involved with the company. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any representations as to what Flynn\u2019s positions or words were, but I was in communication with him directly, and with his staff,\u201d Dr. Farwell said.By the fall of 2016, Mr. Flynn was spending significant time on the campaign trail with Mr. Trump. Back in Washington, Mr. Kian brought in a new client: A prominent Turkish businessman named Ekim Alptekin, who headed a Turkish trade association with ties to the country\u2019s government.Mr. Alptekin had come to know Mr. Kian during Mr. Kian\u2019s days at the Export-Import Bank, Mr. Alptekin said in an interview this month. Last fall, after the failed July 2016 coup against the Turkish president, he wanted to fight back against those whom Mr. Erdogan blamed for the attempt: members of the Islamic religious movement led by Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999.\u201cLike many Americans rolling up their sleeves in 9/11 to do something, I decided to do something,\u201d Mr. Alptekin said.Mr. Alptekin now says that he wanted to hire a credible American firm to lead a public relations campaign against the Gulenists. Mr. Kian suggested the Flynn Intel Group, Mr. Alptekin said \u2014 though without disclosing his own involvement with the firm.\u201cYou need independent work; you need research that is done by Americans,\u201d Mr. Alptekin said. \u201cFlynn was well credentialed; he was a head of D.I.A.\u201dThe Flynn Intel Group promised what sounded like a sophisticated research and lobbying effort, employing former intelligence and military veterans, and led by Mr. Flynn himself. The company would produce a documentary and seek to persuade members of Congress that Mr. Gulen ought to be extradited. Mr. Alptekin agreed to pay $600,000 for the work.But the effort appears to have been slapdash from the start, according to several people involved in the effort, who asked for anonymity because of the continuing federal investigations.Mr. Flynn had little to say during meetings, though he would hand out signed copies of his book at each one. A former United States intelligence operative named Mike Boston appeared to be quarterbacking the assignment, but according to one person involved, he mostly sat in the corner or paced around the room saying nothing.Mr. Flynn\u2019s partners also appeared unsure of what legal requirements they faced, according to another person involved in the project. Yet another Kian friend, a lawyer named Robert Kelley, was brought in for advice, and later filed a lobbying disclosure on the company\u2019s behalf, indicating that its client was Mr. Alptekin\u2019s company, Inovo BV.But the op-ed caught the attention of Justice Department lawyers, who opened an investigation into whether Mr. Flynn was in fact working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey \u2014 a matter that is now part of Mr. Mueller\u2019s broader inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle.Months later, in March, Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kian filed additional disclosures under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The new disclosures acknowledged that the Gulen project \u201ccould be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\u201dAround $270,000 worth of the fees Mr. Alptekin paid to Flynn Intel Group are not accounted for in the foreign agent disclosure, which details payments to roughly a dozen other individuals and firms associated with the Gulen project.Mr. Alptekin says he does not know where the money went.Danielle Ivory contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Soft Brexit\u2019 Supporters Rise in Britain on the Eve of Talks", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Ridiculed by the right-wing tabloid media and ignored by Prime Minister Theresa May as she pursued plans for a clean break with the European Union, Britain\u2019s pro-Europeans suddenly have something they have long wanted: leverage.The pro-Europe Britons\u2019 demands that Mrs. May maintain closer ties to the European Union have grown louder and more assertive \u2014 in particular the calls to keep Britain in Europe\u2019s customs union, which provides tariff-free access to Continental markets and helps integrate the British and European economies.For the first time since the referendum on Britain\u2019s exit, there is \u201can opportunity to have a much better relationship with the European Union,\u201d said Roland Rudd, a senior figure in the defeated \u201cremain\u201d campaign and founder of Finsbury, a communications company.Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London, said, \u201cI think on balance in the House of Commons there is a majority for something softer than Theresa May\u2019s idea of Brexit.\u201dThis, Professor Menon said, creates a difficult and dangerous dynamic for Mrs. May. She emerged from the snap election she called with a far weaker hand for Brexit negotiations, and must also avert a return to feuding over Europe in her Conservative Party, where there is still strong support for a tough stance.The new and changed political landscape makes the prospect of two diametrically opposed outcomes more likely, he said: \u201ca softer Brexit\u201d or \u201ca chaotic Brexit.\u201dFor now, no one is talking about revisiting the principle of British withdrawal, a plan accepted by the Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party after Britons voted in a referendum last year to quit. But the timing could hardly be more problematic for a change in Mrs. May\u2019s original plan, only days before talks are to begin with the European Union and amid signs of frustration in Brussels at the political turmoil in London.Yet, if she does not move away from their agenda, which prioritizes control over immigration and lawmaking above the country\u2019s economic interests, Mrs. May risks legislative gridlock in Parliament, where she has no clear majority and must rely on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party.Central to her attempts to govern effectively will be the more pro-European politicians in Mrs. May\u2019s government. She promoted one of them, Damian Green, a longtime ally, to first secretary of state and kept in place Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, whom she had intended to fire, according to news reports.Speaking in Luxembourg on Friday ahead of a meeting of European Union finance ministers, Mr. Hammond said, according to Reuters, \u201cMy clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritize protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations and take them forward.\u201dEven the Democratic Unionist Party lawmakers, who support Britain\u2019s withdrawal and will want to keep Mrs. May in power, hope to keep open their border with Ireland for free trade, which is vital to the Northern Irish economy. While they may agree to leave the customs union, they back a policy of \u201ccomprehensive free trade and customs agreement\u201d with the European Union.Pro-Europe Britons have floated other ideas, such as accepting a long transition period before Britain departs from the bloc, and accepting rulings from the European Court of Justice.The prospect of Britain\u2019s continuing indefinitely in Europe\u2019s single market, which removes non-tariff barriers and helps trade in services, is less likely. That would almost certainly involve accepting free movement, something that both Mrs. May and Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, have ruled out.Other Labour figures, however, have talked of remaining in a \u201creformed\u201d version of it and have criticized Mrs. May\u2019s stance. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve criticized the government for is simply sweeping options off the table before they even started the negotiations,\u201d Keir Starmer, a Labour lawmaker and spokesman on the British exit, told the BBC.Mrs. May could stall the negotiations for a time, because the immediate focus of the talks will be on other issues, including the rights of European Union citizens living in Britain.But the Labour Party knows that in her weakened position in Parliament, the prime minister could eventually be defeated over a range of issues, including Brexit-related bills. Even if she gets such legislation through the House of Commons, she will have to worry about the unelected House of Lords, where she has no majority, either.\u201cIt was very, very difficult for Theresa May before the election,\u201d Professor Menon said, \u201cand it has now become significantly more difficult still.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tennis Mom Who Put the Blemish in Martina Navratilova\u2019s 86-1 Record", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKathleen Horvath peered over the railing high above the indoor courts at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Outside, rain was pouring down so hard that it sounded as if the New York Philharmonic\u2019s percussion section were rehearsing on the roof.Horvath tried to pretend she was not sneaking peeks at her 16-year-old son R J Fresen. He was hitting with Julia Elbaba, a four-time all-American at Virginia and a fledgling pro, under the watchful eye of Jay Devashetty, a coach for the United States Tennis Association.Fresen, once ranked in the top 10 by the U.S.T.A. among 12- and 14-year-old boys, had been out of the game for much of the last two and a half years because of a stress fracture in his back. Finally healthy, he has his sights set on a pro career, just as his mother once had, with a possible stop at college along the way.\u201cTennis is his aspiration, but all I really want for him is to be happy, healthy, successful and to hopefully pursue his passion,\u201d Horvath said. \u201cBased on his drive, work ethic and how much he loves competing, he\u2019s well suited for this life.\u201dHorvath, 51, who lives in Short Hills, N.J., often drives 200 miles a day shuttling Fresen between training sessions, physical therapy and academic tutoring. She also wafts between typical tennis parent and been-there-done-that observer.That is because she has been there and done that.In 1979, when she was just 14 years 5 days old, Horvath, then known as Kathy, became the youngest player to compete in a main-draw match at the United States Open. Her record still stands. A native of tiny Hopewell Junction in Dutchess County, N.Y., Horvath played her way through three qualifying matches, the first on her 14th birthday, before losing to the Australian veteran Dianne Fromholtz in straight sets in the first round.She would go on to reach the top 10 and amass a singles record of 176-154 before retiring in 1989. But there is only one match that really matters.On May 28, 1983, Martina Navratilova and Horvath played in the round of 16 at the French Open, a match that would become a question on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d and in Trivial Pursuit. While they did not know it at the time, Horvath\u2019s victory would become Navratilova\u2019s only loss in 87 singles matches that season, preventing her from capturing the Grand Slam.\u201cIt\u2019s the reason Martina hates me to this day,\u201d Horvath said, only half joking.On a picturesque Saturday afternoon at Roland Garros, a crowd gathered to watch Navratilova, the defending champion, who had won her first 36 matches that year. Horvath, then 17 and unseeded, had reached the final of the German Open in Berlin the week before, losing to Chris Evert in straight sets.But almost everyone in the stands that day expected Navratilova to win easily and go on to face the second-seeded Evert in the final. Horvath had other ideas.\u201cI always knew that if you started well against her that she could become rattled and there would be windows of opportunity,\u201d said Horvath, who won the junior French Open on the same court three years earlier. \u201cIt was never like that with Chris Evert.\u201dWhen Horvath won the first set, 6-4, by hitting deep to Navratilova\u2019s backhand and then approaching the net, the crowd roared. Navratilova looked beseechingly to her player\u2019s box, but instead of receiving reassurances from her advisers, she saw her coach, Renee Richards, and trainer, Nancy Lieberman, bickering about strategy.Suddenly, Horvath began looking at the finish line rather than at the ball, and she lost the second set, 6-0. But instead of folding, Horvath steadied herself and, bolstered by the crowd, re-employed her chip-and-charge tactic, keeping the ball so low to Navratilova\u2019s backhand that she was forced to float returns back, allowing Horvath to hit menacing swing-volley winners.Horvath vividly remembers match point.\u201cI hit a forehand crosscourt deep to her backhand, and she tried to float it but it slid wide,\u201d Horvath said of the 6-3 third set. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what Martina said to me, but Renee looked at me stone cold and said, \u2018You cost me my job.\u2019\u201dNavratilova did indeed fire Richards the day after the match.\u201cI was the heroine, but the villain in her mind,\u201d said Horvath, who had lost to Navratilova three times before that day and would lose to her seven times after that. \u201cSadly, it\u2019s human nature to root against the person on top. Unless I was a creepy kid, they would be rooting for me to beat the big, bad No. 1. She wasn\u2019t a darling like Federer.\u201dWhile many blame Horvath for preventing Navratilova from winning the Grand Slam in \u201983, Horvath is more pragmatic.\u201cI think it\u2019s 50-50 as to whether she would have lost to someone else that year,\u201d she said. \u201cStatistically, things don\u2019t work that conveniently because the input changes. In a way, her losing to me freed her up to win the other matches.\u201dHorvath added: \u201cShe could have lost any time. Had she won that tournament, she might have been so nervous because the stakes were so high that she might have lost at the U.S. Open. After all, Serena did.\u201dHorvath became disillusioned with tennis and quit six years later at age 23. She earned undergraduate and M.B.A. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School and then worked in finance at Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch before her children were born. In addition to Fresen, Horvath has a daughter, Erika, soon to be a freshman at Goucher College, and Fresen\u2019s twin brother, Andy, who prefers ice hockey to tennis.These days, Horvath rarely picks up a racket and almost never dwells on that day 34 years ago.\u201cI never dream about that match, though I do sometimes wake up having dreamt about tennis,\u201d she said wistfully.Last year, she spent two months as the women\u2019s coach at the College of St. Elizabeth, a Division III school near her home. She grew frustrated when the team was forced to practice in a gym at 10 p.m. Sometimes the team was relegated to the dance studio, where the two players who showed up did drills in front of the mirror and dance barre.When Fresen was 8, he and his mother trained together. Horvath felt she had much to teach him. But more often than not, the two ended up courtside, crying.\u201cI\u2019d plan a perfect practice session, have it all mapped out, and he just wanted to play points,\u201d Horvath said. \u201cWhen I played, I was so driven, a real workhorse. I never took a day off, because I felt that I had to outwork the competition. Now I advise R J to listen to his body and practice smart, not long. I tell him not to be afraid to work on his weaknesses and to put in no more hours on the court than is productive.\u201dMoments after he defeated Elbaba in a close practice set, Fresen said of his mother: \u201cThe best thing about her is that she is so dedicated to her children. But it\u2019s the worst thing, too, because sometimes she\u2019s too dedicated. She just cares so much.\u201dMother and son said there was little talk around the house of Horvath\u2019s pro tennis career, and even fewer mentions of that fateful day back in May 1983.There is, however, one reminder. When Horvath\u2019s husband, Phil, whom she met at Wharton, decided to start his own mergers and acquisitions company several years ago, there seemed but one appropriate name.The firm is called the Garros Group \u2014 as in Roland Garros.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank at Center of U.S. Inquiry Projects Russian \u2018Soft Power\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has offices in a sleek Manhattan skyscraper. Its bonds are accessible to millions of American investors. And it holds ties to some of New York\u2019s biggest banks.Despite this presence on Wall Street, detailed in previously unreported financial records, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, is no normal bank. It is wholly owned by the Russian state. It is intertwined with Russian intelligence. And the Russian prime minister is, by law, the chairman of its supervisory board.Now VEB is at the center of an international firestorm that threatens the Trump presidency because the bank\u2019s chief \u2014 a prominent graduate of Russia\u2019s spy school \u2014 met with Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, during the presidential transition. That meeting is a focus of a federal counterintelligence investigation about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.Three years ago, in response to Moscow\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on VEB that have effectively kept it from taking on most new business in the United States. Since then, however, VEB has quietly kept up appearances on Wall Street in the event that sanctions would be lifted, according to interviews with American bankers and former government officials.That moment appeared to be nearing with Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. And so the bank\u2019s chief, Sergey N. Gorkov, traveled to New York in December for what he described as a \u201croadshow\u201d promoting the bank that was largely hinged on the prospect of improved diplomatic and business relationships between the United States and Russia.During that trip, The New York Times has found, Mr. Gorkov met with bankers at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and another, unidentified American financial institution. Goldman Sachs bankers also tried to arrange a meeting but ultimately had a scheduling conflict. The meetings, which are not prohibited by sanctions, were confirmed by three people briefed on the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly about them.None of the American banks were new to VEB. Citi and JPMorgan had long, established relationships clearing financial transactions for VEB in the United States, activities not affected by the sanctions. And before the sanctions, securities filings show, Goldman and others had helped the Russian bank issue bonds, activity that was blocked by the sanctions and that VEB was eager to resume.After a few painful years, continuing Western borrowing had become a pressing priority for Moscow. The Russian Finance Ministry has spent about $10 billion to prop up the bank over the past three years, according to banking analysts.On that same trip, Mr. Gorkov met with Mr. Kushner. The nature of the meeting, which remains in dispute, followed a session between Mr. Kushner and the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, about opening a communications channel with Russian officials during the presidential transition, according to current and former American officials.The F.B.I. and congressional investigators are now scrutinizing whether Mr. Kushner may have met with Mr. Gorkov to help establish a direct line to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, or for other reasons not cited by the White House.The White House and VEB have issued contradictory statements about the purpose of the Gorkov meeting.The White House has said that Mr. Kislyak requested the meeting and that \u201cMr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official.\u201d But VEB said Mr. Gorkov had met with Mr. Kushner, who was still running his family\u2019s real estate company, to discuss business. The statement said VEB\u2019s management had met with \u201ca number of representatives of the largest banks and business circles of the U.S.,\u201d a claim supported by the Times\u2019s reporting about Mr. Gorkov\u2019s meetings with banks in New York.VEB has not disclosed specifics of the conversation with Mr. Kushner, which is of keen interest to investigators.The subject of sanctions was also freshly topical in December. The rolling back of sanctions was an essential part of Mr. Gorkov\u2019s strategy in visiting New York, and was central to the health of his bank. The next month, during Mr. Trump\u2019s first week in office, administration officials signaled they were considering lifting the sanctions that stemmed from the conflict in Ukraine.Separately, Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, had several phone conversations late last year with Mr. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. In one, the two men discussed additional sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in response to the Russian government\u2019s efforts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.The meeting with Mr. Kushner was not VEB\u2019s only connection to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or associates.A banker who pleaded guilty last year to spying for Russia out of VEB\u2019s office in New York was part of an unsuccessful Russian scheme to recruit Carter Page, an American businessman who later became a Trump campaign adviser, as a spy. VEB also obtained shares in a Ukrainian steel smelter when it was sold by a business partner of Mr. Trump\u2019s who built a Trump hotel in Toronto, according to previously undisclosed documents from the vast leak known as the Panama Papers. The VEB involvement in the smelter deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.These interactions have stirred concerns over whether the bank, which few Americans have heard of despite its ties to Wall Street and big companies like Boeing, has been spreading Russian influence along with its financial footprint.A representative for the bank would not comment.VEB and Mr. Putin are inextricably linked.The bank stepped up lending after 2008 when Mr. Putin, then prime minister, became chairman of the board. And during the oil boom, VEB was seen as embodying Russia\u2019s new financial might.Under a 2007 law, VEB\u2019s mandate was to lend to important but underfinanced sectors of the Russian economy, including infrastructure and businesses that help diversify the economy beyond oil dependence.There are other government-controlled banks in Russia, Sberbank and VTB, but they are primarily retail banks. VEB serves a very different role, lending mostly to large borrowers, many of them politically connected.To that end, VEB over the last decade has lent freely in ways that dovetail with government priorities and make it a tool of Russian soft power. The purse strings opened for two influential groups in particular: oligarchs building Olympic sites in Sochi and companies in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.\u201cThis is not a bank,\u201d said Karen Vartapetov, a public finance analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cWe should rather treat this bank as a government agency. It is used by the government as a tool to invest in politically and socially important but not always financially viable projects.\u201dVEB\u2019s role as a projector of state influence was on display in 2010 with a deal that potentially affected a Trump hotel in Toronto.At the time, Alex Shnaider, a Russian-Canadian businessman developing the hotel, was looking to sell a steel plant in Ukraine. His Midland Resources Holding Ltd., which owned the Zaporizhstal steel factory, sold at least half its stake to a collection of five offshore companies that received funding from VEB, according to documents in the trove of files from the law firm Mossack Fonseca that were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.The documents show that one year after acquiring the Zaporizhstal stake, the five companies \u2014 based in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands \u2014 transferred it to Russian control.In each case, the companies\u2019 shares were \u201ccharged in favor of\u201d VEB, meaning the bank effectively took ownership of them in exchange for financing the steel plant acquisition.Nothing in the Panama Papers linked VEB\u2019s financing to the Trump project, which Mr. Trump did not own. Rather, the deal underscored VEB\u2019s strategy to venture into Ukraine at the behest of the Russian government.More broadly, the bank\u2019s plan had been to tap capital markets in New York to help finance the Ukraine lending, but the plan collapsed with the imposition of sanctions in 2014.The bank today, not unlike Mr. Putin\u2019s government, expanded its sway abroad in a way that appears unsustainable. Weighed down by sanctions and the oil price collapse, the Russian economy has slipped to 12th in the world, below South Korea\u2019s, according to a World Bank ranking.At the time sanctions were imposed, the bank\u2019s total debt ran about $20 billion. It has since been reduced to $17 billion, according to financial disclosures at the end of last year. But the Ukraine lending in particular is affecting the balance sheet, with outstanding Ukraine debt totaling $14.2 billion at the current exchange rate, banking analysts say.Last week, the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti reported that about 40 percent of VEB\u2019s loans were at risk of default.Mr. Gorkov, who previously worked at the Yukos oil company and was a senior executive at Sberbank, became director of VEB in February 2016, partly with a mandate to find market solutions to the bank\u2019s financial woes.For Mr. Gorkov, fixing VEB would require a new focus, and that, according to the bank\u2019s statement, became the reason for a meeting with Mr. Kushner.The two met as Mr. Gorkov traveled to gather ideas for a new strategy for the bank, published a month after the meeting with Mr. Kushner in a document called \u201cStrategy 2021.\u201d It called for shifting some risks directly to the Russian budget, selling assets not considered central to the bank and trying to resume borrowing in places like the United States.The document suggested that the bank was expecting some relief from sanctions. \u201cThe forecasts for the term of the strategy predict certain decrease of geopolitical risks and gradual weakening of the restricted access to global capital markets,\u201d it said.Robert Amsterdam, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Gorkov\u2019s former boss at Yukos, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, said it was essential that sanctions be lifted for the VEB turnaround to succeed.\u201cPutin doesn\u2019t have to worry about what the voters think of him,\u201d Mr. Amsterdam said. \u201cPutin has to think about the top 100. And the top 100 are those who are sanctioned.\u201dLong before VEB became saddled with sanctions, it had deep ties to Washington and Wall Street.In 2010, Mr. Gorkov\u2019s predecessor appeared at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington to unveil a pact with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the federal agency that supports American exports. Under the deal, the two institutions agreed \u201cto cooperate in financing U.S. exports to Russia.\u201dThe arrangement was followed by two little-noticed deals. In 2013, the Export-Import Bank guaranteed a loan of about $500 million so that, in effect, a VEB subsidiary could acquire a number of Boeing 777 aircraft \u2014 planes that VEB then leased to Aeroflot Russian Airlines. A year later, shortly before the sanctions hit, the American agency guaranteed another loan of about $700 million for a similar deal.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Export-Import Bank said, \u201cThese transactions all supported the sale of U.S. exports and thus supported American jobs.\u201dSince the sanctions took effect, the spokeswoman said, there have been no new VEB transactions, and deals involving any Russian entities have been placed on \u201cadministrative hold.\u201dThe sanctions also limited VEB\u2019s relationship with American banks. The sanctions prohibit United States banks and companies from \u201ctransacting in, providing financing for or otherwise dealing\u201d in new long-term debt.For years, issuing debt was a good business for both Wall Street and VEB. Between 2006 and 2013, Goldman, Citi and Morgan Stanley helped the Russian bank issue one bond deal after another, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Now, American banks can work for VEB only in more limited roles.JPMorgan, Citi and BNY Mellon, for example, remain registered to clear VEB\u2019s transactions through the United States, clearinghouse records show, though such transactions have waned since the sanctions were imposed. Many major American banks and investment firms also continue to include VEB debt in mutual funds, including those of Fidelity and Pimco, securities filings show.It would not be out of the ordinary, then, for a VEB official to have brief courtesy meetings with New York bankers about continuing business, though they would not be allowed to discuss new bond deals, said Aaron Wolfson, a partner at Lewis Baach who previously worked at JPMorgan and prosecuted banks for skirting sanctions.Still, Zachary K. Goldman, a former Treasury Department official who worked on financial sanctions issues, said the banks needed to be cautious.Mr. Gorkov, 48, graduated in 1994 from the university of the Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B. \u2014 a school for spies. Like many in his generation of security agents in the early post-Soviet period, he ventured into banking and the oil business.In fact, say businessmen who have worked in Russia, so many F.S.B. agents are in the upper management of state-owned companies that the roles of spy and executive blend almost seamlessly.\u201cIn Putin\u2019s Russia, they don\u2019t draw a distinction,\u201d said Mr. Amsterdam, the lawyer who represented Mr. Gorkov\u2019s former employer.Highly educated and often speaking foreign languages, former F.S.B. officers include Mr. Putin himself, senior officials throughout his government, and board members and top executives at state-run corporations.Mr. Gorkov\u2019s biography on VEB\u2019s website does not suggest he ever served in the F.S.B. The bank did not respond to questions about whether he worked for the agency.But the bank has been known to employ spies. In 2015, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington announced charges against Evgeny Buryakov, an employee at VEB\u2019s New York office, accusing him of acting as a covert agent of the S.V.R., the Russian foreign intelligence agency.At the time, the authorities suspected that some VEB managers were aware of Mr. Buryakov\u2019s spy activities, according to a person briefed on the investigation. Federal authorities recorded a conversation between the two co-defendants discussing how an S.V.R. official told Mr. Buryakov\u2019s supervisor at VEB that Mr. Buryakov was an \u201cemployee of the service.\u201dReporting was contributed by Michael Corkery, Steve Eder, Christopher Drew, Kitty Bennett and Peter Baker.Advertisement"}

The European Central Bank said it had contacted the Single Resolution Board, which was set up to handle the winding down of banks that fail. After an auction, the board selected Santander as the successful bidder.The terminations, which occurred in the past few months, were related to an internal investigation led by the law firm Perkins Coie.Bobbie Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, said the firm was focused on \u201cspecific\u201d allegations raised from a confidential hotline that Uber had set up.Eric H. Holder Jr., a former United States attorney general, and the law firm he works for, Covington & Burling, were hired to conduct a broader investigation focused on the ride-hailing company\u2019s overall culture, after Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, said in a blog post in February that she had been sexually harassed by her supervisor.The report for that investigation has been received by Uber\u2019s board, and the company has said it plans to make some of it public next week.Proponents of the partnerships say that companies can complete projects faster and more cheaply than the government. Local governments can also limit the amount of debt needed to finance the projects.But many experts say there is little hard evidence that public-private partnerships perform better over time. They add that these projects can cost the public in the end through road tolls or government payments to contractors.\u201cTaxpayers or users are going to need to pay for private infrastructure just as they need to pay for public infrastructure,\u201d said David Besanko, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois.And sometimes, private companies can get burned, too.A group led by the Australian investment bank Macquarie and the Spanish infrastructure firm Cintra ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2015 after signing a deal to lease an aging toll road in Indiana.\u2022 At G.M., Greenlight Capital had been pushing to replace three company directors and split the automaker\u2019s stock into two classes.\u2022 At Tesla, a group of Connecticut pension funds had proposed one-year terms for board members to create more independence from the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Elon Musk.She has only to look at Ford Motor, he writes, which ousted Mark Fields as chief executive last month, to realize how quickly shareholder support can disappear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Question in Battle Over \u2018Diller Island\u2019: Which Billionaire Blinks First?", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast Wednesday, the Army Corps of Engineers issued a permit for a revised plan for what is known as Pier 55, or, unofficially, Diller Island, that was designed to overcome a successful legal challenge by opponents of the project.Barry Diller, the chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, and the Hudson River Park Trust, with the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the local community board want to replace a crumbling pier at the foot of West 13th Street with an undulating platform featuring pathways, lush lawns and three venues for dance, theater and musical performances.Richard Emery, a lawyer for opponents of the project, including the nonprofit City Club of New York, said on Sunday that the new permit would prompt another lawsuit to stop the construction of the new pier on procedural and environmental grounds.\u201cI had a feeling they were going to rush the permit, given all the political forces behind it,\u201d Mr. Emery said. \u201cIt will undoubtedly result in a new challenge.\u201dThe dispute has become a war of attrition between two very wealthy men: Mr. Diller and Douglas Durst, a prominent developer whose family owns more than a dozen residential and commercial towers in Manhattan.Mr. Durst, who has served as chairman of a related fund-raising group, Friends of Hudson River Park, and has donated $1 million to it, stepped in to finance a series of lawsuits against the Pier 55 project after Riverkeeper, an environmental group that had been financing the litigation, dropped out.Mr. Durst has said that he does not like Mr. Diller\u2019s project or what he calls the \u201csecretive\u201d process through which it was initially approved. But he has tried to remain in the background of the dispute.Neither Mr. Durst nor Mr. Diller responded to requests for comment.The question now is, who will give in first?Mr. Diller said in an interview in May that he had grown \u201cambivalent\u201d about a project that he has been involved in for nearly five years. In that time, the estimated cost of building and operating the new pier has jumped to $250 million from $130 million, according to Mr. Diller and the park trust.Mr. Diller said that the only opposition is coming from the City Club, Mr. Durst and two other people.Mr. Durst has borne the financial cost of multiple lawsuits, but he could also pay a political price for opposing a project that is supported by Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Cuomo, Senator Chuck Schumer and Councilman Corey Johnson, all of whom are Democrats.\u201cIt has been a bumpy road,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a statement on Friday, \u201cbut I look forward to the day when New Yorkers from across the city can come and enjoy this remarkable open space, and all the cultural and community programming it will offer.\u201dMr. Cuomo said he \u201capplauded\u201d the Army Corps\u2019 decision to issue a modified permit for Pier 55.The park trust and the Army Corps filed notices last month indicating that they planned to appeal Judge Schofield\u2019s ruling. But the trust also filed an amended application with the Army Corps that it hoped would assuage the judge\u2019s objections. The application calls for eliminating the concrete filling that was to be used in a small number of the pilings that would support the pier and for removing a barge that was to be docked next to the structure.The Army Corps accepted the revisions and issued the new permit.

{"Headline": "Yankees Charity Neglects Stadium\u2019s Neighbors", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTen years later, however, an examination of the fund\u2019s public financial records and interviews with community members and a former administrator of the fund show that it has operated with little oversight or public accountability, neglecting those who live near the stadium and instead sending money to other, often wealthier parts of the Bronx that were not affected by the construction.The fund also regularly donates to organizations with which it shares common board members. And although the Yankees provide $35,000 a year to cover operating expenses, the fund in 2011 began to allocate 10 percent of the grants it awards to cover its own \u201cadditional administrative costs.\u201d Those costs have never been publicly explained.Many Bronx organizations say they have benefited greatly from the fund. But they are generally not in neighborhoods around the stadium. Of the $6.8 million distributed by the fund between 2008 and 2015, the last year for which records are available, only 30 percent \u2014 $2 million \u2014 went to charities occupying the same ZIP code as Yankee Stadium or four bordering ZIP codes.Such money is coveted in the neighborhood, one of the city\u2019s poorest, where millions could go a long way.Fund officials did not respond to numerous detailed email and phone messages seeking comment over the course of four months. Alice McGillion, a public relations consultant who represents the Yankees, said team officials would not comment on the fund\u2019s activities or operation.\u201cAll the other nonprofits that I know of who have grants for community organizations are very proactive in terms of alerting the community,\u201d said Joyce Hogi, who is on the board of the Bronx Museum and has been involved in local nonprofits for decades. The Yankee Stadium fund, she said, is \u201clike a deep, dark secret.\u201dAgnes Johnson, a member of the South Bronx Community Congress, a group of neighborhood activists who have tried to monitor the Yankee Stadium fund, said that \u201cthe funding and energy only goes to a select few.\u201dSerafin Mariel, the fund\u2019s chairman, has donated to the candidacies of the former Bronx borough president Adolfo Carri\u00f3n Jr., campaign finance records show. Ted Jefferson, also on the board, was chairman of Mr. Carri\u00f3n\u2019s transition team when he assumed the borough presidency in 2001.Mr. Drezin himself worked as an aide to Maria del Carmen Arroyo, a former city councilwoman who, along with Mr. Carri\u00f3n and two other elected officials, helped broker the community benefits agreement that established the fund.Ms. Arroyo said she did not remember how the board was selected. When asked about some of the board members\u2019 political ties, she said: \u201cThis is a small city. You can\u2019t go very far without knowing anyone.\u201dShe added that she believed community boards surrounding the stadium should have been the focus of the funds being disbursed.A community benefits agreement, or C.B.A., is a contract that requires developers to provide specific amenities to residents affected by a large-scale development. They have been used around the country since the early 2000s and are usually signed by the developer and a coalition of community groups. The Yankees agreement was signed only by elected officials and the team.\u201cYou could tell right away it was basically a slush fund,\u201d said Lukas Herbert, who was ousted from the local community board in 2006 after he voted against the stadium and now works as a city planner in Westchester. \u201cThe Bronx delegation got to choose who to administer the fund they created. No person who cared about good governance would come up with a system like that.\u201dAs part of the agreement, the Yankees also promised to award at least 25 percent of stadium jobs to Bronx-based businesses. The city was required to replace the forfeited parkland. It has taken more than a decade to restore approximately 84 percent of the lost green space.Miya Chen, a staff lawyer at the Partnership for Working Families Community Benefits Law Center, a network of advocacy groups that assists communities in negotiating agreements with city governments and developers, called the Yankees C.B.A. \u201ca behind-the-scenes deal, something to tokenize the community, to say on paper they were going to give the community something when in practice it\u2019s been really hard to hold the parties accountable.\u201dOver the years, at least $300,000 in grants has flowed to organizations that have shared common board members with the Yankee Stadium fund.Susan Goldy, a real estate broker in Riverdale and the fund\u2019s treasurer, also sits on the board of Riverdale Neighborhood House, a community center in the Bronx\u2019s wealthiest neighborhood, which has received $17,000 from the fund.In 2009, the fund contributed $20,000 to the New York Botanical Garden, where Mr. Mariel, the Yankee Stadium fund\u2019s chairman, is on the board of trustees.In 2010, Mr. Mariel was awarded the Spirit of the Bronx Award by the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation. The next year, the fund made a $15,000 contribution to the organization.The Yankee Stadium fund has also sent $60,000 to the Bronx CUNY Scholarship Fund, of which Mr. Mariel was a co-founder in 2006.Mr. Carri\u00f3n, Mr. Crespo, Mr. Jefferson and Ms. Goldy did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Mr. Mariel declined an interview request via the fund administrator, Veronica A. DeJesus.Although the community benefits agreement mandates that the stadium fund \u201cshall distribute a complete annual report of its activities, including contributions and impacts,\u201d no such report has ever been made publicly available. Ms. DeJesus, who has served as fund administrator since 2008 and worked with Mr. Mariel at New York National Bank for years, said in an email, \u201cAs far as annual reports, those reports are prepared and sent to the NY Yankees.\u201dMs. McGillion, a representative for the Yankees on nonteam-related issues, refused to share the reports, saying they \u201caren\u2019t our reports to give.\u201d Instead, she said in an email, \u201cThe New York Yankees provide the support with money, tickets and equipment, but as part of the agreement we expressly are not involved in the distribution to the community.\u201dAccording to Mr. Drezin, the Yankees have tried to keep the fund at arm\u2019s length since its inception.\u201cIn my day, the Yankees wanted to keep as far away from the fund as possible, and with good reason,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said their only legal responsibility is to pay the money.\u201dIn a sworn complaint sent in November 2009 to the state attorney general at the time, Andrew M. Cuomo, Mr. Drezin claimed that Mr. Mariel\u2019s interest in the fund was \u201cself-directed.\u201d When pressed on the issue recently, Mr. Drezin said he recalled \u201cat least two or three instances\u201d of Mr. Mariel offering grant money to organizations that promised to do business with his bank, although he could not provide specific examples.\u201cMariel used his chairmanship in a way that would be more beneficial to him personally than the community taken as a whole,\u201d he said.The attorney general declined to investigate. When asked for specific reasons, Doug Cohen, deputy press secretary for the attorney general, would not elaborate. \u201cThe matter regarding the complaint that Drezin sent has been resolved through private litigation. We have no comment beyond that.\u201dThe city\u2019s Department of Investigation declined to say whether there was an active investigation into the fund.Just as the fund\u2019s annual report has never been publicly released, neither have details about who receives the 15,000 game tickets that are said to be distributed every year. Audits obtained through the state attorney general\u2019s office show that the fund records the tickets as an \u201cin-kind donation\u201d in its financial statements, but does not disclose to which groups or individuals they are given.Laura Otten, director of the Nonprofit Center at La Salle University, reviewed the fund\u2019s tax filings and said she was troubled that the ticket disbursements were so opaque. \u201cThe audit note doesn\u2019t indicate that these tickets are given with the expectation of being distributed to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you have to ask, what happened to them?\u201dTo be sure, many Bronx organizations have benefited from the $6.8 million that has been distributed. SCAN New York, a youth and family services organization, has received the most money over all, netting $120,000 in donations over the years. The Bronx Children\u2019s Museum has received $45,000, the most of any organization in the Yankee Stadium ZIP code. But often the money goes to communities far from the South Bronx.In 2014, the fund sent $8,500 to the New York City Cat Coalition, a group of women helping feral cats in Eastchester, seven miles from the stadium. It has also donated at least $18,000 to two private high schools in Throgs Neck, an affluent neighborhood nine miles from the stadium.The Edgewater Athletic Association, a recreation center in a gated community in Throgs Neck, has received $29,000.Brendan McArdle, who has been in charge of the Edgewater Athletic Association for the last 27 years, said funds from the Yankee Stadium fund almost entirely sustain the existence of the organization. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how much this impacted the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout them, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be. They\u2019ve been very good to us over the years.\u201dAccording to Mr. McArdle, money from the fund paid for new swim lanes, computers, chairs, tables, tents and outdoor shelters. It also allowed Edgewater to participate in the New York Cares Winter Wishes program for the underprivileged. He said he found out about the fund via his local community board in 2010.The neighborhoods around Yankee Stadium remain some of the poorest in the country: 38.1 percent live below the poverty line, more than double the national rate and higher than in many other parts of New York City. The median household income is just over $26,000, well below average for the city.According to the most recent State of New York City\u2019s Housing and Neighborhoods, an annual report published by the N.Y.U. Furman Center, the foreclosure rate is the highest of any neighborhood in the city.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy if you think about it,\u201d said Mr. Herbert, the ousted community board member. \u201cTo have money coming in for 40 years \u2014 the Bronx has a lot of problems, and that money could do a lot of good.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Settlements for Company Sins Can No Longer Aid Other Projects, Sessions Says", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen companies settle claims of wrongdoing, they are often compelled to pay for environmental or community development projects as well as pay fines and direct compensation to victims. Sometimes the third-party payments are only marginally related to the damages caused by the company\u2019s actions.That longstanding practice is now under attack on two fronts, potentially jeopardizing a source of financing for initiatives across the country that supporters say have paid great environmental and social dividends. Critics say the practice effectively creates \u201cslush funds\u201d for favored organizations or causes.\u201cIt has come to my attention that certain previous settlement agreements involving the department included payments to various nongovernmental, third-party organizations as a condition of settlement with the United States,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cThese third-party organizations were neither victims nor parties to the lawsuits. The department will no longer engage in this practice.\u201dThe policy applies only to future cases.This year, groups including the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Americans for Prosperity, both closely linked to the libertarian billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, wrote to President Trump criticizing a recent settlement between the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department and Volkswagen.Some of the money was in effect going to pay for clean air initiatives championed by President Barack Obama, the conservative groups said, initiatives that Congress twice refused to fund.\u201cHaving been twice spurned by lawmakers, the Obama administration leveraged the Volkswagen settlement,\u201d the groups charged. All settlement money, they argued, should \u201cinstead be deposited into the U.S. Treasury.\u201dThe groups said that Congress has not authorized or provided money for electric vehicle infrastructure. They said the plan represents \u201can end-run around Congress\u2019s lawmaking power.\u201dSuch settlement funds can be appropriate in cases of environmental wrongdoing, some environmental lawyers said, because the victims are often scattered over large areas or are difficult to identify and compensate directly. At times, the government has ordered a polluter to pay for unrelated environmental restoration projects as restitution; the attorney general\u2019s order would prohibit such deals.Environmental groups say that settlement funds have gone to critical projects nationwide. The 2012 settlement with BP, in which it agreed to pay to resolve criminal charges, included more than $2 billion for projects aimed at environmental restoration in the Gulf of Mexico, and research into spill prevention and other topics. A 2015 settlement with Duke Energy allocated $4.4 million to stream and river ecosystem restoration in North Carolina.Mr. Sessions\u2019 new policy directs Justice Department lawyers not to include similar payments in settlements with corporations. \u201cThe goals of any settlement are, first and foremost, to compensate victims, redress harm, or punish and deter unlawful conduct,\u201d he said in his memo, dated June 5.The House bill, known as the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, would turn that policy into law, making it difficult for future administrations to reverse.Credit Suisse declined to comment.Frank Holleman, a senior lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that if settlement money for environmental violations goes to the Treasury Department, it may be spent on something else, and prevent restoration of or protection of an affected community or ecosystem.\u201cYou can\u2019t just dump money in the river and it gets clean,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to contribute to a nonprofit that does the work to make it that way. It\u2018s not just being thrown away or given to these entities \u2014 it\u2019s payments for a particular service.\u201dThe money has gone to a variety of environmental projects.The mitigation projects included ecosystem restoration \u2014 soil restoration in national forests, and restoration of a trout population, or revegetation of Red Spruce trees \u2014 and electric vehicle charging infrastructure and energy efficiency programs in poor areas.Neil Nissan, a spokesman for Duke Energy, said the utility does not take a position on the policy or the bill.David M. Uhlmann, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and the former chief of the environmental crimes section at the Justice Department, said, \u201cThe attorney general\u2019s directive prohibits those laudable third-party payments and, in doing so, needlessly undermines public health and environmental protection efforts.\u201dHe added, \u201dCongress can and should rely on the Justice Department and regulatory agencies to ensure that companies who commit regulatory violations make appropriate payments to remedy the harm they have caused.\u201dJohn Schwartz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Tax Cut Might Be Nice. But Remember the Deficit.", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn the debate about federal tax policy, one question looms large: Should we have a tax cut that increases the budget deficit?Mr. Trump wants to cast himself in the role of a tax-cutting Republican president, along the lines of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. But before drawing a comparison with these predecessors, let\u2019s recall the economic circumstances they faced.When Mr. Reagan moved into the Oval Office in January 1981, the economy had recently experienced a recession. The recovery was just six months old. Unemployment was still elevated at 7.5 percent.Worse yet, another downturn was on the horizon. Within six months, the economy would again be in recession. Unemployment rose to 10.8 percent at the end of 1982, its highest level since the Great Depression.In August 1981, Mr. Reagan signed into law a bill that phased in tax cuts over three years. These cuts helped usher in a robust recovery. By the end of 1988, as Mr. Reagan was leaving office, the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.3 percent.To be sure, these large tax cuts, together with the deep recession, reduced government revenue and led to sizable budget deficits. Later in his administration, with the economy in better shape, Mr. Reagan agreed to some tax increases to shrink the deficit. And when he and Congress took up the task of tax reform in 1986, they aimed to make it revenue-neutral. Lower rates were achieved by closing loopholes.When George W. Bush became president in January 2001, he faced a situation that, in some ways, was similar to that of 1981. (Disclosure: I was one of his economic advisers from 2003 to 2005.)The economy was heading toward a recession, attributable largely to the bursting of the dot-com bubble. From March 2000 to April 2001, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite average lost about two-thirds of its value. A recession officially began in March 2001. Unemployment rose from 3.9 percent at the end of 2000 to 6.3 percent by the middle of 2003. Without the tax cuts President Bush signed into law, unemployment would have probably gone higher.Yet Mr. Trump faces a vastly different set of circumstances. The economy has not experienced a recent recession. The recovery from the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2008-2009 is now eight years old.The Federal Reserve is responding to these events by raising interest rates. It believes, correctly in my judgment, that incipient inflation is a greater risk than recession. Keynesian pump-priming is not what the economy needs now.In short, Mr. Trump finds himself not in the position of Ronald Reagan in 1981 or George W. Bush in 2001 but rather of Ronald Reagan in 1986. He should follow the Reagan of the later period and aim for revenue neutrality. He should broaden the tax base, lower rates and reform the tax code to promote saving, investment and growth.A key question is how revenue neutrality is to be judged. Traditional analyses of the effects of tax proposals rely on what is known as static scoring, a method based on the simple but dubious assumption that changes in the tax code do not alter the path of national income. An alternative approach, called dynamic scoring, accounts for the possibility that lower tax rates will promote growth.Of course, not all tax cuts are typical. One virtue of dynamic scoring is that it would apply a different discount to different tax changes. For example, research suggests that modest reductions in the corporate tax rate would most likely be the most self-financing, while increases in the standard deduction would probably do little to improve incentives and promote growth.When judging revenue neutrality, policy makers will need to rely on a credible, impartial arbiter, like the Congressional Budget Office. In this era of alternative facts, it would be far too easy to pass irresponsible tax cuts and hand the bill to future generations.N.

{"Headline": "A Battle Over Prayer in Schools Tests Canada\u2019s Multiculturalism", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMISSISSAUGA, Ontario \u2014 The troubles began over sermons.For nearly two decades, Muslim students in the Peel School District, outside Toronto, had been allowed to pray independently on Fridays, part of a policy in many Canadian provinces to accommodate religious beliefs in public schools.Last fall, the school board decided to standardize the prayer sessions and offer six preapproved sermons that the children could recite, rather than let them use their own.But the dispute unleashed a storm of protest that continued through this spring.The turmoil is one reflection of how Canada\u2019s growing diversity is encountering powerful headwinds, especially in places with significant Muslim populations.\u201cAlthough we have a policy of multiculturalism, for most Canadians there is an expectation that immigrants will conform to the mainstream,\u201d said Jeffrey Reitz, the director of the Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies program at the University of Toronto. \u201cReligious accommodations have been made to various groups, and you\u2019re going to get a backlash once in a while.\u201dThe demographic changes have been especially pronounced in metropolitan Toronto, a patchwork of cities and suburban towns bustling with an array of languages and faiths.Other provinces in Canada have similar policies.For Farina Siddiqui, 43, a Muslim activist whose children attend public and Catholic schools in the Peel district, allowing students to worship once a week in school is a matter of religious freedom.\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for schools to provide a prayer hall for everyone to practice a religion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just ask for the right to have a space to pray.\u201d She supported permitting the children to write their own sermons.Tarun Arora, 40, who works for an outsourcing call center company and immigrated to Canada from India in 2003, said school boards should not be endorsing sermons or allowing prayer in his children\u2019s public schools at all. He wants the schools to be completely secular.\u201cI\u2019m sending my kids to school for education, but the schools are being treated as religious places, and this is not right,\u201d Mr. Arora said.He is a member of Keep Religion Out of Our Public Schools, also known as Kroops, a group that formed in January when the board decided to allow the children to write their own sermons. The group has protested outside recent school board meetings and says it plans to bring a lawsuit challenging the policy of allowing prayer in the Peel schools, arguing that the law does not explicitly permit it.Another group with a similar name, Religion Out of Public Schools, began an online petition to eliminate religious congregation and faith clubs in Canadian schools. It has garnered over 6,500 signatures from people across Canada and the United States.Many of the petition comments specifically criticize Islam. But in interviews, three members of the group, all of them Indian-Canadian, said they opposed the practice of any religion in public schools, not just Islam.Renu Mandhane, the chief commissioner of the Human Rights Commission, which is charged with interpreting the Ontario code, said schools had a duty to accommodate religious belief.\u201cAccommodation doesn\u2019t equal endorsing or otherwise becoming entangled in religious practice,\u201d Ms. Mandhane said. \u201cWhether that requires prayer space in school, we\u2019ve never said. What\u2019s required is we need to reasonably accommodate a person\u2019s beliefs.\u201dIn an interview, she disputed the argument made by many protesters that the policy benefits only Muslims. She noted that Jews and Christians were already accommodated because their most important days of worship fall on the weekend, when schools are closed.\u201cIn many ways, what we\u2019re seeing in Peel is the edge where human rights and hyperdiversity connect,\u201d Ms. Mandhane continued. \u201cWhat Peel shows is that even in places with huge racial diversity, you can have people who identify with different communities but disagree about human rights issues.\u201dTo the Peel school board and many Muslims in the district, the strife over religious accommodation is little more than Islamophobia.At board meetings, protesters have screamed anti-Muslim epithets, while attacks against Muslims who speak out publicly have spread on social media, leading to the stationing of police officers at the meetings and outside schools. The imam who received the death threat also got an online message calling for his mosque to be burned.During one fraught school board meeting, a man tore up pages of the Quran, stunning a community that had long prized its tradition of tolerance.\u201cThese are people trying to fuel the fire and brew our ignorances,\u201d said Rabia Khedr, executive director of the Muslim Council of Peel, which lobbied the school board in support of the students\u2019 right to pray. \u201cReligious accommodation is not at the exclusion of everybody. It\u2019s at the inclusion of everybody.\u201dAnver Saloojee, a political-science professor at Ryerson University in Toronto, has another explanation. He noted that many of those speaking out against the religious accommodation policy were members of the Indian diaspora, including some vocal Hindu nationalists, suggesting that in some ways the battle in Canada mirrors South Asia\u2019s historical Hindu-Muslim conflict.But the groups opposing accommodation, which include people from a variety of races and religions, deny that. Indian-Canadian members of the groups say their concern has nothing to do with a country they left years and in some cases decades ago.\u201cMy religion is Canadian; that\u2019s what gives me the strength to stand up and fight now,\u201d said Ram Subrahmanian, a founder of Keep Religion Out of Our Public Schools.Shaila Kibria-Carter, 42, a finance manager of Bangladeshi descent, was born and raised in Canada and lives in the nearby town of Brampton. She said that as a Peel district high school student in the 1990s, she prayed in school on Fridays. So did her college-age son. There were never any class disruptions or complaints, she said.\u201cWhat these folks are doing is preaching hate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived in harmony with Sikhs and Hindus and white people all our lives, and now all of a sudden someone is in meetings ripping up a Quran.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a political-science professor at Ryerson University.

The bank had been crippled by property loans that went bad amid the financial crisis.The government is expected to raise \u20ac3.4 billion if an overallotment of shares is fully exercised.\u201cThis successful I.P.O. has created a strong platform for the state to recover all the money it has invested in A.I.B. and to further dispose of our banking investments for the benefit of the Irish people,\u201d he added.After rescuing its banks, Ireland sought its own bailout, receiving \u20ac67.5 billion from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The country emerged from the international bailout program in 2013.After the offering, the Irish government will hold 71 percent of the bank\u2019s shares if the overallotment is fully exercised. The government had owned more than 99 percent of the lender\u2019s shares.Conditional trading of the bank\u2019s shares was expected to begin on the Irish Stock Exchange in Dublin and the London Stock Exchange on Friday, with full trading to commence on Tuesday.Allied Irish Banks is the latest bailed-out lender in Europe to return to the public markets as its fortunes have improved.ABN Amro returned to the public markets in 2015 as the Dutch government sold a 20 percent stake. And the British government exited Lloyds Banking Group in May, as part of its plan to end its ownership of British lenders bailed out during the financial crisis.Allied Irish Banks has been profitable in the last three years, reporting a pretax profit of \u20ac1.7 billion in 2016.The bank is Ireland\u2019s largest commercial and retail lender, with 2.3 million retail and small- and medium-size business customers. The bank operates in Britain and Ireland under the Allied Irish Bank and First Trust Bank brands.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Davy and Deutsche Bank are co-coordinators on the offering. Rothschild is acting as a financial adviser to the Irish government.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walmart Will Struggle to Top Amazon\u2019s Offer for Whole Foods", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsWhole Foods\u2019 filing suggests it wasn\u2019t shopped around. Amazon became serious only in late April, when the company\u2019s team signed confidentiality agreements. That means some shareholders, notably Jana Partners, an activist owner of an 8 percent stake, could be receptive to a higher price. A grocery industry buyer like Walmart could also cut costs, helping to justify paying more than the 27 percent premium Amazon is offering.Then there\u2019s the defensive value. If investors were right to sell off grocery chain stocks across the board in the United States and Europe on news of Amazon\u2019s plunge into the sector, it could be worth keeping Jeff Bezos\u2019 online giant away from Whole Foods.Walmart is one of few candidates. Its $230 billion market value dwarfs other listed United States grocers, including Target, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market, as well as Albertsons, which is private. Its balance sheet cash could in theory finance nearly half the acquisition, and with total debt at about 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, it could borrow more.Adding an upscale brand might help Walmart attract new customers and lift its grocery business. Yet that would be a change of direction. Its recent strategy has been to improve its e-commerce offering, including with Friday\u2019s deal to buy the men\u2019s clothing online retailer Bonobos.Financially, too, topping Mr. Bezos\u2019 offer would be tough. Assume Walmart is able to cut Whole Foods\u2019 operating costs by a generous 3 percent, or about $450 million a year. Taxed at 35 percent and capitalized on a multiple of 10, those savings are worth just under $3 billion today, roughly the same as Amazon\u2019s premium. Walmart would be irrational to pay more, especially since it would also have to cover a $400 million break fee.This math applies to any interloper. And even hefty cost cuts wouldn\u2019t make Whole Foods\u2019 Ebitda expand enough for the after-tax return on an acquisition to exceed the 8.6 percent weighted average cost of capital Morningstar attaches to the company. Whatever magic Mr. Bezos has in mind, his advisers have done the trick of making his deal hard to beat.Advertisement"}

But critics say it is intended mainly to stifle independent points of view and to stigmatize as unpatriotic those groups that receive support from Western philanthropists and foundations.Mr. Orban drew a link between the new legislation and Mr. Soros, a major funder of programs that promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\u201cThere is an important element in public life in Hungary which is not transparent and not open \u2014 and that is the Soros network, with its mafia-style operation and its agentlike organizations,\u201d Mr. Orban said on state radio this month, referring to the philanthropic Open Society Foundations financed by Mr. Soros.\u201cThe Hungarian people,\u201d Mr. Orban added, \u201chave the right to know who represents what and to what end, and what goals they seek to achieve through their operations.\u201dPolitical opponents said Mr. Orban\u2019s government should itself be scrutinized for its ties to Russia.John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International\u2019s Europe director, referring to nongovernmental organizations, said that \u201cthreadbare attempts to disguise this law as being necessary to protect national security cannot hide its real purpose: to stigmatize, discredit and intimidate critical NGOs and hamper their vital work.\u201d\u201cThis latest assault on civil society,\u201d he added, \u201cis aimed at silencing critical voices within the country, has ominous echoes of Russian\u2019s draconian \u2018foreign agents\u2019 law and is a dark day for Hungary.\u201dMore recently, the Hungarian government circulated a nationwide questionnaire, under the slogan \u201cLet\u2019s Stop Brussels,\u201d to consult citizens on European Union policy. One section stated: \u201cMore and more organizations that are funded from abroad are working in Hungary with the goal of meddling in domestic affairs in a untransparent way. Those operations can be a danger to our independence.\u201d It then asked whether respondents thought the government should require such groups to register or to allow them to continue \u201ctheir hazardous operations without control.\u201dCritics called the exercise laughable.Legislators made some amendments after that report. For example, the identity of any single foreign donor of up to 500,000 forints, or $1,800, will not have to be published.Organizations that fail to comply with the law could be fined or dissolved.Hatter Society, a group that supports Hungarian gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights, gets more than 90 percent of its funding from abroad.Tamas Dombos, a board member, said he was worried that the government efforts to \u201cchange the public perception of foreign-funded NGOs as being foreign agents might eventually have an impact, though so far we have seen none.\u201dMr. Dombos said his group was already committed to financial openness, disclosing its sources of income in its annual reports.\u201cThis law is obviously not about transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is that we\u2019ll have to deal with a lot more bureaucracy \u2014 and this could be part of the government\u2019s strategy. The goal is to make the work of NGOs that are critical of the government much harder, if not impossible.\u201dAn earlier version of this article inaccurately described the format of the information on Hungarian grants provided by the Open Society.

Instead, Target is now leading a new investment in Casper \u2014 as the mattress maker aims for an initial public offering down the road.\u201cThe reality that we face is that a vast majority of people don\u2019t know that we exist,\u201d Philip Krim, Casper\u2019s chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Partnering with Target, Mr. Krim said, will help change that.The new round values Casper at approximately $750 million, not including the new investment, according to a person with knowledge of the financing. Mr. Krim declined to comment on the valuation.Mr. Krim said there was no fixed timetable for his company going public. But should Casper opt for an I.P.O., it would be one of only a few consumer-facing companies to seek the public markets over the past year.For Mr. Krim, his company has proved that it can carve out a niche in the sleep industry. He said that Casper more than doubled sales last year, to over $200 million, though he declined to discuss whether it is profitable.The company\u2019s origins are well-known within the retail set. Mr. Krim and his co-founders argued that the traditional way of buying mattresses \u2014 going to a retailer like Sleep Train, for example \u2014 was hugely uncomfortable and very expensive. So they instead began selling a memory-foam mattress online that arrived in a modest-size box.\u201cThey are gaining a much higher market potential,\u201d Eduardo Holschneider, a managing general partner of Tresalia, a Mexican investment firm that took part in the new fund-raising. \u201cPeople are really concerned about wellness.\u201dTarget was particularly interested in how Casper has blossomed as a primarily online-only venture.\u201cHow the two experiences connect together is something we\u2019re focused on at Target, and we believe working with Casper will uncover insights and open up possibilities on both sides,\u201d Brian Cornell, Target\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cI think we have a lot to learn from each other along the way.\u201dThe new financing round also included previous investors like New Enterprise Associates, and celebrities including Kevin Spacey and the basketball player Carmelo Anthony, who said that sleep was \u201can essential piece to competing at the highest level in my profession.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fear of a Monopoly Will Help Amazon\u2019s Cloud Rivals", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsFear of no choice is starting to help Amazon\u2019s cloud rivals.Amazon\u2019s web-services division has monopoly-like features \u2014 it is huge and growing, and size makes it operationally and financially more efficient. Yet Jeff Bezos\u2019 company won\u2019t walk away with all the spoils. Customers are worried about being locked in, and that will keep competitors in business.Companies have come to realize it is simpler, cheaper and more convenient to store data and run applications on servers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsofts. Uncertainty over the cost implications is receding rapidly, according to surveys conducted by Bain and Morgan Stanley and highlighted by Kleiner Perkins\u2019s Mary Meeker in her annual \u201cInternet Trends\u201d presentation last week.The providers of cloud services have grown rapidly as a result. First-quarter revenue at Amazon Web Services was about 3.5 times as big as in the same period three years ago. At $3.7 billion for the period, it accounted for more than 10 percent of Amazon\u2019s total sales, and it was by far the most profitable slice. The operating margin for Amazon Web Services has nearly doubled over the last two years to around 25 percent.Not coincidentally, information technology managers have started to worry about the difficulty of switching cloud suppliers \u2014 a particular problem if one outfit, like Amazon Web Services, comes to dominate. This concern rocketed between 2012 and 2015, according to Ms. Meeker, with the proportion of respondents bothered by it surging from 7 percent to 22 percent.As in other sectors including, for instance, finance, companies will often ensure that at least two suppliers of each service stay in business, to retain the option of shifting between the two and maintain price competition. This doesn\u2019t always happen in technology. Alphabet\u2019s Google will, for example, claim 78 percent of United States search revenue this year, eMarketer estimated.For all the market sway enjoyed by Amazon Web Services, that means enterprises will want Microsoft and Alphabet to stay in the game.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Democrats Regroup, Spotlight Turns to New Jersey Governor\u2019s Race", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNION CITY, N.J. \u2014 The door cracked open slightly, about as far as the chain lock allowed, and Philip D. Murphy hunched over to peer inside.\u201cDo you think there\u2019s some trepidation with these families opening their door given the age of Donald Trump and deportation?\u201d he asked, addressing no one in particular.While a handful of congressional and mayoral special elections have attracted outsize national attention, Mr. Murphy is vying for one of the two big statewide electoral prizes this year following Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.In a party searching for direction in the populist era sparked by Mr. Trump, Mr. Murphy is something of a throwback to the pre-Occupy Wall Street period. A former Goldman Sachs banker who won his first political job \u2014 ambassador to Germany \u2014 by raising millions of dollars for the Democratic Party, he looks at first glance more like a traditional Democrat.As he seeks to navigate a party confronting anti-Wall Street populism and the liberalism embodied by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Murphy, 59, has opted to steer an uneasy course, somewhere to the left of Hillary Clinton but bearing right of Mr. Sanders.\u201cI think we\u2019ve done a really good job of avoiding that civil war almost entirely,\u201d he said in an interview.Still, New Jersey, which hosts one of just two statewide elections in 2017, is not necessarily the best barometer of the party\u2019s future. Democratic voters significantly outnumber their Republican counterparts, Mrs. Clinton easily beat Mr. Trump here, and Mr. Murphy\u2019s November opponent, Kim Guadagno, the lieutenant governor, must deal with the fact that she served under Chris Christie, who is leaving office as one of the most unpopular governors in recent times. No matter how he frames his campaign, or whether his 23-year tenure at Goldman Sachs hurts him among liberal voters, Mr. Murphy enjoys a clear advantage in what is not considered a swing state.As for many Democrats in solidly blue territory, Mr. Murphy has seized on Mr. Trump as the ultimate rationale to cast a vote. One more Democratic governor, he tells crowds, can be a check to an out-of-control White House on issues like immigration and the environment.Other Democrats have also sought to elevate the significance of the New Jersey race. \u201cThe American people are with us, we just got to start talking to them again, and this is the man who knows how to do it,\u201d former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said at a rally for Mr. Murphy. \u201cThis is a man who will not only lead New Jersey, he will help lead America.\u201dThroughout the day, his BlackBerry buzzed incessantly with texts and emails from national political figures, including John D. Podesta, the former chairman of the Clinton campaign. At night, as Mr. Murphy was winding his way through a hotel kitchen toward the stage to deliver his victory speech, he received a congratulatory call from another major Democratic figure, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia.The next morning, as he made thank-you calls to mayors and county leaders, he fielded calls of advice and support from former President Barack Obama and Mr. Biden, and had a long phone conversation with Mrs. Clinton.Though Mr. Murphy\u2019s views lean progressive, he tempers some of the more idealistic elements of the platform with his state\u2019s budget realities.Health care is a \u201cright,\u201d he said, without missing a beat.But probably more doable at the federal level.\u201cThe problem is in New Jersey or at any state level, maybe you\u2019ve seen different math than I have, but it\u2019s jaw-droppingly expensive,\u201d he said referring to health care. \u201cAre we open to it at the state level? Absolutely. But it\u2019s billions of dollars a year.\u201dThe same goes for education. He embraces fundamental progressive ideas, like universal preschool and tuition-free community college.But only once the economy improves.\u201cIf we are able to grow at this rate, and find these sources, we\u2019re left with surpluses,\u201d he said, explaining the economic expansion he believes will take place under his policies. \u201cSo we want to also take that and the first steps toward phasing in universal pre-K and free community college.\u201dRunning alongside his progressive streak is a degree of pragmatism. He counts Lyndon B. Johnson as a political role model, along with Robert F. Kennedy. He admires Mr. Kennedy for his \u201ccalls to service,\u201d and Mr. Johnson for his accomplishments.\u201cAll that ideology is well and good, but Lyndon Johnson got stuff done,\u201d he said. \u201cThis state needs a leader who not only stands for the right things but gets stuff done.\u201dThat\u2019s why he has made what he considers his most tangible goals the priority of his potential first days in office. Those include fulfilling the state\u2019s $7.5 million commitment to Planned Parenthood, which he says is a modest sum of money, and signing into law a bill in the Democratic-controlled Legislature that would strengthen gun control.But at the top of Mr. Murphy\u2019s list is addressing New Jersey\u2019s last-place ranking among states in the amount of federal money it receives compared with the taxes it sends to Washington. He believes that can be dealt with by working more closely with the state\u2019s congressional delegation.He\u2019s also prepared to use a potential bully pulpit to try to help turn some of the vulnerable Republican seats in the state to Democrats in 2018.\u201cMacArthur and Rodney, I mean these guys know better, and they think they can get away with being one thing in New Jersey and another in Washington,\u201d he said, referring to Representatives Tom MacArthur and Rodney Frelinghuysen, adding, \u201cThese guys have to pay a political price for the votes they\u2019ve taken.\u201dThough his goal is to claim the State House in Trenton, Mr. Murphy is well aware of the bigger spotlight now shining on him, and he is projecting himself as a candidate not just with New Jersey credentials, but one who can speak to the country.As he practiced his speeches \u2014 one for victory and one for defeat \u2014 two hours before polls closed, he leaned over a chipped wooden lectern in a nondescript Newark hotel room to run a last-second addition to his speech by his staff.\u201cI want to say something about Ramadan,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to say salaam aleikum.\u201dHis aides nodded in approval.\u201cAfter I do the Dr. King \u2018judge people from the inside,\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018And in that respect, I want to wish all of our Muslim brothers and sisters tonight who are celebrating the month of Ramadan, salaam aleikum and Ramadan Mubarak.\u2019\u201dWhat went unmentioned in his speech was his tenure at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank often vilified by Mr. Sanders and the progressive movement.Mr. Murphy casts off the criticism of his tenure at the bank, which he retired from in 2003, as an obsession held by the news media and his opponents, and not by voters. He said he was surprised by the negative tone that came from his Democratic rivals late in the primary campaign.\u201cIt got nastier than I actually thought it would, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve not done this before so I\u2019m probably the least qualified person to pass judgment on this.\u201dIndeed, Ms. Guadagno immediately seized on his background as she started a \u201cMain Street, not Wall Street\u201d campaign swing across the state in the days after Tuesday\u2019s election.How his tenure as a Wall Street banker plays out in the general election remains to be seen. Mr. Murphy promises that he will not be \u201cchanging my stripes\u201d in the coming months, even though more than just the voters in New Jersey may be watching.As he practiced his speech, he paused again at a line describing when Mr. Obama named him ambassador to Germany in which he emphasized that \u201cdespite what Donald Trump thinks\u201d Germany is \u201cone of our most important and dependable allies in the world.\u201dHe turned to his top aides and, referring to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said, \u201cI got the word to Merkel I was going to say that tonight if I won.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Women Don\u2019t See Themselves as Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewFor many Americans, starting their own business is the manifestation of the American dream: Take a risk, work hard, get rich. So why don\u2019t more women do it?\u201cWomen are just outside of those established networks, and if you\u2019re outside the networks, you don\u2019t get the knowledge, you don\u2019t get the opportunities, you don\u2019t get the contacts and you don\u2019t get the funding,\u201d said Susan Coleman, a business professor at the University of Hartford and co-author of the Third Way report. She wrote it with Alicia Robb, a research fellow at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the founder of Next Wave Ventures, for female angel investors.Women are also left out of financing networks, which are predominantly male and often operate through referrals from friends. They are more likely to invest their own money instead of outside capital in their businesses, and when they seek investors, they ask for less.Networks are important for another reason: emotional support. \u201cLaunching an entrepreneurial venture is a lonely and sometimes scary undertaking, and you need to have people to talk to,\u201d Ms. Coleman said.Incubators \u2014 physical spaces where people start businesses and meet other entrepreneurs as well as lawyers, accountants and investors \u2014 don\u2019t help. In a study of 18,000 firms started in incubators, only 6 percent were by women.Jennifer Dionisio said she had no female role models when she started her company, Three Sisters Farm and Dairy, last year. She sells goat milk and beef, and she hopes to start a cheese shop and farm-to-table restaurant.Living in a small town, Pueblo, Colo., made it easier, she said, because she knows the local lawyer and bankers. \u201cI would be apprehensive if I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. Even so, she says, people at the local feed store assume she can\u2019t load bags of feed or drive tractors, and others come to the farm and ask for her boss.She said she was trying to be a role model for her three daughters. She named the farm after them and hopes they will take over someday. \u201cThen they can work for themselves, be independent and still make a living,\u201d she said. \u201cEven my 7-year-old daughter can run a Bobcat\u201d tractor now.Silicon Valley is even more of a bubble than the rest of small-business America.They wanted to find out whether the problem was not enough women with the education, training or desire to start companies, or whether it was factors like bias or closed-off networks.They concluded there were plenty of qualified women. Women earn 40 percent to 50 percent of degrees in science and engineering, and they represent 30 percent of the software industry work force. But they are less likely to have information about how to become an entrepreneur, to see female role models and to know venture capitalists.Female venture capitalists are more likely to invest in female entrepreneurs, Mr. Gompers has found. Yet 91 percent of venture capitalists are male. Eighty-six percent are white, and 11 percent are Asian. Most worked in investment banking, private equity or consulting, and went to Harvard, Stanford or the University of Pennsylvania.Unsurprisingly, the backgrounds of venture-backed entrepreneurs are pretty much the same. Ninety-one percent are men, 80 percent are white and 16 percent are Asian. Most have degrees from a similar set of colleges and have worked at big tech companies like Google or Microsoft.\u201cThe problem when you have five white men who all went to the same business school and worked in the same firms is their networks overlap, so they don\u2019t draw from a very wide source of entrepreneurial deal flow,\u201d Mr. Gompers said.Sheila Lirio Marcelo, the founder of Care.com, a service for helping families find caregivers, was surprised to see that insularity after growing up in the Philippines, where both her parents started businesses. She said one of the most important things she did was seek out male role models and mentors, not just women.\u201cClosing the gender gap in business is often a conversation that women have with other women,\u201d she said. \u201cWe absolutely need to provide a supportive community for each other, but if we\u2019re truly going to level the playing field, men have to be part of the equation.\u201dShe also advised women to develop thicker skin. \u201cMen tend to shake off rejection more quickly than women,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s absolutely true that entrepreneurs are made or broken by how they bounce back from adversity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Macron\u2019s Blessing, France Unveils a Sweeping Ethics Overhaul", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bayrou announced a number of measures, some of which will require a revision of the country\u2019s constitution. They include: imposing a limitation on public mandates; forbidding nepotism; reinforcing scrutiny over the financing of public parties and the use of public money; imposing stronger penalties against culpable politicians; as well as creating a public bank to finance political parties.A number of the steps have often been promoted by anticorruption organizations and lawmakers, but none have ever become law.\u201cFor years, we have seen practices develop that have imperiled, cracked and fractured the trust citizens must have in their elected representatives and provoked a profound exasperation among the French,\u201d Mr. Bayrou said.\u201cNo one can imagine that a bill will make every actor in public life or all citizens virtuous,\u201d the minister said, adding later that he personally did not believe in \u201cindividual virtue,\u201d but in \u201cinstitutions.\u201dMost of the legislation \u2014 which consists of numerous measures targeting members of the government, members of Parliament and political parties, both symbolically and practically \u2014 will be discussed in Parliament this summer in parallel with a public consultation, Mr. Bayrou said.If approved, one symbolic measure would do away with \u201cdouble standards\u201d by suppressing a special court made of Parliament members and Supreme Court justices that considers criminal cases against government officials.The same measure would forbid officials from holding the same public office for three consecutive terms. Also, members of the government \u2014 who currently can hold elective offices at different levels \u2014 would have to choose between their local and national mandates.Another law would redirect a special budget allotted to members of Parliament to a public fund, forbid them from hiring their partners or members of their family, and limit their ability to run consulting activities while in office.All are currently common practices among lawmakers, and they have been increasingly criticized as a sign of the disconnect between the struggling public and the elite.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Nicolas Bay, a member of the National Front, said this morning on the French radio network RTL. \u201cIt saves us from having banks decide who can be a candidate or not.\u201dIf passed by Parliament, the legislation would amount to a small revolution for France, which some say never truly abolished its feudal system of privileges.Asked repeatedly by reporters about Mr. Ferrand\u2019s case, Mr. Bayrou read from a voluminous copy of the French criminal code to back his decision not to comment on the legal proceedings, citing the separation of powers.The stakes are high for the new government. Mr. Macron needs to earn a majority in Parliament during the two-stage legislative elections this month if he wants to push through an ambitious overhaul of labor laws and steer France toward more European integration.Current polls are giving Mr. Macron a clear lead over the other parties, but experts warn they may not reflect the impact the Ferrand case might be having on public opinion.\u201cWill we have an ideal text?\u201d Mr. Bayrou asked as he concluded his news conference on Thursday. \u201cNo. Will we have a text that prevents all incidents?

{"Headline": "Is Putin Getting What He Wanted With Trump?", "Date": "2017-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIn the Senate last week, Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, asked the fired F.B.I. director James Comey if he had \u201cany doubt that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 elections.\u201d Mr. Comey responded with a single word: \u201cNone.\u201dIndeed, he went on to tell the American public that the Russians \u201cdid it with purpose, they did it with sophistication, they did it with overwhelming technical efforts.\u201d And he warned: \u201cThey will be back,\u201d adding, \u201cthey are coming after America.\u201dVodka shots in the Kremlin, right? Not exactly.Doubtless Vladimir Putin continues to derive satisfaction from having assaulted American democracy and embarrassed Hillary Clinton. But the Russian president had one paramount priority: to lift Western sanctions.The sanctions, passed in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, have been effective at preventing key Russian individuals and businesses from obtaining financing and critical technology. Now, even though Mrs. Clinton managed on her own to lose a winnable election, Mr. Putin is likely to get hammered with reinforced sanctions further targeting his circle of capos, state companies and cybercriminals.So it\u2019s unwelcome news for Mr. Putin, to say the least, that the United States Senate is not only unlikely to lift sanctions on Russia but also well on its way to strengthening them. Word from Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, is that a final bill would pass overwhelmingly and that the votes will likely be there in the House, too, to override a presidential veto. When sanctions were imposed in 2014 and reinforced in late 2016, they took the form of an executive order, but if Mr. Graham and his colleagues have their way, the new, tougher sanctions regime will become law.The senators leading the way are right on the policy: Russia needs to pay a significant price for its cyberwarfare against the United States and other adversaries need to be deterred. Mr. Putin\u2019s aim is the survival of his regime. Russia\u2019s longer-term grand strategy, such as it is, consists of hoping that the West weakens or even collapses, and helping that dissolution along. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.As our lawmakers put financial pressure on Moscow, the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and the special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating allegations that the Trump campaign might have coordinated with Russian intelligence on the hacking and tarnishing of the Clinton campaign. Americans will eventually learn the truth.But we don\u2019t need to wait for their official reports to know that the notion that the Russians sought out the help of the Trump campaign is hilarious. It would be like LeBron James asking me for shooting tips. I play pickup, but c\u2019mon.Anyone who knows the likes of Carter Page or Roger Stone, or even more seasoned bumblers like Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, would laugh at the idea that the Russians needed their assistance. Did some of the characters in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle seek to ratchet up their status or fatten their wallets by sucking up to Russians and wittingly or unwittingly expose themselves to foreign intelligence operatives? Maybe. Yet the collusion story is ultimately a sideshow. What\u2019s consequential is the tale of Russia\u2019s penetration of Trumpworld in order to try to influence United States policy.Mr. Putin may be strategically vacuous \u2014 look at Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela \u2014 but he is tactically agile, particularly when it comes to covert ops. Mr. Trump, for many years, was talking to Russian oligarchs and, according to Russian officials, became a walking listening device for the Kremlin. Is it true? We shall learn in due course, when penetration rather than collusion rightly takes center stage.But who needs blackmail when Mr. Trump has genuine affection for strongmen like Mr. Putin (see also: Egypt, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia). His corresponding dislike for democratic and female leaders like Angela Merkel, who happen to be constrained by the rule of law, also seems sincere. Furthermore, it is possible that the president has implored various government officials to deny collusion publicly because there was none on his part, and he views the frenzy over it as a concerted effort to delegitimize his election victory. (To some extent, it is.) Mr. Comey\u2019s shrewd performance under oath on Thursday, however, amplified the prospect that Mr. Trump\u2019s ham-handedness will mire his presidency in charges of obstruction of justice.An investigation into Trumpworld for collusion, moreover, could morph into the equivalent of looking for bacteria on a pile of dung. Large parts of the overpriced real estate sector involve money laundering, with Russian, Chinese, Arab and even Iranian money.That said, the irony is that Mr. Trump\u2019s Putinophilia is correct in an unwitting way: The United States needs Russia inside the international order for its own security and global stability. Attempted isolation, which President Obama pursued, failed spectacularly. The 2016 election interference was a dramatic reminder that Russia is out there and must be reckoned with. A policy of waiting for the \u201cinevitable\u201d regime collapse from its economic failures misunderstands how Russia works. The only viable option is to engage. But contra Mr. Trump, that must be done from a position of strength.What will come of Mr. Trump? Beyond the infamous associates of his chaos campaign, he has assembled numerous outstanding individuals in his administration, and the more I interact with them the more I feel they are characters in a Greek tragedy, whose central figure suffers from a ruinous character flaw. Last week, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to sideline him, Mr. Comey returned to the stage, and his part in the drama won\u2019t end any time soon. Unlike Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump\u2019s fate will be determined by the institutions of our democracy, which have proved more resilient than perhaps all but our 18th-century founding fathers anticipated.Stephen Kotkin is a history professor at Princeton and a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Investors Flexed Their Muscles in Uber Fight", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The conventional wisdom in the world of Silicon Valley start-ups has been that the founders call the shots and that the investors are cheerleaders \u2014 and sometimes enablers \u2014 of the entrepreneurs they backed.\u201cThe examples people cite of founders having all of the power are exceptions,\u201d said Lenny Mendonca, a senior partner emeritus at the consulting firm McKinsey. \u201cIf investors are worried about returns, they engage. They take control. And that\u2019s what happened at Uber.\u201dThe balance of power at young tech companies has long been a delicate issue. Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem relies on founders\u2019 and investors\u2019 getting along \u2014 the entrepreneurs come up with the ideas and need the financiers\u2019 money while the financiers need the founders to help them strike it rich. Over time, who holds the upper hand has shifted back and forth.In recent years, the pendulum has swung decidedly in the direction of entrepreneurs. As with most things in the Valley, the reason is money. In 2016, $333.5 billion was directed into the venture capital industry, compared with $213.7 billion in 2006, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association and Pitchbook.That has allowed entrepreneurs to have their choice of investors. And they have been able to demand provisions that benefited them financially and cemented their control.About a decade ago, for example, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, got his early financial backer, the venture capitalist Jim Breyer, to agree to a board structure that gave Mr. Zuckerberg control. Facebook\u2019s success has been used to support the idea that good things happen when founders lead and investors stay quiet.But then few companies ever match Facebook\u2019s success. Some start-up founders, like David Byttow at the defunct app Secret and Andrew Mason of the online deals company Groupon, were allowed to cash millions of dollars out of their companies long before anyone could call their start-ups a success.\u201cBecause companies have been able to raise capital from all of these sources at high valuations, there has been a delay in the growing-up process,\u201d said Jeffrey Bussgang, a general partner at the venture firm Flybridge Capital Partners and a professor at Harvard Business School.Founders have increasingly taken control of the voting rights at their companies as well. The percentage of company financing rounds that gave extra voting rights to founders and early investors nearly doubled from 2014 to 2016 \u2014 to about 39 percent, from 20 percent \u2014 according to data from the law firm Fenwick & West.Mr. Kalanick and a cohort of early employees owned stock with 10 votes for every share, according to Uber\u2019s corporate charter.While such provisions have given the impression that founders are firmly in charge, the reality is different. In an acrimonious situation, it could be difficult for the founder to exercise the control that he or she technically has.A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder.At Uber, Mr. Kalanick may have had a path to outvoting the investors who asked for his resignation, including Benchmark, First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments.But that would have come with risk: Winning that battle could have meant burning bridges with powerful Silicon Valley investors he might need help from somewhere down the line. Alienating Fidelity risked Uber\u2019s relationship with the powerful mutual fund, whose support would be key should the company trade its shares on public markets.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that founder power peaked in 2015 and we\u2019ve been two years into normalizing,\u201d said Paul Martino, a partner at the venture firm Bullpen Capital. \u201cWe\u2019re not in an investor-friendly environment, but we\u2019ve certainly moved closer to the center.\u201dMr. Martino said there was a big difference between being supportive of founders and ceding absolute control to them. \u201cIf a board can\u2019t hire and fire the C.E.O., why is there a board?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is their only job.\u201dWhile investors can push out founders, they are aware that start-up dynamics still favor entrepreneurs. If venture firms want to court the best ones, they need to have a reputation for playing nice.When venture investors become board members at a very young company, they can think about their funds and founders first, but later on they have fiduciary responsibility to all shareholders, Mr. Bussgang said.\u201cBill Gurley was not speaking as an individual Benchmark partner, but as someone who represented the interests of a broad group,\u201d Mr. Bussgang said. \u201cHe exerted leadership through influence by rallying other investors.\u201dGiving up voting control to Mr. Kalanick caused headaches for the company\u2019s board and investors, but Mr. Martino said the episode was unlikely to deter companies and investors from giving that power to founders. \u201cTravis didn\u2019t try to start a war with the investors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get our teachable moment.\u201dBut entrepreneurs may have. Mr. Bussgang said the executives he worked with had been closely watching the Uber saga. \u201cThey recognize that it\u2019s not helpful to grow up later,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Paths Arise for Democrats in Race for Virginia\u2019s Governor", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEESBURG, Va. \u2014 Tom Perriello acknowledges that he is running the most progressive campaign for governor in modern Virginia history. He speaks stirringly about undocumented immigrants who fear deportation and transgender teenagers who face a \u201cbullier in chief,\u201d while vowing to put \u201ccommunity policing ahead of paramilitary policing\u201d and to confront the state\u2019s utility giant.At a Loudoun County Democrats meeting last week in this booming Washington exurb, it was easy to see why leading liberals such as Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have endorsed the upstart candidate.Yet while Mr. Perriello\u2019s call to arms drew an enthusiastic ovation, it did not sway Matt Leslie, who long ago committed to Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the other Democrat in the race. Mr. Northam came to Loudoun County two years ago to raise money for Mr. Leslie\u2019s boss, a member of the county board.\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to pull out some new voters if he\u2019s going to catch up with the lead Northam has,\u201d Mr. Leslie said.The closely contested primary, which will be decided on June 13, has emerged as the most significant intraparty Democratic contest yet in the Trump era. Mr. Perriello, a one-term House member who was turned out in 2010, is testing whether party activists in a tradition-bound state that typically rewards political moderation will respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency by rallying to the candidate mounting the most unapologetically liberal and Trump-focused campaign.The race has assumed importance beyond Virginia\u2019s borders because it will offer broader insights into the nature of politics today: How much, or how little, do traditional markers of strength, like endorsements, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and fund-raising, even matter in statewide elections?\u201cIf we can show that they have unleashed a new political energy in key swing states like Virginia, some of those Republicans in Congress will start to distance themselves from the hate and bigotry and, frankly, incompetence of the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Perriello implored the Loudoun Democrats.New Jersey is the only other state electing a governor this year, but it is Virginia, which has swung toward Democrats in presidential races yet remains competitive down the ballot, that will be looked to as an early barometer for how voters respond to the political scene across the Potomac River.The winner of the Democratic contest will most likely face Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chair and Washington lobbyist, in the general election.By the traditional rules of primaries, Mr. Northam should not be vulnerable to a challenger. He has the endorsement of every Democratic statewide officeholder and state legislator in Virginia, as well as powerful interest groups like Naral Pro-Choice America and the Virginia Education Association. He has raised more money, and he has effectively been running for governor since being sworn in as lieutenant governor four years ago, appearing at 180 events for other Democrats and picking up countless chits along the way.And since state law bans the sitting governor, currently the Democrat Terry McAuliffe, from seeking a second consecutive term, Mr. Northam is effectively the incumbent.But Mr. Perriello, who has found over half of his campaign financing from out-of-state, is betting that his party is hungry for something more than continuity in the Trump era.\u201cWhen Democrats run on change, we win,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we run on the status quo, we generally lose.\u201dA former state senator, Mr. Northam, 57, is not running as a moderate alternative to Mr. Perriello, 42, but as a consensus-oriented insider who knows his way around Richmond, the state capital.\u201cThe next governor has to hit the ground running, they need to have an agenda of what they want to get done, and they\u2019ve got to have relationships with legislators and know how to get things done,\u201d Mr. Northam told a group of progressive activists gathered near Mount Vernon last week.\u201cThis is an election for the next governor of Virginia,\u201d he continued in response to question about his opponent\u2019s out-of-state supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Vermont.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s decision to wade in for Mr. Perriello not only offered a contrast to the deep establishment support Mr. Northam enjoys, it also prompted suggestions that the clash was evolving into a replay of last year\u2019s Democratic presidential primary.But this contest may better resemble an earlier presidential nomination fight: the epic contest between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\u201cThe closest comparison is the \u201908 race in terms of a candidate with institutional support versus the insurgent,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a national Democratic strategist reared in Richmond.Mr. Perriello\u2019s backers, not surprisingly given the 2008 results, welcome the analogy. The one-time congressman lost his seat largely for embracing the Obama agenda, and his comeback effort bears echoes of the former president whose State Department he worked for in recent years. Mr. Perriello calls for a new politics beyond traditional left-and-right lines and dismisses what he calls a lazy \u201c\u201990s mind-set\u201d about what is and is not possible. The primary, he said, is turning on \u201cwhether we need small change or big change.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve actually been talking about the issues of automation and the monopolization of the economy,\u201d Mr. Perriello said in an interview, \u201cand the number of times the media covers that has been next to zero because it\u2019s a new set of issues they don\u2019t understand.\u201dBut Mr. Obama ultimately bested Mrs. Clinton because, unlike anti-establishment candidates in other Democratic primaries, including Senator Sanders, he was able to forge a coalition that linked educated white progressives and black voters.Mr. Perriello has yet to prove that he can do the same, and the biggest impediment to his doing so has been Mr. Obama himself. While he stands by his praise of the former lawmaker from a 2010 rally, video that Mr. Perriello has made into an ad, Mr. Obama does not want to create a precedent of engaging in primaries and has denied Mr. Perriello a coveted endorsement.In a sign of how potent a force Mr. Obama remains with African-Americans, and the degree to which he could have upended the race, Mr. Northam telephoned former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to ensure the former president\u2019s neutrality, according to three Democrats briefed on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Acknowledging the conversation, Mr. Northam said he told Mr. Holder, a close friend of the former president, that he had been the second elected official in Virginia (after then-Gov. Tim Kaine) to endorse Mr. Obama in the run-up to the 2008 primary. (In fact, other Virginia Democrats backed Mr. Obama before Mr. Northam.)\u201cI just reminded Attorney General Holder that I had been very loyal, as has my wife, too, to President Obama,\u201d Mr. Northam said. \u201cThat message got back to him.\u201dWithout Mr. Obama\u2019s backing, Mr. Perriello has scrambled to appeal to African-Americans, who could make up about a third of the primary vote, with a robust economic and criminal justice agenda. He is wagering that the \u201cinstitutional gatekeepers\u201d in Virginia\u2019s black community have no more clout than those African-American leaders who backed Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Obama in 2008.But Mr. Perriello allows that he is no Barack Obama, and he has bowed to some of those same gatekeepers.He appeared last month at a black church in the suburbs of Richmond, a crucial battleground, and surprised the pastor by staying for the entire service. Tyrone E. Nelson, the minister at Sixth Mount Zion Baptist, had already endorsed Mr. Northam.\u201cIn central Virginia, as it relates to African-Americans, they just don\u2019t really know Tom,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.That is the other key way this race differs from a presidential primary: Statewide primaries can turn on relationships or connections to the candidates themselves.This is particularly the case in an odd-year primary held in June, when colleges have emptied out for the summer and many voters are on vacation. Mr. Perriello is cognizant of his challenge in a friends-and-neighbors primary. He is hoping to broaden the electorate beyond the 319,000 voters who cast ballots in 2009, the last time Virginia Democrats had a contested campaign for governor.\u201cWhen we started the race, we thought if we changed the electorate we would win, with the old electorate we lose,\u201d Mr. Perriello said. \u201cNow if we change the electorate we definitely win, and with the old electorate we\u2019re at about 50-50.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Cup: How Emirates New Zealand Was Able to Rout Oracle Team USA", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMILTON, Bermuda \u2014 Many a well-financed maritime expedition has come to grief through the centuries in the treacherous and deep blue water off Bermuda.Oracle Team USA joined the list on Monday, as the challenger Emirates Team New Zealand and its crew of young newcomers finished off a surprisingly lopsided 7-1 victory to reclaim the America\u2019s Cup 14 years after losing it.The final race was yet another rout. Team New Zealand trailed at the first mark, but its superior boat speed and its slicker, more intuitive crew work helped the team dominate after that, finishing 55 seconds ahead of the Americans.It was a day of redemption for the Kiwis, who blew a seemingly insurmountable 8-1 lead against Oracle in the last America\u2019s Cup, in San Francisco in 2013, by losing eight consecutive races.\u201cIt was absolutely brutal for the team, and it was a hard pill to swallow,\u201d said Team New Zealand\u2019s skipper, Glenn Ashby, who was the only member of that losing team on this year\u2019s crew. \u201cFor the sailors and all the other guys who are with the team, it is a great redemption and, I guess, a relief to right the wrongs of the last campaign.\u201dTo survive and remain in the game, Team New Zealand and its chief executive, Grant Dalton, had to overcome existential challenges, including internal divisions and an early shortage of financing.The team also made the right calls on navigational control systems for the challenging AC50 foiling catamarans and on which foils to use in the light winds that prevailed in Bermuda. Perhaps most important, the team successfully navigated the contentious transition from the popular veteran helmsman Dean Barker to the 26-year-old Peter Burling.Burling \u2014 cool and confident under pressure in Bermuda \u2014 turned out to be just the man for the very tricky job, and he helped produce a one-sided result that was humbling for Oracle\u2019s star helmsman, Jimmy Spithill, and its billionaire owner, Larry Ellison.\u201cI think they made a lot of smart decisions,\u201d said Spithill, who was dominated in the starting box by Burling throughout the series.Ellison, the latest in a long line of tycoons to catch America\u2019s Cup fever, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 his own and his team sponsors\u2019 \u2014 to pursue, secure and now lose the most prestigious prize in yachting.It is unclear whether he will continue funding a Cup team, but what is definite is that the next Cup, the 36th, will be in New Zealand. Immediately after Monday\u2019s victory, Team New Zealand announced that the Royal New Zealand Yacht Club, which it represents, had received and accepted a challenge from the Italian yacht club Circolo della Vela Sicilia.That club, based in Sicily, will be represented by Luna Rossa Challenge, the longtime Cup syndicate headed by Patrizio Bertelli, chief executive of Prada.Bertelli angrily withdrew Luna Rossa from this Cup after Oracle and a majority of the other challengers agreed to reduce the size of the catamarans midway through the cycle to cut costs. Bertelli then provided Team New Zealand\u2019s campaign with information and expertise. The two teams had a history, sharing design elements ahead of the previous Cup in San Francisco after Luna Rossa entered it late.\u201cIt\u2019s a story that goes back several years,\u201d said Matteo de Nora, the Kiwis\u2019 team principal and one of their key financial backers. \u201cThey share the same idea about the Cup, that it\u2019s not about winning or losing. It\u2019s about doing the right thing.\u201dIn this Cup, Team New Zealand was the only one of the five challengers not to sign a framework agreement with Oracle that would have had the Cup staged every two years in the same class of AC50 foiling catamarans used this year in Bermuda.Ellison, the 72-year-old co-founder of Oracle Corporation, undeniably transformed this event. He invested heavily to improve television coverage and supported the move to high-performance foiling catamarans in an attempt to broaden the sport\u2019s appeal.But that move, which made the Cup more dangerous and more physical, also made it too demanding for him to race on his own yacht. He watched from a chase boat in Bermuda on Monday.Oracle and Ellison had the option to defend the Cup in home waters this year, receiving bids from San Diego and Chicago. But Ellison and Russell Coutts, a New Zealander and former Oracle skipper, decided to take the financial guarantees on offer here in this tiny British overseas territory in the mid-Atlantic.It was the first time in the 166-year history of the Cup that an American syndicate chose to defend the trophy outside the United States.It will now remain overseas, with Team New Zealand expected to defend it in Auckland, the country\u2019s largest city, which was also the site for the Cup in 2000 and 2003.The Kiwis are scheduled to return home in triumph next week, potentially to a ticker-tape parade, but Dalton and his young crew were busy Monday exchanging hugs and hoisting the Cup in triumph in the Bermuda sunshine.It is a shiny, heavy trophy.

Memo Indicates Agents\u2019 Off-the-Books Account Was Against the Rules", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were running a multimillion-dollar, off-the-books bank account in Virginia to fund undercover operations at a time when the bureau had imposed strict rules about the use of such accounts.Details about when the account was opened remain sealed, but records show that the account was in use as far back as mid-2011 and continued until at least 2013.The A.T.F. has repeatedly refused to say who authorized the account, but the bureau has denied any wrongdoing. Thomas Lesnak, the lead agent who is now retired, said in a brief interview earlier this year that the operation was done by the book.But the 36-page memo from 2011 indicates otherwise. Written by an assistant A.T.F. director, Mark Chait, the memo lays out strict rules for how agents can spend money in undercover operations. Using money from an undercover account to supplement the A.T.F.\u2019s own budget is prohibited.The rules required strict accounting and approval from senior managers at every step of the investigation.By contrast, court records related to the Virginia case describe an account with little oversight. Ryan Kaye, an A.T.F. supervisor, testified that agents received \u201cverbal directives\u201d to open the account, but the documents do not identify who gave the directives.Agents in Bristol, Va., moved tens of millions of dollars through the account, records show, financed through a web of shadowy cigarette deals. The process was convoluted, but the result was clear: Agents had a steady supply of money and wide discretion about how to spend it.The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general is investigating the use of the account.The A.T.F. has argued the account in Virginia was different, something it called a \u201cmanagement account.\u201d But the 2011 memo offers no exception to the rules and never mentions management accounts. An A.T.F. spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday.The A.T.F. issued the 2011 memo amid an internal audit that uncovered widespread misuse of undercover bank accounts. Because the Virginia account was kept off the books, however, it was never scrutinized as part of that audit. The A.T.F. has refused to say whether it still operates management accounts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American Comic on a Russian Channel: What He Avoids Speaks Volumes", "Date": "2017-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyIf Mr. Camp, who is in his mid-30s, sounds a bit defensive, that may be because it\u2019s a challenging time to be a righteous American host of a political comedy show sponsored by the Russian government.Mr. Camp \u2014 who looks like a Broadway musical costume designer\u2019s idea of a counterculture comedian, with \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d hair and T-shirts bearing images of Bill Hicks or \u201cCatch-22\u201d \u2014 has more radical politics than his television peers. Occupy Wall Street and the Bernie Sanders campaign are lodestars. But Mr. Camp covers many of the same topics (net neutrality, global warming) that John Oliver and Samantha Bee do, except that is, when it comes to Russia.Mr. Camp\u2019s hard-edge critique of corporate greed and American policy is genuine; he was taking this line in his stand-up act before working for RT. But context matters.Liz Wahl is a former journalist for RT who quit on air, accusing the network of \u201cwhitewashing the actions of Putin\u201d in its coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ms. Wahl calls Mr. Camp a \u201cstooge\u201d and told me that his comedy plays into the channel\u2019s disinformation campaign.\u201cThe tactic is to use American anger against itself,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know our divides and aim to make them bigger. To make the angry angrier and the paranoid more paranoid, to push people to extremes.\u201dSquirming in his chair, Mr. Camp abruptly pivoted to a critique of American foreign policy: \u201cWe\u2019re blowing people up.\u201dMs. Wahl said it was precisely this kind of comment that made him useful to RT. \u201cIt creates the notion that we have no position to assert any moral authority,\u201d she said. \u201cIt serves the Russian narrative.\u201dBefore he worked for RT, Mr. Camp was a mainstay of the New York comedy scene who had written for The Onion and toured abroad, with a solo show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe called \u201cYet Another American Mistake.\u201d According to several people in the comedy scene, his stand-up diatribes succeeded with like-minded fans but had more trouble with crowds that didn\u2019t share his point of view. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t book him for a weekend, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d said Cris Italia, one of the owners of the New York comedy club the Stand.Last month, Mr. Camp returned to New York to perform with two fellow stand-ups. \u201cIn Trump\u2019s America, I feel freer,\u201d he said archly at the Cutting Room, a small East Side concert space, before explaining that even if he were to defecate onstage, it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be the craziest thing you see all week.\u201dHe was funniest at his most cynical, describing everyone as replaceable in our economy, including himself. \u201cMy job?\u201d he said with a Dennis Miller twang. \u201cIt can be replaced by a mop, a joke book and a sense of disillusionment.\u201dAt one point, a fan interrupted his set, yelling, \u201cDraft Bernie Sanders!\u201d Mr. Camp looked momentarily thrown off guard. Then the heckler started cursing about the Democratic National Committee.\u201cI hear you, but I\u2019m just trying to do a comedy show here.\u201d Mr. Camp responded, employing Mr. Stewart\u2019s old tactic of deflecting political comments by saying he\u2019s just a comic looking for laughs. Mr. Camp pointed at the door and said, \u201cYou can have the rally after the show.\u201dOnce Mr. Camp finished and the crowd had filed out, I lingered for a minute on the sidewalk. And while there wasn\u2019t any rally, I couldn\u2019t help noticing two beefy guys speaking in Russian and laughing uproariously.An article last Thursday about the comedian Lee Camp, host of the comedy news show \u201cRedacted Tonight\u201d on the RT America network, described incorrectly the departure of an employee at the network, Liz Wahl. She was a journalist for the network during the gestation of \u201cRedacted Tonight,\u201d but quit the network before \u2014 not after \u2014 the show\u2019s premiere. The article also described incorrectly two comedians who performed with Mr. Camp at a stand-up show at the Cutting Room last month. Only one was a correspondent for \u201cRedacted Tonight,\u201d not both.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Real Estate Mirage", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than just a place to live, private housing in the past two decades came to underpin the aspirations of urban Chinese. Homeownership, especially in cities, proved to be a reliable investment outlet. The skyrocketing values of housing have been providing money for sickness and old age in a country where the state has largely dismantled the welfare system. Real estate profits have allowed parents to finance their children\u2019s education abroad.But the impressive size and wealth of the propertied class belies the growing strains plaguing new home buyers. The country now has some of the least affordable housing markets in the world. The ratio of median home price to median income, a common measure of affordability, in most first-tier cities has soared to higher than that of London.To cool the markets, local governments have issued myriad purchasing restrictions, like requiring high down payments and banning the purchase of multiple apartments. The proliferation of red tape, together with the increasingly unaffordable real estate, has become a potent symbol of the thwarted economic hopes and the dwindling social mobility that characterize today\u2019s urban China.In newspapers and dinner table conversations, stories abound of husbands and wives filing fake divorces to get around stringent real estate purchasing restrictions for families. There are also tales of acrimonious disputes between the parents of divorcing couples when both sets claim ownership of the couple\u2019s apartment because they contributed to the purchase. Recently, more than 10,000 home buyers in Beijing found themselves stuck in financial limbo when the government suddenly increased down payment requirements after they had agreements to buy, leaving them short overnight.Nowhere are home buyers\u2019 struggles better reflected than in the saga surrounding \u201cschool-district apartments.\u201d Homeownership guarantees owners access to public schools, and the fierce competition among parents for apartments near highly valued schools has long been considered a culprit of the exorbitant housing prices in prosperous metropolises. In certain areas in Beijing, families are now asked to own homes for at least three years before they can qualify for local schools.Exasperated by the bureaucratic shackles, a growing number of the wealthy Chinese people are turning their eyes abroad, to homes in suburban America or luxury condos in Australia. According to a survey by the National Association of Realtors, the Chinese rank first among foreign nationals buying property in the United States. Their spending, at $27.3 billion for the year ending March 2016, exceeds the combined total of the next four countries in the ranking.To address the overheated housing market, city governments should stop relying on stopgap measures that encumber urban residents and just exacerbate the problem over time. Instead, they need to devise long-term structural solutions, such as delinking housing and public services like schooling, or increasing the subsidized-housing supply, to fix market imbalances.The best solution may also prove to be the most controversial. Implementation of a property tax, many advocates believe, will bring down prices by making speculative purchases more costly. Bringing it to fruition will require governments to overcome vested political and corporate interests, as well as adopting a measured approach to avoid causing a market crash.Among those people left to confront the housing market, there is a prevailing sense that the rules of economic reform have changed. Many Chinese people believe that \u201chard work alone leads to success,\u201d Xu Jin, an economics editor at FTChinese, wrote in a recent column. \u201cBut they are having a harder time believing the same for their children.\u201dRural migrant workers living in cities \u2014 who account for more than a third of the population in Beijing and in Shanghai \u2014 are by and large excluded from the local housing markets because of their nonnative residential status. It means they have missed out on one of the largest wealth transfers from the state to the people.That is why when the government declared its decision in April to build a new special economic zone, equal in status to the southern economic hub of Shenzhen, on a piece of rural land roughly 80 miles south of Beijing, local villagers reacted with elation. Suddenly their humble villages seemed to be on the verge of a real estate boom like those they\u2019ve witnessed in neighboring cities.In less than a day, local average apartment prices tripled. But two days later, Beijing banned housing sales in the region.Helen Gao is a social policy analyst at a research company and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio, in Reversal, Says New York Will Pay $2 Million for His Lawyers", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that he would \u201clet the city cover\u201d most of his legal bills deriving from federal and state investigations into his activities \u2014 reversing an earlier, \u201cbottom-line\u201d pledge that no taxpayer money would be used to pay his lawyers.Mr. de Blasio said he would form a legal-defense fund to pay an additional amount, approximately $300,000, for legal fees that related to \u201cnongovernmental work.\u201d\u201cI have been reluctant to ask taxpayers to shoulder the burden,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in the statement. \u201cBut after giving this a great deal of thought, it has become increasingly clear that the most appropriate course of action is to let the city cover the costs for legal work tied to my government service.\u201dSome of the investigations looked at whether the mayor had done favors for donors who made contributions to his political campaign or a nonprofit group he created to support his policies. Another focus of the investigations was whether laws were broken during a fund-raising push aimed at electing Democrats to the State Senate in 2014 (Mr. de Blasio cited the State Senate effort as an example of the nongovernmental work for which lawyers\u2019 fees would be paid from a legal-defense fund.)Mr. de Blasio had previously been emphatic in saying that no city money would go to pay his legal fees \u2014 although public money was used to pay private lawyers hired by the city for some of his aides.At an unrelated new conference on Friday, Mr. de Blasio at first said he had changed course because he listened to good-government groups that argued that he should not be treated differently from other public employees, whose legal fees were paid.\u201cThe more I thought about it, the more I think that that does make sense and that\u2019s a good standard,\u201d he said.But he later acknowledged that the restriction on donations to a legal-defense fund was a major factor, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s not the option for the legal-defense fund that we thought would be there, and I think this is the way to proceed.\u201dHe said that he would like the City Council to pass a law setting clear rules for legal-defense funds for public officials, and that he would wait to set up a fund.Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, one of the good-government groups the mayor referred to, said he supported the decision to have the city pay for the bulk of the mayor\u2019s legal fees. But he said the mayor should use his own money (or campaign money, if allowed by law) to pay for the rest, to avoid possible conflicts of interest.\u201cSometimes people are on the hook for taking personal responsibility for their political activities,\u201d Mr. Dadey said.Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, another group referred to by Mr. de Blasio, said the group supported the mayor\u2019s decision and would release recommendations on how to best regulate legal-defense funds.\u201cI think one has to be practical,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the mayor has pointed out, he\u2019s not a wealthy individual.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retirement Savings, the Muslim Way", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringWhen faced with a loss in the market versus a lapse in his faith, Nabeel Hamoui, 37, a radiologist in Chicago, will invariably opt for the loss. This is because Dr. Hamoui manages his retirement portfolio in accordance with halal, or religiously sanctioned, Islamic guidelines.\u201cI chose halal investing based on my religious beliefs, and try to remain in compliance with those beliefs,\u201d Dr. Hamoui said. A return on his investment, he said, is beside the point.For Dr. Hamoui and many other Muslims, both in the United States and abroad, saving for retirement means steering clear of investments in companies and funds that trade in a host of forbidden goods and services, which are known as haram. The lengthy list includes alcohol, tobacco, pork products and media or entertainment considered immoral, such as pornography.The rules can be tricky to navigate. Investments are banned in companies with too much debt as a percentage of their assets. Interest on loans (known as riba) is also haram, which rules out investing in conventional banking and insurance sectors. Investing in companies earning a minimal amount of interest, typically 5 percent or less, may be allowed, so long as the dividend income derived from that interest is donated to charity.Equally problematic are many customary market gambits such as annuities and short-selling, which can be viewed as gambling, and thus are prohibited under Islamic law, or Shariah.\u201cThe Islamic principles look to what you are doing with your capital, what types of businesses, assets and operations are you furthering,\u201d said Umar Moghul, a New York-based lawyer specializing in Islamic finance.Other important criteria, he said, are the terms and conditions of someone\u2019s holdings, \u201csince Shariah also speaks to procedure as well as to the substance of investment.\u201dIn spite of these challenges, the global Islamic financial sector is healthy and growing.Islamic finance in the United States is \u201ca nascent industry, but people are very optimistic about where it is going,\u201d said Bashar Qasem, the chief executive of Azzad Asset Management, a money management firm in Falls Church, Va., that he founded in 1997.The philosophy behind Islamic saving and investing can be traced to the Quran and other early Islamic texts. The story of the prophet Yusuf (Joseph, the same one as in the Bible) conserving grain from rich harvests in Egypt, related in Sura (chapter) 12 of the Quran, is often cited as an admonition to save against hard times. Other verses advise against squandering wealth, while the Prophet Muhammad warned in a hadith (a collection of his sayings) that one \u201cwho is prudent in spending will not be dependent on others\u201d later in life.Both the Quran and hadith inform Shariah, which guides Muslims through practical life decisions, including how they should make and save money while remaining true to their religious principles.Like Shariah itself, which varies in interpretation (known as ijtihad), the indexes differ on what is compliant and what is not. Most regard the trade and manufacture of weapons as noncompliant, for example, yet S&P\u2019s board of Islamic scholars takes a nuanced approach. The use of weapons can be permissible (self-defense) or nonpermissible (unprovoked violence), but the weapons themselves are neutral, so investing in their manufacture is sanctioned, as Mr. Orzano noted in a 2013 report.A vast range of customized, equally nuanced Islamic financial products structured like standard investments but operating within Shariah has likewise gained traction in the market.Sukuks are among the most prevalent. These are essentially Shariah-compliant bonds. Yet whereas standard bonds pay investors a set rate of interest over a period of time, sukuks offer a fixed rate of profit instead, thus avoiding forbidden riba.Another important distinction is that sukuks must be backed by some tangible asset, such as properties or a Shariah-compliant business. Ownership is transferred to the investors who then lease the asset to the issuer for a set period, essentially charging rent for its use, an arrangement known in Islamic finance as ijarah.\u201cSo with a sukuk, the investor owns a piece of the asset,\u201d said M. Yaqub Mirza, chief executive officer of Sterling Management Group in Herndon, Va. \u201cWith a bond, it is a debt, and you earn interest on it, which is noncompliant with Shariah.\u201d In 1986, Dr. Mirza introduced the Amana Income Fund, the first Shariah-compliant mutual fund in the United States.Shariah-compliant exchange traded funds (E.T.F.s) are another attractive product for Muslim investors. Whereas a standard E.T.F. is a security that tracks an index, commodity, bonds or an index fund, an Islamic E.T.F. exclusively tracks a benchmark index composed of Shariah-compliant companies. They are also usually overseen by a Shariah committee to ensure compliance.Yet whether driven by conscience or a keen sense of the market, Muslim and non-Muslim investors alike have historically done well by parking retirement savings in the Islamic financial sector, particularly during volatile times. Both WorldCom and Enron were removed from the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index when their debt levels hit 33 percent, the Shariah cutoff. Shares of both companies later lost their value after they collapsed in 2001-2. More recently, halal investors similarly weathered the financial crisis of 2008 in relative safety, Mr. Orzano observed.\u201cDuring that specific time frame, when the financial sector was devastated, being in a Shariah-compliant investment was beneficial,\u201d he said.The bottom line for Khalique Zahir, a plastic surgeon from McLean, Va., is that whether it be high finance or in the interest of a higher cause, building a Shariah-compliant nest egg simply makes sense.\u201cBasically it\u2019s just safe, intelligent investing,\u201d said Dr. Zahir, who is 51. He began saving for retirement in conventional markets soon after graduating from medical school but was drawn to halal investing around 2001, after watching the rise and fall of the dot-com bubble.\u201cWith halal investing, you\u2019re investing in a company that has at least 50 percent of its value in hard cash,\u201d Dr. Zahir said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in some hypothetical dot-com kind of thought processes. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Muslim or non-Muslim \u2014 you just don\u2019t like to lose your capital.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arsonists May Be Behind Fatal Portugal Blaze, Firefighters\u2019 Group Says", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe claim is certain to increase concerns about misinformation by the authorities during a fire tragedy that has traumatized the country.On Wednesday, Jaime Marta Soares, president of the Portuguese Firefighters League, told TSF, a Portuguese radio station, that he was convinced the fire was provoked by \u201ca criminal hand.\u201dThis dry region of central Portugal has a culture built on respect and fear of fire, but residents were not expecting one so violent.He suggested that lightning had struck about two hours after the fire had already begun. While he did not offer evidence to back his claim, he demanded a full investigation into the origins of the fire.On Sunday, a day after the fire began and as firefighters scrambled to reach isolated hamlets in the burning forest, Jos\u00e9 Maria de Almeida Rodrigues, the national director of Portugal\u2019s judicial police, said that the fire \u201cvery clearly\u201d was a result of natural causes.At the time, the police chief said that officials had identified the exact spot in the forest where lightning first struck, during a so-called dry thunderstorm, in which there is lightning but no rainfall.On Wednesday afternoon, firefighters were still battling pockets of fire near the town of G\u00f3is, a short distance from the area around the town of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande, where people perished.The authorities said they were close to bringing the blaze fully under control, with the support of foreign firefighting planes.The debate over the fire\u2019s origins comes after Portugal completed on Tuesday three days of mourning for the tragedy. During the national mourning, politicians mostly heeded a call by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to first deal with the emergency before discussing its circumstances.It is now likely, however, that the fire will turn into a political and institutional confrontation.Environmentalists want the disaster to serve as a catalyst for Portuguese politicians to address longstanding problems relating to the mismanagement and neglect of forests.The migration of rural people to cities and coastal areas as part of the country\u2019s economic development has also left vast amounts of farmlands dangerously untended.While visiting the disaster zone, Feliciano Barreiras Duarte, a national lawmaker from the main center-right opposition party, told The New York Times that the fire was \u201cthe result of mistakes by successive governments,\u201d including flawed policies promoted in the past by his own party.\u201cWhat has happened here isn\u2019t just a natural disaster, it\u2019s also shameful,\u201d he said.While a few funerals have already been held since Tuesday, the authorities have yet to identify all 64 victims. On Wednesday, they raised the number of injured to 204, more than three times the number announced last weekend when the fire began.The government also said it would create a special fund to finance the reconstruction of devastated villages and help support residents, in a thinly populated farming area that has also become increasingly reliant on tourists, drawn to its forest, gorges and river pools.Advertisement"}

G.E. today sells magnetic resonance imaging machines, provides financial and data services, manufactures light bulbs and performs drug research, among myriad other activities.But as a rule, Wall Street does not like conglomerates. Instead, investors tend to prefer the clarity of companies with simpler product lines and fewer moving parts.Mr. Immelt had spoken in the past of stepping down this year. But no successor had been formally named, and in recent months, G.E.\u2019s lagging stock performance brought increasing pressure from investors and new urgency to questions about when he might depart.Those questions were being addressed by the G.E. board on May 13 at a trendy hotel in downtown Manhattan, a location selected in part because it was a place where people seemed unlikely to recognize G.E. board members. There, four contenders for Mr. Immelt\u2019s post lined up and made their case to claim the top job.G.E. said its succession planning had been in the works for about five years, with a target of this summer. Activity accelerated in the past year, once the leading candidates had gathered wider experience across the company.The company\u2019s lead independent director, Jack Brennan, said that there had been an \u201congoing dialogue\u201d about the timing but that, in the end, everything \u201chappened to marry up with the schedule we had in place,\u201d which Mr. Immelt had agreed to.Mr. Flannery will become chief executive on Aug. 1. Mr. Immelt will remain as chairman until he retires on Dec. 31. Mr. Flannery will then add that role on Jan. 1.Mr. Brennan has fielded calls recently from frustrated shareholders, according to two people familiar with those conversations. In an interview, Mr. Brennan \u2014 a former chief executive of Vanguard, a large mutual fund firm \u2014 said: \u201cI talk to investors all the time. And given my background, I get a lot of unsolicited advice.\u201dG.E. has taken some of the proposed steps, and its shares had risen more than 10 percent from the beginning of Trian\u2019s campaign through Friday. Still, rival industrial firms did far better over the same period: United Technologies shares rose 43 percent, and Honeywell\u2019s stock was up 46 percent.On Monday, G.E. closed at $28.94 a share, up 4 percent but still below Trian\u2019s target range. Trian was not consulted on the leadership change and learned about it Monday morning when the company made its announcement.Even investors who praise Mr. Immelt for drastically reducing G.E.\u2019s dependence on finance and shedding its nonindustrial businesses, like the media company NBCUniversal, welcomed the change. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d said Robert Atchinson, managing director of Adage Capital Management, a $30 billion fund that holds G.E. shares. \u201cG.E. needs to go to the next level of change.\u201dLater, the global financial crisis of 2008 delivered a severe blow, one partly self-inflicted. For years, G.E. had chased the seemingly easy profits to be made in everything from American home mortgages to credit-card financing in Japan. In some years, that business made up as much as half the company\u2019s income, and G.E. became one of the largest lenders in the United States.The finance buildup was begun by Jack Welch, the legendary chairman and chief executive and Mr. Immelt\u2019s predecessor, who served for two decades and oversaw an era of tremendous global expansion. That emphasis on financial businesses continued for years under Mr. Immelt \u2014 until the 2008 crisis.Suddenly, finance and the regulatory demands that came with it became riskier and less attractive. GE Capital\u2019s size meant that it was deemed a \u201csystemically important financial institution\u201d in the years that followed, the official name for a lender that the government considers too big to fail. The designation cut into potential profits by imposing additional business restrictions.In the past few years, G.E.\u2019s profit performance has suffered because lower oil prices have hurt the company\u2019s big oil-field-equipment business. In October, G.E. agreed to merge its oil-and-gas unit with Baker Hughes in an effort to create a stronger business that could benefit from a recovery in oil prices.The idea would be that, for instance, software could harness the data produced by a jet engine to predict when the engine needed maintenance, saving time and money. The technology could be used across G.E.\u2019s businesses, whether medical equipment or wind turbines.\u201cIt\u2019s an open question as to whether that pays off,\u201d said Karim Lakhani, a professor at Harvard Business School.Like Mr. Immelt, Mr. Flannery is a company veteran, having begun at GE Capital in 1987 with a focus on evaluating risk for big corporate lending deals. In 2013, he took over business development at the corporate level, and he was involved in G.E.\u2019s sizable acquisition of Alstom\u2019s energy businesses and the shrinking of GE Capital. Mr. Flannery joined GE Healthcare in 2014, overseeing a turnaround of that business, the company said.In an interview, Mr. Flannery took issue with the characterization of him as a financial engineer. Much of his time in finance, he said, was assessing businesses, their managements and whether to make investments. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t trading derivatives,\u201d he said.Mr. Flannery was one of the four candidates who made presentations to the board at the May 13 meeting at the Beekman Hotel in Manhattan. Their day started at 7:30 a.m. and lasted till 4 p.m.The other three competing for the job were Jeffrey S. Bornstein, the chief financial officer (he will become vice chairman, G.E. said Monday); Steve Bolze, the president of G.E.\u2019s power-generation business; and Lorenzo Simonelli, the president of G.E.\u2019s oil-and-gas unit, according to a person briefed on the meeting who was not authorized to speak publicly.Before the meeting, the board members received folders of documents detailing the history, track record and executive reviews of the candidates. One by one, each made a presentation of more than an hour and a half on the subject \u201cthe road forward for G.E.,\u201d Mr. Brennan said.The board knew them all well. In the past few years, G.E. board members, in groups of three to five, had visited each of the executives in their businesses. One visit to Mr. Flannery was in Uppsala, Sweden, where GE Healthcare has a life sciences unit, doing biological research for new therapies.On Friday morning, the board met again to vote, this time at the Boston Harbor Hotel. The conference room had been swept for listening devices the night before, and security guards were stationed outside overnight.The vote, Mr. Brennan said, was unanimous in favor of Mr. Flannery. He got the call a bit after 1 p.m. in Chicago, the headquarters of GE Healthcare, to tell him he would be the next chief executive.An earlier version of this article misstated when Jeffrey Immelt became chief executive of General Electric. It was before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, not after.Chad Bray, Michael J. de la Merced and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In other words, you\u2019re Warren Buffett. The politicians who worship guys like you have another treat in store: They will cut your most recent tax bill by $679,999, making you even wealthier.Such is the bargain \u2014 your health care for my tax cut \u2014 that Republicans have proposed with their overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. The toxic Senate bill does nothing to fix a struggling system. But it is bold and quite daring: for this is the broadest attack on working Americans by a governing political party in our lifetime.No surprise, the real Warren Buffett wants nothing to do with it. He calls it, the \u201cRelief for the Rich Act.\u201d Another eminently sensible Midwesterner, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, is equally perplexed. Why take away vital services for the struggling middle class, the mentally ill, the poor and the elderly to give more money to people who don\u2019t need it?\u201cAnd they think that\u2019s great?\u201d Kasich, a Republican, said. \u201cThat\u2019s good public policy? What, are you kidding me?\u201dLost in the usual banality of the Beltway box score this week are the moral dimensions of the plot to gut health care. The reprieve on a Senate vote, until after the July 4 recess, is momentary. Still, it gives people just enough time to consider the audacity of meanness behind what Republicans are trying to do.There is blood on this tax cut. It\u2019s a simple swap \u2014 taking away $700 billion from one class of people to give it to another. That swap would leave 22 million Americans without health care over the next decade, and many of them will die prematurely because they will not see a doctor in time. In turn, those making $875,000 a year would get an average tax cut of about $45,000. Those making $5 million a year would get a break of $250,000.Americans don\u2019t like talk of class warfare; it reminds us of those dreary, failed Marxists who seldom practice what they preach. But there\u2019s no other way to look at this. Right now, a 64-year-old making $55,000 can afford to get health care, thanks to Obamacare subsidies.But how is that person supposed to pay nearly half of his or her income in premiums, as Republicans propose? The bill would also allow states to eliminate minimum standards of health care. And the worst blow would fall on Medicaid, which one in five Americans depends on.Think of it this way: Your car breaks down. You need it to get to work. Indeed, your livelihood depends on it. You call the Republicans. They scrap the car for cash and leave you on the road.All for a tax cut. Not a tax cut on wages, which would actually help most Americans. But a cut of taxes that are painless to the small percentage of people who have to pay them \u2014 a 0.9 percent Medicare surtax, and 3.8 percent tax on net invested income for couples earning more than $250,000 a year.I bet if you asked rich people if they wanted to cut off health care for millions of their fellow citizens in exchange for a bit more money at the end of the year, most of them would say no, that\u2019s crazy. Taxes don\u2019t register among the top concerns of people, in poll after poll.Why such a cruel bill, then? You can start at the top, with a petty, soulless president who showed with a tweet insulting a woman\u2019s appearance this week that he has no more empathy than a sociopath. Nor does he have a clue about what Congress has been up to.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a great, great form of health care,\u201d President Trump said at midweek, with all the conviction of someone peddling the fraud of Trump University.Where to start? Congress could begin by following the American Medical Association. They see the Republican plan as a violation of an ancient oath that the best doctors still swear by \u2014 first, do no harm.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Grenfell Tower Fire, U.K. Asks: Has Deregulation Gone Too Far?", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is a partisan debate, wrapping in the bitterly fought election this month, the recent terrorist attacks in Manchester and London, the anger about rising inequality, and years of budget cutting that is generally known as austerity.Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative member of Parliament first elected in 2015, described Britain as, without question, \u201cdefinitely more divided on the issue.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the state as provider and the state as guarantor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while stepping away from the state as provider, we\u2019ve moved too far away from state as guarantor.\u201dSimon Tilford, an economist and deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London, said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the biggest challenge to this 40-year drive to marginalize or discredit the state and its role in the economy and society. Grenfell Tower had such impact because it symbolizes for many in Britain the retreat of the state, visible in badly maintained social housing and the failure to build more social housing.\u201dThe debate is an important one. Britain has been a laboratory of sorts for deregulation and the shrinking of the state since Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979. The concepts were embraced by the Conservatives and then by New Labour, and helped rescue the country from the gloom and strikes of the 1970s and early 1980s. The \u201cbig bang\u201d of deregulation of the financial industry gave rise to the London boom, turning it into a global city.The issues encapsulate the renewed ideological battle between the wounded but governing Conservative Party and the revived opposition Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn. A man of the harder left, Mr. Corbyn has brought back the arguments used against Mrs. Thatcher in the 1980s, calling for a reversal of the policies she championed \u2014 privatization, deregulation, corporate tax cuts, and a shrinking of the Labour-built, semi-socialist state.During the campaign, Mr. Corbyn and Labour called for renationalizing the railways, the water supply and some utilities, spending much more on social services like the National Health Service and social benefits and ending tuition fees at universities. After the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London, Mr. Corbyn, long an opponent of surveillance and enhanced police powers, called for more beat police officers, complaining about austerity and arguing that \u201cyou can\u2019t protect the public on the cheap.\u201dHis left-wing populism (marked by a longstanding contempt for American foreign policy) was a sharp break with the neoliberal consensus of the past 30 years or so, which included Labour\u2019s last prime ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. But the Grenfell Tower fire, Mr. Freedland said, \u201cappeared to make the Corbyn argument for him.\u201dWhile preparing a platform for the June election, Prime Minister Theresa May sensed the mood turning against austerity, loosening debt targets, trying to reach out to disaffected working-class voters and penalizing, though mildly, the better-off. But her campaign ended in tears, and \u201cMayism\u201d has had a shorter life than the Edsel.Mrs. Thatcher is often held up as the icon of the Conservative Party\u2019s move to shrink what she called \u201cthe nanny state,\u201d which she felt promoted dependency instead of initiative.Mrs. Thatcher introduced the \u201cright to buy\u201d social housing to its tenants in 1980, in an effort to promote homeownership and responsibility. Over time, the nature of social housing changed, as some apartments simply became private rental properties \u2014 including an unknown number in Grenfell Tower itself \u2014 though their maintenance was controlled by the local council through a nonprofit management agency. And local councils did not build housing fast enough to keep up with demand, especially in big cities.Under Conservative efforts since 2010 to reduce the national budget and the national debt, state funding was reduced or frozen for many parts of the government, including local councils. Deregulation also meant outsourcing responsibility for fire inspections to owners and builders, instead of civil servants. Private companies were required to use \u201cauthorized inspectors\u201d for fire safety, but, as Mr. Freedland pointed out, they worked for builders and developers, and \u201cthere was a classic conflict of interest.\u201dHere the two trends of saving money and deregulation come together: The council had recently spent some $11 million on Grenfell Tower to insulate apartments and cut energy costs, using cladding that was approved under existing building regulations. And those regulations, however inadequate they have proved, are the same for all buildings, not just those of the poor.The cladding aside, there were other fire-safety issues that were not dealt with by anyone, including the questionable installation of new gas pipes, inadequate fire proofing, and the lack of a central fire alarm or a sprinkler system, though neither was required for a structure built in 1974.Still, as Mr. Lammy, the Labour lawmaker, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t contract out everything to the private sector. The private sector can do some wonderful things, but they have for-profit motives, they cut corners. We\u2019ve all been up to those tower blocks \u2014 they exist right across the country. Where are the fire extinguishers on every corridor? Where are the hoses? Are the fire doors really working? Where are the sprinklers?\u201dThe questions are the right ones. But the fight over who is responsible, and over the causes and solutions, will continue, and will continue to mark British politics, divided more now than at any time since the election of Mrs. Thatcher.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What a World Tour of Tax Codes Can Teach the U.S. About How to Reform Its Own", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Tax ranks high among global economic activities. Federal taxes alone constitute more than a quarter of the American economy. Including state and local levies brings the total tax burden to more than a quarter of Gross Domestic Product. Taxes account for about 45 percent of the economies of Denmark, France and Belgium, while in less prosperous countries like Chile and Mexico taxes are a fifth or less of the economy. Overall taxes, and disguised taxes like government fees, account for about 21 percent of the global economy. Given those numbers, researchers coming here from another planet might report back home that Earthlings love taxes, especially those humans living in rich countries, because high-tax countries tend to be the most prosperous.Of course, we don\u2019t even like taxes, ranking the subject near death among those things we find most disagreeable. That\u2019s because we think of what we could do with the money we are forced to part with more often than we contemplate how taxes finance benefits like education, infrastructure, justice and the military, which form the foundations of both liberty and private wealth creation. We don\u2019t think much about the fact that in a society with no taxes the ruthless rule, free to take our property and our lives, while as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, taxes buy us civilization.Our aversion to considering the benefits of taxes helps explain why, as T. R. Reid shows in his charming book, \u201cA Fine Mess,\u201d our elected leaders piece together tax systems far more complex than Rube Goldberg machines. This aversion also helps explain why we keep voting for politicians who hand out tax favors to the political donor class, creating a system that burdens some heavily while allowing others, like Donald Trump, to boast that not paying taxes shows they are smart. Under our current tax system multinational companies and some individuals literally turn the burden of taxes into a profit center, an open secret among top tax accountants and lawyers.Reid takes us on a world tour of tax systems and the efforts to reform them. He approaches this most disliked specialty of the dismal science of economics with a wry voice and a light touch. And while his reporting includes some technical flaws, they are mere lint on a rich and sturdy fabric of facts presented in plain English.As a longtime Washington Post foreign correspondent, Reid knows how to make the distant seem close. His eye for the telling detail is sharp.For example, a running thread through the book involves tax simplification. After Senate Republicans staged hearings in 1997 and 1998 on supposed abuses of taxpayers (the testimony was later shown to be malarkey), Congress enacted an anticomplexity provision: \u201csubsection IX of subpart (ii) of Section 7803(c)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201dReid shows how the design of a tax system can enhance rather than hobble economies. He cites tax reforms in Estonia, a hotbed of digital age innovation, and New Zealand, which despite few natural resources and a remote location, prospers by importing tourists and exporting wines. In both cases a tax code redesign was central to economic success. He also shows that sometimes tax changes work out because of luck or economic circumstances that are fleeting.Americans are accustomed to regarding the I.R.S. as the source of their tax miseries. Reid relates what happened when Congress considered impeaching John Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner, in 2016. \u201cI didn\u2019t write the tax laws, Congressman,\u201d Koskinen testified. \u201cYou did that.\u201dReid smoothly explains the concept of tax expenditures. These totaled about $1.2 trillion in 2014, almost as much as the $1.4 trillion that individuals paid in federal income taxes. When Congress makes mortgage interest tax deductible or gives a tax credit for purchases of plug-in electric cars it is the same as if Congress wrote a check to homeowners and Chevy Volt drivers like my wife and me. Fewer than half of homeowners take the mortgage interest deduction and only the affluent buy electric cars, showing how tax expenditures are stealth welfare for people who don\u2019t need a government handout. Reid argues that \u201cif a government giveaway is justified by social benefits, its backers should make their case and ask Congress to appropriate the money\u201d because a $1 tax break and a $1 government-issued check are, in economics, the same thing.Reid does not recommend what tax expenditures, if any, should be eliminated. He just uses plain English to explain the concept and others, especially how Congress enables offshore tax avoidance by the rich and multinational corporations. His one overall recommendation for tax reform is simplify, simplify, simplify.Those unfamiliar with economics, accounting or tax law will be better able to understand these subjects by reading \u201cA Fine Mess.\u201d It will help them grasp why our tax code, designed more than a century ago for a national industrial economy, is so at odds with our 21st-century needs, and why, instead of helping us prosper, it throws sand in the gears of commerce. With enough readers, Reid might even help us to initiate real tax reform by replacing a tax code so complex it includes the anti-complexity rule in Section 7803(c)(2)(B).David Cay Johnston, who was awarded a 2001 Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of taxes in The New York Times, is drafting a new federal tax code for the 21st-century economy that he calls the Prosperity Tax.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stopping Pandemics Before They Start", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesImagine that enemies possessed a class of weapons with which they attacked your people from time to time. Decades could go by with no attack, but eventually one would come. Imagine also that these weapons were growing more potent, and the attacks were becoming more frequent.Now imagine that there was a way to protect your people from these threats. But making it would be expensive, and could take years. So it was not being made.Each attack brought death, panic and an outcry: \u201cWhere is our defense? Why are we not protected?\u201d But as soon as the attack passed, so did interest in preparing for the next one.As you probably have guessed, this is about Ebola. And SARS. And Zika. And MERS, bird flu, swine flu, Lassa fever, Marburg, Rift Valley fever and the whole range of pathogens \u2014 including the ones we don\u2019t know about yet \u2014 that can rapidly go from outbreak to epidemic to pandemic.These diseases are not going away. They are called zoonoses, which means they are harbored in animal populations \u2014 pigs, monkeys, bats, camels, birds \u2014 and so can never be eradicated.\u201cThere will be more and more outbreaks developing into big epidemics,\u201d said Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the first head of Unaids. (He was also a member of the group that discovered the Ebola virus.) \u201cWith greater mobility, population pressures and climate change, we\u2019ll see more of that.\u201dA United Nations panel studying epidemics recently concluded: \u201cThe emergence of a highly pathogenic influenza virus, which could rapidly result in millions of deaths and cause major social, economic and political disruption, is not an unlikely scenario.\u201dWhy don\u2019t we develop vaccines for these pathogens? Many are relatively uncomplicated \u2014 scientifically.But they are economically complicated. Developing a new vaccine costs hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 and that\u2019s to make a product with no commercial demand. No pharmaceutical executive could be expected to put that kind of money into a product that would be needed largely by poor people in poor countries \u2014 if it\u2019s ever needed at all.And they are politically complicated. Outbreaks tend to begin, and spread most widely, in countries where people live in proximity to animals, especially where the surveillance and health systems are poor.\u201cWe\u2019re always fighting to make sure it\u2019s about caring about people who are affected, and not defending yourself from the affected person,\u201d said Joanne Liu, international president of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders).Building a wall against disease is not only an ugly strategy; it\u2019s a losing strategy. Ebola, swine flu, Zika, and SARS all reached wealthy countries. What protected Americans from Ebola was ending the epidemic. And that meant \u2014 among other strategies \u2014 creating vaccines.In January 2016, Piot led a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with pharmaceutical executives, government ministers, epidemiologists and foundations such as Gates and Britain\u2019s Wellcome Trust. Officials from Norway and India were particularly active. \u201cWe were trying to determine, is there an appetite for this?\u201d said Piot. \u201cIs there a need for this? There were different opinions about how to do it, but the answer was yes. Ebola was the wake-up call.\u201dAt Davos a year later, CEPI was officially started \u2014 an unusually fast beginning in a world that routinely sleeps through endless wake up calls. Its headquarters are in Oslo, with offices in London and New Delhi so far. Richard Hatchett, an American, became CEPI\u2019s chief executive in mid-April. He said the organization wants to raise a billion dollars for its first five years and has raised nearly $800 million so far \u2014 from the governments of Norway, Japan and Germany, the European Commission, Gates and Wellcome. India is preparing a donation.A lot of money? Not if you\u2019re talking about vaccine development.Over the next five years, CEPI aims to develop multiple viable vaccine candidates against three pathogens: Lassa fever, Nipah and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The three were chosen because they are geographically diverse, having stricken Africa, South Asia and the Middle East in recent outbreaks with high fatality rates. And vaccines for those diseases looked promising.The organization plans to take these candidates through all the trials and regulatory approvals possible before an outbreak, and then to produce a stockpile of vaccines that can be quickly tested for efficacy \u2014 and then used \u2014 during an epidemic.Developing a vaccine is never easy, and getting it approved can be even more complex, possibly requiring assent from every country that could be hit. One of CEPI\u2019s goals is to create simpler, more agile structures for approvals.CEPI\u2019s second goal is to create a vaccine delivery system that can be quickly adapted to stem new pathogens \u2014 just as scientists simply plug a new strain into the flu vaccine each year. Once the vector is fully proven, a new agent or strain requires little testing.That became possible because promising vaccine candidates had been sitting in storage in Canada and the United States; they had been developed by researchers worried that a terrorist might weaponize Ebola. The W.H.O. coordinated a huge effort to get them tested, approved, produced and into the field in just six months. The process can normally take a decade.No large-scale efficacy trials were possible, however, because the epidemic was winding down by the time candidates were ready. Still, in Guinea, one of the candidates was used on an investigatory basis, employing a method called ring vaccination \u2014 in which an Ebola patient is identified, and all of his or her contacts are vaccinated. The vaccine proved 100 percent effective, and finally ended that epidemic.Nevertheless, it still lacks the formal approvals needed for large-scale production and use. And other promising candidates need to be developed as well.CEPI has no manufacturing facilities. It will, instead, finance research and development at pharmaceutical or biotech companies. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just giving the money and going away,\u201d said Hatchett. \u201cWe have internal experts and capabilities. And through our partnership with the World Health Organization, I would hope to be able to facilitate connections with public health officials and scientists in countries at risk.\u201dCreating vaccines is not the same as guaranteeing that people who need them can get them. CEPI will require its awardees to sell vaccines to the poorest and lower-middle-income countries (more likely, to donors who will buy vaccine for them) at the lowest possible price.CEPI also agreed to cede intellectual property to the companies \u2014 also business as usual. Hatchett said that CEPI will retain the rights to use the knowledge if manufacturing partners can\u2019t or won\u2019t meet their obligations.Rohit Malpani, director of policy and analysis at MSF, points out that such rights exist in the United States when the government funds drug development \u2014 but they have never been used. The pharmaceutical industry is too powerful. \u201cCEPI will pay for it, so they should own it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like to see a public return on public investment.\u201dCEPI\u2019s value may go beyond the success of any single vaccine.

Is it going to be \u2018Scooby-Doo?\u2019\u201d Ms. Hughes said. \u201cWe thought, \u2018oh, no \u2014 this means he hates ghost stories.\u2019\u201dOn the contrary, Mr. Palin said he has been a fan since childhood of the ethereal tales of authors like M. R. James. \u201cThere were always clergymen involved, for some reason,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he opens a door in the middle of the night, and the world of the suppressed and mysterious invades.\u201dMr. Palin, who grew up in England\u2019s Yorkshire county, said he always showed an aptitude for acting and imitation, but had to keep such aspirations secret from his father, an industrial engineer, who did not want him pursuing a theater career. (His older sister, Angela, had already tried her hand at acting but landed in stage management, and his father \u201ccould already see himself supporting me for the rest of my life,\u201d Mr. Palin said.)When Mr. Palin went onto Oxford in the early 1960s, he said, \u201cI was off the leash, as it were \u2014 my father wasn\u2019t able to monitor all my movements.\u201dEven so, Mr. Palin said he came to think of himself more as a writer than as a performer, which helps explain his being exceptionally choosy about taking on acting assignments. \u201cWriting was expressing myself, and gave me the freedom to think about what I really wanted to do, rather than work to someone else\u2019s schedule,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt that freedom was quite important.\u201dMore recently, Mr. Palin played the politician Vyacheslav Molotov in \u201cThe Death of Stalin,\u201d a coming film directed by Armando Iannucci, in which an ensemble cast (also featuring Steve Buscemi, Jeffrey Tambor and Simon Russell Beale) offers a farcical look at a chaotic moment in Soviet history.Mr. Iannucci, a writer of the film and the creator of the political satires \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cThe Thick of It,\u201d grew up a fan of Monty Python and Mr. Palin in particular.\u201cAs himself, he has this genial demeanor,\u201d Mr. Iannucci said of Mr. Palin. \u201cAnd yet, in \u2018Python,\u2019 he could be really savage. He played his characters with such energy and often a kind of sinister smile.\u201dThe character of Molotov, Mr. Iannucci said, has an inherently \u201cPythonesque element\u201d in his \u201ccomplete, unemotional, fanatical attachment to the party and to its logic.\u201dBut Mr. Palin, he said, is sparing in taking on roles that might be compared to his pored-over Monty Python work.\u201cHe\u2019s conscious that he has this status with Python, and he obviously doesn\u2019t want to boast or brag about it,\u201d Mr. Iannucci said. \u201cBut he\u2019s aware that it does mean a lot to people. He\u2019s worked out how to manage that, so that it gives people pleasure.\u201dMr. Palin nearly starred in \u201cThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote,\u201d a film by his Python colleague Terry Gilliam that reimagines the story of Cervantes\u2019s Man of La Mancha.Last year, Mr. Palin was still attached to this long-delayed film when it ran into a financing problem (again). \u201cI had hung in there for quite a while,\u201d Mr. Palin said, \u201cand turned down one or two other quite interesting things. I said to Terry, \u2018I don\u2019t think I can go through another year of uncertainty.\u2019\u201dAs Mr. Palin recalled the reunion: \u201cThere was lots of coughing and wincing and rubbing of potions into arthritic backs before the show. And then suddenly you get on stage: Wow! Dr. Theater works his magic.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to exchange thoughts and ideas and know exactly how he\u2019s feeling,\u201d said Mr. Palin, who still visits Mr. Jones and has the occasional drink with him. \u201cHe always seems pleased to see me, and he\u2019s physically in very good shape.

{"Headline": "To Understand Betsy DeVos\u2019s Educational Views, View Her Education", "Date": "2017-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOLLAND, Mich. \u2014 The students formed a circle around the Rev. Ray Vanderlaan, who draped himself in a Jewish ceremonial prayer shawl to cap his final lesson to graduating seniors in his discipleship seminar at Holland Christian High School.\u201cWe\u2019re sending you out into a broken world, in part because of my generation,\u201d the minister told the students. Referring to God, he exhorted them to \u201cextend his kingdom.\u201dMr. Vanderlaan could not have missed his lesson\u2019s echoes of Holland Christian\u2019s most famous graduate, Betsy DeVos, who proclaimed in an audio recording that surfaced in December that her education advocacy would \u201cadvance God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d Last month, in her first commencement address as education secretary, Ms. DeVos again reflected her own education when she told graduates at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Fla., that \u201cmy generation hasn\u2019t done a great job when it comes to dealing with one another in grace.\u201dShe continued, \u201cYou have an opportunity to do better.\u201dHolland Christian is one of several western Michigan nonpublic schools that have helped shape Ms. DeVos\u2019s views of elementary and secondary education, and that her critics fear she will draw from to upend the nation\u2019s public schools. The private Christian school that she attended, another that she sent her children to and a hardscrabble private religious school that she has long supported have dominated her time, money and attention.Public neighborhood schools \u2014 the vast majority of schools in this country \u2014 were hardly present in the billionaire\u2019s childhood or adult life.Critics say this lopsided exposure fueled Ms. DeVos\u2019s staunch support of privately run, publicly funded charter schools and voucher programs that allow families to take tax dollars from the public education system to private schools.In an interview, Ms. DeVos disagreed, saying the schools in which she has personal investment reflect only an agenda of empowering parents with a right that she was afforded by privilege: choice.\u201cSome say, \u2018You\u2019re trying to force all families to make choices other than public schools,\u2019 and the response to that is, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cIf your public school is working great for your child, you should embrace that and support it and celebrate it. And if not, you should have the opportunity to choose something different.\u201dMs. DeVos has maintained that she is \u201cagnostic\u201d about the type of schools that parents choose for their children. But in western Michigan, skeptics doubt professions of open-mindedness from someone who grew up in Holland \u2014 a town founded by Dutch Calvinist separatists and perceived as insular \u2014 and educated in parochial schools.\u201cThe Christian schools in Michigan were set up to be separate from the state, and now her intent is to use the state to finance them,\u201d said Mary Bouwense, president of the Grand Rapids Education Association, who has taught in public schools for 25 years. \u201cI know she says it\u2019s about choice, but it\u2019s really about funneling money to what she knows.\u201d\u201cI think her agenda is shaped by her idea of what God wants for the world,\u201d Ms. Bouwense said.Holland Christian\u2019s superintendent, Dan Meester, said he was not surprised that the school\u2019s most famous alumna has seemed unshaken by the backlash.\u201cWhat we teach here is to identify areas of this world infected with chaos and ask how, as a Christian, can I help bring shalom to that,\u201d he said, using the Hebrew word for peace. \u201cWhat we see is her out there saying, \u2018There are families and students in this country for whom the education system is chaos, and they need it to be flourishing.\u2019\u201dMs. DeVos attended the elementary, middle and high schools at Holland Christian. Students there go to chapel three times a week, a display of crucifixes from around the world graces the main corridor and the school\u2019s sports teams are encouraged to \u201ccompete in God-honoring ways.\u201dMs. DeVos was not as cloistered as her schooling would suggest, she said. She attended dances and football games with her public school friends because there were none at Holland Christian. She recalled that for her high school\u2019s junior banquet, students would decorate the gym, get dressed up, go out to eat and then go home.\u201cI thought: \u2018That is really dumb. We need to have dancing,\u2019\u201d she said. During her junior year, her parents began sponsoring dances off-site after the banquet, a tradition that continues.Holland Christian now serves 1,700 students across five schools for $6,000 to $8,000 a year. But about one-third of the school\u2019s families receive a total of about $1 million a year in financial aid.The attention brought by Ms. DeVos, who graduated in 1975, has put Holland Christian on the defensive in recent months.\u201cWe value faith and learning,\u201d Mr. Meester said. \u201cYou will never hear a teacher say, \u2018I don\u2019t care if you forget everything, as long as God loves you.\u2019\u201dMs. DeVos described the role of religion in her life: \u201cMy faith motivates me to really try to work on behalf of and advocate for those who are least able to advocate for themselves.\u201dHer children were mostly educated in private Christian schools because of their proximity to home and the DeVoses\u2019 preference for faith-based learning. The children attended Ada Christian Schools for primary school, which Ms. DeVos praised for its creativity and teachers.She decided to home-school her elder daughter in sixth through eighth grades because, Ms. Devos said, the daughter had grown increasingly bored in school and the girls in her class were growing increasingly \u201ccatty.\u201dAll four of Ms. DeVos\u2019s children graduated from Grand Rapids Christian High School, in the largest western Michigan city, about 45 minutes from Holland. Ms. DeVos said she had preferred Grand Rapids\u2019s Christian school over others because its philosophy was to \u201cengage with the world, not hide from the world.\u201dThe DeVoses also preferred private schools because, she said, they were independent and could be more flexible when she and her husband, Dick DeVos, wanted their children to accompany them on business travel.\u201cIf you ask any of my kids today what their most important experience was in their education, they would say it was the travel and the ability to see and be in other cultures,\u201d she said.Ms. DeVos also said she had chosen Grand Rapids Christian because it was more diverse than her neighborhood school in the wealthy suburb of Ada. Today, Grand Rapids Christian\u2019s enrollment in kindergarten through 12th grade is more than 25 percent minority, 30 percent of its students qualify for free and reduced-priced meals, and 45 percent receive financial aid.Tom DeJonge, superintendent of Grand Rapids Christian Schools and a longtime friend of the DeVos family, said he was proud that the school drew students who couldn\u2019t cover full tuition, as the DeVoses did (they paid about $10,000 a year per child), and who took public transit to school.On a recent visit, the school looked like a relaxed comprehensive public high school: Students lounged in the hallway eating ice cream cones or bantered with their chemistry teacher. The school embraces both secular and nonsecular curriculums. Students learn creationism and evolution and study other religious influences like Hinduism.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to separate God and Scripture from any other aspect of life,\u201d but other influences do intrude, Mr. DeJonge said. \u201cWe do not put our heads in the sand, and neither does Betsy.\u201dLarry Borst, who taught all of the DeVos children, recalled their asking probing questions about religion. They did not expect to be treated any differently just because their last name adorned buildings across town.\u201cSure, they went on better vacations, but they\u2019re just dirt-floor people,\u201d Mr. Borst said.Ms. DeVos is still involved in the school. She has mentored one Grand Rapids Christian student, whom she met while a mentor in the public school system, for more than a decade. And the school\u2019s DeVos Center for Arts and Worship attests to the hundreds of thousands of dollars the family has donated.That involvement has not won over all her critics.\u201cThe fact that she\u2019s mentored a child or two doesn\u2019t change the fact that she is Public Enemy No. 1 for public schools,\u201d said Brandon Dillon, who represented Grand Rapids in the State House for four years and is chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party.John Booy has no time for such \u201chysterics,\u201d which he said were fueled by teachers\u2019 unions, including the one he belonged to for 27 years as a Grand Rapids Public Schools teacher. Mr. Booy met Ms. DeVos more than 30 years ago, shortly after she visited the school he founded, called the Potter\u2019s House. She had missed a fund-raising event, then called him to apologize and ask if she could visit.The Potter\u2019s House is one of the few schools that Ms. DeVos has referred to by name in her campaign for school choice, saying the school represented the kinds of families who used choice to obtain a better education for their children. The DeVoses have been \u201cpartners\u201d at the school for decades, underwriting individual students\u2019 $5,000 tuition, and even entire classes for $25,000.The school allows families to pay what they can afford, most no more than 10 percent of their net income.Mr. Booy, a self-described \u201cradical idealist,\u201d started the \u201cChrist-centered urban school\u201d 36 years ago. He had thought he could change the world after college by moving to a low-income neighborhood and becoming a public school teacher. But at gatherings he hosted at his home, he saw public school students falling through the cracks.A pastor asked him and his colleagues to start a school, and the Potter\u2019s House \u2014 named after scriptural verse in Jeremiah 18 \u2014 was born.\u201cI think getting involved with the school was an education for her,\u201d Mr. Booy said of Ms. DeVos. \u201cShe could hear stories of people and their desperation, and the problems they run against just trying to get a good education.\u201dAbout 60 percent of the Potter\u2019s House\u2019s 560 students are minority and low-income, from 37 countries; 30 percent speak Spanish. Five Syrian refugees enrolled in the high school this year.Each student is greeted by name and a handshake, and the school\u2019s elementary and middle schools are wallpapered in student art, murals and \u201cvision boards\u201d with smiling faces of alumni who are first-generation collegegoers.Mr. Booy said two things separated his school and his old public school: teacher involvement and parent buy-in.Though teachers are not unionized, they are certified, and all are required to sign off on their application that \u201cI accept without reservation the school\u2019s statement of faith.\u201d Parents are required to sign a similar statement, attend all three annual parent-teacher conferences and commit to 25 hours of service a year or leave the school. No one has had to leave. The school has a waiting list of more than 200.Mr. Booy rejects the notion that his school is doing harm to public schools.\u201cEven though we\u2019re not a public school, we\u2019re educating for the public good,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need to be more about saving a child than a child saving the system.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They had paid for access, for a chance to sip bubbly with lawmakers in the halls of Australian government.I was a bit surprised by the scene, but then I remembered something the novelist Richard Flanagan had told me: \u201cAustralia is a lot more like Asia than people realize. It\u2019s got these very closeted but very accepted forms of corruption.\u201dThe report focused in part on two billionaire property developers who have given millions of dollars to Australian politicians: Chau Chak Wing, an Australian citizen, and Huang Xiangmo, a resident who has applied for citizenship.Both men have denied that their generosity has anything to do with efforts to tilt Australian politics toward China.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said this week that he wants to put an end to some of this by banning donations from foreigners. The idea appears to have wide support even if it is a convenient bit of outrage for Mr. Turnbull given that more of money from Chinese donors is believed to go not to his party, but to Labor.The real question, though, according to some of the legal scholars we talked to, is: When will Australia go beyond cutting off foreigners, and shaming China, to create a more transparent political culture that forces all parties to disclose a wider range of giving, quickly, and to explain how the money they receive is spent?Further to the point, when democracies worldwide are facing toxic distrust and cynicism, when will elected leaders here and elsewhere do more to address public frustration with a political structure that looks rigged and wired up for those who have already acquired power and wealth?Now here are a few other items worth reading, some tied to Australia, some not \u2014 followed by a few recommendations from my trip to Melbourne._____________________________My final suggestion, drawn from a few more beers at Belleville with an old friend from San Francisco who now lives in Melbourne, is a 1999 documentary that captures the American working-class with humor and dignity.Here\u2019s a key passage from the review:\u201cThese may not be people whom moviegoers think they want to spend time with, but this is accomplished documentary making, finding universal lessons in determination, struggle, planning, persistence and the relationship of mind and body.

{"Headline": "Why Did China Detain Anbang\u2019s Chairman? He Tested a Lot of Limits", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chairman, Wu Xiaohui, has not been publicly accused of any wrongdoing, and the authorities in China sometimes detain financiers for questioning only to release them to resume their duties a few days later. Anbang said on its website on Wednesday only that Mr. Wu was temporarily unable to fulfill his duties as chairman for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201dAnbang embodies the contradictions of China\u2019s modern economy, with its potentially combustible mix of risk-taking capitalism and episodically draconian government control. Abroad, Anbang shocked Wall Street with its multibillion-dollar takeover efforts, even as Beijing moved to rein in deals. At home, it drew tens of billions of dollars from Chinese investors big and small looking for their own success stories \u2014 making it vulnerable at a time when Beijing is looking to limit potential financial explosions. And it played the fraught game of politics on both sides of the Pacific, including courting Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump.On paper, the company appeared to be a quiet, conservative insurer. But Anbang often seemed to behave as though the usual informal political guidelines did not apply \u2014 possibly because Mr. Wu was married to a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, a major Communist Party figure who was China\u2019s paramount leader in the 1980s.\u201cOne of the basic rules of operating in China is everybody is a dog on a leash,\u201d said Fraser Howie, a former banker in Asia who has co-written three books on the Chinese financial system. \u201cNobody has freedom. The party does not give anybody freedom. They merely give them a leash.\u201dOne bright line for Chinese companies: Try not to get mixed up in China\u2019s foreign policy without clear backing from Chinese leaders.Yet Anbang tried late last year to invest in an office building partly owned by Mr. Kushner. The potential investment, which was never consummated, became controversial in the United States because of Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in setting China policies in the Trump administration, and exposed Beijing to accusations that it was trying to meddle in American politics. No Chinese bank stepped forward to play any role in a possible transaction.Some analysts in China said that political considerations were likely to be the main reason that Beijing had detained Mr. Wu, pointing to a Communist Party meeting scheduled for late this year at which party officials are to consider changes in leadership. Anbang has a murky ownership structure that traces back to family and friends of Mr. Wu who live on apparently modest means, fueling speculation in China that other wealthy and powerful figures may be behind it.Anbang also pushed \u2014 and even defied \u2014 the government\u2019s often loosely defined limits on what Chinese insurers are allowed to do.That campaign continued even after the Shanghai stock market crashed in the summer of 2015, which prompted the Chinese government to begin stepping up its measures to discourage companies and individuals from taking large sums of money out of the country. Just last week came the disclosure that, starting in September, banks will be required to send daily reports to the government on every overseas credit card expenditure by their customers of more than 1,000 renminbi, or $147.Anbang has also argued that it did not depend on converting renminbi into foreign currencies to make its acquisitions, but has not explained how it was able to finance so many foreign deals without converting large sums.To fund its investments, Anbang aggressively marketed what in China are called wealth management products. Wealth management products are often short-term investments that offer investors considerably higher rates of return than are paid on bank deposits. While they are often sold out of the offices of banks and securities brokerages, giving investors a sense of confidence, the money often goes off the balance sheets of banks and into murky and sometimes speculative investments.Anbang\u2019s wealth management product sales contributed to eye-popping growth. In the six years through last December, the assets of Anbang\u2019s life insurance unit multiplied 2,876-fold, to $213 billion. Anbang also has a much smaller property and casualty insurance business.\u201cThe nature of insurance should be safety, mobility, and the least concern is yield,\u201d said Ju Lan, the director of the risk management and insurance research center at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University. \u201cSince we don\u2019t allow insurance companies to go bankrupt, once one gets into trouble, the government needs to save it.\u201dAfter the detention of Mr. Wu, investors in Anbang wealth management products lit up social media starting on Tuesday night with questions about whether to leave their money with the company or to demand it back immediately, incurring significant penalties for early redemption.\u201cI am worried something big will happen and I won\u2019t get my money back,\u201d wrote one investor. \u201cYet it costs a lot to quit as well.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong, and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Gangsters, Grandmothers and Gold: Japan\u2019s New Crime Wave", "Date": "2017-06-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Sometimes the perpetrators are gangsters. Sometimes they are rather less accustomed to the criminal life. In one case, the ringleader of a middle-aged, female crime ring was said to be a 66-year-old woman.An old-fashioned crime is experiencing a resurgence in Japan: gold smuggling. The authorities say they are contending with a startling rise in the amount of gold being brought illegally into the country. The smugglers \u2014 an array of professional criminals and enterprising amateurs \u2014 profit by dodging import duties and taxes, in some cases worth millions of dollars. Arrests have jumped 40-fold in just a few years.The smuggling has gained national attention because of a spate of high-profile episodes, including a brazen gold robbery by thieves dressed as police officers; the seizure of multimillion-dollar gold cargoes from fishing boats and private jets; and the foiling of the smuggling ring the police have said was organized by a 66-year-old housewife.Crime rates in Japan are among the world\u2019s lowest and have been falling further as the population ages. But some nonviolent crimes, like shoplifting or embezzlement, have remained more common than other offenses \u2014 say, murder or armed robbery.Experts say gold smuggling is the type of crime that might appeal even in law-and-order Japan: It requires no violence, has no victims except state coffers and does not call for an aging person to carry a gun.\u201cPsychologically, it\u2019s something you can do more casually than drug smuggling,\u201d said Takahisa Urushibata, a criminologist at Osaka University of Economics and Law. \u201cPeople see it as an easy way to earn extra cash, almost like a part-time job.\u201dIn small amounts, gold can be easy to smuggle. Customs officials report that people carry it into Japan in pouches sewn in their underwear and in bars taped to the bottoms of their feet.This month, the police in central Japan arrested five women in their 50s and 60s on suspicion of hiding nearly 70 pounds of gold in their clothing on flights from South Korea, a haul worth about $1.2 million.The woman accused of leading the group, the 66-year-old, admitted making eight such trips in the past three years, according to the police. Criminals in Japan covered the airfare and hotel bills of her and her companions and paid them $200 to $400 per pound of smuggled gold. (The women were in custody and could not be reached for comment, directly or through legal representatives.)Some smugglers work on a larger scale.The Coast Guard said last month that it stopped a fishing boat loaded with about 460 pounds of gold, worth roughly $9.1 million. In a separate case in December, two men connected to a yakuza crime syndicate, the Inagawa-kai, were arrested at an airport in Okinawa after flying in from Macau with 250 pounds of gold stashed aboard a Gulfstream private jet.Smugglers have sometimes become targets. Two who were on their way to a cash-for-gold shop in Fukuoka last year were confronted by criminals in police uniforms who relieved them of cases containing several hundred pounds of gold bars, worth $6.9 million. Six men were arrested last month in connection with the robbery.Gold smugglers are essentially profiting from the tax law.The police say the smuggled gold comes from places where purchases are not taxed, like Hong Kong or Macau. It is ferreted in mostly by plane, either directly or through neighboring South Korea, which shares air links with many Japanese cities. The smugglers, unlike legitimate importers, hide their cargoes from customs agents and skip an 8 percent duty on gold brought into the country.Once in Japan, the gold is sold at pawnshoplike cash-for-gold stores. Such enterprises pay sellers, even individual ones, the value of the metal in addition to sales tax. That is the key to profit: Smugglers pocket the tax portion, netting an automatic gain of 8 percent. While the margin might sound small, for a commodity worth more than a thousand dollars an ounce, the money can quickly add up. A sales tax increase in 2014 expanded the potential for profit.The risks, by contrast, can seem small.While it is impossible to know how many smugglers avoid detection, specialists say most probably do. A man and a woman arrested on suspicion of gold smuggling in 2009 said they had made 56 round trips to Hong Kong and Australia, netting a profit of $1.4 million, before getting caught, according to records collected by the customs authorities.The unlucky few who do get caught are typically charged only with evading the sales tax, an offense that carries a maximum fine of about $90,000. Once the fine is paid, the gold is usually returned, customs officials said.Smuggling cases have multiplied. During the decade before the sales tax increase, the police arrested about 10 people on suspicion of gold smuggling-related tax evasion in a typical year, according to data compiled by the Ministry of Finance. In 2015, there were 294 arrests, a pace that continued last year, officials say, though official figures for 2016 are not yet available.Yakuza syndicates are behind some of the smuggling, said Atsushi Mizoguchi, a nonfiction writer who specializes in Japan\u2019s criminal underworld. But much of it, he said, is carried out by newer, more loosely knit groups who lack formal ties to traditional organized crime.\u201cThey\u2019re more creative than the yakuza,\u201d Mr. Mizoguchi said. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re rich, so they can scale up by buying even more gold.\u201dHisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Last, Jeff Bezos Offers a Hint of His Philanthropic Plans", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside WealthJeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, is well on his way to becoming the richest person in the world, with a net worth of more than $80 billion. What\u2019s less certain is what he plans to do with his fortune, and how he could reinvent philanthropy.Citing a homeless program in Seattle, Amazon\u2019s hometown, that the company is working with, he said he was seeking to help people \u201cat the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you have any ideas, just reply to this tweet...\u201dThe message was classic Bezos \u2014 challenging conventional wisdom, seeking the wisdom of the market and highlighting his various businesses. Yet it failed to answer a question that is likely to follow him more often if and when he becomes the richest man: What are his plans to give away some or all of his wealth?Mr. Bezos, who owns about 17 percent of Amazon, has enjoyed what could be the most rapid personal-wealth surge in history. As Amazon\u2019s share price has more than tripled since 2015, its leader has added more than $50 billion to his net worth, bringing his current total to nearly $83 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is now less than $7 billion shy of taking the title of the world\u2019s richest person from Bill Gates, who has held the crown for 18 of the past 23 years.Mr. Bezos\u2019 wealth is proof of Amazon\u2019s seemingly unstoppable growth and dominance in a wide range of fields, including online retailing and cloud computing. It adds another Horatio Alger story to the mythmaking machine of American wealth \u2014 showcasing someone from the middle class who was adopted by his Cuban-immigrant stepfather, quit his Wall Street job to start selling books online from his garage and created a company now worth nearly a half trillion dollars.Yet until Thursday, his philanthropy remained largely a mystery.Still, Mr. Bezos has never said publicly what he plans to do with his fortune, what causes he might support or even whether he will give away some or most of it.Mr. Bezos declined to comment for this article. His Twitter invitation on Thursday came after repeated questions on Wednesday from The Times about his giving levels and the lack of public information on his philanthropy. A spokesman declined to comment on whether the queries prompted the post.The Twitter post \u2014 while offering the most insight so far about his philanthropy thinking \u2014 did not commit to any funding levels or to creating a foundation or an L.L.C., as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and other billionaires have done.Experts on nonprofits and friends of Mr. Bezos say he has been more focused on building Amazon and would probably turn to philanthropy later. The more wealth he creates today, they said, the more he can give away later.\u201cI took the less safe path to follow my passion,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m proud of that choice.\u201dYet Mr. Bezos has so far refused the kind of charitable pledges common among billionaires today. The Bezoses\u2019 giving has largely been a family affair, with Mr. Bezos\u2019 role hard to determine. Nonprofit experts said the Bezos Family Foundation, while funded with Amazon stock, is mainly led by Mr. Bezos\u2019 mother. The foundation has given away tens of millions of dollars, mainly to causes related to child brain development and early education.And judging from his Twitter post and conversations with people who know Mr. Bezos, he wants to forge a new path for addressing social problems rather than just writing checks to nonprofits. His desire to get ideas from the public and fund \u201chere and now\u201d philanthropy suggests what could be a bold new direction for philanthropy.Mr. Bezos also sees for-profit ventures as a more effective way to solve certain social problems.\u201cIn many cases, for-profit models improve the world more than philanthropy models, if they can be made to work,\u201d he told Charlie Rose in 2010.\u201cWe know that he hasn\u2019t been very receptive to traditional philanthropy,\u201d said Steve Delfin, a Washington-area philanthropy adviser to companies and wealthy families. \u201cMy guess is that at some point, he will create an innovative new model or a hybrid approach. And maybe, like Amazon, he\u2019ll do it better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Silicon Valley Pushed Coding Into American Classrooms", "Date": "2017-06-27", "News": "Supported byEducation DisruptedThe Apple chief\u2019s education mandate was just the latest tech company push for coding courses in schools. But even without Mr. Trump\u2019s support, Silicon Valley is already advancing that agenda \u2014 thanks largely to the marketing prowess of Code.org, an industry-backed nonprofit group.In our tech-driven world, Hadi Partovi argues, computer science has become as essential for students as reading, writing and math. \u201cEncryption is at least as foundational as photosynthesis,\u201d he said.Computer science is also essential to American tech companies, which have become heavily reliant on foreign engineers. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to limit immigration make Code.org\u2019s teach-Americans-to-code agenda even more attractive to the industry.Along the way, Code.org has emerged as a new prototype for Silicon Valley education reform: a social-media-savvy entity that pushes for education policy changes, develops curriculums, offers online coding lessons and trains teachers \u2014 touching nearly every facet of the education supply chain.Mr. Partovi, 44, said he simply wanted to give students the opportunity to develop the same skills that helped him and his backers succeed. He immigrated as a child to the United States from Iran with his family, went on to study computer science at Harvard, and later sold a voice-recognition start-up he had co-founded to Microsoft for a reported $800 million.\u201cThat dream is much less accessible if you are in one of America\u2019s schools where they don\u2019t even tell you you could go into that field,\u201d Mr. Partovi said.Even so, he acknowledged some industry self-interest. \u201cIf you are running a tech company,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s extremely hard to hire and retain engineers.\u201dCode.org is now one of the largest providers of free online coding lessons and more comprehensive computer science curriculums. It has also provided training workshops to more than 57,000 teachers, Mr. Partovi said.The rise of Code.org coincides with a larger tech-industry push to remake American primary and secondary schools with computers and learning apps, a market estimated to reach $21 billion by 2020.Then Mr. Partovi came along with the idea of using a viral video to spark mass demand for the courses.He began by persuading Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, to appear in a short film promoting coding to students. In its first week on YouTube, the video, called \u201cWhat Most Schools Don\u2019t Teach,\u201d racked up roughly nine million views. Within two weeks, Mr. Partovi said, about 20,000 teachers contacted him.Mr. Partovi compared Code.org\u2019s approach to those of start-ups like Airbnb and Uber. \u201cAirbnb is disrupting the travel space, but they don\u2019t own the hotels,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are in a similar model, disrupting education. But we are not running the school and we don\u2019t hire the teachers.\u201dMr. Partovi\u2019s elite connections didn\u2019t hurt.Mr. Partovi, for his part, was hoping to go viral with a message that coding could improve students\u2019 job prospects. Teaching skills that may lead to higher-paying jobs \u201cseems like the kind of idea that everyone in the country can get behind,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi promptly invited Mr. Smith over to preview his celebrity coders video.\u201cWe think computer science is to the 21st century what physics was to the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Smith said.But the movement has also supported legislation that could give companies enormous sway in public schools, starting with kindergarten, with little public awareness.\u201cIt gets very problematic when industry is deciding the content and direction of public education,\u201d said Jane Margolis, a senior researcher at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.The Idaho bill read, in part, \u201cIt is essential that efforts to increase computer science instruction, kindergarten through career, be driven by the needs of industry and be developed in partnership with industry.\u201dWhen a reporter apprised him of the bill\u2019s language, Mr. Smith of Microsoft seemed taken aback, saying he had not endorsed it. \u201cBroad public education should not be grounded first and foremost in the needs of any particular industry \u2014 or in the needs of industry as a whole,\u201d he said.Mr. Partovi noted that Code.org had opposed a \u201cmore extreme\u201d coding bill in Florida that would have required students to obtain industry certification. It has also opposed bills that would allow coding courses to count toward foreign-language credits in high schools, he said. Still, Mr. Partovi added, \u201cWe do think that tech companies have a role to play.\u201dThe clout behind computer science has all but obviated a wider debate about whether, to better prepare students, schools might introduce an array of new subjects. It has also overshadowed discussion about whether students would be better off if schools modified traditional math classes to increase the emphasis on fields like statistics.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said that tech companies and philanthropists were simply trying to give voice to an overlooked subject. \u201cWhat we really need is a national conversation about the broad array of intellectual disciplines that will be fundamental to the future of American students,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a broad array, not a single subject.\u201dMr. Partovi concurred. \u201cWe have a lot of debate in this country about how to teach,\u201d he said, \u201cand not enough debate about what to teach.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hudson Yards Offered a Payday for the Subway, but We Got Offices", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkPilgrims, here is what passes for progress.Moving vans are packed or planned, ready to carry businesses to brand-new office towers in a commercial district that is being created on the Far West Side of Manhattan.The neighborhood is virgin territory \u2014 26 acres built on platforms above rail yards \u2014 but the companies moving there are hardly start-ups.For instance.The developers of the West Side real estate, the Related Companies and Oxford Properties, call it \u201cthe largest private real estate development in the history of the United States.\u201dKind of private.So far, the city has underwritten the project with $626 million in public funds to pay for things like a new boulevard, and extending the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 34th Street and 11th Avenue.The public cash register has not stopped ringing yet.A city official said of the additional $96 million, \u201cIt\u2019s not the most money the city has spent on something.\u201d True.Yet it is musical chairs played at dizzying velocity.Established businesses are moving a few blocks into a publicly subsidized commercial development, where regular property taxes are not being charged. Richard Ravitch, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority who has held a number of senior positions in state government, said: \u201cThey\u2019re moving from a fully taxpaying building to a tax-abated one. Think about that one.\u201dDuring the years Michael R. Bloomberg served as mayor, the city saw a need to create more modern office space and borrowed nearly $3 billion to extend the No. 7 line, which was essential to developing the Far West Side. The financing plan giddily anticipated that the new buildings would generate enough revenue to pay off the bonds, though the city might need to cover the interest payments for a few years. How much would the taxpayers kick in? A study done for the city by Cushman and Wakefield projected that the amount could be as little as $7 million, or in the most pessimistic version, $205 million. In fact, the bill to the public for the interest has turned out to be $359 million.Freddi Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said that as of this year, the project was providing enough revenue to pay the interest, and that the city expected to collect $100 million per year through at least the middle of 2021, and beyond. Officials in the de Blasio administration said they refinanced the debt in a way that would bring money to the city treasury faster.But where will the additional estimated $96 million in costs come from?Ultimately, from the taxpayers\u2019 purse, city budget officials said.While property values are climbing around Hudson Yards, no one can say with authority what is happening to commercial properties that are being vacated to fill the gleaming new spaces. Other public services, beyond the new subway station, will be needed for Hudson Yards, and the total value of tax breaks will be higher than the $723 million tallied so far, said James Parrott, a fiscal analyst who has followed the development.Another chapter of this saga relates to our transit system. The land for the train yards was bought by the M.T.A. in the early 1980s with the idea that one day it would be valuable. The money from developing it could support the constant rebuilding of the century-old system, Mr. Ravitch said.But that\u2019s not what happened. Instead, it was used (along with city subsidies) to pay for new rails for the No. 7 extension.The train yards didn\u2019t buy us any new signals. Instead, they paid for a new stop on the No. 7 line, making possible a new office territory \u2014 and created the perfect moment to own a moving van.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once a Model City, Hong Kong Is in Trouble", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "When the British left 20 years ago, Hong Kong was seen as a rare blend of East and West that China might seek to emulate. Now, increasingly, it\u2019s a cautionary tale.Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 When Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule two decades ago, the city was seen as a model of what China might one day become: prosperous, modern, international, with the broad protections of the rule of law.There was anxiety about how such a place could survive in authoritarian China. But even after Beijing began encroaching on this former British colony\u2019s freedoms, its reputation as one of the best-managed cities in Asia endured.The trains ran on time. Crime and taxes were low. The skyline dazzled with ever taller buildings.Those are still true. Yet as the 20th anniversary of the handover approaches on Saturday, the perception of Hong Kong as something special \u2014 a vibrant crossroads of East and West that China may want to emulate \u2014 is fading fast.Never-ending disputes between the city\u2019s Beijing-backed leadership and the pro-democracy opposition have crippled the government\u2019s ability to make difficult decisions and complete important construction projects.Caught between rival modes of rule \u2014 Beijing\u2019s dictates and the demands of local residents \u2014 the authorities have allowed problems to fester, including an affordable-housing crisis, a troubled education system and a delayed high-speed rail line.Many say the fight over Hong Kong\u2019s political future has paralyzed it, and perhaps doomed it to decline. As a result, the city is increasingly held up not as a model of China\u2019s future but as a cautionary tale \u2014 for Beijing and its allies, of the perils of democracy, and for the opposition, of the perils of authoritarianism.\u201cMore and more, there is a sense of futility,\u201d said Anson Chan, the second-highest official in the Hong Kong government in the years before and after the handover to Chinese rule. She blames Beijing\u2019s interference for the city\u2019s woes. \u201cWe have this enormous giant at our doorstep,\u201d she said, \u201cand the rest of the world does not seem to question whatever the enormous giant does.\u201dOthers spread the blame more broadly. They point to the opposition\u2019s reluctance to compromise and policies that weaken political parties, including multiseat legislative districts that allow radical candidates to win with a minority of votes.\u201cThis kind of a political atmosphere will disrupt many of the initiatives that may come along,\u201d said Anna Wu, a member of the territory\u2019s executive council, or cabinet.A high-speed rail station planned for Hong Kong is a half-finished shell \u2014 years after every other major city in China has been linked by bullet trains.Hong Kong ranks only after New York and London as a center of global finance, but it has no world-class museums. After 15 years of delays, construction of a cultural district intended to rival Lincoln Center has started, but funding from the legislature could be disrupted in the coming days.Widespread complaints about test-obsessed schools leaving students ill equipped to compete against those in mainland China have not led to education reform. Nor has the government found a way to address simmering public anger over skyrocketing rents and housing prices.Hong Kong was once known for the speed and efficiency with which it built huge planned communities with ample public housing every several years. But it has not managed to do so since Britain returned it to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.Hong Kong is still a gem in many ways, a place that is hard not to love, and for its 7.4 million residents, hard to leave.Narrow ribbons of oceanfront skyscrapers are backed by wooded hillsides protected as country parks. Just 10 minutes uphill from the majestic Victoria Harbor and financial district are breathtaking views of the South China Sea. Steel and concrete fade into sylvan trails that wind past lakes and waterfalls, all of it not too far from the city\u2019s cavernous and efficient airport, part of a renowned transport network of subways, buses, trams and ferries.But the airport was built by the British before they left. So were the institutions that really distinguish the city: the independent courts, the widely respected civil service, the freewheeling press.Beijing\u2019s allies have a majority in the legislature because half the 70 seats are selected by interest groups mostly loyal to the mainland government. But the other half is elected, and lawmakers who favor greater democracy have won a majority of those seats. The result is gridlock.The legislature\u2019s rules allow any three members to stall action for months with filibusters. In the last two years, various groups in the pro-democracy camp have repeatedly used that tool as leverage, causing a backlog of legislation that has delayed even projects that are not contentious, like a cleanup plan for the harbor.Both sides agree that the city will become ungovernable without some kind of political change. But they cannot agree on what to do.The democrats want a clear road map to universal suffrage \u2014 which Beijing promised in 2007 \u201cmay be implemented\u201d in 2017 \u2014 starting with direct elections for the chief executive. Only when the government is accountable to the public will it have a mandate to tackle the challenges facing the city, they say.But supporters of Beijing say the problem is too much democracy, not too little.Shiu Sin-por, the departing head of the local government\u2019s agenda-setting Central Policy Unit, said pro-Beijing lawmakers must break with tradition and get tough on filibusters.He also wants to eliminate civil service protections for many senior officials and put them on renewable, short-term contracts \u2014 which would make them more accountable to Beijing.\u201cYou have a lot of deadbeats and layabouts who drag it out until they retire,\u201d he said. \u201cWould elections change this? No.\u201dMr. Shiu, a longtime power broker with close ties to the Beijing government, warned that if Hong Kong remained politically paralyzed, it could slip from the ranks of the world\u2019s great cities and end up like Monaco, a tax haven for the wealthy with few industries beyond financial services and retail.In an interview, Mrs. Lam, who will be sworn in on Saturday, acknowledged \u201ca certain degree of truth\u201d in the argument that the lack of a political overhaul was making it more difficult to address issues like housing, education and infrastructure.But she added: \u201cIf we were to have universal suffrage tomorrow, would all these problems disappear? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dIn many ways, Hong Kong as a city has fared better than its people. Since the handover, more than one million mainland Chinese have moved here, contributing their energy and talents to the territory\u2019s economic development. But the newcomers\u2019 success has sometimes come at the expense of those with deeper roots.Big international companies and banks now aggressively recruit mainland Chinese instead of local residents, who speak Cantonese instead of the Mandarin used on the mainland and who often lack the connections to win deals and thrive there.The language issue is a challenge for Hong Kong\u2019s education system, which tries to teach three of them \u2014 English, as well as Mandarin and Cantonese. This produces many graduates with weaker English and Mandarin than those from the mainland\u2019s top schools.But efforts to address the problem get caught in the city\u2019s fractious politics, with suspicions that Beijing wants to undermine local identity or limit the West\u2019s influence.Soaring prices and rents have squeezed middle-class families and younger residents in particular, fueling resentment against the mainland Chinese who have poured money into the market. Government measures to limit speculation have not deterred those investors, many of whom are looking for a safe way to get their money out of the mainland.The underlying problem is limited supply. Land disputes have nearly halted plans to build big residential areas in the rural sections of northern Hong Kong.Under a policy dating from the colonial era, families in traditional villages there are awarded long-term grants of land, producing suburban sprawl and making it difficult to put together a large parcel for development. The government could force families to sell but is worried about setting off protests, in part because the leaders of those communities have generally supported Beijing.Plans to build elsewhere have also stalled. Efforts to rezone the fringes of country parks for apartment buildings have been blocked by environmentalists, while the government has been leery of the cost of controversial proposals by developers to subsidize land reclamation and build thousands of acres of artificial islands.\u201cThere\u2019s land in Hong Kong, but what we lack is developable land,\u201d said Anthony Cheung, the transport and housing secretary, noting that everyone wanted more housing but no one wanted it built next door. \u201cWe still need to seek local community support.\u201dGaining such support is difficult, though, given deep distrust of the government. Lawsuits by neighborhoods and environmental groups have delayed a range of infrastructure projects that require much less land than housing developments.The planned high-speed rail line, for example, is being built underground the entire 16 miles to the border partly because of the political challenge of obtaining land. That has driven up the project\u2019s cost many times over. Even the tunneling effort required the removal of a village of scarcely 100 people, though, and democracy activists joined them in protests that slowed the initiative.\u201cIt will be used as an excuse to create a serious loophole to allow mainland officers to implement mainland laws in Hong Kong\u2019s territory,\u201d said Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy member of the legislature.As the political wrangling in Hong Kong is drawn out, some people are leaving. One popular destination is Taiwan, a flourishing Chinese democracy with more affordable real estate and news outlets that have not been cowed by Beijing, as many of those in Hong Kong have.Pat Yeung, 43, an entrepreneur, said she moved to Taiwan this summer after a friend emigrated to get her children out of the high-pressure schools, and after she met another couple who relocated in search of cheaper housing.In Hong Kong, with its relentless business competition and darkening political climate, Ms. Yeung said, \u201cthe pressure is too, too much.\u201dIt was a pivotal moment for Hong Kong, with all sides letting a chance at compromise slip by and digging in for what has been a prolonged stalemate.The pro-democracy camp\u2019s biggest mistake may have been believing that President Xi Jinping, who at the time had been in office for almost two years, intended to guide China toward a more pluralistic future.Martin Lee, the founding chairman of the Democratic Party, said that he harbored such hopes because he had met Mr. Xi\u2019s father, a senior Communist leader considered more open-minded than most of Mao\u2019s generals.Others noted Mr. Xi\u2019s record as a leader in the eastern provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, where he adopted a moderate tone while trying to attract Hong Kong investors, said Joseph Cheng, another longtime democracy advocate.Zhang Dejiang, a member of the powerful Politburo Standing Committee, took the lead on policy toward Hong Kong, and some wondered at the time if his hard-line stance reflected Mr. Xi\u2019s views.But there is little doubt now that Mr. Xi calls the shots. After nearly five years in power, he has proved to be a committed authoritarian who considers political liberalization a threat.There seems little hope that Beijing will make Hong Kong an offer better than the one it put forward three years ago. Jasper Tsang, the recently retired president of the legislature and a longtime ally of Beijing, said the attitudes of the Chinese leadership toward the city had hardened.\u201cPeople are telling me there won\u2019t be a second chance,\u201d he said.Last month, Mr. Zhang visited Macau, the former Portuguese colony that is now a Chinese gambling hub, and praised it in terms that suggested he saw it as a model for Hong Kong.People here were stunned because Macau has a reputation for obsequious obedience to Beijing as well as chronic corruption, organized crime and limited tolerance for labor unions and other independent organizations.The worry now is that Mr. Xi may share that vision of Hong Kong\u2019s future. \u201cIf the idea came from him,\u201d Mr. Lee said, \u201cwe are finished.\u201dFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter @KeithBradsherAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peace Efforts May Be Another Casualty of Bombing in Afghanistan", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past several weeks, the Afghan government and the foreign missions here have been preparing for a conference on Tuesday 6 in which senior representatives from nearly two dozen countries were to gather in Kabul to discuss the war.The plan was that President Ashraf Ghani would use the conference as a venue to try to build international support as he emphasized that his government was recommitted to the idea that negotiations were needed. Officials characterized it as an Afghan attempt to bring all the regional and political players together to try to take control of a process that has repeatedly been derailed by a lack of cooperation from neighboring powers and by Taliban military gains.But the bombing, which the government says was committed by the Haqqani wing of the Taliban, has cast a shadow over the effort in several ways \u2014 a demonstration of how fragile even the earliest steps of peacemaking can be in the middle of a war.Abdul Hakim Mujahid, who used to be a Taliban ambassador to the United Nations and is now a member of Afghan government\u2019s High Peace Council, said that even though the Taliban spokesman had denied that the group was responsible for the bombing on Wednesday, the attack had nevertheless further complicated an already difficult task.\u201cThere are movements underway about peace and the making of a peace deal, but I am not hopeful about the current situation,\u201d Mr. Mujahid said.First was the physical reality of a huge bomb going off in the diplomatic district of Kabul.Aides to Mr. Ghani said that he was determined to go ahead with the conference even if it meant some of the foreign dignitaries attending via video conference. And Afghan officials and diplomats scrambled around the city on Thursday, often having to skirt the blast\u2019s large crater as it was being filled by city workers, in a push to keep the meeting on schedule.Some Western officials said the meeting was on schedule as late as Thursday evening. But several expressed concern, saying the security environment was just not right for dignitaries from their capitals to visit. One diplomat said even the idea of visiting the palace for briefings felt daunting, given how close the bombing was and how steep the death toll was, rising to almost 100 people on Thursday.The damage from Wednesday\u2019s blast was so widespread that some of the embassies in Kabul were in no shape to host their own dignitaries for the meeting. The windows of the Foreign Ministry, including the hall where many of the sessions were supposed to happen, were also blown in.The staff at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates, who ambassador and diplomats were killed in another blast in Kandahar in January, was flown out of the country hours after the bombing.Diplomats at the German Embassy, who had already shifted deeper into their compound upon being alerted of a threat weeks ago, had to evacuate as their facilities were badly damaged. Western officials said the employees of the German development agency, the GIZ, were flown to Dubai, and that some staff from the Turkish mission would also be evacuating temporarily. The Iranian Embassy was also badly damaged.There was another concern, also: that a forum meant to revive efforts for peace could become another platform for furthering regional tensions if the Afghan government intensified its accusations against Pakistan.In the hours after the bombing, the Afghan intelligence agency pointedly accused the Pakistani military intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, of facilitating the bombing by its allies in the Haqqani network.In his address to the nation, Mr. Ghani turned to a combative tone again, calling for no restraint in \u201cdestroying terrorism,\u201d and making a barely veiled accusation against Pakistan, saying that the international community knows well \u201cthose who train and support terrorism as a political tool.\u201dAnd on Thursday, local Afghan news media reported that the president had signed the execution orders of 11 members of the Taliban in custody. Such prisoners have long been considered bargaining chips to negotiate with the Taliban, but occasionally they have become easy targets for punishment that appeals to public rage.The Taliban responded with a threat, saying that if the prisoners were executed, \u201call offices of the Kabul administration\u201d would come under attack \u201cto teach them a lesson.\u201dA senior Afghan official said the government was once again struggling between trying to moderate its reaction to keep the door open for a peace process, and being led by an angry public demanding vengeance.Jawed Ludin, a former deputy foreign minister involved in past peace efforts, said the Afghan government had no choice but to react emotionally after such carnage.\u201cIn helplessness, I think for nations as well as human beings, the emotional response is very important,\u201d Mr. Ludin said. \u201cYou are being attacked, and the enemy that attacks you is not within your reach even with the help of the most powerful militaries and the most powerful countries in the world, with all that you have at your disposal.\u201dHe continued: \u201cYou are constrained primarily by geography, because people who train these people, mobilize and finance these people, and send them away and equip them are outside your borders. And there is nothing really practically you can do.\u201dHe said past attempts at peace were not necessarily disrupted by emotional reactions, but rather they disintegrated as Pakistan never felt that there would be consequences for not withdrawing support to a Taliban insurgency that has kept Afghanistan weak.\u201cThat critical element to get a process to succeed, that has never been put in place,\u201d Mr. Ludin said. \u201cThat critical element is for Pakistan to be confronted with a reality that if they don\u2019t do this, they will face consequences.\u201dEven if all that could be overcome, officials say the road to peace talks is a long one. And hanging over it is a central question about whether the Taliban, which in recent years has accelerated its military victories, is ready to talk at all right now.One Western official estimated that it could take two to three more years before the Taliban might realize that it has exhausted its potential for military gains. For that to happen, the Afghan security forces, which had close to 20,000 casualties last year, would need to hold their ground, and the Taliban, estimated to have a fighting force of about 30,000 right now, would also need to keep taking heavy casualties.But even those calculations can seem optimistic in the face of a war that has continued unabated well into its second decade, and after many failed attempts to start talks.Fahim Abed and Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Matt Zames to Leave JPMorgan Chase, Seeking to Run His Own Business", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatt Zames, the tough-minded chief operating officer of the banking colossus JPMorgan Chase, is unexpectedly resigning.His departure was disclosed on Thursday in an internal memo from Jamie Dimon, the bank\u2019s chief executive, who spoke admiringly of Mr. Zames\u2019s career.Mr. Zames, Mr. Dimon wrote, \u201crecently informed me of his decision to leave our firm following 13 years of outstanding service.\u201d He has worked \u201ctirelessly across many disciplines to help make us a better company,\u201d Mr. Dimon added.In an interview on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Zames, 46, said he was leaving over a desire to run his own business, either at a financial company or perhaps in a role that combined finance and technology.\u201cI have been in this business almost 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI spent the vast majority of my time running businesses, driving things forward, facing off against clients, taking business risk.\u201d\u201cBut at its core, look: I\u2019ll be 47 in October,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to get back to running the railroad \u2014 running my railroad, running my business. So it\u2019s just a natural point.\u201dHis exit is sure to rekindle speculation about who will succeed Mr. Dimon, who at 61 is in his 11th year as chief executive of the large international bank and has shown little interest in leaving.More recently, the focus has shifted to up-and-comers like Marianne Lake, the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, as well as on established players like Gordon Smith, its chief executive of consumer and community banking, and Daniel Pinto, who runs the corporate and investment bank.Shares of JPMorgan rose 1.24 percent on Thursday.Mr. Zames, who had also been regarded as a potential candidate to be chief executive, said on Thursday that a feeling that he would not obtain that job was not a motivating factor in his decision to leave.The executive has long been associated with crisis management. Mr. Zames worked as a junior trader at Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that had to be rescued in 1998, before playing a leading role in JPMorgan\u2019s emergency takeover of Bear Stearns in 2008.He later recalled walking in to Bear\u2019s Madison Avenue office tower late one evening in March 2008. Bear\u2019s officers had realized that a series of client cash withdrawals had rendered their company insolvent, and Mr. Zames summed up the situation with some characteristically blue language, saying the \u201cwhole thing\u201d was headed in a very bad direction. That office building, one of the most valuable assets sold to JPMorgan in its hasty purchase of Bear, was where Mr. Zames later worked.He did his share of troubleshooting at JPMorgan, too. In the London whale episode, Mr. Zames helped unwind some exotic trades that had created billions of dollars in losses for the bank. He then took over the role of chief investment officer in 2012, reshaping the department that had made the risky transactions and marred JPMorgan\u2019s reputation.At the time, Mr. Dimon praised Mr. Zames as a \u201cworld-class risk manager.\u201dMr. Zames counted some of the most senior hedge fund managers as both clients and personal friends, and was known for giving tough advice, even to competitors.Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago money-management firm Citadel, said that he had been impressed with Mr. Zames since meeting him as a student at M.I.T., 25 years ago.\u201cMatt\u2019s profound impact on JPMorgan reflects the combination of brilliance I saw in him then, and the leadership skills he has developed as he\u2019s taken on challenge after challenge over the years,\u201d Mr. Griffin said in an email.His happiest years at JPMorgan were probably spent running its multi-thousand-person fixed-income business, walking the trading floors of the former Bear building. There he studied markets ranging from interest rates to currencies and mortgage bonds, looking for moments when traders seemed to be reaching consensus on the market\u2019s direction. At those times, he believed, prices were often on the verge of turning unexpectedly.He often called his bond shop the \u201cWalmart\u201d of trading because of its heavy and lucrative flow of buy and sell orders from clients around the world. At one point, he set up a trading floor office for the head of the investment bank at the time, Mr. Staley, now chief executive of Barclays of Britain, to give him more direct exposure to the market\u2019s dynamics.\u201cMy philosophy has always been if you can create a flood of volume through your pipes, you\u2019re meaningfully reducing your risk,\u201d Mr. Zames said on Thursday. \u201cAnd your business will trade at a higher multiple if you do it.\u201dUnder terms of an agreement with JPMorgan filed Thursday, Mr. Zames can collect more than $10 million in compensation in the coming two years if he avoids joining a competing company until February of 2018, among other requirements.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a former executive at JP Morgan Chase.

{"Headline": "How the Saudi-Qatar Rivalry, Now Combusting, Reshaped the Middle East", "Date": "2017-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterThe crisis convulsing the Persian Gulf, entangling the United States and now threatening to pull in Turkey and Iran, can be traced to a dilemma facing a man who had just deposed his own father.He believed Qatar could find security only by transforming itself from Saudi appendage to rival. But how?The audacious plan he put in motion set off something of a regional cold war, in time remaking not just the politics of the oil-rich Persian Gulf, but also those of the entire Middle East, culminating in last week\u2019s crisis.It would be as if Cuba sought to break from American influence by becoming a global superpower overnight, competing with the United States across Asia and Europe.In the years before Sheikh Hamad took power, a few incidents deepened his desire to break from Saudi domination.In 1988, his father had established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, a Saudi adversary, giving Qatar a taste of an independent foreign policy.In 1992, a clash with Saudi Arabia along their short but disputed border left two Qatari soldiers dead. Two years later, when Yemen fell into a brief civil war, Qatar and Saudi Arabia backed opposing sides.Autonomy, Sheikh Hamad learned, could be both feasible and desirable.Marc Lynch, a political scientist at George Washington University, put Sheikh Hamad\u2019s view as: \u201cWhy be under the thumb of the Saudis if you don\u2019t have to be?\u201dThe Qatari emir also had ambitions to prove himself more than a Saudi vassal.\u201cA lot of it does come down to personality,\u201d Mr. Lynch said. \u201cWhen the new emir comes in, he really does have a chip on his shoulder.\u201dFew countries have ever grown from client state to regional power. Qatar managed it in just a few years.\u201cFrom the late 1990s on, Qatari foreign policy is a combination of: \u2018What can we do to get ourselves on the map?\u2019 and \u2018What can we do to annoy the Saudis?\u2019\u201d Mr. Lynch said.Qatar cultivated ties with Iran and established trade relations with Israel. It became host to a large American air base, in part to guard against Saudi bullying.It also made use of its history as a once-remote haven for Islamist exiles. If foreign governments had to deal with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Palestinian group Hamas, Chechen separatists or even the Taliban, they often went through Qatar.The United States found Qatar\u2019s diplomacy useful, if sometimes annoying, using it as a base for Afghan peace talks. It relied on its Qatari air base for the war in Iraq and, later, strikes in Syria.In 2002, Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Qatar, nominally over Al Jazeera\u2019s criticism of the Saudi government.\u201cIt takes until 2008 for Saudi Arabia to really digest the notion that Qatar is a fully independent state,\u201d said David B. Roberts, a professor at King\u2019s College London.The Saudi ambassador returned to Qatar in 2008, and the two neighbors might have found equilibrium if not for what came next.The Arab Spring, which saw uprisings across the region in 2011, provided Qatar with an opening.For all its rising influence, Qatar had never been able to crack Saudi regional dominance. Now, with Saudi-aligned autocrats under threat, it saw opportunity.It backed antigovernment movements, both secular and Islamist, with Al Jazeera airtime, diplomatic support and, later, money and sometimes weapons, hoping to install friendly new governments. When Islamists showed the most promise, Qatar threw its support behind them.To Saudi Arabia, the uprisings imperiled both the regional order and, potentially, its own rule; populist Islamist movements had long challenged it at home.Every time a vacuum opened, both gulf rivals would rush to fill it first. \u201cFrom 2011 to 2013, they\u2019re in open proxy warfare across the region,\u201d Mr. Lynch said.In Tunisia, for instance, each supported opposing political parties.Elsewhere, their rivalry fueled violence. In Libya, each backed armed groups that would later fight a civil war. In Syria, they sought to outbid each other in financing rebels, including extremists.In Egypt, Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood, whose candidate won the country\u2019s first real presidential vote in 2012. The next year, when the Egyptian military took power in a coup, Saudi Arabia and its allies awarded the new rulers a $12 billion aid package.These interventions, in addition to shaping the Arab Spring, helped realign the region\u2019s geopolitics.Turkey, for its own reasons, joined Qatar in backing the uprisings, forming the basis of Qatar\u2019s first real alliance.Sunni monarchies like the United Arab Emirates, fearing uprisings at home, consolidated behind Saudi leadership and against Qatar.The rivalry even extended to Washington, where Qatar spent lavishly on lobbying and think tank donations. The United Arab Emirates did the same, seeking to keep pace with Qatar\u2019s influence in the United States.\u201cIn 2013, you have more or less a rout of the Qatari position,\u201d Mr. Lynch said.Still, Qatar retained the autonomy and network of connections that had been its original goal.Saudi Arabia tolerated Qatar\u2019s autonomy, to focus on another regional proxy war, against Iran. This also served the interests of the United States, which relied on both Saudi Arabia and Qatar in fighting the Islamic State and wanted their rivalry stabilized.The 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, which Saudi Arabia opposed, further complicated the issue. It left Saudi Arabia more concerned by Qatar\u2019s links to Iran, however limited, but less willing to pressure Qatar, which the Saudis knew would inflame tensions with Washington over the Iran deal.The rivals were left in a tenuous, uneasy balance.Though Qatar had stepped back, its campaign taught Saudi Arabia a lesson: An uncontrolled Qatar posed a grave threat.Saudi Arabia, joined by other gulf states and Egypt, finally found its opportunity to reimpose dominance with last week\u2019s blockade.This would also force fence-sitters to choose sides, at a moment when Saudi Arabia is stronger. Riyadh is still working to re-establish regional dominance, under growing pressure from Iran.But Saudi Arabia appeared to quickly win the greatest prize of all: American backing.But forcing hands can be risky.Iran has offered food aid to Qatar, betting that it can expand its influence there and perhaps with two other gulf states, Kuwait and Oman, that seek a balance between it and Saudi Arabia.The most significant move could come from Turkey, which has sided vocally with Qatar. Its Parliament approved a measure allowing Turkey to deploy up to 3,000 troops to its base in Qatar, where 100 are currently stationed.Aaron Stein, an analyst at the Atlantic Council, a think tank based in Washington, said Turkey had recently patched up relations with Saudi Arabia, seeking a middle ground, \u201cbut there are limits to that.\u201dTurkey\u2019s state-dominated media, which has few pro-Saudi voices, has championed the defense of Qatar, an ally, as a nationalist cause.Though Turkey is a NATO member, over the past year it has joined Iran in aligning its regional strategy with Russia\u2019s. Moscow\u2019s position could gain in the crisis as American allies quarrel.Though few expect the standoff to escalate to violence, it remains far from clear how it will be resolved. This may be the end of the two-decade Saudi-Qatar rivalry, or it could bring just another layer of instability and crosscutting alliances to a region that already has plenty.A capsule summary on Tuesday for an article about the decades-long rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Qatar omitted the context in describing the population of Qatar. The country\u2019s population was one-seventh that of Connecticut\u2019s in 1995 when its crown prince seized power; that is not a current comparison. (Qatar now has about 2.6 million people and Connecticut about 3.6 million.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lessons From the Collapse of Banco Popular", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameRather than panic, though, world financial markets shrugged, and eurozone regulators congratulated themselves for directing a big bank rescue without having to tap taxpayers.Isn\u2019t it good to know that everything is under control among eurozone banks?That is the view investors seem to be taking. Whistling past the Banco Popular graveyard, many seem eager to ignore the warnings this failure raises about rising risks in the European banking sector. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, too, seem unfazed by the incident as they continue their push to reduce the size of capital cushions that banks must set aside for bad times.But its rescue, European financial regulators say, proved that the mechanisms created after the 2008 crisis work well. After all, no taxpayer money was involved in the takeover; those on the losing end included investors in the bank\u2019s stock and in the $1.4 billion in debt-like instruments Banco Popular issued to provide a capital cushion.Santander\u2019s shareholders are also taking a hit: Their holdings are diluted by the bank\u2019s decision to raise $7.9 billion in equity to shore up its balance sheet.But there is much for investors to learn in the Banco Popular meltdown. Lesson No. 1: Don\u2019t trust bank stress-test results.Financial institutions must have capital on hand in order to absorb losses. And stress tests were designed by regulators to assess how resilient bank balance sheets will be during downturns. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Board released the results at 34 of the nation\u2019s largest banks. All exceeded their minimum thresholds.Consider, for example, the institution\u2019s common equity Tier 1 capital, a measure that takes its equity, or ready capital, and divides it by the risk-weighted assets it holds. In the 2016 report, that measure stood at 10.2 percent of assets, which was below the 12.6 percent average among 51 big European banks, but not the worst on the list.Even in a so-called adverse scenario, the 2016 test said, Banco Popular would have excess capital of 6.6 percent.This spring, amid a genuinely adverse situation, this supposed capital cushion vanished almost overnight. After top Banco Popular officials said they needed to raise capital in April, the institution began to experience a run. Then, in early June the bank received $4 billion in emergency assistance from the Spanish central bank; it was consumed in two days. The Santander deal quickly followed.Lesson No. 2 of the Banco Popular collapse is that regulators should require banks to maintain higher leverage ratios, another measure of capital adequacy. And yet this is a regulatory requirement the Trump administration wants to loosen.Leverage ratios are computed by dividing a bank\u2019s tangible common equity by its total assets. Currently, large United States bank holding companies must have a leverage ratio of at least 5 percent to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. European regulators are much more lenient, requiring a ratio of only 3 percent beginning in January 2018.Obviously, given the rescue, the bank\u2019s capital was inadequate.And yet, Mr. Hoenig said, the leverage ratio is under attack.Left unsaid is that looser capital requirements could also result in greater risk of a taxpayer bailout.Which leads us to lesson No. 3 from the Banco Popular mess: Don\u2019t reach for yield if you\u2019re not ready for the risk.Investors who bought contingent convertible securities issued by Banco Popular to fund its capital cushion learned this the hard way. They were wiped out literally overnight in the failure.These securities, also known as additional tier notes, are part of the regulatory regime in Europe and are designed to absorb losses when a bank gets in trouble. Mutual funds and insurance companies often buy these securities for their slightly higher yields.The idea is that the creditors holding these instruments, not taxpayers, will pay the price of a failure \u2014 and that is what occurred in the Banco Popular collapse.Trading in the Banco Popular securities has been stunning. In April they were above par, in bond parlance, or 100, but the day before the bank failed, they were trading around 50. The next day they went to zero.Still, the market for these types of securities issued by other European banks has not plummeted. This suggests investors are ignoring their perils.\u201cThe root of the problem is the nonperforming loans on the books of European banks,\u201d said Cliff Noreen, deputy chief investment officer at MassMutual. \u201cWe view the European economy as improving and are actively purchasing European corporate bonds and loans, both investment grade and high yield. But we are very leery of the banking sector.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fyre Was Bad. For the Concert Industry, This One Could Be Worse.", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the collapse of another event, the Pemberton Music Festival in the mountains of Canada, has put the business on edge, with veteran talent agents and promoters warning that it could have wide implications for the booming festival market.Pemberton, planned for July 13 to 16 with acts including Chance the Rapper, Muse and A Tribe Called Quest, was abruptly canceled on May 18, when the two companies behind it declared bankruptcy. In a break from standard practice, ticket holders were not offered refunds, but were instead told that they could \u201cfile a proof of claim form as an unsecured creditor.\u201dMusic executives are now aghast over the failure to provide refunds and the maneuvering of investors in the weeks before the festival fell apart. Marc Geiger, the head of music at William Morris Endeavor and an outspoken voice in the business, called Pemberton\u2019s collapse \u201ca fraud and a scam\u201d that could have a domino effect on the industry, hurting smaller promoters the most.\u201cThis could be the symbolic end for independently promoted festivals,\u201d he said.Pemberton, held in a picturesque spot about 100 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia, was a typical entry into the frothy festival business. It was revived in 2014 by Huka Entertainment, a well-known independent promoter, after an earlier iteration failed. According to bankruptcy filings, the festival lost money for three years, and sold 18,000 tickets in 2017, down from 38,000 last year.But the collapse of both Fyre and Pemberton has once again focused the industry\u2019s attention on what has become a perennial question: Has the ever-expanding festival market hit its peak? High-profile failures like Pemberton and Fyre \u2014 which is now facing numerous lawsuits from ticket buyers and others \u2014 could erode consumer confidence, Mr. Geiger said.Then there is simply natural competition, as more festivals are added to the calendar.World-famous events like Coachella began as risky endeavors undertaken by small promoters. If the credit markets for festivals grow too tight, there may be no room for such innovation, said Sam Hunt, an agent with Paradigm Talent Agency whose artists Major Lazer and Run the Jewels had both been booked for Pemberton.\u201cThis industry thrives on a variety of creative individuals doing things in new and creative ways,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cIf they become more constrained, everybody loses.\u201dIn filings, the two entities that controlled the festival \u2014 Pemberton Music Festival Limited Partnership and 1115666 B.C. Ltd. \u2014 declared $5 million in assets and $12.5 million in liabilities, with ticket holders listed as having an unsecured claim of $6 million. The first meeting of creditors is scheduled for June 6 in Vancouver.Further muddying the Pemberton situation are questions of control, with Mr. Geiger and others accusing the organizers of swapping shell companies for the investors\u2019 benefit. In April, the investors created 1115666 B.C. and made it general partner of Pemberton Music Festival Limited Partnership, which controlled the festival.William E. J. Skelly, a lawyer for the investors, said in an email that the new company was created to give the directors \u201cgreater management control and transparency\u201d over the event\u2019s finances.Less than a month later, the investors resigned as directors of the newly formed company and, the very next day, declared both companies bankrupt.\u201cThe fact that somebody decided to stick it to the consumer, not deliver any product, and say they are protected by bankruptcy, is hideous,\u201d Mr. Geiger said.Funds from ticket sales are often held by ticketing companies in case an event is canceled, but smaller promoters may depend on advances to pay expenses. Pemberton\u2019s ticketing company, Ticketfly, paid the festival operators each week, Mr. Skelly said. Ticketfly declined to comment.Mr. Geiger likened this process to the easy availability of credit before the housing crisis, and said the fallout from Pemberton meant that the financing arrangements behind festivals will most likely be tightened. Ticketing companies will be reluctant to pay advances, and artists will demand more money upfront, he said. If that happens, the only companies that could meet the multimillion-dollar capital requirements to stage a large event would be corporate players like Live Nation and AEG.\u201cIt may be an advantage for the bigger guys,\u201d said Peter Shapiro, an independent promoter behind Brooklyn Bowl and the Lockn\u2019 festival in Virginia. \u201cBut for the new guys starting out, it\u2019s going to be a much more difficult environment.\u201dSome longtime players in the concert industry see these developments as a consequence of the growing corporatization of the business. That process began in the 1990s and has gone through another wave lately, with small promoters bought out by Live Nation and AEG. In this landscape, independents are finding it harder and harder to compete.\u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing now is a result of what\u2019s been going on now for more than 10 years with the consolidation of the music industry,\u201d said John Scher, a veteran promoter in New York and New Jersey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Plans to Shift Infrastructure Funding to Cities, States and Business", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump will lay out a vision this coming week for sharply curtailing the federal government\u2019s funding of the nation\u2019s infrastructure and calling upon states, cities and corporations to shoulder most of the cost of rebuilding roads, bridges, railways and waterways.He will also endorse a plan to privatize and modernize the nation\u2019s air-traffic control system. That plan, which is to be introduced on Monday at the White House and the subject of a major speech in the Midwest two days later, will be Mr. Trump\u2019s first concrete explanation of how he intends to fulfill a campaign promise to lead $1 trillion in United States infrastructure projects. The goal is to create millions of jobs while doing much-needed reconstruction and updating. But the actual details of the initiative are unsettled, and a more intricate blueprint is still weeks or even months from completion.What the president will offer instead over the coming days, his advisers said, are the contours of a plan. The federal government would make only a fractional down payment on rebuilding the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure. Mr. Trump would rely on a combination of private industry, state and city tax money, and borrowed cash to finance the rest. It would be a stark departure from ambitious infrastructure programs of the past, in which the government played a major role and devoted substantial resources to paying the cost of large-scale projects.\u201cWe like the template of not using taxpayer dollars to give taxpayers wins,\u201d said Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council and an architect of the infrastructure plan, in an interview Friday in his West Wing office.His language evoked the corridors of Wall Street, where he previously worked. \u201cWe want to be in the partnership business,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cWe want to be in the facilitation business, and we\u2019re willing to provide capital wherever necessary to help certain infrastructure along.\u201dAs a model for the approach, Mr. Trump plans on Monday to send a proposal to Congress for overhauling the nation\u2019s air-traffic control system. He would spin it off into a private, nonprofit corporation that would use digital satellite-based tracking systems, rather than land-based radar, to guide flights in the United States. There would be no cost to the government, Mr. Cohn said, because a newly formed corporation would finance the entire enterprise, using loans to handle the initial costs of equipment and other needs.On Wednesday, Mr. Cohn said, the president will travel to the banks of the Ohio River to deliver a speech about overhauling the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including the inland waterways that are in dire need of attention.Mr. Trump is \u201ctrying to figure out, How do I get the most infrastructure improvements for the American citizens in the quickest fashion I can with the best return on investment for the U.S. taxpayers,\u201d said Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a businessman\u2019s model.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Trump will hold listening sessions at the White House with a group of mayors and governors. On Friday, he plans to cap off what members of the administration are calling \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d with a visit to the Transportation Department, where he will discuss drastically reducing the time it takes to obtain federal permits for projects.The Trump administration clearly hopes the infrastructure rollout will provide a sorely needed policy victory. Its first attempt to overhaul the Affordable Care Act was so unpopular, even among Republicans, that House Speaker Paul Ryan called off a planned vote and began a rewrite. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said he was uncertain whether he could find a majority to move a health care bill through his chamber.The president\u2019s principles for a \u201cmassive\u201d tax cut, encapsulated in what appeared to be a hastily written one-page document issued in April, were widely ridiculed for a lack of specifics and their underlying economic-growth assumptions, which many economists and policy experts considered overly rosy. And Mr. Trump has been roundly chastised for his recent decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, a multinational plan to limit global warming through curbs on emissions that Mr. Cohn and many prominent corporate executives supported.Despite the public push to promote the infrastructure package, Mr. Cohn acknowledged that the White House did not have a detailed proposal ready to release. He said, for example, that no decision had been made on whether the infrastructure plan would ultimately be married to a tax measure. Republicans and Democrats tried such a step during the Obama administration, in a plan that would have used revenue from repatriating corporate profits parked overseas to finance projects to improve roads, bridges, waterways, broadband and other areas.\u201cIt\u2019s undetermined yet,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cIt may come before. It may come during. It may come after.\u201dMr. Trump said in an interview with CBS News in April that his infrastructure bill was \u201clargely completed, and we\u2019ll be filing over the next two or three weeks, maybe sooner.\u201dMr. Cohn blamed the delay on lawmakers, saying the White House was reluctant to send its proposal to Congress until progress had been made on the health care bill, a budget bill, legislation to raise the debt ceiling and the as-yet-unformed tax bill.\u201cIf we thought it was the time to release an infrastructure bill, we would release an infrastructure bill,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t keep throwing stuff on Congress. We actually need them to get legislation done. And as they start getting legislation done, we\u2019ll come back with infrastructure.\u201dWhen that happens, the package is likely to meet with substantial criticism from Democrats, who were heartened to hear Mr. Trump focus on infrastructure spending during his presidential campaign but crestfallen to see the budget he unveiled last month. The proposed spending plan devoted only one-fifth of the money that he had spoken of for building and improving infrastructure.\u201cWhen Trump talked during the campaign about $1 trillion for infrastructure, people were taking him at his word that it would be $1 trillion,\u201d said Sarah Feinberg, a former senior official at the Transportation Department in the Obama administration. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal to spend $200 billion in the next 10 years falls far short of what is needed, she said.\u201cThe idea that this really minimal amount of federal investment will spur that level of private investment is hopeful but not realistic,\u201d Ms. Feinberg said. \u201cThe reality is, the state of infrastructure has become an existential threat to huge portions of the economy.\u201dFor now, Mr. Trump is focused on popular ideas that have been discussed by members of both parties for years. At the Transportation Department on Friday, he will pitch what Mr. Cohn called his \u201c10-to-two plan,\u201d an effort to cut permitting requirements so the process takes only two years instead of a decade. The current sluggish pace has prompted frequent complaints from construction and financing companies, who say the excessive bureaucracy that surrounds major infrastructure projects can be a costly and sometimes insurmountable hurdle.Mr. Trump\u2019s air-traffic control privatization plan is based on a bill sponsored by Representative Bill Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. It has drawn criticism from Representative Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the panel, who has said it would cater to large airlines at the expense of smaller operators.Jonathan Root, a senior credit officer for the ratings agency Moody\u2019s, said privatizing air-traffic control could be a welcome change. \u201cThe expectation is that a private organization will complete the modernization much quicker than if it remains with the F.A.A.,\u201d he said.Although many of the details of the privatized air-traffic control system are far into the future, administration officials said they did not anticipate higher airline-user fees or increases in ticket prices.In a statement, Thom Metzger, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, expressed cautious optimism about the air-traffic control reforms, which have been widely telegraphed in Mr. Trump\u2019s public comments and at White House gatherings. \u201cNatca considers the status quo to be unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Metzger stated, adding that the group shares \u201cthe administration\u2019s commitments to infrastructure modernization.\u201d It supports the notion of privatizing air-traffic control, he said, but only in a nonprofit entity.An earlier version of this article identified incorrectly those who said they did not think a privatized air traffic control system would result in higher fees and ticket prices. Administration officials took that position, but Jonathan Root of Moody\u2019s did not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What if Your Environmentally Correct Shoes Were Also Cute?", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThey\u2019re Rothy\u2019s,\u201d she enthusiastically told the women, peeling the shoes off her feet and encouraging the women to try them on.Before the plane had taken off, the two women had ordered their own pairs online.The two men behind Rothy\u2019s, Roth Martin and Stephen Hawthornthwaite, are not typical designers, and they don\u2019t aim to be. Five years ago, Mr. Martin, a former director at Hedge Gallery, a midcentury design gallery in San Francisco, and Mr. Hawthornthwaite, who had worked in finance for more than 20 years, teamed up, motivated by the desire to build something together.Having watched their wives fret over finding the perfect \u201cout for the day\u201d footwear, the men decided \u2014 and why not? \u2014 to pursue shoe design. More innovative, technological entrepreneurs than fashion designers, they spent four years trying to create a shoe that would be comfortable and stylish, but also environmentally friendly.\u201cNo one takes four years to develop a shoe,\u201d Mr. Martin said, laughing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we were doing, but it was also completely unchartered territory.\u201dIt was four years of trial and error in design and manufacturing \u2014 they tried, but failed, to find a way to manufacture the shoes in the United States \u2014 but by last summer, the start-up was in business, with the shoes being made in China.Rothy\u2019s process is novel. Plastic water bottles are sourced from recycling centers, hot-washed and sterilized, then chipped into flakes and extruded into little pellets. The pellets are heated, then drawn into soft filaments of plastic. The shoes are then knitted by a computer program that has different settings for pattern, color, design and size.Nike uses a somewhat similar method to make its Flyknit line, which was introduced in 2012. But unlike Flyknit, and other recycled-material athletic shoes, which are made in two dimensions, Rothy\u2019s are knit in three dimensions and come out of the 3-D knitting machine seamless \u2014 the whole process takes six minutes \u2014 using almost the precise amount of material required. There is no cutting, which is the most wasteful part of normal footwear manufacturing.\u201cWe have virtually no waste,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cAnd as adhesives get greener or as waterless dyeing comes to fruition and is commercially viable, we can add it to our program.\u201dFor now the shoes, which feel like fabric, not plastic, come in just two designs: pointy-toe, called the Point ($145), and round-toe, called the Flat ($125). Because they\u2019re knitted, they breathe like mesh. They are also machine washable and take about 40 minutes to air-dry.Alexandra Legrain, who lives in Barcelona, Spain, heard about Rothy\u2019s from her sister in California. Eager to support brands that are environmentally responsible, she bought two pairs of Rothy\u2019s in the past three months.\u201cThey are just so comfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are the shoes you could wear at home, but you can wear them out to dinner and they complement an outfit.\u201d\u201cWomen are the arbiters of popular culture, so we pay a lot of attention to the kind of the opportunities we see in which women are talking about how great a product is,\u201d Mr. Liew said. In May, Rothy\u2019s secured a $7 million Series A round of financing from Lightspeed. Other investors including Finn Capital Partners, M13 and Grace Beauty Capital invested about $2 million combined through a convertible note before the Series A funding.Mr. Liew, who is best known as Snapchat\u2019s first investor, thinks Rothy\u2019s has the potential to be as successful as iconic labels like Vans, Toms and Uggs.\u201cThey really go beyond being a shoe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get into the mainstream of recognition rather than just being something people know about as a shoe.\u201dMr. Liew\u2019s biggest concern is that with a wait list for styles like the black pointy-toe flat as high as 20,000, keeping up with demand may be difficult.\u201cIt\u2019s a high-quality problem to have, but it\u2019s still a problem,\u201d he said, adding that he is confident Rothy\u2019s will find a solution. \u201cThey spent years creating these shoes and have already demonstrated that they\u2019ll work through any problems.\u201dRothy\u2019s are recyclable too. The \u201cfabric\u201d portions are turned into carpet tiles, the rubber soles into yoga and gym mats.Advertisement"}

They relocated from Boston, where they were married three years ago, to a rental in the West Village.Their one-bedroom was charming and expensive \u2014 $3,450 a month \u2014 with little light and a location too near the subway. \u201cYou would feel this soft quake passing by,\u201d said Mr. Rauchwerger, 29.Mr. Dvir, 34, was renting out an apartment he owned in Tel Aviv. In 10 years, its value had tripled. He sold it, planning to use the proceeds to buy a co-op in New York.Last summer, the couple went on the hunt for a one-bedroom costing $700,000 to $900,000. It needed to be within walking distance of the OMA office in SoHo. \u201cThe feeling that you don\u2019t need to rely on any transportation is freeing,\u201d Mr. Rauchwerger said.So they stuck to nearby neighborhoods, seeking a small, prewar building and a sunny apartment, preferably shabby enough to beg for renovation. Their ideal layout had the bedroom far from the living room. They sometimes have \u201cweird scheduling conflicts that would let one of us be asleep and one of us be awake,\u201d Mr. Dvir said.Early on, they saw a one-bedroom on lower Fifth Avenue for $745,000. Monthly maintenance was $925. It was relatively small, with \u201ca very uneventful view\u201d of back windows, Mr. Rauchwerger said.Still, the men were encouraged. \u201cIf this is what we can find on Fifth Avenue, we can find something better or something else,\u201d Mr. Dvir said. That one later sold for the asking price.At one viewing, they met Shai Bernstein, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman, also from Israel. \u201cThis whole thing was so stressful, it was so wonderful to have someone speak your native tongue,\u201d Mr. Dvir said.They looked at a 10-unit walk-up building on a tree-lined Chelsea street. A one-bedroom floor-through, offered through an estate sale, had exposures to the north and south. The asking price was $765,000, with maintenance of around $1,100. The apartment had a newly redone kitchen and bathroom. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very impressive,\u201d Mr. Rauchwerger said. \u201cThe apartment felt like it could be something much better than what it was.\u201d The prospect of a renovation excited them. They offered $785,000.Four offers were received, Mr. Bernstein said, and a different one was accepted. The men were disappointed, but \u201cwe are both very pragmatic people and knew sometimes it is hit or miss,\u201d Mr. Dvir said.Now, though, they knew just what they wanted. \u201cWe got kind of fixated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe kept wishing there was another one like that one, because we liked it so much.\u201dThey later saw a one-bedroom in a doorman building on Fourth Avenue for $875,000. Maintenance was $1,300. It included a loft space with a spiral staircase. Their offer of $915,000 was accepted.But the living room was comparatively uninspiring, while the bedroom had big, beautiful windows and an open view that \u201cyou will never really see because you want to close your blinds when you go to sleep,\u201d Mr. Rauchwerger said.And it was impossible to stand up in what they called the mezzanine level.After sketching their renovation plans, they decided against it and backed out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to commit to such an expensive renovation,\u201d Mr. Dvir said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to become slaves to the mortgage or the renovation costs.\u201d That one later sold for $907,000.Then, to their surprise, they heard from Mr. Bernstein that the contract on the floor-through hadn\u2019t worked out because of financing issues.They didn\u2019t bother revisiting the apartment. This time, Mr. Bernstein suggested that they offer the asking price, $765,000. The executor of the estate agreed, and that was that. They closed in the winter. Then they gutted the place, selling the appliances and fixtures on Craigslist for cheap.They moved in a month ago, still amid some dust and mess. \u201cWe were on edge quite a lot,\u201d Mr. Rauchwerger said. \u201cWhen you come back to a construction site from a long day at work, that is really difficult.\u201dBut every inch is customized to their taste, including a motorized screen and projector instead of a television, and narrow appliances that fit perfectly.\u201cIt was a lot of new challenges for us because of the small scale,\u201d Mr. Dvir said. \u201cI design towers but don\u2019t design kitchens. It was a learning curve for us.\u201dBecause of editing errors, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the couple and misstated the given name of one of them.

{"Headline": "Editorial Contest Winner | \u2018The Anguish of the Rich\u2019", "Date": "2017-06-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContestsBelow, an essay by Yiqi Wang, age 17._______The Anguish of the RichChina has experienced unprecedented economic growth in the past 30 years. A widely accepted positive correlation between happiness and wealth predicts that this growth should lead to higher life satisfaction, especially among the upper classes. Contrary to traditional understandings that equate increasing economic prosperity with increases in a nation\u2019s overall happiness, however, a recent paper on the paradox of Chinese progress draws an unusual conclusion:In recent decades in China, life satisfaction declined dramatically at precisely the time of its unprecedented economic growth. More educated respondents, those in urban areas, and those with insufficient rest and leisure, are much less satisfied with their lives than the average.The unhappiness of China\u2019s growing middle class illustrates the futility of equating material success with happiness. Long working hours and high workplace stress are usually the prerequisites for ascension to higher socio-economic status. Exposure to ever-higher standards for success triggers a persistent feeling of extreme pressure to succeed, and this phenomenon is especially conspicuous among the educated. Many find that their higher aspirations are combined with an increasing lack of security in the turbulent modern economy. A vicious cycle is formed, and those trapped within it begin experiencing feelings of anxiety and depression. An increase in the incidence of mental illness is a long-term manifestation of this phenomenon: China\u2019s psychiatric hospital admissions have increased by 183.21 percent from 2002 to 2012.Karma Ura, president of The Centre for Bhutan Studies and GNH (Gross National Happiness) Research, has introduced a formula to gauge a nation\u2019s wealth according to the following criteria: access to a \u201cravishing environment,\u201d \u201cvibrant health,\u201d \u201cstrong communal relationships\u201d as well as \u201cmeaning in life and freedom to free time.\u201d If this formula is used as the benchmark for success, China\u2019s economic development has clearly been achieved at the price of many people\u2019s happiness.In order to boost productivity, Deng Xiaoping converted the institutions of the highly-centralized planned economy to market institutions. This shift engendered a period of economic growth. While bringing economic prosperity to many, these largely-successful reforms also led to unchecked exploitation of land and natural resources, soaring average work intensity, rising income inequality and loss of communal beliefs. The legacy of reform includes severe environmental problems, a breakdown of social safety nets, and a conviction among the middle class that materialistic pleasure equals spiritual happiness. All these elements combined to create a sense of unhappiness among the bourgeoisie.It is time that Chinese society prioritized mental health over economic success. The government should encourage this change by introducing GNH as a complement to GDP, placing more emphasis on improving people\u2019s well-being and enacting policies that encourage a healthy work-life balance and a fair and secure environment for all.Works CitedGraham, Carol Shaojie Zhou, and Junyi Zhang. \u201cHappiness and Health in China: The Paradox of Progress.\u201d Brookings Global Working Papers.

{"Headline": "Where Trump Zigs, Tillerson Zags, Putting Him at Odds With White House", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a remarkable series of hearings this month, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, declared Mr. Tillerson\u2019s proposal for a 30 percent cut in the department\u2019s budget a \u201cwaste of time\u201d that he would not even review, and he expressed disbelief that the reorganization plan for the department would not be ready until the end of the year, at the earliest.In fact, Mr. Tillerson\u2019s determination to rationalize the State Department structure, which many applaud, and his refusal to appoint under secretaries and assistant secretaries until he has it all figured out have created policy gridlock. Three foreign ambassadors \u2014 one from Asia and two from Europe \u2014 said they had taken to contacting the National Security Council because the State Department does not return their calls or does not offer substantive answers when it does.Mr. Tillerson, for example, recently shut down the office of the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2014 whose role had been diminished since Richard Holbrooke had the job during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term \u2014 and has yet to appoint an assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, at a time when the Taliban\u2019s return and Pakistan\u2019s instability are major concerns.When he attended a series of recent meetings on Afghanistan, Mr. Tillerson was accompanied by only his chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin, who is a former United States Patent and Trademark official and technology executive with no diplomatic experience.There is also no one in line for the Asia policy job, just when there is talk about whether the North Korea crisis will be defused by negotiation or steam toward conflict.Through it all, Mr. Tillerson, a Texas native and an engineer by training, has remained publicly stoic, proceeding at his own pace, though colleagues from his Exxon days say they have seen little evidence he is finding much joy in the job.Running one of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas companies, Mr. Tillerson had complete authority. At the State Department, he finds himself negotiating with other power centers \u2014 from a White House with conflicting factions and priorities to the Defense Department \u2014 and managing a bureaucracy that largely cringes at the president\u2019s approach to the world. Some senior diplomats have resigned over the administration\u2019s policies, and many have signed letters of protest.Accustomed as he is to having the final word, it was clearly jarring for Mr. Tillerson, during a recent trip to Australia and New Zealand, to be out of sync with Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets on the Qatar crisis. \u201cI\u2019m not involved in how the president constructs his tweets, when he tweets, why he tweets, what he tweets,\u201d the secretary said.In dealing with the Saudi leadership, which Mr. Tillerson knows well, Mr. Kushner argued for cultivating Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 31-year-old son of King Salman, who was emerging as a rival to the crown prince at the time, Mohammed bin Nayef.The rift widened when Mr. Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, argued for backing Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other countries that had imposed an embargo on Qatar, ostensibly to punish it for financing the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremist groups. Mr. Tillerson, who had relationships in Qatar dating from his time as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, argued for the United States to take a neutral position in the dispute in order to keep the Gulf Cooperation Council, a loose association of mostly Sunni Arab nations, together.But the secretary\u2019s efforts to play peacemaker were undercut by Mr. Trump\u2019s statement. When the administration pressed Saudi Arabia and Egypt to draw up a list of demands for Qatar, a senior official said, Mr. Tillerson asked Qatar to do the same. Officials at the White House were nonplused.Mr. Tillerson does have his supporters, such as James Jay Carafano, a vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. \u201cFrankly, the biggest criticisms really amount to he works for Trump and he doesn\u2019t act like Kerry or Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like pandering to the media, and he is perplexed by Trump\u2019s tweeting. That\u2019s pretty vapid stuff.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk first about my view of how you translate \u2018America First\u2019 into our foreign policy,\u201d he said, and then went on to describe an era in which American economic and security interests would be paramount.To many in the department, Mr. Tillerson\u2019s speech was notable for what it did not include. Over the previous five presidencies, questions of how to use American influence to advance the rights of minorities around the world, to negotiate a new arms control deal or to set norms of behavior for nations that attack each other with cyberweapons had become the focus of American diplomacy. Not anymore.And when Mr. Tillerson spoke of human rights, it was to caution that while the United States always treasures \u201cfreedom, human dignity, the way people are treated,\u201d those values would often not be reflected in policies. Values, he warned, cannot be allowed to \u201ccreate obstacles to our ability to advance our national security interests, our economic interests.\u201dWhen asked to specifically condemn such targeted attacks in Russia, he said, \u201cThat is our position globally.\u201d And when pressed further, he snapped, \u201cLast time I checked, Russia is part of the globe.\u201dTo many State Department employees, Mr. Tillerson is something of a phantom who says little in staff meetings, rarely leaves his seventh-floor office \u2014 where he is surrounded by Ms. Peterlin and a small group of protective aides \u2014 and does not solicit their views.Since he became secretary, the torrent of words that once flowed from the State Department in daily briefings, speeches and statements \u2014 helping to refine and set policy in embassies around the world \u2014 has slowed to a trickle. Mr. Tillerson has rarely held \u201cbackground\u201d briefings with reporters to explain his positions.His reticence has become so well known that even the president gently ribbed him about it when the two were in Saudi Arabia, volunteering the secretary to conduct a briefing where no American reporters were present.Mr. Tillerson\u2019s aides say his approach is as refreshing as the new d\u00e9cor in the State Department\u2019s seventh-floor offices, where the art and colors of the American West now hang, rather than paintings of long-dead diplomats.\u201cHe thinks like a cowboy,\u201d Mr. Tillerson\u2019s strategic adviser, R. C. Hammond, said recently. Likening words to ammunition, Mr. Hammond added, \u201cYou carry a revolver with only six shots, and you don\u2019t waste your bullets.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Giving Away Your Billion", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI suppose I arrived at my charitable commitment largely through guilt,\u201d writes George B. Kaiser, an oil and finance guy from Oklahoma, who is purported to be worth about $8 billion. \u201cI recognized early on that my good fortune was not due to superior personal character or initiative so much as it was to dumb luck. I was blessed to be born in an advanced society with caring parents. So, I had the advantage of both genetics \u2026 and upbringing.\u201dKaiser decided he was \u201cmorally bound to help those left behind by the accident of birth.\u201d But he understood the complexities: \u201cThough almost all of us grew up believing in the concept of equal opportunity, most of us simultaneously carried the unspoken and inconsistent \u2018dirty little secret\u2019 that genetics drove much of accomplishment so that equality was not achievable.\u201dHis reading of modern brain research, however, led to the conclusion that genetic endowments can be modified by education, if you can get to kids early. Kaiser has directed much of his giving to early childhood education.Most of the letter writers started poor or middle class. They don\u2019t believe in family dynasties and sometimes argue that they would ruin their kids\u2019 lives if they left them a mountain of money. Schools and universities are the most common recipients of their generosity, followed by medical research and Jewish cultural institutions. A ridiculously disproportionate percentage of the Giving Pledge philanthropists are Jewish.Older letter writers have often found very specific niches for their giving \u2014 fighting childhood obesity in Georgia. Younger givers, especially the tech billionaires, are vague and less thoughtful.A few letters burn with special fervor. These people generally try to solve a problem that touched them directly. Dan Gilbert, who founded Quicken Loans, had a son born with neurofibromatosis, a genetic condition that affects the brain. Gordon Gund went fully blind in 1970. Over the ensuing 43 years, he and his wife helped raise more than $600 million for blindness research.The letters set off my own fantasies. What would I do if I had a billion bucks to use for good? I\u2019d start with the premise that the most important task before us is to reweave the social fabric. People in disorganized neighborhoods need to grow up enmeshed in the loving relationships that will help them rise. The elites need to be reintegrated with their own countrymen.Only loving relationships transform lives, and such relationships can be formed only in small groups. Thus, I\u2019d use my imaginary billion to seed 25-person collectives around the country.A collective would be a group of people who met once a week to share and discuss life. Members of these chosen families would go on retreats and celebrate life events together. There would be \u201cclearness committees\u201d for members facing key decisions.The collectives would be set up for people at three life stages. First, poor kids between 16 and 22. They\u2019d meet in the homes of adult hosts and help one another navigate the transition from high school to college.Second, young adults across classes between 23 and 26. This is a vastly under-institutionalized time of life when many people suffer a Telos Crisis. They don\u2019t know why they are here and what they are called to do. The idea would be to bring people across social lines together with hosts and mentors, so that they could find a purpose and a path.Third, successful people between 36 and 40. We need a better establishment in this country. These collectives would identify the rising stars in local and national life, and would help build intimate bonds across parties and groups, creating a baseline of sympathy and understanding these people could carry as they rose to power.The collectives would hit the four pressure points required for personal transformation:Heart: By nurturing deep friendships, they would give people the secure emotional connections they need to make daring explorations.Hands: Members would get in the habit of performing small tasks of service and self-control for one another, thus engraving the habits of citizenship and good character.Head: Each collective would have a curriculum, a set of biographical and reflective readings, to help members come up with their own life philosophies, to help them master the intellectual virtues required for public debate.Soul: In a busy world, members would discuss fundamental issues of life\u2019s purpose, so that they might possess the spiritual true north that orients a life.The insular elites already have collectives like this in the form of Skull and Bones and such organizations. My billion would support collectives across society, supporting the homes and retreats where these communities would happen, offering small slush funds they could use for members in crisis.Now all I need is a hedge fund to get started.Advertisement"}

Now the hard part begins.Pennsylvania Station in New York will soon become even more intolerable than commuters thought was possible when aging tracks are closed for repairs and the number of trains serving the nation\u2019s busiest station is significantly reduced.The hundreds of thousands of commuters who rely on the station are poring over scrambled schedules. They are searching for information about alternate routes into Manhattan by ferry, subway and bus. They are having tough conversations with bosses about missing work.Their employers likewise are trying to devise coping strategies. Some are considering flexible hours. Others are deciding who could work from home or a satellite office outside Manhattan.\u201cI think we have to react a little bit like the crisis mentality after Hurricane Sandy,\u201d said Scott Rechler, chief executive of RXR Realty, which has offices in Midtown Manhattan and in Uniondale on Long Island. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a need for some behavioral adjustment to reduce the demand at peak hours.\u201dOfficials at the three railroads that share Penn Station \u2014 Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road \u2014 have pledged to limit the pain. But commuters who have watched service deteriorate in recent months are justifiably skeptical that things will go even remotely smoothly when the eight weeks of upheaval start on July 10.Many veteran commuters are hoping to avoid Penn Station altogether. In search of a Plan B, they will brave traffic-clogged roadways to drive to New York City. They will rearrange their schedules to work from home or use vacation time during July and August. Or they will hope for the best when their trains detour to Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey or Jamaica Station in Queens.Marissa Espinoza, a consultant who lives in Lindenhurst on Long Island said she would try to work from her company\u2019s office on Long Island and drive to Manhattan when she had to, handing over at least $60 to park in a garage to avoid being stuck on a train.\u201cThis is really making me rethink my plans for the summer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do as many meetings as possible by videoconference.\u201dBeatrice Body Miller plans to set her alarm for 4 a.m. and drive to a nearby New Jersey Transit station to catch a 5:43 a.m. train on the Morris and Essex line to Penn Station before that line starts diverting to Hoboken.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the world at that hour,\u201d said Ms. Body Miller, who lives in Flanders, N.J. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough.\u201dOnly a few early-morning trains on the Morris and Essex Line \u2014 those that finish their runs by 7 a.m. \u2014 will still go to Penn Station. Anticipating that some commuters, like Ms. Body Miller, will sacrifice sleep to avoid having to transfer to the PATH train or a ferry at Hoboken, New Jersey Transit turned the last direct train to Manhattan into two.The first \u2014 train 6696 \u2014 will stop at stations at the west end of the line, then run as an express to Penn Station. The second \u2014 train 6306 \u2014 will stop at stations skipped by the first. Combined, the trains will contain 19 double-decker cars that can hold about 2,600 passengers.Jennifer Polishook, who lives on the line in South Orange, N.J., said she would work from home three days a week and try the ferry from Hoboken to West 39th Street in Manhattan. But she said she was not sure how well the ferry would run or how she would get to her office in Chelsea once she got off.\u201cThe best way to get to work is unknown at this moment,\u201d she said.Ms. Polishook worries that she and her husband will lose valuable time with their two young children this summer. She will miss swim meets, she said, and will lean on friends to help with child care when she is delayed.\u201cNow my entire summer becomes an emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to get home.\"\u201cOne of the lessons that we\u2019re all learning from what\u2019s going on this summer is that we need to have multiple options for commutation,\u201d Mr. Pinsky said. \u201cWe have infrastructure that requires significant investment, and as a result of that there are going to be periods of time when Method A may be more challenging and people should have the option of going to Method B.\u201dMr. Rechler said RXR was contemplating which employees could work from its Long Island offices instead of Manhattan. He said the company, which owns office buildings around the city, was also considering offering temporary space in its suburban buildings so that its tenants in Manhattan could spare some workers the commute.Gib Chapman wants to take his commute from Long Island into his own hands. He recently texted a friend who owns a boat asking how much it would cost to take it into Manhattan each day with a group of friends.Mr. Chapman, who lives in Oyster Bay and works in finance, said his office was also discussing whether people might work from home. He usually takes a train to the Hunterspoint Station in Queens and transfers to the subway, but he fears the trip will be a \u201chorror show\u201d during the track repairs, with more people transferring to an already overburdened subway.\u201cIt\u2019s full enough that if you have 25 percent more people going from Hunterspoint, it\u2019s going to be a real issue,\u201d he said.Riten Jaiswal has the same concern about crowds at the Hunterspoint station, especially since he fractured his ankle and walks with a limp.\u201cI feel that I could be trampled or even shoved down the staircase because I\u2019m going too slow,\u201d said Mr. Jaiswal, who lives in Little Neck and works in information technology.Instead of braving crowds on the railroad, Mr. Jaiswal said he planned to drive to Manhattan during the repairs \u2014 a trip that could take more than two hours each way. The gridlock on the roads could be a horror of a different kind, and garages are looking to capitalize on the mayhem. A sign outside Penn Station on a recent morning targeted desperate commuters with discount parking rates.Michael Lowinger, a Long Island commuter who lives in Seaford, had planned to use his vacation days earlier in the summer, but rescheduled his time off so that he would have two weeks of vacation starting on July 10, right as the track repairs begin.\u201cI\u2019ll be out of the office for those days, so I won\u2019t have to deal with at least the first issues,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, they\u2019ll get things in order.\u201dVeronique Hakim, the interim executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the Long Island Rail Road and the subways, said the agency would be sending letters to employers asking them to consider flexible work hours and locations. But many commuters do not have the option of working remotely.Caroline Barilla works in human resources and has to be in her Manhattan office to have access to the files she needs. If her Long Island Rail Road train is delayed during the repairs, she fears she will lose part of her wage of about $20 an hour, she said.\u201cOne hour is not a huge deal, but when it happens once a week, it adds up,\u201d she said.Ms. Barilla, who lives in Malverne, said it was frustrating to pay about $260 for a monthly pass only to face delay after delay. She hopes the construction work at Penn Station will help solve the constant disruptions.\u201cIf we\u2019re still seeing these delays after the repairs,\u201d she said, \u201cthen I\u2019ll be angry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ossoff Raises $23 Million in Most Expensive House Race in History", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jon Ossoff, the Democrat running in a closely watched special House election in Georgia, raised over $15 million in the last two months, vastly exceeding his Republican rival and shattering fund-raising records, according to federal campaign finance documents filed on Thursday.Karen Handel, the Republican candidate for the suburban Atlanta district seat, raised approximately $4 million in the same period. But she began the final stretch before the June 20 runoff election with slightly more cash available than Mr. Ossoff, who had already spent much of his money to reserve television advertising time.The contest to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, was already the most expensive House race in history. Mr. Ossoff has now raised over $23 million and Ms. Handel, who only became the Republican nominee after the initial balloting in April, has brought in over $4.2 million. In a sign of the intense national interest in the race, much of the money came from outside Georgia.In addition to the candidates\u2019 own fund-raising, the national parties and allied groups have swooped in with millions more. The largest Republican groups have spent about $12 million on behalf of Ms. Handel, while Democrats have just spent over $6.7 million on behalf of Mr. Ossoff in the same period.The biggest spender among the third-party groups has been the Congressional Leadership Fund, a so-called super political action committee aligned with the House Republican leadership, which has poured in more than $6.2 million to attack Mr. Ossoff.The astonishing fund-raising totals illustrate the stakes of a campaign that both parties fear losing.Democrats, who have already fallen short in a couple of special House campaigns this year, are eager to notch a win and sustain the spirits of the grass-roots activists energized by President Trump\u2019s election. The pressure is even more intense on Republicans, who have held the Georgia seat for decades and fear a loss could trigger a wave of retirements by lawmakers reluctant to run in a potentially difficult midterm election.Regardless of who wins, it is the Atlanta TV stations that may come out on top: The city\u2019s NBC affiliate added a 7 p.m. newscast to accommodate all the additional political advertising being broadcast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting, While Funding, Extremists", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialEven sophisticated observers admit to confusion and consternation about the Middle East, where rivalries and jealousies among nations have reached new levels of complication. Saudi Arabia and some of its neighbors decide to punish Qatar and some of its citizens, ostensibly for fostering and financing Islamist terrorism. But Saudi Arabia itself has been accused of underwriting extremists. No matter: President Trump, captivated by Saudi royalty, sides with the Saudis \u2014 even though the United States has two important bases in Qatar.Baffling, right? But here is one clear bottom line: The biggest loser in all this may turn out to be the fight against the Islamic State. Nobody likes ISIS. Yet the idea of a united front among Gulf states against the terrorist group has all but evaporated, and hypocrisies and contradictions abound. Here\u2019s a primer on some of the main players.The Saudis are also annoyed that Qatar talks to Iran, their chief rival, but it\u2019s hardly surprising since the two nations jointly manage a major offshore natural gas reserve.Dependent on the Wahhabi clerics for legitimacy, the royal family has been slow to reform a religion that teaches that nonbelievers and wayward Muslims should be shunned or fought if they reject its strict message. Experts say some Saudi school texts seem to make a virtue of hating others. The Saudis, aided by American intelligence and arms, may also be creating extremists with their brutal war in Yemen.American experts say that whatever Saudi Arabia or Qatar\u2019s failings, Iran\u2019s are worse because its involvement with extremist groups is sponsored by the government. According to State Department reports, Iran finances, trains and arms Hezbollah and other Shiite forces in Syria who have committed human rights abuses in the fight to prop up Syria\u2019s notorious butcher, President Bashar al-Assad; anti-Israeli Hezbollah forces in Lebanon; and Shiite militants in Bahrain. Historically, Iran has also provided weapons, training and funding to Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups.Each of these three main players has a role to play in the larger effort to defeat and defund terrorists. But there needs to be clarity and honesty about the various sources of the problem, and the various contributions each nation can make to the struggle. Exaggerating or misrepresenting the misdeeds of Qatar and Iran, while giving the Saudis a free pass, will only benefit Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts to expand its regional influence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Key Republican Demands Subsidies to Calm Insurance Markets", "Date": "2017-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A powerful House Republican said Thursday that Congress should immediately provide money for subsidy payments to health insurance companies, which have been demanding big rate increases or fleeing from Affordable Care Act markets because of President Trump\u2019s threat to cut off the funds.The Republican, Kevin Brady of Texas, who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, went out of his way to make clear that he now believes that Congress should continue the subsidies, which compensate insurers for reducing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for seven million low-income people.The Trump administration has sent mixed signals on the issue, as the president seeks leverage to win legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That has destabilized insurance markets and jeopardized a health law that Mr. Trump says is collapsing.Mr. Trump has said he can stop the payments \u201canytime I want,\u201d and his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, refers to the subsidies as \u201cObamacare bailout payments.\u201dBut at a budget hearing on Thursday, Mr. Brady said the payments were needed \u201cto help stabilize the insurance market and help lower premiums for Americans trapped in Obamacare.\u201d\u201cWe should act within our constitutional authority now to temporarily and legally fund cost-sharing reduction payments as we move away from Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cInsurers have made clear the lack of certainty is causing 2018 proposed premiums to rise significantly.\u201dThe Republican moves may be a response to political pressure: Democrats say Republicans will be responsible if the government cuts off the cost-sharing payments and premiums then skyrocket or markets collapse in some states.The federal government spends $7 billion a year on the subsidies. The money goes directly to insurers, which are required to provide discounts to low-income people regardless of whether the companies are reimbursed by the government.But Mr. Brady said the payments were needed to help consumers.\u201cObamacare\u2019s design flaws were not the fault of the American people,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cThe people now trapped in Obamacare did what the government mandated them to do \u2014 they complied with the law. They should not be left out to dry.\u201dHouse Republicans filed a lawsuit in 2014 asserting that the Obama administration was paying the subsidies illegally because Congress had never appropriated money for them, and a Federal District Court judge agreed last year. She ordered a halt to the payments, but suspended her order to allow the government to appeal. That appeal is still in progress, though it is unclear how far the Trump administration will take the fight.At separate hearings of the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees on Thursday, Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, got a tongue-lashing from Democrats who said he and Mr. Trump were pursuing policies that could deprive millions of Americans of health care and coverage.Representative Suzan DelBene, Democrat of Washington, said the administration was causing \u201cchaos, confusion and instability in the market.\u201dIn response to similar criticism from senators, Mr. Price said: \u201cNobody is interested in sabotaging the system. Nobody is cheering the challenges that we have in the system.\u201dThe Trump administration cut back efforts to encourage enrollment in health plans under the Affordable Care Act, is loosening enforcement of the requirement for people to have coverage and has refused to say if it will continue paying the subsidies.Democratic senators, including Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, asked Mr. Price why the administration was destabilizing insurance markets.In response, Mr. Price said the markets were deteriorating before Mr. Trump took office. In Michigan, Delaware and many other states, he said, average premiums doubled in the past four years.Mr. Price, a former congressman from Georgia, defended proposals in the president\u2019s budget that would sharply reduce the growth of Medicaid.Even Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, a Republican who once held Mr. Price\u2019s House seat, expressed doubts about the proposed cutbacks. In Georgia, he said, Medicaid helps pay for more than half of all births, and of the 1.9 million people in the state\u2019s Medicaid program, 1.3 million are children.\u201cWe are talking, first and foremost, about children\u201d who could be hurt if the program is cut, he said.Under questioning by Democrats, Mr. Price stood by his statement last month that \u201cthere are no cuts to the Medicaid program\u201d in the House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the bill would reduce projected federal spending on Medicaid by more than $800 billion over 10 years and reduce expected enrollment by 14 million people.Still, Mr. Price said, federal spending on Medicaid would increase from year to year, just not as fast as under current law.Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, told Mr. Price, \u201cYou have been deliberately misleading.\u201dThe secretary said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d disagreed with the budget office report. (As chairman of the House Budget Committee in 2015, Mr. Price helped select the director of the Congressional Budget Office, Keith Hall, who Mr. Price said at the time had a \u201cvast understanding\u201d of economic policy.)Advertisement"}

There is a dentist on the top floor. The boss drives a Honda.Yet the company, Creative Planning, is at the vanguard of a profound shift in finance: the move away from brokers and mutual fund companies peddling products for a fee, and toward firms offering truly independent, low-cost investment advice.These firms, known as registered investment advisers, number about 30,000 and can manage as little as $1 million and as much as $70 billion. They now oversee about $4.5 trillion in assets.That is about $1 trillion more than what hedge funds administer, and with no sign that this growth will diminish anytime soon, independent advisers \u2014 with their vast exposure to \u201csticky\u201d retirement money throughout the country \u2014 have become crucial distribution channels for the biggest names in the industry, including BlackRock, Vanguard, Pimco and Goldman Sachs.As the independent advice industry has grown, Creative Planning has grown faster, with assets exploding to $26.2 billion today from just $34 million in 2004. Peter Mallouk, an estate planning attorney who started the business with an eye toward servicing medical professionals in suburban Kansas City, now oversees a national fleet of wealth advisers in more than 30 states.Although most Creative clients have their funds in broader stock and bond markets accessed largely via passive investment vehicles, the firm\u2019s growth has attracted a who\u2019s who of Wall Street firms, eager to pitch more complex, less liquid investment options.Once a month, Creative\u2019s Honda-driving founder, Mr. Mallouk, and 10 of his top executives gather in a conference room to hear pitches \u2014 in person and over the phone \u2014 from these investment shops.Plain-spoken and dressed casually in polo shirts and chinos, they seem more like high school teachers than seasoned investment professionals.\u201cHow would you explain the benefit of your fund to a 15-year-old?\u201d one team member asked at a recent meeting, after a windy presentation from a big-name investment firm pushing a private-equity-style credit fund.But don\u2019t mistake anyone here for a rube. That investment house would slash its fees and its multimillion-dollar investment minimum to get on Creative\u2019s approved list. That means, higher-net-worth Creative clients would have the opportunity to invest directly in the vehicle, alongside traditional private equity investors like pensions and sovereign wealth funds.Mr. Mallouk, who led the meeting, was fresh off a plane, having just landed a $75 million account.And he was urging his colleagues to be more flexible in allowing sophisticated clients to get maximum exposure to these types of elite, alternative investments.\u201cWe have to be able to do what we do for all clients, which is give them our best advice but give them the power to adjust as they wish,\u201d Mr. Mallouk said. \u201cOtherwise they are going to kick my butt out the door.\u201dAt a time in finance when a firm\u2019s ability to gather assets in large amounts has become the ultimate emblem of sway and success (see fund leaders like Vanguard and BlackRock or the private equity giant Blackstone Group), Creative\u2019s asset growth numbers border on the unfathomable.That is doubly true because the growth has been largely organic. Unlike many other large registered investor advisers, Creative Planning has not expanded via acquisitions, or by luring away teams of brokers from the likes of Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley.Instead, Mr. Mallouk has bet the ranch on a single principle: that as clients become ever more aware that the first priority of large brokerage firms is to direct investors to in-house investments, they will instead choose independent advisers like Creative Planning.\u201cI honestly think that if you are a financial consumer and you are dealing with a brokerage house, you are just out of your mind,\u201d Mr. Mallouk said, his voice rising as it often does when he talks about investors\u2019 right to receive conflict-free advice. \u201cThe problem in American finance is that if you go to a large broker, you are assuming he will act in your best interest \u2014 but by law he does not have to. \u201dWhile it is true that much of Wall Street is moving toward the independent model of charging a flat fee tied to assets, Mr. Mallouk notes that many brokers at the big houses are still paid by commission, which is tied to their ability to sell proprietary investments to clients.\u201cIt\u2019s horrible \u2014 people don\u2019t even know that they are paying someone to sell them something,\u201d Mr. Mallouk said. \u201cHere is the bottom line: Compensation drives behavior.\u201dAt Creative, which has no in-house funds, there is no such temptation and the firm\u2019s advisers are compensated not on what they sell, but on how their client assets grow and are retained.Industry experts say that the fee independent advisers charge clients is, on average, about 1 percent of assets under management. That would include the central function of creating a financial plan for clients and other services as well, including tax, legal and estate planning advice.Since 2005, the market share for independent financial advisers has increased to 23 percent from 13 percent, according to a recent report by Cerulli Associates, a financial research firm. The gains for registered investment advisers have been strongest in recent years, as a combination of steep fees and heightened investor scrutiny since the financial crisis has prompted a small exodus of funds from traditional brokerage houses.Fueling Creative Planning\u2019s own success are two critical developments that have been instrumental in driving the growth of independent advice.One is the increasing popularity of low-cost, passive investing styles, exemplified by the emergence of exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which give independent advisers cheap and easy exposure to every imaginable investment preference.At Creative, for example, planners rarely if ever buy individual securities or traditional mutual funds. Nor do they pay much attention to the daily ups and downs of the market: Mr. Mallouk\u2019s ban on CNBC-spouting televisions is supposed to favor long-term sang-froid over shorter-term panic.Accordingly, a basket of E.T.F.s, Mr. Mallouk believes, keeps his employees \u2014 and clients \u2014 from succumbing to the temptation to try to outsmart the market by taking big risks.Creative Planning is now among the larger individual holders of Vanguard funds. And at BlackRock, Mr. Mallouk and his $26 billion pool of client assets loom large as a crucial distribution channel for the firm\u2019s fleet of iShares E.T.F.s.All of which is heady stuff for Mr. Mallouk, who is 47.With 426 workers workers, Creative is hiring, on average, a new employee every day \u2014 each of whom Mr. Mallouk interviews. The company recently broke ground on new headquarters to house its expanding work force.And about $400 million in new investor funds has been flowing into the firm each month.Still, Mr. Mallouk likes to keep things simple. He has no secretary and he leaves the office most days at 5 p.m. to catch a son\u2019s baseball or basketball game.\u201cWe are building a rocket ship even though the rocket has already taken off,\u201d said Mr. Mallouk, who believes it will not be long before an independent adviser reaches $100 billion in client assets.The son of Egyptian immigrants, Mr. Mallouk grew up not far from where he works today, and he celebrates what he calls Creative\u2019s \u201csolid, not flashy\u201d Kansan sensibility.He runs the firm but still considers himself a customer man, even though he does not play golf and eschews client dinners, industry conferences and other schmooze-driven outings.\u201cYou don\u2019t call up your doctor and say, \u2018Let\u2019s go to dinner,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mallouk said. \u201cI like where I sit \u2014 on the side of the client.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moving to Scuttle Obama Legacy, Donald Trump to Crack Down on Cuba", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Friday will move to halt the historic rapprochement between the United States and Cuba set in motion by former President Barack Obama, delivering a speech in Miami in which he plans to announce he is clamping down on travel and commercial ties with the island nation to force the government of Ra\u00fal Castro to change its repressive ways.Mr. Trump is expected to declare that the two-year-old Obama-era approach of engagement has amounted to a failed policy of appeasement. To that end, he plans to outline stiffer rules for American travelers visiting Cuba and a sweeping prohibition against transactions with companies controlled by the military, which runs vast segments of the hotel and tourism sector, according to White House officials.The changes are likely to affect both countries, making it more difficult and costly for Americans to travel to and do business with Cuba. The island\u2019s population potentially may pay the steeper price, particularly Cubans who derive their livelihoods from tourism and increased business opportunities stemming from the opening.The expected changes will also place a distinct chill on the relationship between the United States and Cuba that was just beginning to thaw after a half-century of isolation and estrangement and thrust the two countries back into an adversarial posture that is among the last vestiges of the Cold War.In making the shift, Mr. Trump is delivering on a politically potent promise he made to the Cuban-American exile community based in Miami, which backed him in last year\u2019s election and was deeply opposed to the d\u00e9tente. The new policy was shaped in large part by Cuban-American Republicans in Congress, including Senator Marco Rubio and Mario Diaz-Balart, both of Florida, and both of whom wanted even stiffer American sanctions on the Castro government.But many business leaders and human rights groups are profoundly opposed to the change. Even members of Mr. Trump\u2019s own administration have privately argued that the move toward normalizing relations between Washington and Havana had yielded national security, diplomatic and economic benefits for the United States that should not be sacrificed.The internal conflict is evident in the new approach, which will be enshrined in a policy directive that Mr. Trump plans to issue on Friday, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid pre-empting the president.Although Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that Mr. Obama made a \u201cbad deal\u201d with Cuba, his shift falls well short of the wholesale reversal that many hard-liners, including Mr. Diaz-Balart, were seeking.Embassies in Washington and Havana that reopened in 2015 for the first time in a half-century will remain open. The Trump administration is not moving to unwind other regulations that have carved out exceptions to the trade embargo, including those allowing direct financing of certain exports and allowing American dollars to be used in transactions with Cuba, the officials said.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s expected changes are substantial.Now, such trips, sometimes known as \u201cpeople-to-people\u201d exchanges, will only be possible as part of a licensed tour group, as was the case before last year. And the Treasury Department, which will be tasked with drafting the new rules, will be directed to strictly enforce the law regarding travel to Cuba, including with routine audits.Mr. Trump is also directing a broad prohibition against Americans doing business with companies controlled by the military, intelligence or security services in Cuba, which control large swaths of the economy, including many foreign-owned hotels, through the military\u2019s business arm known as Grupo de Administraci\u00f3n Empresarial S.A., or Gaesa. However, White House officials said there would be exceptions, including for airports and seaports, meaning that the operation of cruise ships and commercial flights would not be affected.The current policy, officials argued, enriched the Cuban military and empowered a government that has engaged in human rights abuses. Mr. Trump\u2019s directive will call for the State Department to issue a list of blacklisted companies to comply with the prohibition.The Trump administration will lay out conditions that the Cuban government would have to meet before the restrictions could be lifted, including holding free and fair elections, releasing political prisoners and allowing Cuban workers to be paid directly, one White House official said.The impending changes drew sharp criticism from architects of the Obama-era policy.Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security to Mr. Obama who helped broker the opening first announced in 2014, called the clampdown a politically motivated move that would ultimately be self-defeating. He said it would revive an adversarial dynamic between the United States and Cuba that would harm citizens of both countries while allowing the Castro government to once again cast Americans as the root of all its people\u2019s ills.\u201cFor nothing more than a partial rollback, Trump has made us the bad guy again,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said on Thursday. \u201cThey are not going as far as the real hard line, but they are going far enough to cause damage.\u201dBusiness organizations that have been pushing Congress to lift the embargo, to foster potentially lucrative commercial relationships and closer personal and cultural ties between the United States and Cuba, also voiced opposition.\u201cThe idea that after 55 years of failure, going back to isolationist policies will produce any results is insane,\u201d said James Williams, the president of Engage Cuba, a pro-engagement group.Mr. Trump plans to cast his decision on Cuba as a matter of human rights, arguing that the changes will ensure that the United States is not rewarding a government that deprives its citizens of basic rights.\u201cThis is going to have a dampening effect, but so be it,\u201d said Jorge Mas, the president of the Cuban American National Foundation, a Cuban exile group. \u201cThe Cuban government\u2019s behavior has to change, and they will now understand the cost of not changing behavior.\u201dHuman rights groups had implored the administration not to roll back the engagement policy, arguing that while the Castro government\u2019s record continued to be poor, cutting nascent ties with Cuba would only hurt its citizens.\u201cThe Cuban government was able to use the old policy as an excuse for all the problems on the island and as a pretext for repression,\u201d Daniel Wilkinson, the managing director of the Americas division at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s true the repressive system in Cuba has not changed, but the fact that two years of a different policy didn\u2019t change things isn\u2019t a reason to go back to one that was a clear failure for decades.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where the Senate Health Care Bill Fails", "Date": "2017-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSpeaking at a rally for his wife\u2019s presidential campaign last year, Bill Clinton called Obamacare \u201cthe craziest thing in the world.\u201d As he put it, \u201cThe people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\u201dMr. Clinton was right, and it\u2019s why Republicans have been pushing to repair the damage done by Obamacare for so long. Our priority should be to bring relief, and better, less expensive care, to millions of working men and women.Unfortunately, the Senate Republican alternative, unveiled last week, doesn\u2019t appear to come close to addressing their plight. Like Obamacare, it relies too heavily on government spending, and ignores the role that the private sector can and should play.As an accountant with more than 30 years\u2019 experience in manufacturing, I assure you the private sector is much more effective at solving problems. Concepts like the \u201cKISS\u201d principle (\u201ckeep it simple, stupid\u201d), pursuing continuous improvement and root-cause analysis are core ideas in private-sector problem-solving. From what I\u2019ve seen in six years in office, these concepts are foreign to government.The decades-long health care debate is an example. Layer upon layer of laws, rules and regulations have made our health care-financing system a complex mess, separating patients from direct payment for health care.As a result, patients neither know nor care what things cost. We have virtually eliminated the power of consumer-driven, free-market discipline from one-sixth of our economy.The primary goals of any health care reform should be to restrain (if not lower) costs while improving quality, access and innovation. This is exactly what consumer-driven, free-market competition does in other areas of our economy. Look no further than how laser eye surgery went from exotic to affordable during the years it was not covered by most insurance.Washington believes that the solution to every problem is more money. But throwing more money at insurers won\u2019t fix the lack of consumer-driven competition, combined with government mandates that artificially drive up the cost of care and insurance.Obamacare imposes enormous taxes and plans to spend nearly $2 trillion over the next 10 years to decrease the number of uninsured, mostly through Medicaid but also through taxpayer-subsidized exchanges. In doing so, Obamacare has largely destroyed an already struggling individual health insurance marketplace. It does this by mandating high-cost provisions as standard for every insurance policy, then forcing a small percentage of the population to shoulder the cost. These are the people Mr. Clinton was talking about.Prior to Obamacare, the individual market was already challenged by unequal tax treatment, which forced the forgotten to pay for insurance with after-tax dollars. The simple solution would have been to equalize the tax treatment, but President Obama chose to spend trillions and artificially increase premiums unaffordably. The result: Too many of those individuals who are \u201cbusting it\u201d and who responsibly carried insurance can no longer afford it, have dropped coverage, are paying a penalty and are taking a huge risk.Once again, a simple solution is obvious. Loosen up regulations and mandates, so that Americans can choose to purchase insurance that suits their needs and that they can afford.Like many other senators, I had hoped that this was where things were headed during the last several weeks as the Republican bill was discussed. We\u2019re disappointed that the discussion draft turns its back on this simple solution, and goes with something far too familiar: throwing money at the problem.The bill\u2019s defenders will say it repeals Obamacare\u2019s taxes and reduces Medicaid spending growth. That\u2019s true. But it also boosts spending on subsidies, and it leaves in place the pre-existing-condition rules that drive up the cost of insurance for everyone.Instead, we should return more flexibility to states, to give individuals the freedom and choice to buy plans they want without Obamacare\u2019s \u201creforms.\u201d And we should look to improve successful models for protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, models underway prior to Obamacare, such as those in Maine and Wisconsin.Only then can the market begin to rein in the underlying cost of health care itself and reduce the cost of taxpayer subsidies.We are $20 trillion in debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years. A truly moral and compassionate society does not impoverish future generations to bestow benefits in the here and now.Republican leaders have told us the plan unveiled last week is a draft, open to discussion and improvement. I look forward to working with Senate leadership and the president to improve the bill so it addresses the plight of the forgotten men and women by returning freedom and choice to health care.Ron Johnson is a Republican senator from Wisconsin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Maine, a Call for a More Measured Take on Health Care", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGOR, Me. \u2014 Hundreds of miles from the health care debate that will begin again this week in Congress, lobstermen here are out in force, bees are furiously pollinating the state\u2019s famous blueberries and part-time workers are preparing for another summer tourist season.As a result of their short-term spike in income, many of Maine\u2019s working class will likely lose some or all of their health insurance subsidy, a feature of the federal health care law, which has been a complicated blessing for the citizens of Maine.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has spent a lot of time thinking about how to deal with these \u201csubsidy cliffs,\u201d even as her party\u2019s leaders press for the wholesale repeal of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.Ms. Collins\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (she once oversaw Maine\u2019s insurance bureau), her relentless practicality and her state\u2019s particular vulnerability within the health care debate \u2014 its population is old and largely poor, with a sizable part-time work force \u2014 have placed her at the center of an issue that conservatives have tried to dominate in Congress.\u201cThere is no denying that the Affordable Care Act has made insurance available to millions of Americans and allowed people to leave corporate jobs and start businesses,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cWe are disproportionately affected, which is one reason I\u2019ve spent so much energy on this issue.\u201dMs. Collins, omitted from the working group convened by Mr. McConnell, has formed a bipartisan working group that may help build a foundation for future changes should Senate Republicans fail on their own, which seems increasingly likely.It is reminiscent of when Democrats tried desperately to woo Senator Olympia Snowe, who also represented Maine, to their side in the last health care debate. They won her vote for the health bill in the Finance Committee, only to lose it on the Senate floor.\u201cObamacare created a mind-set here that the federal government can be a partner in providing health insurance,\u201d said Lee Umphrey, the chief executive of the Harrington Family Health Center, where 1,500 residents in a rural county east of Bangor have enrolled in health insurance plans since the law was enacted.\u201cSenator Collins has had an open mind, but it\u2019s hard for her with the more conservative pockets here in Maine and her caucus back in Washington,\u201d Mr. Umphrey said.The House bill would roll back state-by-state expansion of Medicaid, and replace income-based government subsidies to buy insurance policies on the act\u2019s marketplaces with tax credits of $2,000 to $4,000 a year, depending on a person\u2019s age. It would also offer states the ability to let insurers charge higher premiums for some people with pre-existing medical conditions.While Maine did not expand its Medicaid program \u2014 something providers here greatly lament \u2014 the new subsidies increased the number of individual policyholders to 80,000 from 30,000 since the law was enacted.Should a bill like the House measure pass, Americans between 50 and 64 will be the most vulnerable to steep rate increases. The impact would be particularly acute in Maine, where the median age is 43, the oldest in the nation.Like many states with high health care costs, Maine is largely rural \u2014 and nearly 22 percent of the state\u2019s workers have part time jobs, well above the national average of 17 percent.But the health care law has allowed self-employed residents and owners of very small businesses to have insurance for the first time in years. \u201cIt\u2019s been good to have it,\u201d said Charles Smith, a lobsterman from Jonesport whose wife and three teenagers were sporadically without insurance for years before the law.Ms. Collins has been a critic of the Affordable Care Act since it was enacted. She has cited the instability in the insurance markets; the increasing costs of premiums, especially in rural northern areas; and the scarcity of health care facilities that accept the plans.\u201cThe uncertainty is extremely problematic,\u201d said Eric A. Cioppa, the superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance, who said carriers could not fix their rates without knowing the fate of those subsidies. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get a subsidy, I fully expect double-digit increases for three carriers on the exchanges here.\u201dMs. Collins also said she would like to see a fix to the \u201cwage cliff,\u201d in which a single dollar increase over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s income threshold can cost a worker the full value of his insurance subsidy. It is a special problem for seasonal workers whose incomes fluctuate throughout the year.\u201cI really dislike that the law discourages work and pay raises,\u201d she said.Maine has been viewed by Republicans as a possible model for some reforms. It was one of a handful of states that embraced a \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d policy of health insurance, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions, and it created \u201cinvisible\u201d high-risk pools to help sick people buy insurance and stabilize the markets.Republicans cite Maine as the model for the risk pool in the House measure, but Ms. Collins notes that the House bill does not fund state-based risk pools anywhere near the level that Maine has.\u201cOne of the problems with the exchanges is that the pools are not large enough,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would cost $15 billion annually to expand nationally a patient stability fund like Maine did.\u201dA state bill that loosened community rating rules and deregulated the insurance market could also be a model for a Republican health care bill that allows states more waivers from federal rules. Many state health care experts see that as a way to get more flexibility and experimentation in insurance markets.For instance, Ms. Collins thinks Maine should embrace a Medicaid expansion modeled on the one adopted by Indiana after the state obtained a waiver from the Obama administration. Indiana included managed-care plans in its Medicaid expansion and a requirement that poor people contribute to savings accounts, which are then applied to the portion of their medical bills.Maine health care experts are watching Ms. Collins carefully in the debate, which Republicans would like to see reach its climax before the July Fourth recess.\u201cI think she is very conscious of the fact that if you move forward with a plan that gives tax credits to higher-income people but not a 60-year-old in Presque Isle, that is not a good move for our state,\u201d said Emily Brostek, the executive director of Consumers for Affordable Health Care in Augusta, Me.Rural Maine voters, who largely supported Mr. Trump in his election, are watching, too.\u201cI like what I\u2019ve got,\u201d said Mr. Smith, the lobsterman, who is an independent and voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cIf they get rid of Obamacare, I would say I would blame the Republicans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Team New Zealand, Rising Power, Closes In on the America\u2019s Cup", "Date": "2017-06-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith two more victories on Sunday, Team New Zealand took a 6-1 lead in this first-to-seven Cup match. So lopsided is the contest that significant crew changes are not out of the question for Oracle; Jimmy Spithill, Oracle\u2019s star skipper and longtime leader, is not ruling out being replaced at the helm by the team\u2019s tactician, Tom Slingsby, for Monday\u2019s races.\u201cLook, everything is on the table,\u201d Spithill said after Oracle\u2019s latest error-filled afternoon on the Great Sound.Spithill, long considered the world\u2019s top match racer, has been beaten to the starting line in all but one race so far, losing duel after duel against the Team New Zealand helmsman Peter Burling, who is in his first America\u2019s Cup.In the yachting world, this has been a stunning development.\u201cIt is student teaching the master,\u201d said Ken Read, a former America\u2019s Cup helmsman.It is also challenger schooling the defender. Team New Zealand, which led Team USA by 8-1 in San Francisco in 2013 only to suffer a collapse, is navigating the cerulean waters of Bermuda more expertly than its more experienced opponent.In Sunday\u2019s second race, Team New Zealand never once dropped off its foils from start to finish, keeping the friction and fuss to a minimum as Spithill and his veteran crew kept splashing down in their wake, and even incurred their latest penalty for sailing outside the course.The Oracle team owner Larry Ellison, who became a multibillionaire by developing and marketing business software, is financing a team that cannot get the technical details right; Team USA has blamed its onboard computer systems for some of its problems, despite its budgetary advantage. As an innovator and perfectionist who likes his Zen gardens just so, Ellison must also admire the Kiwis\u2019 precision and ingenuity on a relative shoestring.The chief executive Grant Dalton and the chief operating officer Kevin Shoebridge have spent their limited budget on the essentials, not creature comforts, as those who have visited their spartan home base in Auckland can confirm. The Kiwis have also had the moxie to think outside the box while staying inside the rules.The four cycling grinders on board are the most obvious manifestation of this. Known as cyclors \u2014 a portmanteau of cyclists and sailors \u2014 they have become the symbol of this Cup and, like many a design breakthrough, represent an idea that looks obvious only in retrospect.The Swedes tried it in the America\u2019s Cup long ago, but only below decks. Other teams, including Oracle, claim they had considered the idea before rejecting it, but only the Kiwis have truly made it work.And it has worked not only because strong legs can produce more wattage with less effort than strong arms on traditional hand-powered grinding pedestals. It has worked because it has allowed the Kiwis to produce that wattage while keeping their hands free for other onboard duties, supplementing the work of Burling and the wing trimmer Glenn Ashby.\u201cThat\u2019s a massive factor,\u201d said Andy Maloney, one of Team New Zealand\u2019s cyclors. \u201cWe pride ourselves on not everything being put into Peter\u2019s or Glenn\u2019s hands, whereas you see Jimmy Spithill and Tom Slingsby pretty much doing 99 percent of the work on the Oracle boat, and they look pretty hectic. They get pretty flustered when it\u2019s a tight race, whereas we delegate the jobs a bit more evenly across the boat because we can use our hands.\u201dIt is more complex than that, of course. Team New Zealand has also had good weather models and developed its boat with light winds in mind.It is far from certain that the rules will allow cyclors in the next Cup. It may be time for the power to be produced automatically, rather than relying so heavily on grinders.But Team New Zealand\u2019s control system \u2014 with the bikes just one component \u2014 has also worked so well in Bermuda because the Kiwis dreamed it up and polished it up early enough in this Cup cycle to make it impossible for the competition to replicate effectively on short notice.Oracle tried. The team added a cycling station for Slingsby early in the regatta but has since abandoned the idea. Slingsby was back turning the handles with his hands on Saturday and Sunday.\u201cI\u2019m sure Tom has spent a lot of time making crucial decisions while he\u2019s fatigued,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cBut it would be a lot harder for him to do it than Pete, who is sitting in the back of our boat and has a really good feel for the angles we\u2019re sailing, and he\u2019s just getting information fed to him, and he\u2019s able to make pretty clear calls around the racecourse.\u201dThe Kiwis have not been perfect, but they have been remarkable, all the more so given that just one of their primary crew members had sailed in an America\u2019s Cup until arriving in Bermuda.The fresh-faced crew, led by a young helmsman with no scar tissue from 2013, has Spithill entertaining the idea of stepping down and has itself one victory from taking the sport\u2019s oldest major trophy all the way back to New Zealand.Advertisement"}

Mr. Dimon is losing his leading successor candidate, Matt Zames, the chief operating officer. Granted, the bank\u2019s division heads are all more than capable executives, but age or inexperience probably means they would be interim C.E.O.s at best.Mr. Zames is both young and well traveled. Now 46, he was head of fixed-income trading before Mr. Dimon in 2012 asked him to clean up the mess left when the bank\u2019s chief investment office lost $6 billion in the infamous \u201cLondon whale\u201d fiasco. His duties as chief operating officer then grew.The former investment banking bosses James E. Staley and William T. Winters now run Barclays and Standard Chartered, respectively. Frank J. Bisignano, Mr. Zames\u2019s co-chief operating officer for a time, now heads First Data, while the onetime retail chief Charles W. Scharf stepped down last fall after four years as boss of Visa.JPMorgan\u2019s board is by no means bereft of alternatives now that Mr. Zames is joining the exodus. Trouble is, none of them is an obvious candidate to run the bank long term. Gordon Smith has had great success overseeing the consumer and community bank, not least in keeping the retail-banking and credit-card division\u2019s tech skills ahead of the pack. But at 58 he\u2019s only three years younger than Mr. Dimon, who has no intention of leaving any time soon.Daniel Pinto has kept the investment bank powering ahead, but has little experience in other parts of the organization. The same applies to the asset-management boss, Mary Erdoes. Doug Petno, the commercial bank chief, used to be an investment banker, but he has a relatively low profile in a smaller part of the company.There is one other candidate: Marianne Lake, who has shone as finance chief and is well known to investors. She, though, has never run a major business. Handing her the reins to the chief investment office, which she will take over from Mr. Zames, is a start. If Mr. Dimon gives her a larger profit and loss to manage, it will send a strong signal that she is the next anointed one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DeVos Is Discarding College Policies That New Evidence Shows Are Effective", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCost of CollegeIn June, the secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, announced plans to dismantle a set of Obama-era policies devised to protect students and taxpayers from predatory for-profit colleges.Yet data released in the final days of the previous administration shows that the existing rules have proved more effective at shutting down bad college programs than even the most optimistic backers could have hoped.The rules that Ms. DeVos wants to repeal are called the gainful employment regulations. For all for-profit programs, and any nondegree employment certificate programs at public or nonprofit colleges, the Education Department compares how much typical students borrow with how much they earn after graduation.If the ratio is too high \u2014 if students borrow lots of money and can\u2019t get well-paying jobs \u2014 the program is deemed \u201cfailing.\u201d A program that fails in two out of three years becomes ineligible for federal financial aid. Since many for-profit programs get up to 90 percent of their revenue through the Department of Education, the penalty will almost surely shut them down.No program has reached this point yet. Before it could complete the rules, the Obama administration had to spend years fighting through a thicket of lawsuits filed by the for-profit college industry. Eleven days before President Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Department of Education released the first list of failing programs. Ms. DeVos has extended the original deadline for appealing the findings, and recently announced plans to rewrite the rules.But a close analysis of the more than 500 failing programs that haven\u2019t appealed their status reveals something interesting: A substantial majority of them, 300 or so, have already been shut down \u2014 even though colleges are not yet required to do so. The gainful employment test turns out to be an accurate way of identifying programs that for-profit colleges themselves don\u2019t think are worth saving, as well as identifying programs run by colleges that are on the brink of bankruptcy and dissolution.Some of the failing programs were run by ITT Tech, a publicly traded chain of technical schools that collapsed under a wave of consumer lawsuits and government investigations in 2016. Dozens of other for-profits have failed in recent years, from mom-and-pop hairdressing academies to business schools with dozens of programs in multiple states.The gainful employment results suggest why. Students who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in fashion design at Sanford-Brown College\u2019s now-defunct Chicago campus left school with over $45,000 in federal and institutional loans. But they earned less than $21,000 per year, before taxes, food and rent. That\u2019s barely above the minimum wage for a family of three. Only 29 percent of students who started the program graduated on time.Sanford-Brown operated for years with results like this, until the Education Department stepped in. Announcing that the entire chain would shutter, Ron McCray, C.E.O. of Sanford-Brown\u2019s parent corporation, cited a \u201cchallenging regulatory environment\u201d and \u201cthe gainful employment regulations issued last year.\u201d In other words, rather than invest the time and money necessary to offer affordable programs that lead to well-paying jobs, they simply closed up shop.Other colleges stayed open, but quickly dispensed with their failing programs. Fortis College, which operates more than 40 campuses in 15 states, used to offer an associate degree in criminal justice and safety studies at its Centerville, Ohio, location. Students typically left the two-year program with nearly $32,000 in debt \u2014 yet earned only $15,400 a year. Officials at the Centerville campus say the program is no longer accepting new students.The colleges that are keeping their failing programs open tend be small concerns that simply can\u2019t afford to lose the revenue. The Seattle Institute of Oriental Medicine offers only three programs, one of which, a master\u2019s degree in acupuncture, failed the test. Tuition is $76,800. The median earnings for program graduates is $16,256 per year.Despite strong evidence that the gainful employment rules are working as intended, Ms. DeVos has decided to tear them up and start from scratch, calling the regulations \u201ca muddled process that\u2019s unfair to students and schools.\u201d Both Ms. DeVos and the president of the for-profit college industry association, Steve Gunderson, have said that students should be protected from \u201cfraud.\u201d Many of the failing programs aren\u2019t fraudulent, in the strict, legal sense of the word. They\u2019re just extraordinarily ineffective: a waste of taxpayer money and student time.Bridgepoint Education, a publicly traded for-profit college corporation, offers an online associate degree in early education through Ashford University that costs almost $34,000 in tuition, fees and supplies, most of which students finance with debt. Fewer than half of students finish on time, and the median graduate earns less than $16,000 per year. If those results continue, the program will be cut off from aid under current rules.It will take two years for the Department of Education to write and set into effect new gainful employment rules. A department spokesman declined to say whether the department would be enforcing the existing rules in the meantime. If it doesn\u2019t, and if the new rules gut the existing regulations, Ms. DeVos will have destroyed a highly effective tool for protecting students from for-profit colleges that offer few job prospects and mountains of debt.Advertisement"}

The French ambassador to the United Nations, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, on Wednesday called the resolution of approval a \u201clandmark\u201d that would need the world\u2019s financial support in the coming months.The United States had objected to giving the force the authority to \u201cuse all necessary means,\u201d which is the most robust form of Security Council authorization. The Americans argued that the mandate was too broad and that it was not legally necessary \u2014 and in the final text, adopted unanimously, that language was dropped.The counterterrorism force is to be made up of 5,000 troops from Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.The next French-American diplomatic battle could be over who will finance the mission. For now, the money will not come from the United Nations peacekeeping budget. The United States pays the largest share of that budget, and the administration\u2019s envoy to the United Nations, Nikki R.

{"Headline": "In McConnell\u2019s Own State, Fear and Confusion Over Health Care Bill", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s broken. It\u2019s broken very badly,\u201d Mr. Gorman said of former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. \u201cBut if they want to take away insurance from 22 million people \u2014 a lot of them would come from these mountains. That would be devastating to our area.\u201dAnd in few places are the political complexities of health care more glaring than in this poor state with crushing medical needs, substantially alleviated by the Affordable Care Act, but where Republican opposition to the law remains almost an article of faith. While some Senate moderates say the Republican bill is too harsh, Rand Paul, Kentucky\u2019s other Republican senator, is among Senate Republicans who say they are opposed to the current bill for a different reason: They believe it does not go far enough to reduce costs.Here in Whitesburg, a city of roughly 2,000 people at the base of Pine Mountain, Mr. Gorman\u2019s sentiment seems to be the prevailing one. In nearly two dozen interviews with health care workers and patients, at the hospital and at a nonprofit clinic run by the Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation, Kentuckians sounded both fearful and flummoxed by the health care drama on Capitol Hill.\u201cIt makes me very nervous,\u201d said Brittany Hunsaker, 29, a clinic social worker who counsels pregnant women addicted to opioids. \u201cSome of the most vulnerable people that we serve, we may not be seeing any more.\u201dSeveral clear themes emerged. Most people said they want everyone covered, and were appalled, as was Mr. Gorman, when they learned the Congressional Budget Office had estimated the Republican plan would leave 22 million more people uninsured over a 10-year period. They are happy that lawmakers are trying to fix Mr. Obama\u2019s health law \u2014 rising premiums are a worry for many \u2014 but fear that Republicans, in their haste, will make a bad situation worse.Sorting out the way forward is agonizingly complex. Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion and successes under the Affordable Care Act are largely the result of former Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat who is out of office now. Meanwhile, Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican elected in 2015, is pushing for a Medicaid waiver from the federal government that includes requirements for many beneficiaries to work or participate in job training.Dr. Van Breeding, the clinic\u2019s director of medical affairs, lamented that the Republican bill in the Senate had gotten mixed up in \u201cparty politics,\u201d while patients had been forgotten. He summed up the situation this way: \u201cSenator Paul is worried about the financial aspect of it. Senator McConnell is worried about the political aspect of it. And I\u2019m worried about patients not having access to basic health care.\u201dKathy Collins, 50, who suffers from lupus, an autoimmune disease \u2014 and who was uninsured until she got Medicaid coverage through the law\u2019s expansion \u2014 is among Dr. Breeding\u2019s patients. Sitting in her hospital bed here Tuesday morning, she said she was surprised to hear that Mr. McConnell, whom she had voted for previously, was leading the charge to roll it back.\u201cHe is?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell, then, he\u2019s no good for Kentucky.\u201dHealth care is a growing part of this region\u2019s economy, and people here are also deeply concerned that the repeal will bring job losses to a region already decimated by unemployment from the coal industry downturn.Dr. Breeding says the number of uninsured patients at the clinic dropped from 19 percent to 4 percent as a result of the health care law. He said Mountain Comprehensive was \u201cbarely getting by\u201d financially before the law was passed; business is much better now. Mountain Comprehensive has hired more people and now offers extended weekend hours and an optometry clinic \u2014 services that have been financed by revenue brought in from the health law, Dr. Breeding said.And those services mean more health care jobs.\u201cIf they do what they say they are going to do, then we may lose our jobs,\u201d said Vicki Roland, a surgical nurse. \u201cI think what we have works pretty good for the people. If they revamp it, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dDespite his constituents\u2019 concerns, Mr. McConnell has little reason to worry about a political backlash; he is widely credited with building the Republican Party in this state, and after three decades in the Senate, his seat is secure. In 2014, he clobbered his Democratic opponent, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, winning by more than 15 percentage points.\u201cHe ran on a clear platform to repeal and replace Obamacare, as did Matt Bevin, the governor, as did Rand Paul, the other senator, as did Donald Trump,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a Kentucky Republican strategist with close ties to Mr. McConnell. \u201cAnd they all have one thing in common: They have overwhelmingly won their elections in Kentucky.\u201d\u201cYou said you have a \u2018responsibility to act,\u2019\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe believe you have a duty to act responsibly. Kentuckians deserve better.\u201dThe local newspaper here in Whitesburg, The Mountain Eagle, published an editorial assailing Mr. McConnell for putting the bill together behind closed doors. \u201cWhy the secrecy, Sen. McConnell?\u201d its headline read.To spend a day with Dr. Breeding is to get a glimpse of his patients\u2019 challenges. His weekday mornings begin at 4:30 a.m., when he arrives at the hospital in Whitesburg. Dressed in his workout gear, he makes rounds, visiting patients whose ailments run the gamut: pneumonia, respiratory failure, colon cancer, lupus, black lung disease, dementia, heart attack, kidney infection and multiple myeloma, a bone cancer.By 8:30 a.m., after a break for a brisk walk through town, he arrives at the clinic, where his nurse practitioner, Heather Yates, says she sees the health care debate from both sides.Like her colleagues, Ms. Yates, 35, worries that undoing the Affordable Care Act will hurt patients. But she has had to cope with the high cost of premiums; when her husband was out of work, they qualified for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act but still paid $400 a month for an insurance policy with a deductible of as much as $1,500. Now the couple pays $1,000 a month, with a $6,000 deductible, for a plan that covers all expenses once the deductible is met.\u201cI\u2019ve got a mix of emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cI do want everybody to have insurance, but I understand what it\u2019s like to pay for it too.\u201dFollow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter: @SherylNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young People Have Their Say About the Future of Hong Kong", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When crowds calling for greater democracy occupied the streets of Hong Kong three years ago, a skinny teenager led them. When voters went to the polls last year, they elected a 23-year-old legislator, the youngest in the city\u2019s history. And when calls for Hong Kong\u2019s independence from China gained momentum, young people were again at the forefront.Many of the most influential voices in Hong Kong today belong to those who have little or no memory of this former British colony\u2019s return to Chinese rule two decades ago. But this generation\u2019s identity has been shaped by the handover.By contrast, Carrie Lam, who will be sworn in Saturday as Hong Kong\u2019s new chief executive, says she wants to make sure that children will learn from an early age to say, \u201cI am Chinese.\u201dWe asked a half-dozen young people in Hong Kong how they identify themselves, what it has been like to grow up in a city newly returned to Chinese rule and what they expect from the future. These are excerpts from their answers, edited for clarity and length:Student beginning at Hong Kong Polytechnic University in SeptemberI was born after the handover. When I was growing up, society told me I was Chinese. When I was young, I was proud to be Chinese. I was excited when I saw China shoot a rocket into space.But when I grew up, I learned more and more about China and the Communist Party, and I felt ashamed to be Chinese. Especially in recent years, the Communists kind of control Hong Kong. When a foreigner asks me who I am, I will always say I\u2019m a Hong Konger but not Chinese. In my mind, I know I\u2019m Chinese, but I don\u2019t want to say I am from China. I would rather say that I\u2019m from Hong Kong.The thing I don\u2019t like is the truth \u2014 that Hong Kong is a part of China. Our city has to follow every rule set by Beijing. We have no rights to our politics. We couldn\u2019t really vote for the chief executive. The Communist Party is actually assigning the people to control Hong Kong.High school graduate pursuing a nursing careerI started to pay close attention to politics after the Umbrella Movement in 2014. Everyone in my class, which had about 30 people, had been to the protest sites at some point, and the school held a forum the next day after the protest erupted. The whole assembly hall was full.Hong Kongers should unite as a nation, and then go independent. As long as Hong Kong is under China\u2019s rule, there will not be democracy. That\u2019s one reason. But another important reason is that I want to tell the world we\u2019re not Chinese.Our differences with Chinese people are mainly cultural. You can tell very easily when you travel. Hong Kongers queue up and won\u2019t talk too loud, and they don\u2019t spit or squat everywhere. We have our language \u2014 traditional scripts and Cantonese \u2014 and shared experience and spirits.Hong Kong needs to be economically independent as well. Hong Kong\u2019s economy has tilted too much toward the mainland and has become overreliant on it. If China\u2019s economy collapses, Hong Kong would be doomed.Community officer with a pro-Beijing political partyI was 5 during the handover. But I remember there was less political struggle. The neighborhood relationships were better. There were fewer complaints about the colonial government.I am happy to see the return of Hong Kong to China. Twenty years after the handover, the development of Hong Kong is still stable. Hong Kong has retained its prosperity. China has done a satisfactory job managing political development. But still, China has to do more for the return of Hong Kong people\u2019s hearts.Hong Kong is part of China. Therefore, I would identify myself as a Hong Konger and also Chinese. Still, I would see myself first as Hong Konger because this is the place where I grew up.But this cannot violate my Chinese identity. Hong Kong is a place, and China is a country.University of Hong Kong graduate from the Chinese city of Harbin who now works in financeAfter graduation I decided to stay in Hong Kong. But now, if you asked me again, I am probably open to going back to China. I visit Beijing and Shanghai a few times every year, and I realize they have been developing pretty fast and making lots of progress. Now China in general has lot of advantages over Hong Kong.Many Chinese people are more adaptable to new technology and new ideas. Hong Kong is a bit lacking in terms of that. Of course, Hong Kong has pretty good infrastructure. It\u2019s quite developed. Now China has developed so fast, as a function of that, Hong Kong will be weakened in the future.I think some Hong Kong people are not very happy about the handover. Some Hong Kong people I know have British passports. They are very proud of it.And also, my British friends, they are very arrogant about it. They\u2019re like, \u201cHong Kong was a British colony. We decided to give it to China. We\u2019re so awesome.\u201d These conversations make me unhappy, but they\u2019re still my friends.Student at St. Stephen\u2019s College, a secondary school in Hong KongGrowing up in Hong Kong as an American-born Chinese, I\u2019ve never really identified fully and exclusively with one single culture or had a strong sense of nationalism.I think the most relevant issue to youth like me would be the tangible social divide by language, mannerisms and cultural identity within Hong Kong. There is a lot of local tension between a perceived \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cus.\u201d It has led to a lot of friction and compromise between the Chinese and the Hong Kongers. A lot of people are also unsatisfied with the increasingly corrupt political and justice scene.All said and done, I\u2019m proud to be associated with Hong Kong. I personally think that Hong Kong is also much, much more than just a city under Chinese rule. In fact, it could be argued that the handover inadvertently caused the term \u201cHong Konger\u201d to be coined, the idea that the people of Hong Kong are neither this nor that, but their very own.Freelance video producerI think Hong Kong has two problems. First is the systemic political problem in terms of who gets power and whether Hong Kong people have the independence to determine whatever we want to determine. The second is the income gap problem.Hong Kong has this bottled-up situation where people are very upset about housing in particular. The government is too scared to do anything to land developers because they\u2019re making a lot of money out of selling land.I despise politicians old or young who are just yelling, doing nothing. Thank you, we all know there\u2019s a problem. Can you think of a smart way to solve it? Hong Kong right now, I think that everyone is just so angry, and we\u2019re not moving anywhere. We\u2019re just stuck.Advertisement"}

Another former employer has a 10,000-acre hobby farm he visits about 10 times a year. And, in a total coincidence, I have been hired by two people who each happen to own one of the 25 largest yachts in the world, boats that come with 12 times the living space of my house and are equipped not only with fully stocked wine cellars but also with helicopters and submarines.So I know what wealthy is. And I know my wife and I are not.However, my wife\u2019s consulting business is recognized nationally in her part of the universe, and every 10 years or so I write a book that sells a few copies, so we are doing O.K. No, we haven\u2019t ever chartered a private jet, ordered a $1,000 bottle of wine at a restaurant or bought a $10,000 watch. But we did manage (barely) to put our four children through the (very expensive) colleges of their choice.After we had paid boatloads of tuition for 11 years, a funny thing happened: When the baby \u2014 all 6 feet 2 inches and 175 pounds of him \u2014 graduated, we relearned the meaning of discretionary income.So we have made a decision that gets some people to look at us strangely.We have started to give our children some of our money.We are not setting up substantial trust funds. Heck, we are not even fully taking advantage of the tax code that says I could give each kid $14,000 a year, and Alison could, too, so that we could end up gifting each of our four children $28,000 a year with no tax consequences to either us or them.We are not even averaging half of that. But for the last four years, right around the holidays, we have given them checks \u2014 along with traditional presents. So far the total allotted in aggregate to the four of them adds up to about three years of higher education at a good private college.They have each parked the money in low-cost, diversified index funds.Why would we ever give them our money? A couple of friends asked this question in horror \u2014 figuring we could use the funds, or it would be better to wait until after my wife and I die.My answer is threefold.Child No. 2 and his wife are house hunting. Child No. 3 and her fianc\u00e9 soon will be. And Child No. 4, the aforementioned rather tall baby, is planning on starting a restaurant. They have legitimate uses for the money \u2014 now.Our friends listen to all this, and sometimes they have questions like, \u201cAren\u2019t you concerned you are giving them money you may need someday?\u201dNot really. While neither Ali nor I own a working crystal ball, we have prepared the best we can for the future. We have saved \u2014 and continue to save \u2014 aggressively for retirement, and we have really good health insurance.The other common question is whether we\u2019re worried about what our kids might do with the money.That answer is a flat no.For one thing, it is not all that much. Each of the children makes more \u2014 in some cases, a lot more \u2014 in a year than they have gotten in total.For another, they are pretty levelheaded young people. If they are going to make bad choices, they are going to make them no matter when they get the funds. (When we started doing this, the baby was 23.)While I find my friends\u2019 reactions intriguing, I found our children\u2019s reactions fascinating \u2014 and totally in character for each of them.Child No. 1, a finance/logistics guy for a San Francisco start-up, cited the longstanding \u201ctime value of money\u201d concept, which states that the value of money right now is greater than it will be in the future because of the earning power it has today.\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are giving us part of our inheritance now. Time value of money, and all that. Cool. Your grandson thanks you for helping to pay his college tuition.\u201dChild No. 2, who has always been a bit of hoarder, said \u201cthanks\u201d \u2014 and instantly deposited it in his mutual fund.Child No. 3, who has never cared about money, tried to persuade us to spend it on ourselves. She took the check reluctantly \u2014 and with the strong understanding of just how much it is going to cost her and her soon-to-be husband to buy a house in or near Boston.Child No. 4, the budding restaurateur, said, \u201cThanks, guys!\u201d and went back to planning his potential menu.I will not waste a minute worrying about how they are going to spend the money. And I am glad we gave it to them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was Lenin a German Agent?", "Date": "2017-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRed CenturyBecause he returned home by way of Germany \u2014 and with the obvious cooperation of the German High Command \u2014 which was then at war against Russia and her Entente allies (France, Britain and, from April 6, the United States), allegations that Lenin was a German agent were immediately hurled by his opponents, a charge that remains controversial to this day. If it is ever proved that Lenin was acting on behalf of the German Imperial Government in 1917, the implications for our understanding of the October Revolution, and the Soviet Communist regime born of it, which lasted until 1991, would be profound. This would amount to the greatest influence operation of all time, making present-day concerns about Russian meddling in Western elections, including last year\u2019s American presidential contest, seem tame in comparison. Was it true?Had the British or French governments been weaker in World War I, they might have been undermined by other Lenins. In fact, Germany did target them, too, though German support for Irish nationalists and French pacifists never amounted to much.Russia, long troubled with labor agitation and peasant unrest, was the weak link of the Entente alliance, and it is not surprising the Germans put so much effort into undermining Czarist rule. Ecumenical in their support for Russian revolutionaries, the Germans subsidized not only Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks, but also socialist rivals such as Leon Trotsky, then a Menshevik, who published antiwar articles in Paris and then New York City.If Lenin was not the only recipient of German largess, however, he was the most important. Although what most people today understand as Communism is the Marxist program of the abolition of private property, state ownership of the means of production and a planned economy, it was not this program, endorsed by other European Marxists, that recommended Lenin to the German Imperial government.What singled Lenin out from fellow Russian socialists was his fanatical opposition to the war and his support for Ukrainian independence, a key aim of the Central Powers. While other antiwar socialists like Trotsky genuinely abhorred the carnage and strove to bring the war to a halt by supporting protests and draft resistance, Lenin argued in his 1915 pamphlet \u201cSocialism and War\u201d that revolutionaries should instead infiltrate the armies and turn them red, promoting mutinies and actively seeking the defeat of \u201c \u2018their\u2019 governments\u201d (Lenin\u2019s own quotation marks).Nor did Lenin conceal his antiwar views after returning to Russia. The \u201cApril Theses\u201d advocated toppling the provisional government that had come to power after the February Revolution. During the April Days putsch, which occurred two weeks after Lenin\u2019s return, Bolshevik activists held up antiwar placards that openly urged fraternization with the enemy (\u201cthe Germans are our brothers\u201d).After a second attempted putsch, known as the July Days, Lenin and 10 other Bolsheviks were charged with \u201ctreason and organized armed rebellion.\u201d Scores of witnesses came forward to testify about wire transfers from Stockholm, money-laundering via a German import business, the German financing of the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda (including editions aimed at front-line troops), the going rates for holding up Bolshevik placards in street protests (10 rubles) or for fighting in the Red Guards (40 rubles per day). While Lenin fled to Finland, most of his comrades were arrested. The stage was set for a spectacular show trial.It was not to be. Just as the provisional government\u2019s case was buttressed in late August 1917 with the testimony of the police agents who had raided Lenin\u2019s headquarters, its prime minister, Alexander Kerensky, granted amnesty to most of the arrested Bolsheviks (though not Lenin) in order to enlist their support against a general, Lavr Kornilov, whom Kerensky believed was plotting a right-wing military coup. In a shortsighted move, Kerensky allowed the Bolshevik military organization to rearm, thus acquiring the weapons they would use to oust him two months later.Lenin, with wanted posters for his arrest plastered all over Russia on the eve of the October Revolution, did not miss his chance. Once Lenin was in power, far from showing caution in relations with his alleged German paymasters, one of his first acts was to send a cable to German military headquarters on the eastern front, offering an unconditional cease-fire. When the harsh terms of the resulting treaty of Brest-Litovsk were announced in Petrograd\u2019s Tauride Palace in 1918 \u2014 terms that included detaching Ukraine and the Baltic States from Russia \u2014 Lenin was greeted with shouts of \u201cDown with the traitor!\u201d and \u201cJudas!\u201d and \u201cGerman spy!\u201dSo was Lenin a German agent?In his own mind, Lenin could and did justify his actions as tactical maneuvers serving the higher cause of Communism, not the sordid war aims of the German Imperial Government. Fair enough. But it is hard to imagine this defense holding up at trial, if the jury were composed of ordinary Russians while the war was still going on. The evidence assembled by Kerensky\u2019s justice department, much of which has only recently been rediscovered in the Russian archives, was damning. No matter Lenin\u2019s real intentions, it is undeniable that he received German logistical and financial support in 1917, and that his actions, from antiwar agitation in the Russian armies to his request for an unconditional cease-fire, served the interests of Russia\u2019s wartime enemy in Berlin. They also brought about disastrous consequences for Russia herself, from territorial dismemberment in 1918 to decades of agony under the suffocating Bolshevik dictatorship.The Russian Revolution inaugurated a new era in foreign influence operations. Lenin himself helped to found the Communist International, which for nearly a quarter of a century was dedicated to trying to topple capitalist governments around the world. The Nazis played a similar game in Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938, only to abandon the pretense of influence-peddling for brute force when, along with the Soviet Red Army from the east, they invaded Poland from the west in 1939. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States turned Revolutionierungspolitik into an art form, striving to undermine one another\u2019s allies and satellite states by all manner of subterfuge and subversion.Today, it appears that a new round of the Cold War has emerged, though with a different ideological flavor, as the Kremlin promotes populist nationalism in Europe and the United States, even as Western leaders and democracy activists mobilize opposition against Russia and Putin-friendly regimes, such as Viktor Orban\u2019s in Hungary \u2014 which then crack down on such activists as \u201cforeign agents.\u201d Revolutionierungspolitik has gone global.Before panic sets in, it is well to be reminded of the difference in degree, and kind, of today\u2019s foreign influence-peddling compared with past episodes. Disinformation spread by state media, online bots and Twitter trolls is a serious nuisance, taking advantage of the openness of Western societies to undermine confidence in democratic institutions; cyberattacks and hacking are more serious still. For their part, Mr. Putin and his defenders denounce outside political interference in places like Ukraine, claiming that Russian moves there are mere reactions to Western meddling.Yet none of these influence operations are comparable, in scale or geopolitical impact, to Germany\u2019s playing of the Lenin card, or indeed to what the United States and Soviet Union did during the Cold War. Unlike Russia in 1917, the great power governments of today, whether in Washington, Paris, Berlin or Moscow, are too strongly entrenched to fall prey to a Lenin. Or so we must hope.Sean McMeekin, a professor of history at Bard College, is the author of \u201cThe Russian Revolution: A New History.\u201dThis is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Trump Destroy Obama\u2019s Legacy?", "Date": "2017-06-23", "News": "News AnalysisThe president seems determined to define his time in office by demolishing what his predecessor did.Supported byEvery new president changes course, particularly those succeeding someone from the other party. But rarely has a new president appeared so determined not just to steer the country in a different direction but to actively dismantle what was established before his arrival. Whether out of personal animus, political calculation, philosophical disagreement or a conviction that the last president damaged the country, Mr. Trump has made clear that if it has Mr. Obama\u2019s name on it, he would just as soon erase it from the national hard drive.\u201cI\u2019ve reflected back and simply cannot find another instance in recent American history where a new administration was so wholly committed to reversing the accomplishments of its predecessor,\u201d Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center, said. While other presidents focus on what they will build, \u201cthis one is different, far more comfortable still in swinging the wrecking ball than in developing models for what is to follow.\u201dShirley Anne Warshaw, director of the Fielding Center for Presidential Leadership Study at Gettysburg College, said Mr. Trump is not unusual in making a clean break from his predecessor. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t doing anything that Obama didn\u2019t do,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is simply reversing policies that were largely put in place by a president of a different party.\u201dThe difference, she said, is that other presidents have proactive ideas about what to erect in place of their predecessor\u2019s programs. \u201cI have not seen any constructive bills in this vein that Trump has put forth,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as I can tell, he has no independent legislative agenda other than tearing down. Perhaps tax reform.\u201dAdvisers insist Mr. Trump is not driven by a desire to unravel the Obama presidency. But like the Manhattan real estate developer he is, they said, he believes he must in some cases demolish the old to make way for the new.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t dismantled everything, and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s looking to do,\u201d said Hope Hicks, the White House director of strategic communications. \u201cThat may be a side effect of what he\u2019s building for his own legacy. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s coming into the office every day saying, \u2018How can we undo Obama\u2019s legacy, and how can he go back?\u2019 \u201dCritics say Mr. Obama brought this on himself. His biggest legislative achievements were passed almost exclusively with Democratic votes, meaning there was no bipartisan consensus that would outlast his presidency. And when Republicans captured Congress, he turned to a strategy he called the pen and the phone, signing executive orders that could be easily erased by the next president.\u201cI\u2019ve heard it joked about that the Obama library is being revised to focus less on his legislative achievements as each week of the Trump administration goes by,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. \u201cIt\u2019s like living by the sword and dying by the sword. When your presidency is based on a pen and a phone, all of that can be undone, and I think we\u2019re seeing that happening rather systematically.\u201d\u201cObama\u2019s legacy would be under much greater threat by a more competent president than Donald Trump,\u201d said Josh Earnest, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s White House press secretary. \u201cHis inexperience and lack of discipline are an impediment to his success in implementing policies that would reverse what Obama instituted.\u201dOther Obama veterans said much of what Mr. Trump has done was either less dramatic than it appeared or reversible. He did not actually break relations with Cuba, for instance. It will take years to actually withdraw from the Paris accord, and the next president could rejoin. The real impact, they argued, was to America\u2019s international reputation.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of posturing and, in fact, not a huge amount of change, and to the extent there has been change, it\u2019s been of the self-defeating variety,\u201d said Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser. \u201cWhat\u2019s been happening is not that the administration is undoing President Obama\u2019s legacy, it\u2019s undoing American leadership on the international stage.\u201dFor decades, presidents moving into the Oval Office have made a point on their first day or two of signing orders overturning policies of the last tenant, what Mr. Riley called \u201cpartisan kabuki\u201d to signal that \u201ca new president is in town.\u201dEven so, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Obama invested much effort in deconstructing programs left behind. Mr. Bush kept Mr. Clinton\u2019s health care program for lower-income children, his revamped welfare system and his AmeriCorps service organization. Mr. Obama undid much of Mr. Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind education program, but kept his Medicare prescription medicine program, his AIDS-fighting program and most of his counterterrorism apparatus.Mr. Obama understood that his legacy might be jeopardized by Mr. Trump. During last year\u2019s campaign, he warned supporters that \u201call the progress we\u2019ve made over these last eight years goes out the window\u201d if Mr. Trump won. Only after the election did he assert the opposite. \u201cMaybe 15 percent of that gets rolled back, 20 percent,\u201d he told The New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of stuff that sticks.\u201dIndeed, when it comes time to tally the record for the history books, Mr. Trump can hardly reverse some of Mr. Obama\u2019s most important achievements, like pulling the economy back from the abyss of a deep recession, rescuing the auto industry and authorizing the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Nor can Mr. Trump take away what will surely be the first line in Mr. Obama\u2019s obituary, his barrier-shattering election as the first African-American president.Conversely, Mr. Obama owns his failures regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. History\u2019s judgment of his handling of the civil war in Syria or the messy aftermath of the intervention in Libya or the economic inequality he left behind will not depend on his successor. If anything, America\u2019s decision to replace Mr. Obama with someone as radically different as Mr. Trump may be taken as evidence of Mr. Obama\u2019s inability to build sustained public support for his agenda or to mitigate the polarization of the country.But legacies are funny things. Presidents are sometimes defined because their successors are so different. Mr. Obama today is more popular than he was during most of his presidency, likely a result of the contrast with Mr. Trump, who is the most unpopular president this early in his tenure in the history of polling. By this argument, even if Mr. Trump does disassemble the Obama legacy, it may redound to his predecessor\u2019s historical benefit.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine future historians condemning Barack Obama for breaking with his country\u2019s past ostracism of Cuba or joining the civilized world in combating climate change or pursuing a more humane and accessible approach to health care,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIndeed, we build memorials to presidents who prod us toward fulfilling the egalitarian vision of Jefferson\u2019s declaration.\u201dBut that may not be all that comforting to Mr. Obama. Presidents prefer memorials to their lasting accomplishments, not their most fleeting.Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times and author of \u201cObama: The Call of History.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plan on Growing Old? Then the Medicaid Debate Affects You", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyThese are the stories we tell ourselves: I will never be poor. I will never be disabled. My child will develop normally. They stand a decent chance of being true, even.There is one tall tale, however, that ought to inspire a great deal of skepticism: I will be able to pay for myself in my old age.Reality forces our hand, however, when the first nursing home bills arrive. The average annual cost is $82,128 for a semiprivate room, according to Genworth, which sells insurance that can help pay those bills. Most people can\u2019t pay that amount and certainly not for long, especially after 10 or 20 years of retirement spending. If a spouse (a male spouse, more often than not in heterosexual couples) has already needed years of expensive care, the other partner is all the more vulnerable.So we tune out the health care policy debates at our own peril. The proposed cutbacks in the growth of Medicaid spending do not just affect the expansion that has taken place in recent years. They propose new per-capita caps on spending.But many people don\u2019t want to be in a nursing home at all. They would much rather live in their own residence for as long as possible. This is where things get tricky, and where the various proposals in Congress could make a big difference. Medicaid must cover nursing home care, but state Medicaid plans don\u2019t have to cover community- or home-based care that might allow you to stay out of a nursing home for some period of time or forever.If state Medicaid administrators have much less money to work with in future years, they will face some unpleasant choices. Do they spread the cuts equally (or at least proportionally) among children, adults with disabilities and seniors? And when billions disappear from budgets for old people who have run out of money and have no family to help them, what will be cut first and most?Advocates for seniors and the industries that serve them are in general agreement here: that care at home and in your nearby community will probably be cut first, given that Medicaid isn\u2019t required to pay for that but is required to pay for nursing home care.Once Medicaid administrators push that domino, here\u2019s how the rest of them might fall. People who cannot get care in the community or at home will simply make different choices if they meet the eligibility requirements.If they tough it out at home without the help they need, they may become injured or sick. That could lead to a hospital stay that\u2019s even more expensive than a nursing home. And who picks up the tab for that? The federal government, except Medicare this time and not Medicaid (which states contribute to as well).So to review, big Medicaid cuts could lead all of us to miss out on the care that many of us like best \u2014 and costs the government the least \u2014 because it will be cut first.Sound wrongheaded to you? Then it\u2019s time to learn more and do more. I pledge to do my part in this space in the coming weeks as the debate in Washington continues. Ask me anything about Medicaid and elder-care services in the online comments area of this column \u2014 or write to me directly by clicking on my digital byline \u2014 and I\u2019ll try to answer as many questions as I can in future articles.She\u2019s right.

America\u2019s might and majesty were cornerstones of international relations, cooperation and diplomacy. We were a beacon and balance to the world. America has been imperfect \u2014 sometimes disastrously so \u2014 but it always seemed to me bent toward the belief that America and the world could be made more perfect.Well, that time has come to a close. America is exiting the world stage. Donald Trump is drawing the curtains.\u201cPresident Trump upended America\u2019s traditional, bipartisan trade policy on Monday as he formally abandoned the ambitious, 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership brokered by his predecessor and declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades.\u201dTrump has had, and continues to have, an unhealthy and inexplicable admiration for the world\u2019s strongmen, dictators and authoritarian regimes \u2014 Russia and Vladimir Putin stand out among the rest \u2014 while simultaneously chiding and chastising America\u2019s traditional allies and those countries\u2019 leaders.Last month in Europe, Trump was as boorish and belligerent as it was possible to be, lashing out at our NATO allies about their defense spending just after having been gracious and magnanimous to leaders in the Middle East.But even beyond whether or not it was popular, staying in was right. More than 190 countries \u2014 most of the countries on the planet \u2014 are signatories to the agreement. We have one planet. It is in trouble. The world must band together to save it. How does it look for the world\u2019s last remaining superpower to simply walk away?This is not putting America first, this is putting America on a path of regression and isolationism.

The percentage was even higher in many precincts within the city of Pittsburgh itself. (Allegheny County includes a range of suburbs in addition to the city.)\u201dThen, for me, the icing on the cake was Trump\u2019s absolute lack of grace and tact in his response to the London terror attacks over the weekend. His first response was not to express his horror and extend America\u2019s condolences and offer American assistance. No, that would have required that he possess a shred of empathy and common decency.Instead, his first instinct was to use the attacks as political fodder to advance his own failed domestic agenda to impose a \u201ctravel ban.\u201dShortly after the attacks, while people were still trying to get their minds around what exactly had happened in London, Trump tweeted:\u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201dTrump is pulling America back and pulling America down.

In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin.The Russian government owns the major television outlets and, according to Russian journalists, sets the daily news agenda. The head of Rosneft, the state-owned oil company, is Igor Sechin, a former K.G.B. and F.S.B. security officer who served as a top lieutenant to Mr. Putin.

It also owns the country\u2019s largest media holding company, Gazprom Media.The deal Mr. Putin made with these companies, oligarchs and banks was that they would be free to make money with state help (often to the detriment of the Russian people) as long as Mr. Putin and his cronies got their cut of the profits \u2014 and the Kremlin and security forces were free to govern without interference.

{"Headline": "Abortion Adds Obstacle as Republicans Plan to Unveil Health Bill", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Abortion flared up Wednesday as the latest hot-button issue to complicate passage of a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which Senate Republican leaders hope to unveil on Thursday and pass next week.If that provision is dropped, a bill that has already elicited deep misgivings among moderate Republicans \u2014 and stiff resistance from Democrats, health care providers and patient advocacy groups \u2014 could also generate concern among abortion opponents, as well as conservative lawmakers.Further complicating the measure\u2019s prospects, insurance companies, which took a leading role in the health care fights of 1993-94 and 2009-10 but have been conspicuously quiet this year, released a blistering letter objecting to Republican plans to remake Medicaid and cut its funding.The changes being considered in Congress could \u201camount to a 25 percent shortfall in covering the actual cost of providing care to our nation\u2019s neediest citizens,\u201d the top executives of 10 insurance companies wrote this week. \u201cThese amounts spell deep cuts, not state flexibilities, in Medicaid.\u201dAs senators struggle to develop a health care bill, their handiwork appears to be too moderate for some Senate conservatives and too conservative for some Senate moderates. The latest version, without the abortion-coverage prohibition and with steep Medicaid cuts, may prove unacceptable to some in both camps. To pass it, Senate leaders can afford to lose only two Republican votes of the 52 in the chamber.Republican senators got a glimpse Wednesday of the highlights of the bill, which was drafted in secret by the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and top aides. White House officials were granted a formal briefing, which risked irking many senators who had yet to see the actual bill.But senators said the provision might have to be dropped for a more prosaic reason: It may not comply with the Senate rules that Republicans are using to speed the health care bill through the Senate.The bill is scheduled to go to the Senate floor next week under these procedures, which limit debate and preclude a Democratic filibuster.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the problems we have to work with,\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said of the abortion issue. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite sure how that\u2019s going to be resolved.\u201dMr. McConnell is determined to get a vote on the bill by the end of next week, before a break for the Fourth of July holiday, but he still does not have enough committed votes to ensure passage.Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, made clear on Wednesday that he was not on board with the Republican bill.\u201cI\u2019m still hoping we reach impasse, and we actually go back to the idea we originally started with, which is repealing Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Paul said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not for replacing Obamacare with Obamacare lite.\u201dThe insurance industry helped block the Clinton White House's health care plan, then helped push through the Affordable Care Act. Insurance companies have been conspicuously quiet this year as Republicans draft legislation, but 10 executives spoke out this week against Medicaid cuts.The House bill and the Senate version, like the Affordable Care Act, would provide tens of billions of dollars in tax credits to help people pay insurance premiums.The federal government is expected to spend more than $30 billion this year on tax credits to help lower- and middle-income people pay premiums. The Senate bill would provide more assistance to lower-income people than the House bill, which bases tax credits on a person\u2019s age.The Senate bill would also repeal most of the taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act. It would delay the effective date of a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage, but Republicans plan to offer an amendment next week to eliminate this \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d which is opposed by labor unions and employers.Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine, both Republicans, said they understood that the House restrictions on the use of tax credits for insurance covering abortion had encountered parliamentary problems.\u201cWhat I heard earlier from the parliamentarian is they didn\u2019t think it would pass\u201d muster under Senate rules, Mr. Tillis said.Mr. Tillis and Ms. Collins said they understood that Senate Republican leaders were hoping to devise some kind of workaround to address concerns of anti-abortion lawmakers. But it was not clear whether those anti-abortion lawmakers would be satisfied with such a plan, which could involve separate legislation.Republicans have been promising to repeal the health law ever since it was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010. On Wednesday, in the final hours before the Senate repeal bill was to be unveiled, members of Congress, consumer groups and health care executives engaged in frenetic advocacy in hopes of shaping the bill.Women\u2019s groups and at least two moderate Republicans, Ms. Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, continued to object to a provision of Mr. McConnell\u2019s bill that would cut off funds for Planned Parenthood.In a letter to Mr. McConnell on Wednesday, more than two dozen House members in the conservative Republican Study Committee listed several parts of the House bill they view as crucial, including cutting funds to Planned Parenthood and restricting the use of the tax credits. The bill, they wrote, fulfills \u201can important conservative commitment to promote life and protect the unborn.\u201dLeaders of the 10 insurance companies told Mr. McConnell that proposed caps on federal Medicaid spending would cause \u201can enormous cost shift to the states,\u201d which could force them to raise taxes, reduce benefits, cut payments to health care providers or eliminate coverage for some beneficiaries. Among those signing the letter were top executives of AmeriHealth Caritas, Molina Healthcare, Blue Shield of California and Healthfirst, in New York.But Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said the Medicaid provisions were one of the bill\u2019s chief attractions for him.\u201cIn my state,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said, \u201cwe are now spending 47 percent of our budget on Medicaid. That\u2019s up from 23 percent in 2008. It\u2019s crowding out money for universities and roads and public safety and coastal restoration, and it just keeps climbing.\u201dEven senators who might support the legislation said they did not want to be rushed.Asked how he felt about the prospect of having a vote on the bill a week after its release, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said, \u201cI feel terrible about it.\u201dSenator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said, \u201cI need the information, I need to hear from constituents, and that\u2019s going to take some time.\u201dJennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting from Washington, and Reed Abelson from New York.Advertisement"}

But they shine a bright light on Libya\u2019s current tragedy. Since the revolution of 2011, the country\u2019s oil and gas resources have been held hostage to both its fractious politics and power struggles in the Middle East.State institutions have been devastated since 2011. Two camps claim to constitute the country\u2019s legitimate leadership. One, based in Tripoli, is backed by Western governments, Turkey and Qatar; the other, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Russia.Representatives of both camps reached an agreement in December 2015, acknowledging the House of Representatives, in Tobruk, as the country\u2019s official legislature; giving a strong consultative role to the previous parliament, the Tripoli-based General National Council; and creating an interim Government of National Accord to mediate between the two. But the deal has failed to bring much stability.Under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya was a classic petrostate, and it remains that today. Absolute dependence on oil and gas, which account for 95 percent of export revenues, has helped turn political infighting into a winner-take-all contest.The N.O.C. has also had to contend with assaults on its independence as a decision-making body. This spring the United Nations-backed Presidency Council, which oversees the Government of National Accord, issued a decree transferring to itself the N.O.C.\u2019s most important functions, such as the right to negotiate concession agreements with foreign companies or set the sale price of Libya\u2019s oil. The move was blocked by an appeals court in Benghazi, but we cannot discount the possibility of similar attempts in the future.The camp based in the east \u2014 a loose affiliation of federalists, the last elected parliament and the Libyan National Army \u2014 controls almost all the oil ports. Yet it cannot legally export oil because resolutions of the United Nations Security Council reserve that right to the Government of National Accord, based in Tripoli.Caught between those rivals, we at the N.O.C. intend to remain neutral until there is a single legitimate government we can submit to. In the meantime, the integrity of the N.O.C. \u2014 arguably the only institution today that can still function across the entire country \u2014 must be protected. The organization must not be split up. Its monopoly on oil and gas exports must not be broken.The mandate of Operation Sophia, the European Union\u2019s anti-smuggling mission, was recently extended for another year. Currently focused on the smuggling of people and arms in Libyan waters, the mission should be expanded to also cover oil smuggling and liaise with the N.O.C. to interdict rogue tankers.The N.O.C.\u2019s board, which comprises technocrats appointed by recognized governments soon after the 2011 revolution, should be insulated from arbitrary changes. Its investment and maintenance budgets must be guaranteed. It should be granted the power to negotiate new foreign investments so that it can reach its revenue goals and help stimulate the domestic economy.The N.O.C. expects that very soon oil production will reach one million barrels per day for the first time since 2013. With this milestone, we have the opportunity to build up our financial reserves and restart the economy, including by using oil-sector investment to help develop local industry.Ring-fencing Libya\u2019s oil sector from local and international rivalries would have an enormous impact on the country\u2019s prospects, both economic and political. It would de-escalate the current internal conflict. It would unlock the potential of oil as a driver of national regeneration. It would, in short, allow the country\u2019s resources to be put to work for their rightful beneficiaries: the people of Libya.Mustafa Sanalla is the chairman of the Libyan National Oil Corporation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For G.E.\u2019s John Flannery, It Was a 30-Year Trip to the Top", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe is the quintessential company man.Mr. Flannery, 55, will also be counted on to revive the company\u2019s languishing stock price. Under Mr. Immelt\u2019s leadership, shares of G.E. fared poorly, drawing the ire of investors and the involvement of an activist hedge fund that hastened the succession planning that led to Mr. Flannery\u2019s appointment.Already, Wall Street is betting that Mr. Flannery has what it takes. G.E. shares were up more than 3 percent on Monday. And analysts spoke approvingly of his behind-the-scenes maneuvering in various G.E. deals \u2014 particularly the $13.5 billion agreement two years ago to take over the power business of the French giant Alstom and the spinoff that year of G.E.\u2019s consumer finance arm, Synchrony Financial.That Mr. Flannery is not afraid to divest assets has some analysts betting that he could reach back into that toolbox to further simplify G.E.\u2019s sprawling business.Any major divestitures will probably take time. Mr. Flannery said in a video broadcast on Facebook that he planned to conduct a review of the company with a \u201csense of urgency\u201d and that he would make recommendations later in the year.Mr. Flannery said he was going to \u201creview all aspects of the business,\u201d with a particular focus on the cost structure. For the next few months, he will be traveling the globe, visiting businesses, customers and investors. Asked whether those decisions would be about the portfolio or the financial outlook, he said, \u201cI think you should expect both.\u201dMr. Flannery lands in the hot seat at a pivotal moment for G.E., a 125-year-old company with $120 billion in annual sales.Major shifts in geopolitical tides have resulted in bumpy currency fluctuations for the multinational conglomerate. And while Mr. Immelt, who is retiring as G.E.\u2019s chief on Aug. 1, praised President Trump\u2019s policies on deregulation and tax reform, he criticized his nationalistic trade policies, publicly supporting Mexico and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump wants to renegotiate.In an interview, Mr. Flannery said he had had \u201cno interaction with President Trump,\u201d adding that the administration\u2019s proposals to cut taxes and spend on infrastructure represented an \u201cagenda\u201d that G.E. supported.But Mr. Flannery suggested that he would try to steer clear of politics as he conducted his review of the company.A keen wine collector who often grills for guests at his Nantucket home, Mr. Flannery, who is married and has three children, is an avid reader and enjoys attending R.E.M. and Natalie Merchant concerts. He named the family\u2019s new puppy, a 12-week-old black Labrador, after Boston Red Sox outfielder Mookie Betts.Analysts said that in the last few months, it had become clear that Mr. Flannery had landed on the shortlist of chief executive candidates. Various institutional investors who visited General Electric\u2019s headquarters in Boston were increasingly meeting with Mr. Flannery.In the fall of 1987, Mr. Flannery, fresh from graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, arrived at General Electric\u2019s finance arm, GE Capital. Just a few weeks later came Black Monday and the stock market crash.The son of a former director for bank supervision for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Mr. Flannery worked with a group that assessed risks in providing financing for the booming arena of leveraged buyout deals. In the wake of the market crash, as banks steered clear of the risky deals, GE Capital moved in.Besides providing funding for early cable and wireless deals, Mr. Flannery\u2019s team was involved in G.E.\u2019s funding the 1987 leveraged buyout of the magazine publisher Edgell Communications. G.E. took a hit a few years later when that company, suffering from a steep decline in sales and overburdened by a heavy debt load, filed for bankruptcy.But Mr. Flannery\u2019s star was already on the rise. After tours in Latin America, Asia and India, Mr. Flannery returned to corporate headquarters to run mergers and acquisitions in 2013.There, under the direction of Mr. Immelt to transform the company and shed various businesses, Mr. Flannery negotiated the Alstom deal in France and also spun off Synchrony and sold off G.E.\u2019s refrigerator business.In 2014, Mr. Flannery stepped in to run the company\u2019s health care business, which is a leader in imaging and diagnostic equipment. Many analysts and investors expected the unit to be sold or spun off, but Mr. Flannery instead expanded it, pushing into life sciences and cell therapy systems businesses.Still, Mr. Flannery may face new pressure to evaluate businesses to divest. And one early target, some analysts say, could be the health care division he has been leading.\u201cWhat has always struck me about his background is that he ran G.E.\u2019s business development \u2014 that is G.E. shorthand for mergers and acquisitions,\u201d said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cSo when he was running health care \u2014 a guy who wasn\u2019t a health care guy but an M&A guy \u2014 one could draw the conclusion that he was preparing it for some sort of action that would maximize shareholder value.\u201dThe health care division is still very much a part of G.E. But analysts say that with pressure coming from investors \u2014 including the activist hedge fund Trian Partners, led by the billionaire Nelson Peltz \u2014 health care could once again be a target for a sale or a spinoff sooner rather than later.\u201cHealth care is not a shining star of G.E.,\u201d said Paul Keckley, an independent health care industry analyst. \u201cIt has been a staple, but aviation is what is driving the company\u2019s earnings more these days.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe question is going to be how quickly institutional investors have him answer the question of break up the business or keep it together.\u201dMr. Flannery on Monday played down the idea that he was simply an unsentimental deal maker.When he took over the health care business, he said, the expectation was that this \u201cbean-counter guy is here, and we\u2019re for sale.\u201d Instead, he made a top-to-bottom review of the business, streamlining it in places but investing in others.\u201cThere was a preconception\u201d about me, he said. \u201cBut the reality was the opposite.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ketumile Masire, Who Shaped and Led a Vibrant Botswana, Dies at 91", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKetumile Masire, who as president of Botswana for nearly two decades helped transform his arid and destitute country into the envy of other African nations, died on June 22 in Gaborone, the capital city. He was 91.His death, at a hospital where he had been taken for surgery on June 16, was announced in a statement by his family.Mr. Masire (pronounced ma-SEE-ray) was an architect of Botswana\u2019s government after the southern African country gained independence from Britain in 1966, working alongside Seretse Khama, the country\u2019s first president. Mr. Masire succeeded Mr. Khama, who died of cancer in 1980, and he was elected in 1984, 1989 and 1994, serving until 1998.At the time of its independence, Botswana was listed by the United Nations as one of the world\u2019s least developed nations, with little running water or electricity, few paved roads and no public high schools. Beef was virtually the only export.The geographical challenges were great, too; in the landlocked country, largely made up of desert sand, farming was virtually impossible.\u201cWhen we asked for independence, people thought we were either very brave or very foolish,\u201d Mr. Masire was often quoted as saying.They got to work. Mr. Masire and Mr. Khama formed the Botswana Democratic Party, and Mr. Masire became the first minister of finance and the first vice president.About a year after Botswana became independent, the De Beers company made a mining discovery on the eastern edge of the Kalahari Desert that gave the country the glittering hope it needed: diamonds.But Mr. Masire and Mr. Khama saw to it that De Beers did not simply plunder Botswana\u2019s resources, as many big companies had historically done in Africa. Instead, De Beers entered into a 50-50 joint venture with the government.Today, diamonds are as synonymous with Botswana as cigars are with Cuba, accounting for more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s exports.Mr. Masire and Mr. Khama leveraged the newfound wealth to add schools, improve health care, build infrastructure and modernize farming. The development helped Botswana maintain stability through droughts and a slump in diamond prices in the 1980s. Tourism began to flourish, especially wildlife tourism.\u201cIt\u2019s a simple country, but he was not ashamed of that,\u201d she said.Botswana achieved the highest annual economic growth rate in the world and reached middle-income status among nations globally. As surrounding countries struggled with violence and corruption, Botswana became a model, often referred to as \u201cthe African exception.\u201dBut not everything was rosy. One delicate challenge for Mr. Masire was opposing apartheid in neighboring South Africa even while depending on the country economically. When South African guerrillas from the African National Congress set up a base in his country, he looked the other way. But in 1985, after South African forces raided Gaborone, destroying buildings and killing civilians, Mr. Masire was forced to eject the A.N.C.Another challenge in the 1980s was the rapid spread of the virus that causes AIDS. Though the government provided free treatment, Botswana continues to have one of the highest rates of H.I.V. in the world.Inequality between the rich and the poor also remained vast, despite Mr. Masire\u2019s efforts to close the gap by providing access to education, giving Botswana one of the highest literacy rates in Africa.Abdi Samatar, author of \u201cAn African Miracle,\u201d (1999) a book about the development of Botswana, said in a phone interview that Mr. Masire had been unusual among leaders for his humility and his recognition of his country\u2019s shortcomings.\u201cHe was a man who carried a big brain but who spoke softly and walked softly,\u201d Mr. Samatar said. \u201cHe was a different kind of politician than I have seen anywhere else in the world.\u201dQuett Ketumile Joni Masire was born in Kanye, Botswana, on July 23, 1925, to Joni Masire, a farmer, and the former Gabaione Kgopo. He spent his childhood as a herd boy but excelled in academics, winning a scholarship to the Tiger Kloof secondary school in South Africa.In 1946, after both his parents had died, he earned a teaching certificate and worked at the Kanye Junior Secondary School to support his younger siblings. When he saved enough money, he bought a tractor and taught himself dry farming.In 1958, he married Gladys Olebile Molefi, who died in 2013. They had six children, who survive him, as do 10 grandchildren and four siblings. Mr. Masire was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991.Mr. Masire was working as a journalist for the Naledi ya Batswana and African Echo newspapers when he first met Mr. Khama at a community meeting. The two had a symbiotic relationship: Mr. Khama had the vision for a democratic post-colonial Botswana, and Mr. Masire had the enthusiasm and community ties to rally support.Long after he stepped down as Botswana\u2019s president in 1998 \u2014 there were no term limits at the time, but Mr. Masire helped establish them \u2014 Mr. Masire was often asked how the rest of Africa could be more like Botswana. He would answer, softly, with thoughtful pauses, that the keys to success were government transparency, a resistance to corruption and a willingness to follow the rule of law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Helmut Kohl Taught Bill Clinton", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPolitics can be a cruel contact sport. Nobody knew that better than Helmut Kohl, the longtime German chancellor and the father of German reunification who died on Friday.He governed his own conservative party at times like a fief and relentlessly went after possible challengers within his own party. Like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, he towered over and defined his country\u2019s place in the world, and alongside them he defined the center-right consensus that drove Western foreign policy at the end of the Cold War.Unlike Mrs. Thatcher or Mr. Reagan, however, Mr. Kohl had an ignominious end to his career, perhaps the steepest fall from grace in German postwar politics, when his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and now chancellor, Angela Merkel, pushed him from power over a scandal involving illicit campaign financing. At one moment he was the hero behind German reunification; the next he was seen as an embarrassment within his own party, increasingly lonely and isolated.But recent history has been kind to Mr. Kohl, if only by showing the contrast between the sort of international statesmanship he stood for and what passes as leadership today. He was, above all, a staunch supporter of NATO and the West, and kept his course even at times when some Western policies weren\u2019t very popular in Germany.When Mr. Kohl became chancellor in 1982, he faced huge protests against the stationing of nuclear-capable Pershing II missiles on German soil, in response to a Soviet buildup of Warsaw Pact forces. But he had given Germany\u2019s word to its NATO allies to allow the missiles, and he didn\u2019t budge. Though it made him unpopular and put his country at risk, there was a bigger issue at hand: whether the West would stand up to the Soviet threat.At a moment when the West is in exceptional disarray, there are some important lessons to be learned from Mr. Kohl. For one, the West is doomed when it starts giving in to Russian intimidation. A second: To keep and nourish an alliance, you sometimes have to do things that are good for all partners but don\u2019t play well domestically. And finally, trust among allies is perhaps the most precious commodity of all, which you play with to everyone\u2019s peril.Chancellor Kohl knew that alliances are not measured by annual balance sheets; they pay off over a longer term. His stance on the Pershings earned the trust of his American counterparts, a credit he could draw on in 1989 when the peoples of Eastern Europe, including in East Germany, were in revolt against Soviet domination and homegrown dictators. Mr. Kohl dreamed of something few people in the West thought possible: German reunification, anchored squarely in the West.Other nations in Europe were afraid of the overwhelming power a reunified Germany could muster within Europe, and did what they could to oppose reunification. But Mr. Kohl knew he could rely on the United States for support, and President George H. W. Bush duly threw his support behind the German leader. It wasn\u2019t because Mr. Bush thought he owed Mr. Kohl something; it was because Mr. Kohl had earned Washington\u2019s trust.Chancellor Kohl understood something else, too, that today\u2019s nationalist foreign policy makers ignore: International politics is not a zero-sum game. That\u2019s why he fought hard to make sure Germany\u2019s victory at the end of the Cold War did not come at someone else\u2019s expense. In a time of Russian revanchism, it is crucial to remember how many billions of dollars Germany and Europe invested in Russia to stabilize a failing country.It was a lesson Mr. Kohl taught other Western leaders. In 2011, Bill Clinton recalled a conversation with his aides in the early 1990s. \u201cSo one of my young aides showed me a poll that said, \u2018Mr. President, the American people are against your proposal to help Russia 74 to 20.\u2019 \u201d But Mr. Clinton, like Mr. Kohl, knew that a stable Russia made everyone safer. \u201cWe got hired to do the right thing here,\u201d he told the aide. \u201cLook at what Germany\u2019s doing; let\u2019s do that.\u201dNor did Chancellor Kohl push Germany\u2019s interests at his Western neighbors\u2019 expense. He did the opposite. To demonstrate the continuing German commitment to a common Europe, he agreed to give up the most cherished symbol of Germany\u2019s postwar economic success, the mark. Whatever flaws are now obvious in Europe\u2019s common currency, Mr. Kohl\u2019s intentions in supporting it were noble ones. He wanted to anchor the new Germany firmly inside the European project. Being a part of the generation that had experienced the devastation of World War II, he was passionate about creating a Europe whole, free and at peace. That\u2019s why he also helped to prepare the path for Eastern European countries to become part of the European Union and NATO.In 2008, Mr. Kohl fell down a staircase, leaving him with difficulty speaking and forcing him to largely withdraw from public life. Still, during the euro crisis he urged his countrymen to be more forgiving toward their European brothers and sisters in distress, because he more than anyone knew how much Germany had relied on the help of others during its own trials.At times like these, when petty nationalisms threaten the global liberal order and the coherence of the West, it is important to remember that the comparatively peaceful Western order didn\u2019t come about by accident. It took the effort of many brilliant and decisive statesmen and stateswomen. By that same token, the Western order can be squandered by the ineptitude of today\u2019s leaders, and by a politics that looks only to the next election to decide even the most momentous policies. It is something Mr. Kohl understood, and something we cannot forget.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Censors Have New Target: Celebrity News", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Whether read openly and voraciously or behind closed doors, celebrity gossip plays an integral role in the entertainment world, connecting stars and the big businesses that back them to an audience eager for the juiciest of details.But to some officials in China, the bloggers that report those tidbits play another role: a threat to public order.At a meeting on Wednesday with representatives from China\u2019s leading internet companies, officials from the Beijing bureau of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top online regulator, called on the companies to \u201cactively promote socialist core values\u201d and create a \u201chealthy, uplifting environment for mainstream opinion\u201d by combating vulgar and sensationalist coverage of celebrity scandals and lifestyles.Many of the closed blogs and accounts were making a tidy profit from advertising revenue, and some recently turned to venture capital investors as a route to growth. Zhuo Wei, known as China\u2019s No. 1 paparazzo, had more than seven million followers for his coverage of celebrities like the singer Faye Wong and the Chinese actress Bai Baihe. He could not immediately be reached for comment.At least one of the closed accounts was affiliated with a global brand. The entertainment-related WeChat account of the fashion magazine Harper\u2019s Bazaar was shut down, although its account on Weibo, another social-media service, and its general WeChat account appeared to have survived. A spokesman for Harper\u2019s Bazaar could not immediately be reached for comment.The closings prompted a swift outcry from China\u2019s media circles. While the local news industry has long been subjected to strict government censorship on politics and other topics deemed to be delicate, entertainment news has typically been viewed as safe.\u201cIn China, there were only two areas before that we could say had news freedom: One was entertainment, and the other was sports,\u201d said Gao Ming, host of the podcast Radio HiLight and a former editor at AsiaContent.com, an online entertainment news company. \u201cBut now I think the government is trying to send a message that all the news needs to be within its control.\u201dUsing a Chinese phrase that means to make an example of someone or something, Mr. Gao added, \u201cThey\u2019re killing the chicken to scare the monkeys.\u201dOf particular concern for many fans and industry watchers was the shutdown of popular entertainment-related accounts that were not in the business of trading celebrity gossip. One of these was the WeChat public account of the popular movie-review blog Dushe Dianying, which still had more than 4.8 million followers on Weibo. In July, the Chinese news media reported that Dushe Dianying was valued at about $44 million, after completing an early round of financing.\u201cGenerally, China\u2019s leaders have been obsessed with the containment of negative coverage, and under Xi Jinping we\u2019ve seen a rather dramatic decline in serious coverage by China\u2019s media,\u201d David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong, said in emailed comments, referring to the Chinese president. \u201cWhat we\u2019re now seeing is a war on the nonserious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no longer enough for media content to avoid the negative,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cIt must be adequately positive.\u201d\u201cThese regulations could have quite a dramatic impact on the ecosystem of public accounts on WeChat, and on the broader online space,\u201d Mr. Bandurski said. \u201cThis is something we must watch closely.\u201dSome of the affected accounts have already begun to regroup. By Thursday morning, Go Ying Studio, known for celebrity photographs and gossip, had created a new account and posted an official apology. \u201cFor us, this was a very profound lesson,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe wholeheartedly accept the criticism and help given to us by different corners of society, and from now on, we will make sure to strengthen our own thinking and moral education.\u201dBut the future of many of the accounts remains uncertain \u2014 a cause for concern among the bloggers\u2019 millions of fans.\u201cTo me, it has become a habit to read some of these accounts every evening to relax,\u201d lamented one reader, Luna, in a comment on a Chinese-language article about the deleted accounts. \u201cPeople need these kinds of positive entertainment news. I am so sad.\u201dKaroline Kan contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The False Premise Behind G.O.P. Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWith the Senate effort to upend Obamacare suspended for the Fourth of July holiday, there\u2019s a chance to step back and examine the assumptions behind Republicans\u2019 longstanding objections to the social safety net \u2014 as well as the flaws in those assumptions.From Ronald Reagan\u2019s invocation of a \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d to Mitt Romney\u2019s derision of \u201ctakers,\u201d to the House and Senate bills to cut taxes for the rich by taking health insurance away from tens of millions of people, the premise of incessant Republican tax cutting is that the system robs the rich to lavish benefits on the poor.But here is an essential and overlooked truth: As a share of the economy, federal spending on low-income people, other than for their health care, has been falling steadily since it peaked in 2011, after the Great Recession, and while it\u2019s still slightly above the long-term average, it is declining, according to a recent series of reports by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Spending has risen for Medicaid, which the Senate and House health care bills would slash. But the increase is not the result of generosity or waste. Much of it is from rising nursing home admissions as the population ages. Medicaid insures most nursing home residents \u2014 after they have exhausted their savings.Medical inflation, which usually rises faster than the general inflation rate, also pushes up Medicaid costs. But Medicaid is not driving that inflation. In fact, compared with privately insured care, Medicaid\u2019s costs have risen more slowly over the past decade and its costs per beneficiary are lower, partly because it has no profit margin.By using Medicaid to cover millions of previously uninsured people, Obamacare chose the most economical and efficient part of the health care system to achieve a historic reduction in the number of uninsured. And by using tax increases on the well-to-do to pay for expanded coverage, the expansion did not add to budget deficits.In the next decade, higher spending on low-income health programs is expected to be offset by lower spending on other low-income programs. So total federal spending on people struggling to get by is projected to hold steady.That is not lavish. And it is not an excuse for tax cuts that deprive tens of millions of people of health insurance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With 843 Acres Buffed, Central Park Leader Will Step Down", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGazing at the Great Hill, an emerald lawn flecked with boulders at the park\u2019s north end, Mr. Blonsky, 58, remembered what it was like trekking there to discuss its restoration.\u201cThere were mattresses all over the place for prostitution and drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we would be sitting here trying to do this work, and everybody would just be staring at you. Now, it\u2019s baby carriages and dogs and picnics.\u201dAs Mr. Blonsky announces his retirement on Tuesday from the conservancy, a nonprofit group founded 37 years ago to rescue Central Park from decades of neglect, his imprint on the park\u2019s landscape is everywhere.The conservancy, which has 360 employees, has methodically renovated every lawn and meadow \u2014 once mere dust bowls \u2014 and cleaned up water bodies from Turtle Pond to the Harlem Meer. It has refurbished historic buildings that were scarred with grafitti, like Belvedere Castle and the Dairy, as well as dozens of bridges, arches and fountains. It has renovated all 21 playgrounds \u2014 twice.Over more than three decades, Mr. Blonsky helped the park become maybe even more pristine than it was when Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux began creating it out of farmland 160 years ago.The group, which manages the park for New York City, has logged nearly all of the 19,500 trees into a database, along with their pruning history, and instituted a novel trash management and recycling program. By moving toward a \u201ccarry-in, carry-out\u201d policy in areas like the North Woods, the conservancy has suppressed the rat population, enabling chipmunks to return.Mr. Blonsky also introduced innovative practices, including a zone management system. He identified 49 zones in Central Park based on topography and use and appointed a dedicated gardener or manager to each.\u201cIf a garbage can is overflowing, you know who to talk to,\u201d explained Mr. Blonsky, who is also the Central Park administrator for the city\u2019s Parks Department. \u201cI like to say that every garbage can really should have someone\u2019s name on it.\u201dAdrian Benepe, who was the city\u2019s parks commissioner for 10 years before he stepped down in 2012, said Mr. Blonsky had an encyclopedic understanding of the park. \u201cHe has an intimate physical relationship with Central Park and an emotional one, too,\u201d said Mr. Benepe, who is now a senior vice president at the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit organization. \u201cHe fell under the magical sway of the park and took it very personally.\u201dAs the park improved, visitation ballooned. But despite millions of additional users, crime has plummeted.In the early 1980s, visits to Central Park totaled about 12 million annually, and about 1,000 crimes were logged each year. Today, visitation is over 42 million annually, and crimes are down to fewer than 100 a year.Mr. Blonsky, who studied landscape architecture and horticulture, said he was ready to turn over the conservancy\u2019s reins to someone new, but he plans to stay in his current position for at least another year while the search for his successor takes place. He will then assume an advisory role.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real momentum for somebody else.\u201dThe park has been an all-consuming passion for Mr. Blonsky, who in the early years worked \u201c24 hours, seven days a week,\u201d as myriad problems competed for his attention. His spouse, Mai, whom he met in the park when she worked as a landscape architect for the Parks Department, used to joke that Central Park was his second wife. He wears his trademark Central Park baseball cap wherever he goes.With his soft-spoken manner and fair complexion, Mr. Blonsky would seem more at home in a university library than amid the woodlands and outcroppings of the park. So it is fitting that he discusses the park and its original architects with the reverence and knowledge of a scholar.\u201cThis is one of the most important pieces of American art there is,\u201d Mr. Blonsky said. \u201cOne of the unintended consequences of the conservancy\u2019s doing such a great job was bringing back Olmsted and Vaux. When the park falls into such disrepair, you lose who they are. But this is a way of celebrating their lives.\u201dMr. Blonsky\u2019s success has not come without criticism. His salary, now topping $700,000, has raised eyebrows. Some park advocates and elected officials have blamed the conservancy model for disparities in the park system, where a handful of well-endowed parks with wealthy neighbors, like the High Line and Central Park, are exquisitely tended, while hundreds of others look tired by comparison.\u201cAll this was silted up, and you couldn\u2019t see anywhere,\u201d said Mr. Blonsky, pointing to the refurbished shoreline with the pride of a general contractor.As someone who is paid to walk through Central Park, usually twice a day, Mr. Blonsky insists there is not a particular spot he will miss when he is no longer on the job. Rather, he will miss a season. \u201cMy favorite time is the dead of winter, particularly at night when it\u2019s quiet and you can see the lights through the park,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cYou get a sense of the undulation. And you feel like you own it a little bit, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Decline of the Baronial C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-06-17", "News": "Corporate giants once had all-powerful chiefs with domains to match. But activist investors and technological change are remaking the executive suite.Supported byFAIRFIELD, Conn. \u2014 They bestrode the business world, or at least the suburban corporate campus, like a colossus.Sitting behind burnished wooden desks, in glass-walled corner offices like the one Jeffrey R. Immelt occupied at General Electric\u2019s former headquarters here, a select group of American chief executives were once more akin to statesmen than businessmen.G.E. moved out of this sprawling Skidmore, Owings & Merrill-designed emblem of 1970s corporate modernism in favor of smaller, humbler digs in downtown Boston last year. And last week, Mr. Immelt unexpectedly announced plans to retire after 16 years in the top job, amid a sagging stock price and pressure from activist investors.General Electric is just the latest storied name in corporate America to show its leader the door. Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, had been in the job for less than three years when he was fired in late May. Two weeks earlier, Mario Longhi of U.S. Steel abruptly stepped down.With these departures, the American era of the baronial chief executive, sitting atop an industrial dominion with all the attendant privileges, is drawing to a close.It is one consequence of a transformed economic landscape in which many of the mega-corporations that defined 20th-century commercial life are confronting a host of new business and technological challenges. These changes \u2014 in corporate leadership, on boards and across Wall Street \u2014 are recasting the very idea of industry in America.\u201cThe C.E.O. with a big office, a tenure of 10 or 20 years, in a suit and tie, is becoming a thing of the past,\u201d said Vijay Govindarajan, who served as G.E.\u2019s chief innovation consultant in 2008 and 2009 and now teaches at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business.Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit from G.E. is particularly telling, given the company\u2019s reputation as a training ground for the future chief executives of other companies. He tried to change G.E., yet couldn\u2019t react quickly enough to the forces affecting companies like his.These include the rising power of activist investors, who buy up stakes in companies and then demand changes. Activists are now hunting much bigger game, demanding double-digit annual earnings growth in a stagnant economy. Or else.That deal also shows how the digital age has upended the competitive landscape, pitting companies in vastly different industries against one another.\u201cWho ever thought Ford would be competing with Google?\u201d said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who has studied corporate leadership for decades. \u201cBut they are, and Mark Fields wasn\u2019t moving fast enough.\u201dBoards, too, have changed, evolving from country-club-like collections of the same familiar faces into a much more diverse and demanding constituency.To be sure, the money is better than ever. And pockets of unbridled ambition and occasional excess remain, especially in Silicon Valley, where Apple\u2019s new $5 billion spaceshiplike headquarters opened in April.But for most of the Fortune 500, the unquestioned power and perks, the imperviousness to criticism from the likes of shareholders, and the outsize public profile that once automatically came with the corner office have gone the way of the typewriter and the Dictaphone.\u201cThese people were bigger than life, and I saw it up close,\u201d said Kevin Sharer, a former chief executive of Amgen who worked as a top aide to Mr. Immelt\u2019s legendary predecessor at G.E., Jack Welch. \u201cThey were a combination of chief executive, statesman and rock star. They were unassailable.\u201dA Naval Academy graduate, then an officer, before joining G.E. in 1984, Mr. Sharer said the only place that evoked a feeling of power comparable to the long hallways and corner offices of Fairfield in its prime was aboard the fast attack nuclear submarines where he once served as chief engineer.\u201cWe had the confidence, the swagger, and we felt like we had unlimited industrial potential,\u201d he said. \u201cCould we buy RCA or NBC? Of course we could. I\u2019m not complaining, but this is absolutely not the case today.\u201dAs Amgen\u2019s chief executive in the spring of 2009, Mr. Sharer visited the White House repeatedly to meet with Obama administration officials as they designed what would become the Affordable Care Act. He also played a key role in getting fellow pharmaceutical industry chiefs to support the legislation.Now retired and teaching at Harvard Business School, Mr. Sharer said he would never do that today, as wading into bitterly partisan public debates offers little upside for corporate leaders, and risks damage to their company\u2019s reputation.As a result, while companies in many ways have more economic and political power than ever, \u201cchief executives now shy away from weighing in on the policy level or broader societal issues,\u201d Mr. Sharer said. \u201cThey\u2019re more focused on running their companies.\u201dThere are exceptions. Besides Mr. Immelt\u2019s outspokenness on the climate issue, last year Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck called out \u201cbad actors\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry for exorbitant price increases. Timothy D. Cook of Apple challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed immigration restrictions in January.Still, Mr. Immelt\u2019s exit leaves a void at the intersection of business and public policy, along with the retirement this year of Douglas R. Oberhelman, the Caterpillar chief who led both the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers.\u201cIf you start fooling around in Washington with the Business Roundtable or writing op-eds, activist investors will ask what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Useem said.\u201cI don\u2019t see him stepping into that role,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep his head down and focus on the numbers.\u201dAt Exxon Mobil, it\u2019s referred to as the God Pod. On the 11th floor of Procter & Gamble\u2019s headquarters in Cincinnati, there was Mahogany Row. And while the official name of the executive wing at G.E.\u2019s Fairfield headquarters was E3, inside the company it was known as Carpet Land.And no wonder. From the Persian rugs that lined the hallways to the plush wool floor covering in Mr. Immelt\u2019s office and private conference room, the carpets created the hushed atmosphere of a monastery or library.\u201cIt was so quiet, you could feel the energy drain out of you,\u201d said Ann Klee, the G.E. executive who oversaw the move to Boston and the development of its new headquarters there.What these executive aeries all shared was an Olympus-like sense of remoteness, authority and defined hierarchy.At G.E., even in Carpet Land, office size grew in lock step with rank, and the biggest corner space was reserved for the chief executive. Not only did Mr. Immelt have his own bathroom, but his two administrative assistants had a private bathroom and a pantry.The abundant perks \u2014 in G.E.\u2019s case, two helicopter pads, a shoeshine station and an executive dining room linked to the kitchen below by dumbwaiters \u2014 fed the sense of exalted status. At the same time, faster economic growth and rising earnings camouflaged the cost of these indulgences.With G.E.\u2019s profits and shares soaring in the 1980s, Mr. Welch oversaw the construction of a private 28-room hotel known as the Guest House to serve visiting executives and others, with no expense spared on the parquet floors, wood-burning fireplaces and a Steinway piano, which was left behind when the company moved out.\u201cNothing was off-the-shelf,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Brien, a 19-year G.E. veteran who helped supervise the Fairfield facility. \u201cWith Jack Welch, everything was custom and the operation was five star, spot on.\u201dAlmost 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001 and Mr. Immelt took over, G.E. shares have never regained their 2000 peak. So while Mr. Immelt successfully steered the company through a near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis, refocused it on its industrial roots and shed its ancillary businesses, it became a natural target for activist investors.One of those was Nelson Peltz, a onetime corporate raider who relied on Michael R. Milken\u2019s junk bonds for financing back when Mr. Welch was building his Guest House. Mr. Peltz has come a long way since then, having scored big wins forcing laggards like Heinz and Wendy\u2019s to improve their performance, and he acquired a $2 billion stake in G.E. in 2015.G.E.\u2019s chief communications officer, Deirdre Latour, denied that activist pressure was a factor in Mr. Immelt\u2019s decision to retire. \u201cSixteen years is a long time,\u201d she said.But at 61, Mr. Immelt is four years younger than Mr. Welch when he stepped down, and joins a long list of otherwise respected executives whose stately succession plans were seemingly interrupted by impatient investors.\u201cC.E.O. tenure is down from the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, and the G.E. situation is a reflection of that,\u201d said Jason D. Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201cWithout this outside pressure, it\u2019s likely Jeff Immelt would have served out his term and retired at 64 or 65.\u201dNow other chief executives are feeling the same pressure, including Mary T. Barra of General Motors. \u201cShe\u2019s being pulled in different directions,\u201d Mr. Schloetzer said, noting that G.M.\u2019s shares have barely budged in the last two years, even as the broader stock market has soared.If Ms. Barra can\u2019t turn things around in 12 to 18 months, Mr. Schloetzer said, she could share a fate similar to that of Mr. Fields at Ford.Indeed, Mr. Fields\u2019s defenestration was more shocking in many ways than Mr. Immelt\u2019s slow-motion fade, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management.\u201cHe\u2019s the poster child for what\u2019s happened to the C.E.O. job,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cUntil last month, people thought dynastic family capital like the Ford family was the solution to rampant short-termism. I\u2019m sorry Ford forgot that recipe.\u201dHow did activist investors acquire such outsize power over publicly traded companies?\u201cWith fewer public companies out there, any one of them is more likely to become a target of interest for one hedge fund or another,\u201d Mr. Slaughter said.At the same time, activists are getting more, well, active. More than 300 American companies were targeted by these investors in 2015, up from just over 100 in 2010, according to Mr. Useem of Wharton. They\u2019re also becoming more successful at winning board seats, as fewer companies stagger their board elections over three-year cycles.What\u2019s more, chief executives have less internal latitude. In 2001, more than half of new C.E.O.s also assumed the position of chairman when they took over. By 2016, only 10 percent occupied both roles, according to an analysis by Strategy&, the strategy and consulting arm of PwC.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the C.E.O. running the board too,\u201d said Gary L. Neilson, a principal with Strategy&. \u201cNow the C.E.O. has a boss.\u201dBoards themselves have changed, Mr. Sonnenfeld added. A few decades ago, a Pittsburgh-based giant like U.S. Steel would draw board members from a local pool of business and community leaders.\u201cThere was a downside in terms of cronyism, mutual back-scratching and a hesitance to criticize,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positive was that they were anchored in their communities and they invested in them. Now, for C.E.O.s, all the constituencies have changed.\u201dSo while boards are still willing to dole out huge golden parachutes to C.E.O.\u2019s, even if they fail, they\u2019ve become much more generous with money than they are with additional time.The glaring exception to the trends outlined by Mr. Sonnenfeld is in the technology sector. But in many ways, these firms are the exception that proves the rule, because they play by different rules.Facebook also has a multi-class stock structure that effectively guarantees that the founder Mark Zuckerberg will retain control even as he sells shares. And on this point, the company offers no apologies.The staggering profitability of the tech giants provides their leaders with more than a little of the swagger the industrial executives once possessed.In 1990, the revenues of Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers totaled $250 billion while they employed 1.2 million people, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.Silicon Valley\u2019s top three companies in 2014 had almost the same revenues before adjusting for inflation \u2014 $247 billion \u2014 but with 137,000 employees, they required a work force just one-tenth the size.That kind of efficiency adds up to huge profits, soaring stock prices and few complaints from investors. Or as Brooks C. Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown, put it, \u201cIf your stock is doing well, your job is safe.\u201dIf the old quarters for G.E.\u2019s top brass were akin to a pedestal, the new ones are more like a fishbowl. At G.E.\u2019s interim headquarters in Boston, and in the permanent one set to open next year, the offices for top leaders have glass walls that enable them to see out and, in turn, let employees see in.They are also much smaller. In Fairfield, a handful of senior G.E. leaders and their assistants occupied 44,000 square feet in the executive wing. Now the same group shares a total of just 7,800 square feet, less space than in the big mansions many C.E.O.s inhabit in places like Greenwich, Conn., or the Bay Area.\u201cIt has a much more collaborative feel, and the glass replicates the transparency of working together,\u201d said Ms. Klee, the G.E. executive. \u201cThe Fairfield campus was beautiful, but it lacked the spark you feel here. It\u2019s a different time, and we like the power and energy and creativity that comes from mixing people together.\u201dG.E.\u2019s 66-acre Fairfield campus was purchased for $31.5 million last fall by Sacred Heart University, according to Michael J. Kinney, the school\u2019s senior vice president for finance and administration.\u201cThere\u2019s not as big a need for corporate headquarters like this any more,\u201d said Mr. Kinney, who as a Kraft executive once worked in a similarly spectacular setting in the Taj Mahal-like General Foods building in Rye Brook, N.Y. \u201cThose were the days.\u201dMr. Kinney has big plans to convert the old offices into classrooms, a business incubator space and a computer engineering center, among other things. Students will be trained in hospitality at the former Guest House.As a result, the university has kept the campus in pristine condition since the last G.E. executives left. \u201cThe only things missing are the Persian rugs and the artwork,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who now serves as Sacred Heart\u2019s director of facilities.\u201cIt\u2019s such a different vibe with the kids all here,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, who added that he\u2019s still getting used to people strolling around the manicured grounds rather than quietly shuttling between hushed offices.Walking around the pub in the Guest House Mr. Welch built, Mr. O\u2019Brien confessed to a little nostalgia for G.E.\u2019s glory days in Fairfield. \u201cCan\u2019t you see just see Jack running the world from here in \u201987 or \u201988?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "World Offers Cautionary Tale for Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Plan", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn India, politically connected firms have captured contracts on the strength of relationships with officialdom, yielding defective engineering at bloated prices. When Britain handed control to private companies to upgrade London\u2019s subway system more than a decade ago, the result was substandard, budget-busting work, prompting the government to step back in. Canada has suffered a string of excessive costs on public projects funneled through the private sector, like a landmark bridge in Vancouver and hospitals in Ontario.By contrast, China has engineered one of the most effective economic transformations in modern history in part through relentless investment in infrastructure, traditionally financed and overseen by an unabashedly powerful state. China illustrates both the benefits and perils of state domination. It has constructed projects strategically, as part of a highly successful effort to catalyze economic growth. Yet the state has wielded authoritarian powers, generating waste and corruption.Many economists warn of a classic mismatch of incentives. Governments may have good reason to invest in projects that yield no profit, building roads to nowhere that ultimately open up undeveloped land for job-generating commerce. Government alone has the incentive to upgrade shoddy wastewater treatment and supply systems for drinking water. Absent public guarantees for profits, private companies have no inducement to bring such works into creation.\u201cPrivate investors need to have a decent rate of return,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia for Oxford Economics, based in Hong Kong. \u201cThey cannot wait 40 years, and they are simply not able to take into account the additional tax revenues for the government.\u201dIndia\u2019s heavy reliance on so-called public-private partnerships \u2014 the mechanism Mr. Trump has in mind \u2014 comes not from some ideological predisposition toward private enterprise, but from the fact that its government is short of financing. Like most countries, India cannot borrow as cheaply as the United States, which attracts virtually unlimited flows of investment by dint of the dollar serving as the global reserve currency.India has expanded its highway network with private companies collecting tolls. Power stations have been erected, though often at costs far in excess of initial bids. Banks, many operated by the state, have been left with piles of bad debts as developers have failed to recoup enough to pay their loans.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t worked out,\u201d said Pranab Bardhan, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of \u201cAwakening Giants, Feet of Clay: Assessing the Economic Rise of China and India.\u201d \u201cMany of the infrastructure projects in India are now stalled.\u201dIn 2008, the Indian highway authority granted a contract to a private company, a subsidiary of L&T Infrastructure Development Projects, to establish a six-lane toll road beginning in the state of Tamil Nadu, running north from the city of Chennai. By the government\u2019s reckoning, the highway was supposed to be finished three years later at a cost of about $65 million. But difficulties in acquiring land led to delays and cost overruns. Two years ago, the company defaulted on its loans. The road has yet to be completed.That Mr. Trump will find investors for his plans may be taken as a given. Be it Japan, Europe or North America, central banks have maintained rock-bottom interest rates in an effort to spur recovery from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. As a result, money managers are on the prowl for investments offering a decent rate of return.\u201cInfrastructure investment, which typically yields 3 to 4 percent, looks relatively attractive,\u201d said Linda Yueh, a visiting senior fellow at the London School of Economics.But others question why the United States needs to involve private money. The American authorities can tap vast and sophisticated bond markets, with municipal bonds exempt from federal taxes.\u201cThe borrowing costs for the U.S. government are zero,\u201d said Mark Weisbrot, a co-founder of the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s simply no reason to turn to private capital and all the complications, uncertainties, and opportunities for corruption and bad outcomes that you add to the mix.\u201dHad the private sector been shaping plans, the Pearl River Delta in southern China would presumably not have gained the ports, highways and electrical supplies that transformed it into a clattering zone of industry. Once in place, the infrastructure attracted vast sums of foreign investment. The region grew into the factory floor to the world, generating millions of jobs for poor migrant workers.That process has been aided by features of the Chinese political system that are anathema in the democratic world.The government can seize land, moving less-than-enthusiastic residents to new homes. China has not been constrained by owls or fish or other environmental considerations.Atif Ansar, the co-author of a paper studying China\u2019s infrastructure investments and a management scholar at the Sa\u00efd Business School at the University of Oxford, said he and his colleagues found many roads that \u201cwere almost empty\u201d in parts of southwestern China.\u201cHad China focused on about a third of its most productive investments, it would have reaped lasting economic benefits without the debt overhang,\u201d Dr. Ansar said.As China\u2019s indebtedness has soared, the state has expanded infrastructure investment while turning to a new mode that limits the state\u2019s direct outlay \u2014 the public-private partnership. Two years ago, China invited private investors to finance more than 2,000 proposed infrastructure projects totaling an estimated $622 billion.Mr. Trump is not one to let cautionary tales stand in the way of his plans. The globe appears poised for another test case in what happens when private finance is handed control over public works.Sui-Lee Wee contributed reporting from Beijing, and Nida Najar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Exits Paris Agreement, Other Nations Are Defiant", "Date": "2017-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Emmanuel Macron of France, speaking in French before switching to English, said he believed Mr. Trump was making a mistake. He then extended an offer to Americans:\u201cTonight, I wish to tell the United States: France believes in you, the world believes in you. I know that you are a great nation. I know your history, our common history. To all scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States, I want to say that they will find in France a second home.\u201d\u201cI can assure you,\u201d Mr. Macron added, \u201cFrance will not give up the fight.\u201d He capped off his English remarks with a twist on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan: \u201cMake our planet great again.\u201dChina made it a point to say it would stay in the accord, while Mr. Macron and the leaders of Germany and Italy issued a joint statement expressing \u201cregret\u201d and rejecting Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that he would renegotiate the deal.\u201cWe therefore reaffirm our strongest commitment to swiftly implement the Paris Agreement, including its climate finance goals, and we encourage all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Trump, in a Rose Garden address, said he wanted better terms for the United States. \u201cWe are getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that\u2019s fair. And if we can, that\u2019s great.\u201dBut Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations official who led the negotiations, said his remarks underscored a lack of understanding of how international agreements work. Under the accord, the United States cannot even submit its intention to withdraw until November 2019, after which the process would take a year.\u201cYou cannot renegotiate individually,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a multilateral agreement. No one country can unilaterally change the conditions.\u201dOther reactions were more blunt. The prime minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, called the American decision \u201ca brutal act.\u201dMary Robinson, former president of Ireland, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision had turned the United States into \u201ca rogue state.\u201d Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for climate, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision had \u201cgalvanized us\u201d and promised that \u201cthis vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership.\u201dIn his address on Thursday, Mr. Trump also took aim at the Green Climate Fund, designed to help poor nations deal with the havoc of climate change, calling it a scheme to redistribute wealth. Ms. Figueres described the fund as a \u201cpolitical message\u201d of help from rich countries to poor countries that have done little to wreck the atmosphere. Countries decide how much they want to give, and former President Barack Obama, pledged last year to contribute $3 billion.President Trump will withdraw the United States from the first worldwide deal to address global warming. Where do other countries stand on the agreement?The secretary general of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called Mr. Trump\u2019s move \u201ca major disappointment\u201d and while he said nothing specifically about a renegotiation, suggested that countries and businesses all over the world had already made advances based on the agreement.\u201cThe transformation envisaged in the Paris Agreement is already underway,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe Secretary-General remains confident that cities, states and businesses within the United States \u2014 along with other countries \u2014 will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low-carbon, resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity.\u201dVictoria Tauli-Corpuz, the United Nations special envoy for indigenous people, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision would punish those who were least to blame and the most vulnerable.\u201cWe are already seeing climate change destroy lives, livelihoods and entire communities,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWhile indigenous peoples are often the first to feel these effects because of where we live, the entire planet will suffer as a result of history\u2019s largest emitter retreating on climate change.\u201dBefore the announcement, United Nations envoys from rich and poor countries alike said they were sticking to the agreement, with or without the United States. New diplomatic alliances were forming, with Europe, India and China pledging to uphold their end of the deal.Premier Li Keqiang of China, in Berlin for meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Thursday that his country remained committed to the fight against climate change and to participating in international efforts for a greener world.China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, stands to gain international credit for standing by the Paris Agreement, but it would not be able to fill the void on its own if the United States abandoned the treaty.She pointed to future cooperation between Brussels and Beijing, making clear the similar intention in Europe to move ahead with potential partners to fill any vacuum created by Washington\u2019s absence.Ms. Merkel and India\u2019s leader, Narendra Modi, pledged their support for the climate accord during meetings in Berlin on Wednesday.After his meetings in Berlin, Mr. Li will head to Brussels for a summit meeting with European Union leaders. They are expected to announce a number of measures deepening joint cooperation on climate protection.The United States has emitted more planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other country. Now it is walking back a promise to lower emissions.\u201cThe international community may expect China to play a leading role,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my view, China doesn\u2019t have the capacity to single-handedly play the role of global hero. Instead, we\u2019ll need to work closely with the European Union and the Basic countries,\u201d he said, referring to a negotiating bloc that includes Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\u201cCollective leadership will be more important,\u201d he said.The one exception to the chorus of criticism on Thursday came from Poland, whose economy is heavily dependent on coal and whose conservative government has been a vocal critic of European climate policies.Grzegorz Tobiszowski, Poland\u2019s deputy minister of energy, commended President Trump\u2019s for his decision as he was signing an agreement on developing a new hard coal-fired power unit in Jaworzno, a city in southern Poland and one of the most polluted regions in Europe.Yet even some of Washington\u2019s most reliable allies warned that the United States would find itself isolated on the international stage.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain expressed her disappointment in a telephone call to Mr. Trump, according to a statement from her office. In the call, Ms. May reaffirmed her government\u2019s commitment to the agreement, according to the spokesman.At United Nations headquarters in New York, Several Western diplomats said they could not fathom why the White House would join the tiny clique of nations \u2014 like Syria and Nicaragua \u2014 that had not signed the accord. The last time the United States\u2019 standing had fallen so low was during its invasion of Iraq, several said.\u201cHumanity is at a fork in the road,\u201d said Kai Sauer, the ambassador from Finland. \u201cOne hundred and ninety countries going on one path, and the United States, Syria, Nicaragua going on another? It seems a bit strange. This definitely also changes how we are looking at the United States.\u201dAlready, the United States is likely to miss the climate-related pledges that it made just last year because of policies set in motion by the Trump administration. So who can make up the difference? Perhaps the biggest surprise comes from India, which just a couple of years ago insisted that it needed to burn much more coal in order to lift its people out of poverty.Since then, India has sharply slowed the expansion of its coal-fired plants, and although coal use will most certainly rise, according to experts, the Indian government has said that in another 10 years, it may not need to build any more coal plants at all.Navroz K. Dubash, a climate change expert with the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, said planned coal projects were struggling to obtain financing in India because of uncertainty over the regulatory environment, and most were unlikely to get off the ground.Solar and wind power prices have fallen sharply, making them far more competitive sources of energy for a poor country. And India has said it aimed to sell only electric cars by 2030.After the White House announcement, Lavanya Rajamani, a professor at the center and colleague of Mr. Dubash, called Mr. Trump\u2019s claims baffling: \u201cStating that the Paris Agreement hamstrings the U.S. while allowing India and China to increase their emissions is baffling,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe Agreement allows every country to choose its pledge tailored to its national circumstances.\u201dAn article on Friday about reaction to President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord attributed a quotation incorrectly. It was Lavanya Rajamani, a professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi \u2014 not her colleague Navroz K. Dubash \u2014 who said, \u201cStating that the Paris Agreement hamstrings the U.S. while allowing India and China to increase their emissions is baffling. The Agreement allows every country to choose its pledge tailored to its national circumstances.\u201d The article also referred incorrectly to comments by President Emmanuel Macron of France. In criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, Mr. Macron spoke in French before switching to English, not the other way around.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to plumes seen rising from a German power plant. They were plumes of water vapor, not smoke.An earlier version of this article misstated the date of the Kyoto Protocol. It was signed in 1997, not 1992.Somini Sengupta reported from the United Nations, Melissa Eddy from Berlin and Chris Buckley from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Runners-Up From Our Fourth Annual Student Editorial Contest", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContestsWe\u2019re very pleased to publish these student editorials below, which address a diverse range of subjects from cultural appropriation to news literacy, drug policy and excess packaging.________I am a refugee. Although, I was not fully aware of what this meant at age 7, there are no words to describe the feelings that flooded over me when my family landed at Miami International Airport, when I realized that we were here to stay. The process of being accepted as a refugee into the United States is a nightmare. It took us 10 months of exhausting interviews, paperwork and medical tests. After fleeing Baghdad, and spending a year as illegal refugees in Jordan, that moment meant everything. It breaks my heart that in 2017, there are some trying to steal this moment from countless individuals whose promise of a new life will be broken \u2014 families no different from mine, who deserve a second chance but who won\u2019t get one. President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration is not merely illegal and unconstitutional, but also heartless and discriminatory.Under the newest draft of President Trump\u2019s executive order that is meant to \u201cprotect the nation from foreign terrorist entry,\u201d citizens from the affected countries \u2014 Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya \u2014 will be subjected to a 90-day ban on travel to the United States. It should be noted that while Mr. Trump\u2019s ban covers these countries, which have produced exactly zero people linked to terrorist attacks that have killed Americans since 1975 to 2015, the ban does not cover countries like Turkey, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, with which the Trump family has business interests and whose citizens have been linked to terrorist attacks that have killed Americans. In addition to that, terrorism by Muslims as opposed to American Christian lone gunmen accounts for just one third of 1 percent of all murders in the United States.But let\u2019s take a step back from the politics of it all. Children may die, families will be separated. These are the world\u2019s most vulnerable that we are turning our backs on. What about the tired, poor and huddled masses yearning to breathe free? A few weeks ago when returning to the United States from Dubai, my family was selected for a \u201crandom security check.\u201d This one was more thorough than ever. I had to hold back tears as everyone in line passed while they were dissecting my bag like I was some sort of criminal. My crime? The American passport that I carry says that I was born in Iraq. My father asked the man why the security check was taking so much longer than usual. The man replied simply with \u201cAmerica first,\u201d but how do you put America first when you are destroying the very values it was founded upon?Works CitedBoard, The Editorial. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban Is Cowardly and Dangerous.\u201d The New York Times.

Independent Digital News and Media, 01 Mar. 2017. Web. 03 Apr. 2017._________There are over four million people living in the five permanently inhabited island territories of the United States. The residents of these territories \u2014 Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and Puerto Rico \u2014 are Americans who follow the Constitution, serve in the U.S. military and vote in presidential primaries. However, unless citizens establish an official residency in a U.S. state (and vote by absentee ballot or travel to their state to vote), they cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections or receive any substantial representation at a national level. It is time for the U.S. to stop infantilizing its territories and to grant them voting and other rights equal to the mainland states.The Supreme Court decision that denied equal rights to the territories was made over 100 years ago. Not only was the verdict intended to be temporary, but it was also made by the same justice who approved the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson. The ruling denies territories rights outlined in constitutional amendments because the territories are \u201cinhabited by alien races\u201d unable to understand \u201cAnglo-Saxon principles.\u201d This blatantly discriminatory decision is still used today against U.S. territory citizens fighting for equal rights.Inequality for the territories is also prevalent in Congress and bureaucracy. All U.S. territories elect representation into the House of Representatives; however, their Congressmen have no voting power on legislation. Guam and American Samoa specifically receive unfair treatment from the government despite their overwhelming large military enrollment. One-eighth of Guam\u2019s population is enrolled in the U.S. military and American Samoa has \u201cthe highest rate of military enlistment in the U.S.,\u201d yet citizens in both territories do not vote for their commander-in-chief, have adequate representation in Congress, or receive equal veteran benefits to mainland citizens.It is even more difficult to acquire the right to vote in American Samoa because American Samoans, unlike other territory residents, are not born U.S. citizens. They are instead called \u201cnationals\u201d to accommodate their \u201ccultural distinctiveness.\u201d In order to vote, American Samoans must move to a U.S. state and become naturalized as if they were immigrating from another country. This process costs \u201calmost $700\u201d and includes tests in English, U.S. history and civics. The naturalization process is comparable to poll taxes and literacy tests \u2014 forms of voting discrimination outlawed by the 24th Amendment \u2014 and further highlights unjustifiable bias of the U.S. government against its territories, simply because of cultural differences.It is time for the U.S. to acknowledge its disrespectful and isolating treatment of its territories and give their neglected citizens the rights they deserve.Works CitedMurriel, Maria. \u201cMillions of Americans Can\u2019t Vote for President Because of Where They Live.\u201d PRI\u2019s The World, 1 November 2016.Ponsa, Christina Duffy. \u201cAre American Samoans American?\u201d The New York Times, 8 June 2016.Savage, David G. \u201cSupreme Court Rejects Citizenship for American Samoans.\u201d Los Angeles Times, 13 June 2016.\u201cU.S. Territories: Last Week Tonight With John Oliver (HBO).\u201d YouTube, uploaded by LastWeekTonight, 8 March 2015._________Climate change is a threat to every young person on our planet. It is vital that schools teach about the climate-caused tragedies that are occurring globally and how to combat climate injustice. Fortunately, some school districts are taking steps to ensure that this is done. In 2016 the Portland, Ore., school board unanimously passed a resolution supporting the teaching of climate justice.In the New York Times article, \u201cSetbacks Aside, Climate Change is Finding its Way into the World\u2019s Classroom,\u201d Alexander Leicht of Unesco states \u201c[to slow climate change] we need an overall change of mind and a change of action that relates to everything that we think and do.\u201d Education can provide this essential change in perspective that will ultimately help the generations to come.However, actions like Portland\u2019s are still relatively rare. There are too many cases of state legislatures, school districts and teachers actively denying the fact that climate change is real, or bowing to pressure from community members and corporations who value short-term profits over long-term climate stability.Even when teachers and school districts want to teach the facts about climate change, many classroom resources discount the science behind climate change. Holt McDougal\u2019s textbook, \u201cModern World History,\u201d published in 2010, includes misleading statements questioning the legitimacy of the climate crisis such as, \u201cnot all scientists agree with the theory of the greenhouse effect.\u201d This statement falsely leads students to believe that there is not a wide scientific consensus about climate change.Fossil fuel industry funding of curriculums also poses a huge obstacle to eliminating misinformation about climate change. Energy corporations are paying for materials to be developed that promote fossil fuel usage and production. In the Washington Post article, \u201cEnergy Industry Shapes Lessons in Public Schools,\u201d Kevin Sieff writes, \u201cThe industry aims to teach students about its contributions to local economies and counter criticism from environmental groups.\u201d These resources are often biased and factually incorrect.Actions like Portland\u2019s demonstrate that schools can address climate change in the classroom. It is essential that cities around the nation follow their lead because we, as the future generation, deserve to know what we are facing and what we can do to fix this crisis that we did not create.As Portland student Gaby Lemieux says, \u201cClimate education is not a niche or a specialization, it is the minimum requirement for my generation to be successful in our changing world.\u201dWorks CitedGardiner, Beth. \u201cSetbacks Aside, Climate Change Is Finding Its Way Into the World\u2019s Classrooms.\u201d The New York Times.

Web. 03 Apr. 2017._________At the opening of the Whitney Museum Biennial last month, a small protest began to gather in front of a painting by white, American-born artist Dana Schutz that depicted the open-casket funeral of 14-year-old Emmett Till. Within days, dozens of demonstrators showed up to block the painting from view, and over 25 black artists signed an open letter to the Whitney\u2019s curators demanding that the painting be destroyed due to its cultural appropriation of black suffering for \u201cprofit and fun.\u201dCultural appropriation is the adoption of elements of one culture by members of another culture. What makes the protests at the Whitney Museum so frustratingly sad isn\u2019t just the call for a museum to destroy a piece of artwork. Instead it is the objection that a white artist has no right to paint a subject like a lynching victim that entirely misses the point. What these critics \u2014 the same people who would protest against the routine stop and frisking of innocent black people, the vulgar accusations made by President Trump caricaturing Mexican immigrants, and the harassment of Muslim-American families \u2014 fail to realize is that \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d can actually be used to heighten empathy and stop these injustices.The truth is that people, even the most sympathetic ones, tend to view victims from disparate racial groups as separate from themselves. Again and again, politicians, reporters and television broadcasters reflect this trend. \u201cNo one wants any child to be kidnapped,\u201d writes journalist Conor Friedersdorf, \u201cbut the little blond girl leads the local news; her black analog might not make the newscast... [Dana Schutz] was trying to bridge the gulf between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them.\u2019\u201dSlavery and white supremacy are very real parts of American history, and white people ought to confront them no less than black people. To label such efforts as \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d lends credibility to the sort of racial rigidity that fuels racism in the first place. So while Dana Schutz is white and Emmett Till is black, the emphasis on racial essentialism here feels ludicrously, infuriatingly off topic. Sometimes a woman rendering painful moments in black history has nothing to do with whether she herself is white or black, but rather with the exposure of human pain. Combating racism must not only rely on racial equity in legislation, but also must allow for the full participation of every ethnic group, nationality and race.Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting itself is abstract and haunting \u2014 the ambiguous brush strokes across Till\u2019s face form a profoundly disquieting image. But this is to be expected of any painting that reopens the wounds of American racism. Call it whatever you will, but what Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting does is powerful and evokes emotion in the viewer. Sorrow. Anger. Loss. Some might even say empathy.Works CitedFriedersdorf, Conor. \u201cWhat Does \u2018Cultural Appropriation\u2019 Actually Mean?\u201d The Atlantic. 3 Apr. 2017.Fury, Alexander. \u201cMarc Jacobs and the Appropriateness of Appropriation.\u201d The New York Times. 21 Sept. 2016.Sehgal, Parul. \u201cIs Cultural Appropriation Always Wrong?\u201d The New York Times. 29 Sept. 2015.Shamsie, Kamila. \u201cThe Storytellers of Empire.\u201d Guernica Magazine. 1 Feb. 2012.Tomkins, Calvin. \u201cWhy Dana Schutz Painted Emmett Till.\u201d The New Yorker. 10 Apr. 2017._________Christine Lagarde. Charles Murray. Condoleezza Rice. What do the director of the IMF, the conservative political scientist, and the 66th secretary of state have in common? All three have been prevented from speaking on college campuses due to student protests.Campaigns by college students to block speakers from campus events have markedly increased in recent years. According to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, there have been 338 attempts by college students to prevent public figures from speaking at campus events since 2000. The annual number of \u201cdisinvitation events\u201d has increased since 2011, with 2016 reaching a record high of 42 campaigns.The protests themselves are not the problem. Throughout history, protests have been the catalyst for political progress, from Gandhi\u2019s salt march to the American Civil Rights movement. Instead, it is the motivation behind these college protests that provides a disservice to the students of today. Often, the reason for campaigns against speakers is the disparity between the politics or actions of the proposed speaker and the views of the student protesters. Many students hold that the beliefs of proposed speakers are so damaging that they should not be given a platform.The solution to a difference of opinion is not a violent refusal to listen. Discourse is necessary.By listening to and engaging with political opponents, students can strengthen their understanding of political issues and both sides can evolve their views.In an increasingly polarized political climate, an understanding of opposing viewpoints is crucial to developing and strengthening one\u2019s own ideology. By listening to speakers with different political views, students are afforded the unique opportunity to learn about contrary beliefs and their underlying reasoning. In turn, this understanding allows students to refine their positions and, therefore, to more effectively advocate for them.Vigorous and open debate also allows both sides the opportunity to engage in ideological development. One purpose of college is the ability to grow and change before venturing into the real world. Listening to a speaker with whom you already wholeheartedly agree is a merely a visit to the echo chamber. Exposure to new viewpoints may actually change the beliefs of students. Conversely, students who confront the speaker with informed questions and arguments may challenge the position of the speaker or sway other undecided listeners.Thus, for the benefit of students and the future of political discourse, the practice of blocking speakers on college campuses must stop. College students should continue to protest, but should also listen and demand respectful dialogue with speakers, no matter their politics. If we fail to listen, if we turn our backs on the opposition instead of arguing and engaging, then we have already lost.Works Cited\u201cDisinvitation Attempts.\u201d Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.Fitzsimmons, Emma G. \u201cCondoleezza Rice Backs Out of Rutgers Speech After Student Protests.\u201d The New York Times, 3 May 2014.P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, Richard. \u201cAfter Protests, I.M.F.

The hero quickly realized what made the nine-headed beast so deadly. After decapitating one head, two more took its place. However, if he cauterized the wounds, the heads would not spawn, allowing Hercules to defeat this relentless foe. The moral is brute force may not be the sole solution. Three thousand years later, we do not fight sea monsters and impervious lions, but we need Hercules\u2019s lesson more than ever. For the past 16 years our nation has been at a never-ending war with a similarly regenerating enemy: international terrorism.Former President Obama criticized his predecessor\u2019s strategy for creating more terrorists than it killed, but his own pivot from conventional warfare to drone strikes was not the ideal solution either.President Trump appears to be embracing Obama\u2019s myopic tactics. On January 21 and 22, the United States conducted drone strikes in the Yemeni province of Bayda that claimed the lives of 75 people. Though such drone strikes successfully kill insurgents, new radicals always seem to spring up in their place. Could this new technology be moving us toward perpetual war rather than peace?Retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, once responsible for the Joint Special Operations Command, says yes. During a Reuters interview, he argues that drones strengthen the \u201cperception of American arrogance that says, \u2018Well we can fly where we want, we can shoot where we want, because we can.\u2019\u201d Although these strikes eliminate enemies, General McChrystal stresses that radical groups use perceived American imperiousness to bolster their numbers faster than we kill them.Proponents claim this technological advantage enables us to remotely kill key targets like the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour. However, these weapons\u2019 short term gains cause more havoc than sustained peace. Just days after terminating Mullah Mansour, an \u201ceven more ruthless and radical leader\u201d filled his position.The attack that killed Mullah Mansour also incinerated an innocent taxi driver name Mohammad Azam. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism states this humble cabdriver joined \u201cbetween 256 and 633 civilians\u201d who perished in United States\u2019 drone strikes between January 2009 and December 2015. Our feigned progress leads us to ignore the innocent people who have been trampled and shallowly regarded as collateral damage. Our acceptance of these unintended deaths generate resentment, hatred and destabilization, creating a prime environment for spawning new radicals.The modern Hydra is more complex than its ancient Greek counterpart. However, its heads will continue to sprout even though our weapon is a Hellfire missile rather than Hercules\u2019s club. We must discover how to seal the wounds rather than just inflict them, or our problems will grow exponentially.Works CitedAlexander, David. \u201cRetired General Cautions against Overuse of \u201chated\u201d Drones.\u201d Reuters.

This time it was a group of first graders from a sandy hook. Standing in the kitchen with my backpack by my feet, I could not escape the visions of carnage.In school, we practice Code Red. We pile furniture against classroom doors and sit silently, holding our breath until reminded that it is just a drill. Wariness follows me home from school, its tentacles twisting my head.When I pick up my phone, there are notifications reading, \u201cAt least 50 dead after nightclub shooting in Orlando, officials report\u201d next to Snapchat notifications. I can list Adam Lanza, Dylann Roof, Omar Mateen, Robert Dear and Chris Harper Mercer, just as quickly as I can list the names of my best friendsI notice that when the bullets hit the kids, our civilized side flares. But we build the excuses back up, brick by brick, into cities and laws and Second Amendments. I am mad because 16-year-olds are supposed to be angry with their parents and society and not having a date to the prom, but instead I have to be angry with lawmakers and the N.R.A. and an entire country that lets holsters and bazookas pull its puppet strings. I can fire off facts faster than an AR-15 rifle: last year, there were 358 shootings in the U.S. in which four or more people were injured or killed. 306 Americans are shot every day. 48 of those are children or teenagers.It does not have to be this way. Take Australia. After a shooting in 1996 left 35 civilians dead, extensive gun control legislature was passed. These new laws included required licenses, safety training courses and an assault weapons ban. In the twenty years since the legislature was passed, there have been no mass shootings in Australia. This is sensible action. This is making sure guns do not end up in the wrong hands.Dear lawmakers: I challenge you to think about the American people. Think about the 306 Americans who will feel bullets tearing into their skin tomorrow. Think about the American students holding their breath in the corners of dark classrooms.Works CitedKauffman, Gretel. \u201cWhy Australia Isn\u2019t a Model for US Gun Control.\u201d The Christian Science Monitor.

In the Kingdom of the Little People theme park just outside Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, that\u2019s the norm. The park creates a safe space for little people in China, but still sources such as the L.P.A., Little People of America, believe the park is mocking dwarfism and isolating the handicapped community. The Kingdom of the Little People theme park should be kept running, because it gives little people a stable job and a safe space to be themselves.Little people in China have an extremely hard time finding work, but at the Kingdom of the Little People they have many job opportunities. According to the South China Morning Press, \u201cdwarves earn average pay packets of 1,500 yuan, equivalent to that of local college graduates.\u201d Though most dwarfs in China live in poverty, often times forced to beg on the streets, the dwarves at the park are paid well and many say that it changed their lives forever.Another big pull for dwarfs is to be finally in an environment where they aren\u2019t the odd one out and they have a safe space to be with others like them. One of the performers at the park, Wu Zhihong, 20 said, \u201cBefore, when we were at home, we didn\u2019t know anyone our size. When we hang out together with normal-size people, we cannot really do the same things. So I really felt lonely sometimes.\u201d Many of the workers felt isolated in their hometowns where most often they were the only person of short stature they knew. At the park they have a place to meet others they can relate to and reportedly many dwarfs find their first loves at the park.Some say the park is a human zoo and a place to gawk, but this is not the case. Most of the performers have nowhere else where they can have a stable life with friends similar to them. The performers all say that they wouldn\u2019t be the same if they hadn\u2019t worked at the Kingdom of the Little People.The park creates a safe space for little people in China to meet friends and get paid a comfortable salary. Without the park little people in China would live as lesser members of society subject to extreme ridicule. Ethics groups that oppose the park need to be shown the effect it has had on performers and how drastically different their lives would be without it. The park must remain open for the sake of the little people all over China.Works CitedNews, Red Door. \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World: The Kingdom of the Little People.\u201d South China Morning Post.

I should be glad that it keeps \u201cAlexa\u201d clean and protected, but I cannot overlook the amount of waste created. I recycled the cardboard, but the plastic? My neighborhood recycling plant only accepts plastic bottles. It does not have the facilities to break down the multilayered packaging economically. Instead, it went to the landfill, adding to the 14.4 million tons of plastic produced each year in America.Granted, we have made progress over the years. Since 2005, United States companies have already avoided creating 1.5 billion pounds of packaging waste. Even so, reducing the amount of packaging is not enough. We must eliminate it entirely in order to see any large progress.Zero waste stores have opened all across Europe in order to combat this issue. At Original Unverpackt, in Berlin, Germany, all of their products are out in the open, unobstructed by layers of plastic, paper or metal. Precycling removes trash before it is even created. Shoppers come in with sacks and totes buying local products while making conscious purchases.Few places generate as much waste as grocery stores. We consistently see produce individually wrapped in plastic. But why is this necessary? For thousands of years, people bought goods fresh and in bulk \u2014 free of any sort of packaging. Bulk items are still around now, but their sections are dwarfed by aisles and aisles of unnecessary packaging. These small areas do not dominate stores and therefore have very little influence on our buying habits.In America, a land full of supermarkets and large companies, it is more difficult to have zero waste and bulk markets because we want security and convenience. We pay for instant gratification rather than quality when we buy packaged food. If we want to reinvent grocery shopping, both the manufacturers and the consumers must take part.Many large corporations such as Nestl\u00e9 and WalMart have taken steps toward becoming more environmentally friendly, but lesser-known brands have made the most progress. They have responded to the demands of consumers, eliminating excessive packaging and sourcing from local and organic farms. We need to continue this movement toward zero waste by encouraging consumers to change their way of life and look toward the future of healthy, sustainable living, rather than being content with harming our planet. Bring your own bags. Buy food in bulk. Shop zero-waste. Small changes are all it takes to make a difference that extends far beyond our own homes.Works CitedBall, Aimee Lee. \u201cThe Anti-Packaging Movement.\u201d New York Times, 29 Nov. 2016.

In fact, The New York Times reports that it has nearly the same capacity as Madison Square Garden. Now, McKinney Independent School District, adjacent to Allen I.S.D., is building a rival stadium for nearly $70 million. That\u2019s the equivalent of providing school lunch to all of the 24,500 students in McKinney every day for six years.This is a remarkable misappropriation of money in a state that chronically underfunds education. As of last year, not only did Texas rank 43rd in the nation for education, it ranked 49th in per pupil spending. Nationally, the U.S. spent an average of $11,667 per student whereas Texas fell behind at $7,957 per student. But it\u2019s not only Texas whose obsession with sports is ripping at the seams of our educational system and, consequently, our democracy.A democracy forming without the proper education is doomed to crumble. Education is the key in arming the electorate with the information necessary to consider candidates, yet superfluous spending toward athletics is hindering the way our society is learning and voting. Paving the path toward a strong democracy, not a sharply divided one, begins and ends with education. Shifting the focus from athletics to academics, from the playing field to the classroom, is the way to uphold our trembling nation. As Richard D. Kahlenberg and Clifford Janey explain, \u201cThe Founders saw education as the safeguard of America\u2019s system of self-governance. Educating common people was the answer to the oligarchs who said the average citizen could not be trusted to choose leaders wisely.\u201d But with more than two-thirds of Americans unable to name all three branches of government, I can\u2019t help but ponder: Is this the America that our founders had hoped for?Defunding sports is absurd. It is just as vital to have an active society as it is to have an educated one. But athletics cannot be the top priority when the U.S. is ranked so low in education. The Pew Research Center reports that the U.S. is currently 38th out of 71 developed and developing countries in math, and 24th in science. We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but our school funds are going down the wrong drain. Author Marguerite Roza \u201cfound that one high school was spending $328 a student for math instruction and more than four times that much for cheerleading \u2014 $1,348 a cheerleader.\u201dSpend tax money wisely; invest more in education; prioritize academics over athletics. And, who knows? Maybe if we spent $60 million on libraries instead of sports stadiums, students would understand that their society values education. And they would vote accordingly.Works CitedAnderson, Lindsey. \u201cTexas Falls to 43 in National Education Ranking.\u201d El Paso Times. 11 Jan. 2016.DeSilver, Drew. \u201cU.S. Students\u2019 Academic Achievement Still Lags That of Their Peers in Many Other Countries.\u201d Pew Research Center. 15 Feb. 2017.Gerber, Marisa. \u201cAfter Texas High School Builds $60-million Stadium, Rival District Plans One for Nearly $70 Million.\u201d Los Angeles Times. 17 Sept. 2016.\u201cMcKinney ISD Meal Prices for the 2016-17 School Year.\u201d McKinney ISD.

However, it also reaffirmed the power and relevancy that the written word still has in this day and age. A study conducted at Stanford University just after the November 2016 elections found that over 7,800 students in middle school, high school and college in 12 states \u201cwere unable to assess the credibility\u201d of information that they encountered on the internet. Now, more than ever, it is critical that we teach students in all schools \u2014 public and private, K-12 and college \u2014 how to think critically and analyze the news that they come across.Though terms such as \u201cfake news\u201d have risen to prominence in the past year, the art of deception reaches back to the advent of modern media. Photography especially has long been used to make political statements, \u201cprove\u201d questionable supernatural sightings, and justify cultural appropriation. Today, complex 19th-century equipment and studios have been replaced with Photoshop and a computer. The outcome, however, is still the same: an altered form of truth, or proof of a nonexistent event. Photoshopped images cover the internet, often side-by-side with real ones. How are students with an untrained eye supposed to spot the difference between reality and fiction?Then there are the articles themselves. Fake news articles are mainly spread through various social media platforms, frequented by teenagers and adults alike. When people see fake news articles \u2014 which often have eye-catching or alarming headlines \u2014 how are they to judge the validity of these articles without knowing what to look for? Fact-checking sites like Snopes certainly help, but they do not cover every article or statement on the internet. Some claims can only be proven false through critical thinking and by consulting reputable references.There are many different ways to tackle the rise of fake news, but the most important is teaching people how to think critically about what they encounter on the news and how to recognize whether it is fact or fiction. This can only be accomplished by incorporating news literacy into existing school curriculums \u2014 such as government, civics or history classes \u2014 rather than having a separate elective or seminar. By the time students reach college, they\u2019re already \u201ctoo immersed in their own worldviews\u201d to be able to look at news objectively. News literacy classes must be introduced to schools, and it needs to be done as soon as possible. Everyone is affected by fake news, and it is now our civic duty to educate ourselves and others about it.Works CitedBarron, James. \u201cIn an Era of Fake News, Teaching Students to Parse Fact From Fiction.\u201d The New York Times. 20 Mar. 2017.Chen, Angus. \u201cLong Before There Was \u2018Fake News\u2019, There Were \u2018Fake Photos\u2019.\u201d Goats and Soda.

We all run back to class, forming a line and departing from our adventures in the land of recess. I\u2019m last in line. Every. Day.The system of alphabetical order in schools must be changed, as a silent bias toward the names starting with letters near the end of the alphabet is causing detrimental effects to our children\u2019s psychology due to the subconscious implications of inferiority.As someone with the last name \u201cZhang,\u201d I still remember the rush of excitement I felt when my teacher read the roll sheet from the bottom to the top \u2014 only on special occasions, of course. I remember the condolences the teacher would give, telling me \u201clast but not least!\u201d But I still felt least. This display of alphabetical inequality not only continually provides an unfair disadvantage and feeling of inferiority to the same group of people; it also affects our decisions made later in life.In the New York Times article \u201cHow Inequality Hollows Out the Soul\u201d by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, it discusses how social inequality allows us to \u201cnot only [see] what we knew intuitively \u2014 that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive \u2014 but that it also damages the individual psyche.\u201d If inequality in wealth damages people, why wouldn\u2019t inequality in school cause damage as well?In a recent four-series scientific study in the Journal of Consumer Research conducted by Kurt A. Carlson, assistant professor at Georgetown, and Jacqueline M. Conard, assistant professor at Belmont University, the professors found that those who had last names later in the alphabet reacted quicker to special sale opportunities when offered deals simultaneously.\u201cWe find that the later in the alphabet the first letter of one\u2019s childhood surname is, the faster the person acquires items as an adult. We dub this the last name effect ... it stems from childhood ordering structures that put children with different names in different positions in lines ... since those late in the alphabet are typically at the end of lines, they compensate by responding quickly to acquisition opportunities,\u201d Professor Carlson says.Alphabetical order is fine for files in cabinets or books in a library or for naming hurricanes. It is not appropriate for organizing people. \u201cThere may be no great alternatives to alphabetical order,\u201d says Professor Carlson. \u201cBut flip it around every now and then.

Yet, the opposite has occurred.According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 46.3 percent of inmates are currently imprisoned on drug offenses. The National Institute on Drug Abuse approximates that more than 50,000 individuals died from drug overdoses in 2015 alone, and states that diseases like hepatitis and H.I.V. continue to rage, spreading through unhygienic methods like unsterilized needles.Considering these failed results, the federal government should look to an alternative approach to combating drug use.That alternative is the decriminalization and legalization of all illicit drugs. This may seem like a disastrous choice; however, in Portugal, it\u2019s worked.In 2001, Portugal\u2019s government decriminalized and legalized all drugs, no matter their severity, in response to a growing heroin problem. Instead of a criminal offense, those caught with less than a 10-day supply of hard drugs are taken before a special court of legal experts, psychologists and social workers. In place of jail time, a small fine or community service, as well as treatment, is provided.Today, Portugal has one of the lowest drug-usage rates in all of Europe. The British Journal of Criminology found a significant reduction in the imprisonment of alleged drug dealers, from 14,000 in 2000 to 5,000 in 2010, and in the imprisonment of addicts, which fell from 41 percent in 1999 to 21 percent in 2008. The Washington Post reported that \u201cthere are three drug overdose deaths for every 1,000,000 citizens\u201d in Portugal; as a comparison, \u201c44.6 per million\u201d die in the United Kingdom. Drug-related diseases, like H.I.V., have decreased, \u201cwhile the dramatic rise in use feared by some has failed to materialize,\u201d as stated by the Transform Drug Policy Institute.By focusing on treatment rather than punishment, Portugal has given its citizens the opportunity to rehabilitate and contribute as functioning members of society. Consequently, the demand for drugs falls as the number of users declines.In the U.S., certain states are moving toward reformation instead of incarceration. The New York Times reported Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s efforts to combat the wild opioid epidemic in New York City: \u201c$38 million a year\u201d will go to programs like \u201cexpanded methadone and buprenorphine treatment for addicts\u201d and \u201ca focus at city hospitals on dealing with addiction and overdoses.\u201dThat is what the U.S. needs. The current system is a complete failure; the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d concept is ridiculously ineffective. It\u2019s time to look for an alternative model; Portugal has proved that its model works.Works Cited\u201cA Brief History of the Drug War.\u201d Drug Policy Alliance.\u201cDrug Decriminalization in Portugal: Setting the Record Straight.\u201d Transform: Getting Drugs Under Control. 11 June. 2014.Goodman, J.

Members of minority groups struggle to find accurate representation in films, clinging tightly to even the smallest examples of representation. This lack of diversity is particularly damaging to young children, whose perception of the world is warped to fit a narrative where only a certain type of person gets to have a happily ever after.In 2015, only 22 out of 126 released films featured a character that was part of the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community. Some people argue that because there are more cis-heterosexuals in real life, there should be more cis-heterosexuals in films. By this logic, the number of cis-heterosexual characters in individual films should exceed L.G.B.T.Q. characters. The lack of L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters in over 100 films creates entire universes where L.G.B.T.Q.+ people are seemingly nonexistent, a statistic that does not mirror reality in the slightest.Children especially need to see L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters, and yet their demographic is the one that is most denied access to films with accurate representation. Unfortunately, many people consider same-sex relationships to be too mature for children. Because of this, impressionable young people are prevented from watching films that could help them to better understand themselves and to accept the people around them.This also prevents L.G.B.T.Q.+ people and relationships from becoming normalized. If children are not exposed to the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community until later on in life, they will learn to treat it as something new and different as adults. By showing them films with diverse casts of characters, children will recognize that L.G.B.T.Q.+ people are a part of everyday life and that they \u201chave a right to ... their happily ever after, too.\u201d Normalizing L.G.B.T.Q.+ identities will also normalize their inclusion in films and other media outlets, because the people making those films will be so used to a world of L.G.B.T.Q.+ people that to not include them would be unthinkable.Film companies argue that parents would not allow their children to see films with L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters in them, making diversity and inclusivity bad for business. Though there are certainly people who would boycott films on this basis, there are also many parents who would be thrilled to see their children introduced to that kind of diversity at such a young age. Many L.G.B.T.Q.+ adults would watch the films as well, because they want to experience the representation they were denied as a child.Representation in any type of media is important, but L.G.B.T.Q.+ visibility in children\u2019s films is of particular significance. It represents another step on the long road to equality and a shift in the mind-set of an entire generation.Works Cited\u201cOverview of Findings.\u201d GLAAD. 02 May 2016.________The angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Igneous rock melts into magma. And I\u2019m sure by now many high schoolers know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of a cell. Having knowledge in a variety of subjects gives students information that could be useful in their futures depending on what they do with their lives. But what about classes that teach skills that will be useful to everyone, regardless of their life paths? Being a high school student myself, I do not believe I currently know enough about how to manage money. If more personal finance classes were available in schools, students would be more prepared for their futures.Financial education is not a requirement in every U.S. state, and students are missing out on useful information because of this. Only 17 states \u201crequire high school students to take a course in personal finance \u2026 the same number as in 2014.\u201d The United States is also behind other countries in regard to financial education. A 2012 international survey reported, \u201cmore than 1 in 6 students in the United States failed to reach the baseline level of proficiency in financial literacy.\u201d This same large study showed that American students are just behind Latvia and just ahead of Russia in financial knowledge, at the center of the countries assessed. Using money is something people do in their everyday lives, so being in the dark about financial skills leaves room for instability.When high school students take finance classes, they are more responsible with their finances. It has been shown that \u201chigh school students who are required to take personal finance courses have better average credit scores and lower debt delinquency rates as young adults.\u201d In the New York Times article, \u201cMaking Your Family Better at Personal Finance,\u201d Paul Brown says after his daughter took a personal finance course, she was \u201cfar better with money than her equally smart brothers.\u201d A parent\u2019s advice alone is often not enough to foster sensible financial habits in young people \u2014 being in a classroom allows students to process information and make meaningful connections to their own lives.While my school district requires I take a personal finance class in high school, many schools throughout the world do not. Young students everywhere should have ways to learn about how to survive and succeed in their lives, and learning about the economy is one way to do that. Yes, learning about the cycle of how rocks melt into magma can be interesting, but learning how to create and manage a budget, use and manage a credit card, and pay off a mortgage can make a lasting positive influence on one\u2019s life.Works CitedAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Says Financial Watchdog Agency Should Be Defanged", "Date": "2017-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration called for the neutering of many of the central provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as it offered its most detailed plans to date for the unraveling of the financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cProperly structuring regulation of the U.S. financial system is critical to achieve the administration\u2019s goal of sustained economic growth and to create opportunities for all Americans to benefit from a stronger economy,\u201d said Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.The recommendations were written with an eye toward easing regulations imposed on community banks and all but the largest credit unions after the financial crisis.President Trump asked for the report in February, giving the Treasury Department the authority to restructure major provisions of the Dodd-Frank law, which was passed in 2010. His order directed Mr. Mnuchin to take steps to ensure that the law aligns with the administration\u2019s goals.While the Trump administration cannot roll back the law on its own, the law does give the president broad authority to determine how its rules are executed. Mr. Mnuchin said at a congressional hearing on Monday that the administration could implement many of the changes in the report on its own.If passed, it would exempt some financial institutions that meet capital and liquidity requirements from many of Dodd-Frank\u2019s restrictions on risk-taking. It would also replace Dodd-Frank\u2019s method of dealing with large and failing financial institutions, known as the orderly liquidation authority \u2014 which critics say reinforces the idea that some banks are too big to fail \u2014 with a new bankruptcy code provision.The Senate is working on its own legislation on financial regulations, but analysts think that passage of a bill is unlikely because Republicans do not have enough votes without help from Democrats, who supported Dodd-Frank.The Trump deregulation plan sets up a clash between Mr. Trump and one of his most vocal Democratic critics: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was her brainchild. Among other approaches to scaling back its power, the Treasury report called for its funding structure to be changed so it is beholden to the annual appropriations process.\u201cThe C.F.P.B. was created to pursue an important mission, but its unaccountable structure and unduly broad regulatory powers have led to predictable regulatory abuses and excesses,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe C.F.P.B.\u2019s approach to rule making and enforcement has hindered consumer access to credit, limited innovation and imposed unduly high compliance burdens, particularly on small institutions.\u201dThe report did not take up many other important financial-regulation issues, but several more reports from the Treasury are due this year. The report did not address reform of the government-controlled mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been in a government conservatorship for nearly nine years.But the report did focus a good deal on the effect of postcrisis regulations on the mortgage market, saying that some of the rules had added costs to the business of servicing mortgages. The report said \u201cincreased oversight and regulation has led to an increase in compliance costs,\u201d which limits the ability of mortgage firms to spend more money \u201con developing more effective mortgage servicing platforms and technology.\u201dThe Treasury recommended a slowdown in new regulations for mortgage servicers.Many of the regulations imposed on mortgage servicers came about because of foreclosure abuses during the financial crisis that led big banks to pay tens of billions in fines and restitution.However, the report recommended a number of regulatory changes to spur greater mortgage origination. In particular, the report said, there needs to be \u201ccareful study of regulations and the extent to which they may be holding back the supply of mortgage credit.\u201dOne recommendation was to revise the definition of what constitutes a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d which can be guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to encourage more expansive lending. The report said a loan should be able to meet the criteria \u201ceven if one particular criterion is deemed to fall outside the bounds of the existing framework.\u201dThe financial industry cheered the Treasury report as a step in the right direction.\u201cToday\u2019s report is an important step towards modernizing America\u2019s financial regulatory system so both economic growth and consumer protection are advanced,\u201d said Tim Pawlenty, chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable.Some of the changes, such as revising the Volcker rule, would largely be a moot point, as banks sold off their proprietary trading desks years ago. While Republicans have generally been in favor of rolling back Dodd-Frank, the plan would open the door to loosening capital requirements they tend to support.Progressive groups condemned the recommendations as proposals that would put the economy at risk and allow the same practices that led to the recession.\u201cThe financial crisis had devastating costs for families and communities, and everyday abuses in financial markets cost people tens of billions of dollars a year,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cFinancial reform has made the system safer, and the C.F.P.B. is returning billions of dollars to consumers facing industry tricks and traps.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders.\u201dBut Mr. Trump has been a vocal critic of financial regulations and has argued that loosening them, along with cutting taxes and renegotiating trade deals, would unleash faster economic growth.In January, Mr. Trump called the financial regulations that President Barack Obama ushered in after the 2008 crisis a \u201cdisaster\u201d and promised to \u201cdo a big number on Dodd-Frank.\u201dMatthew Goldstein contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

More than 70 others were injured as 1,200 customers and employees fled the hotel in panic.After Mr. Carlos was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with security guards, he broke into a hotel room on the fifth floor, set fire to the room and shot himself, the police said.Investigators discovered Mr. Carlos\u2019s identity early Sunday morning, after interviewing the taxi driver who had picked him up near his home in the San Lazaro neighborhood of Manila and driven him to the casino.Family members confirmed his identity after viewing the security video of the attack, in which Mr. Carlos is seen at one point without his mask, the police said.\u201cThey had no idea whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Albayalde said.Relatives also told the police that Mr. Carlos had once had gall bladder surgery, which matched a scar found on the attacker\u2019s body, the police said.

Mr. Anne\u2019s younger brother Gibbe also tried to reach Italy. He, too, died at sea.Their fates, sealed in journeys nearly two years ago, matched those of so many in this region, where young men often fall into three unforgiving categories: the ones who have made it to Europe, the ones who were blocked or deported along the way and the ones who died trying.\u201cIf they would have made it, it really would have changed things for us,\u201d Ms. Diallo said.Late last month, 44 migrants, including children, died in the Sahara after their vehicle broke down and they ran out of water.

Only four people aboard were rescued.\u201cHuman smugglers will go to any extent to exploit desperate refugees and migrants,\u201d said Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency. \u201cThese shocking deaths are part of the bigger picture of exploitation.\u201dThe stream of migrants from this region \u2014 from Nigeria, Guinea, Gambia, Ivory Coast and Mali \u2014 is growing. In 2016, the number of Senegalese making the journey nearly doubled from the year before.Yet almost 47 percent of the Senegalese population lives in poverty, according to the World Bank. In rural areas, almost two-thirds of residents are considered poor.The Anne brothers\u2019 sparsely populated region is among the poorest in Senegal. At least 110 people from here have died along the migrant route since 2015, local officials said. This area lost 17 of its men in a single episode, a shipwreck in April 2015 that killed more than 800 people.\u201cWe have no machinery to cultivate the land, no rain and now no young people,\u201d said Alassane Diallo, mayor of the nearby village of Koussan.In this sandy landscape, with its blistering heat and fat baobab trees, the chief means of survival is farming. The kind of life it provides is on full display in the small compounds of one-room mud homes: a mini-flock of two or three sheep, a piece of foam to soften a bed of sticks, a few changes of clothing, plastic flip-flops.But some of the compounds strung along the bumpy dirt roads here serve as siren calls to Europe: concrete homes instead of mud, an automobile parked outside, a satellite television dish poking from the ground, an iPhone.All of it comes from money sent home from Europe \u2014 from the migrants who made it. They are local heroes, the envy of everyone.\u201cA young Senegalese is always covered with shame and guilt when he sees his own mother trying to make ends meet without being able to support and relieve his parents,\u201d said Ousmane Sene, director of the West African Research Center in Dakar.Some parents and spouses push their sons to make the trip. Village life is so isolated that often they are unaware of the dangers of the voyage. The pressure to try can be so intense that some men who fail never return home. Ashamed, they would rather have their families think they are dead.Moussa Kebbe, who lives in the area, tried making the journey in 2014. He sold his home to finance the trip, which included 16 days in the desert with so little water that he was forced to drink his own urine. Four people in his vehicle died from thirst, he said.Once Mr. Kebbe arrived in Libya, he worked in construction and cleaned toilets to try to earn enough money to pay for the boat to Italy. Libyan immigration officials threw him in jail for three months before he was deported.He came back home empty-handed, worse off than when he started. Mr. Kebbe explained to his wife what had happened. She cried and pleaded with him to try again.\u201cIt\u2019s a suicide mission,\u201d said Ousmane Thiam, who also failed to reach Europe.In the Anne family\u2019s tiny compound, the side-by-side huts of Amadou and his brother Gibbe are still empty, a broken bicycle resting against the mud wall in one.No one realized the journey would be so dangerous, said the men\u2019s mother, Ms. Diallo.\u201cWe\u2019d only heard success stories,\u201d she said, shaking her head.Before he left, Amadou, 36, told his brother to wait. But Gibbe, 28, working in Dakar as a brick maker, thought he could earn more in Europe. Anxious to follow his brother, he took off on his own, even before he heard of Amadou\u2019s fate.\u201cWe had no idea where he was,\u201d Ms. Diallo said.Gibbe\u2019s name showed up on a list of dead migrants a few weeks after his brother\u2019s did.The Anne family relied on other sons to help financially. One of them had been living in Gabon, where he had found work. A few months ago, he came to the village. He suddenly fell ill and died, of natural causes, the family said.Another son, Adama Anne, had planned to leave for Europe or somewhere else promising, his family said.But he, too, had been ill. A few weeks ago, while The New York Times was interviewing the family in the village, Adama began coughing violently. His father tried to help him walk back to his hut, but the man collapsed in his father\u2019s arms and went cold.\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d his father howled. \u201cHe\u2019s finally gone.\u201dNow, it is up to Arouna Anne, the last male in the family, to make a better life for his parents and the children his dead brothers left behind.He is just 14 years old.Arouna knew he couldn\u2019t support his family living in their tiny village. He left for a town a few hours to the east.He arrived on a Wednesday, market day, carrying only a change of clothes and the equivalent of $33. When darkness fell, he spotted children reading Arabic outside a big house. He went inside and asked for help from the teacher. Arouna now lives there with three other boys, sleeping on a mattress made of rice stalks.He thinks about his brothers often \u2014 about Amadou, the strict one, always trying to discipline him, and Gibbe, the jokester, always playing pranks.Once, Arouna accompanied Gibbe to the fields. He turned his back and Gibbe disappeared, hiding in a tree. He made baboon noises and pounced on Arouna, who was terrified and ran away.\u201cEveryone laughed when we told them what happened,\u201d Arouna said, giggling so hard he could barely continue talking.Arouna hasn\u2019t seen his parents for six months. He sends a bit of money to them from time to time. It\u2019s not enough.\u201cI am the only remaining son now,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to support the family.\u201dArouna knows well the dangers of the trip to Europe. One of his friends from home also tried the trip not long ago and died in Libya.Eventually, Arouna says, he will go to Gabon or Congo, to work in the mines.\u201cIt\u2019s not risky there like Libya,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lenin\u2019s Return From Exile Put Russia on the Fast Track to Revolution", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Catherine Merridale is well-known for her books on Soviet history, particularly for \u201cRed Fortress,\u201d her account of the Kremlin, and \u201cNight of Stone,\u201d on how Russians coped with violent death in the 20th century. Her latest book, \u201cLenin on the Train,\u201d has a tighter focus than these and vividly reminds us how the fateful events of 1917 depended on a seemingly small episode: Vladimir Lenin\u2019s return to Russia from political exile in Switzerland.With all the inevitable attention on the Bolshevik takeover in October 1917, when Lenin and Leon Trotsky seized power from the ill-fated provisional government, the extraordinary events of February and March should not be forgotten. It was then that unexpected riots over lack of food and fuel by thousands of people in the imperial capital of Petrograd and the ensuing mutiny by garrison troops compelled Czar Nicholas II to abdicate, ending 300 years of Romanov rule and handing political authority to a group of high-minded liberal figures. \u201cRussia became the freest country in the world,\u201d Merridale writes, \u201cas the new government granted an amnesty for political prisoners, abolished the death penalty and dissolved what was left of the detested secret police.\u201d (It also abolished the infamous Pale of Settlement, which had required the czar\u2019s Jewish subjects to live within a defined area of the country; they were now made equal before the law.)The provisional government inherited power from a discredited autocracy that had resisted any sensible move to establish a constitutional monarchy. Leaders like Alexander Kerensky, Paul Miliukov and Georgy Lvov tried in vain to establish a stable government and withstand the appeal of extreme forces. But the Romanov collapse was so sudden and so thorough that it left no credible institutions capable of governing effectively, let alone in the midst of widespread social turmoil, an imploding economy and the devastations of World War I.To explain the significance of Lenin\u2019s return a month after the czar\u2019s abdication, Merridale reconstructs a familiar story: how the war sapped confidence in the monarchy; how the provisional government had to share power with the radical Soviet of Workers\u2019 Deputies; and how Lenin, learning about the autocracy\u2019s collapse from his place of exile in Zurich, was so bent on returning that he accepted the assistance of Germany to travel more than 2,000 miles over eight days in a sealed railway car through Germany, Sweden and Finland before finally reaching Petrograd in April. (The exact date varies depending on what calendar you cite; unlike most other countries in the world, Russia in 1917 still used the Julian calendar.) Lenin\u2019s sojourn in Zurich remains the stuff of popular imagination; both Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (in a book called, simply, \u201cLenin in Zurich\u201d) and Tom Stoppard (in his play \u201cTravesties\u201d) depicted Lenin in Zurich plotting revolution.Merridale\u2019s account benefits from her thorough research, particularly concerning the circumstances surrounding Lenin\u2019s return; the train\u2019s route, which has confused earlier historians; and the intentions of the Germans, whose armies faced Russian forces on the Eastern front. Lenin had always opposed the war, giving Kaiser Wilhelm II\u2019s regime hope that his return would have the effect of \u201cdisabling the Russian colossus\u201d by undermining the provisional government\u2019s resolve to remain loyal to its British and French allies and not seek a separate peace. But Lenin understood he was compromising his credibility by cooperating with the hated German enemy. Lenin, moreover, had accepted the kaiser\u2019s money \u2014 \u201cGerman gold\u201d \u2014 to help finance Bolshevik propaganda and amplify his strident appeals against the provisional government and anyone, Bolshevik or otherwise, who thought of cooperating with it. If his enemies were to confirm his reliance on the kaiser\u2019s assistance, he would face arrest for treason and the collapse of the Bolsheviks\u2019 aim to seize power. But Lenin, unable to travel by boat because of Britain\u2019s refusal to help leftist exiles like him, believed he had no alternative except to work with Berlin. (After Trotsky set off by boat from New York at the end of March, British officials arrested him in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and held him for a month with German prisoners of war. Trotsky gained his release only after vehement protests in Russia; he reached Petrograd a month after Lenin.)The cover of \u201cLenin on the Train\u201d portends the trouble to follow. In a notorious Soviet-era painting, Lenin is shown descending from the train to greet an exuberant crowd of admirers at Petrograd\u2019s Finland Station. Behind him looms the image of a smiling Stalin, as if that future tyrant had been aboard as well \u2014 \u201ca visual fairy tale,\u201d in Merridale\u2019s words, to reinforce Stalin\u2019s claim that he had always been Lenin\u2019s principal lieutenant. In fact, Stalin had faced internal exile in Siberia before reaching Petrograd in March. Lenin was greeted by hundreds of followers, among them prominent Bolsheviks like Lev Kamenev and Fedor Raskolnikov, while others, most notably Grigory Zinoviev and Grigory Sokolnikov, accompanied him on the train. Stalin later had them killed.But it was Lenin himself who made it clear that the Bolsheviks would reject democratic values. He \u201chad not traveled back to join a coalition,\u201d Merridale writes, but to undermine the provisional government and establish a dictatorship in the name of the proletariat. It was Lenin who instituted severe censorship, established one-party rule and resorted to terror against his political enemies. Stalin took these measures to further extremes for his own sinister purposes. Merridale is right to recall Winston Churchill\u2019s famous observation about Lenin\u2019s return. The Germans, Churchill wrote, \u201cturned upon Russia the most grisly of all weapons. They transported Lenin in a sealed truck like a plague bacillus from Switzerland to Russia.\u201dJoshua Rubenstein\u2019s most recent book is \u201cThe Last Days of Stalin.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For Latin American countries, which overwhelmingly support global efforts to tackle climate change, the move will make it more difficult to meet climate objectives, and it will put a strain on relations with the United States.International cooperation and support will be critical for Latin American and Caribbean countries\u2019 ability to fulfill their Paris commitments and to ratchet up their pledges in the future, as climate negotiators intended. Emissions reduction plans developed by many countries, including Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, involved both unconditional commitments and more ambitious pledges that countries agreed to meet on the condition of technology transfer and international finance.President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the climate pact seems to be part of a broader policy of disengagement from international affairs that will ultimately hurt the United States\u2019 relationships with Latin American countries. Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy ostensibly aims to strengthen American interests and national security, and Mr. Trump has indicated he will prioritize defense over international cooperation. The president\u2019s budget, presented to Congress on May 16, proposes to cut funding to the State Department by 30 percent compared with the previous year while increasing military spending.After Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, many Latin American leaders condemned the United States\u2019 decision to leave the Paris accord and vowed to meet their climate change targets nevertheless. With the dramatic fall in renewable energy costs and gains in energy efficiency, clean energy is often more cost-effective anyway. However, meeting the global challenges of fighting and adapting to climate change requires global cooperation, and the United States\u2019 decision to withdraw from this international partnership will damage its standing with Latin America and the rest of the world.Lisa Viscidi is the director of the energy, climate change and extractive industries program at the Inter-American Dialogue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Team\u2019s Shifts Jolt Some Allies and Soothe Others", "Date": "2017-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump scrambled American diplomacy on two fronts on Friday, delivering a stinging rebuke of Qatar at the very moment his secretary of state was trying to mend fences in the Persian Gulf, while at the same time reaffirming support for NATO two weeks after he had declined to do so.Unpredictable as always, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments cut in two directions: He appeared to undermine Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who has thrown himself into an effort to mediate a resolution to the bitter dispute between Qatar and several of its neighbors, chiefly Saudi Arabia.Yet the pattern of sudden reversals in the Trump administration\u2019s diplomacy was most pronounced in the Middle East.On Friday afternoon, Mr. Tillerson called for a \u201ccalm and thoughtful dialogue\u201d to resolve the deepening dispute among Sunni Muslim states in the Persian Gulf. Barely an hour later, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were anything but that. He accused Qatar of being a \u201cfunder of terror at a very high level\u201d and demanded that the tiny, energy-rich nation cut off that money flow to rejoin the circle of responsible nations.\u201cWe had a decision to make,\u201d Mr. Trump declared at a Rose Garden news conference with the president of Romania, Klaus Iohannis. \u201cDo we take the easy road or do we take a hard but necessary action?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop the funding of terrorism.\u201dA senior administration official insisted that Mr. Trump was \u201con the same page\u201d as his secretary of state, even distributing a page to reporters on Air Force One that showed their statements on Qatar side by side. He also disputed that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Article 5 represented a reversal, arguing, as the White House has before, that the president had already effectively endorsed it.But on Qatar, a senior adviser to Mr. Tillerson, R.C. Hammond, suggested a difference in emphasis \u2014 if not ultimate goal \u2014 between the two men.\u201cThe president is focused on ending terrorism; the secretary is focused on diplomacy that will return G.C.C. focus to fighting terrorism,\u201d he said, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council, a loose association of mostly Sunni Arab states.The mixed messages extended to the Pentagon, which issued a statement reaffirming Qatar\u2019s critical role as a military partner to the United States and expressing concern that the deepening instability would hurt the American-led campaign against the Islamic State.Qatar is home to two major American command posts, including a center from which the United States and its allies conduct their air war on Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.\u201cWhile current operations from Al Udeid Air Base have not been hindered or curtailed, the evolving situation is hindering our ability to plan for longer-term military operations,\u201d said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, naming the large military installation in Qatar.A senior administration official played down those concerns, saying that the dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia would pose a problem to American military operation only if it drags on over time. At the moment, a blockade on land crossings into Qatar mostly threatens food deliveries and sundered families, said the administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Whether deliberately or accidentally, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Trump appear to have taken on a sort of good-cop, bad-cop role.For Mr. Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil who has deep contacts in the Persian Gulf, Qatar has emerged as an early test of his diplomatic skills. His approach was to try to lower the temperature on all sides.The blacklisting deepened a five-day standoff that has included a cutoff of all diplomatic relations, travel and trade with Qatar, forcing the country to import critical food supplies by air from Turkey and elsewhere.Mr. Tillerson noted that the standoff has already had serious humanitarian consequences, including food shortages, family separations and children being pulled out of school. Military operations in the region have also been affected, as has the functioning of American and international businesses, he said.\u201cDuring my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLeaders pointed to Qatar \u2014 look!\u201dThe president\u2019s remarks on Friday appeared to reinforce that impression. After criticizing Qatar, Mr. Trump lavished praise on Saudi Arabia\u2019s monarch as \u201cmy friend, King Salman,\u201d who played host at what the president called a historic summit meeting in Riyadh during his visit there last month. \u201cThere has never been anything like it before,\u201d he said, \u201cand perhaps there never will be again.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks fueled Qatar\u2019s adversaries. In a statement, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, Yousef al-Otaiba, welcomed the presidents\u2019 comments and said, \u201cQatar can no longer have it both ways.\u201dMr. Tillerson said the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, had made progress in cutting off funding to groups linked to terrorism. \u201cBut he must do more, and he must do it more quickly,\u201d Mr. Tillerson added.He said the United States supported efforts by the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, to resolve the dispute. But Mr. Tillerson called on countries in the region to \u201cimmediately take steps to de-escalate the situation.\u201dQatari officials have repeatedly denied supporting terrorist groups and say the emirate works closely with Western security agencies to crack down on the financing of terrorism. American officials are dubious of those claims, though they agree that Qatar has made progress.Inside the administration, Mr. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have argued that the United States cannot afford a rupture between Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Middle East, on one side, and Qatar on the other.On Thursday, the two men had breakfast together and then went to the White House for a meeting with Mr. Trump, who officially offered Mr. Tillerson as a mediator in the dispute.Mr. Trump\u2019s statement on NATO will make life easier for Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis. The president\u2019s refusal to endorse Article 5 \u2014 a reluctance that dates back to the 2016 campaign, when he questioned the underpinnings of the alliance \u2014 had strained America\u2019s relationship with its NATO allies at a time when the United States is pressing them to contribute a greater share of troops to the international military force in Afghanistan.Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team expected him to offer an explicit endorsement during his visit to NATO headquarters two weeks ago. When he did not, it underscored his willingness to deviate from his advisers on core foreign policy principles.\u201cShouldn\u2019t be a big deal,\u201d Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a research and consulting firm, tweeted on Friday about Trump\u2019s explicit commitment to Article 5. \u201cBut it is.\u201dReporting was contributed by David D.

{"Headline": "Gaza Dating Site Matches Widows to Men Seeking 2nd (or 3rd) Wife", "Date": "2017-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGAZA CITY \u2014 He was looking for a woman with particular attributes, hopefully a widow of a man killed in the struggle against Israel, without children, between 25 and 30, from southern Gaza. Her requirement was no less important: She was looking for a married man.For Majdi and Ghada Abu Mustafa, their simultaneous search for a spouse turned out well, and the pair are now married.\u201cShe is beautiful and a widow of a martyr at the same time,\u201d Mr. Abu Mustafa said, using the word preferred by Palestinians for a killed fighter, often a terrorist to Israelis. She is the second of his two wives.\u201cWhen I get wealthy, I will marry the third wife.\u201dIts founder knows his demographic well: residents of the religiously conservative Gaza Strip, with its culture of resistance. Some 1,400 men have been killed in the three wars with Israel since 2008, leaving many widows who would like to remarry. Tradition, however, can make it difficult for them to wed single men.Mr. Abu Mustafa, 34, a math teacher, said he had no specific reasons to get married again, but said he did wish to give \u201cdignity\u201d to a widow. Ms. Abu Mustafa\u2019s first husband died during the conflict between Hamas and Israel in 2012.Islam permits a man to have up to four wives.\u201cOur men fight wars and die. Women stay alive,\u201d said the site\u2019s founder, Hashem Sheikha. \u201cThis is why my project supports polygamy.\u201dMr. Sheikha, 33, a Palestinian born in Saudi Arabia, said the site has led to 160 weddings since it started in March, he said, and more than half the marriage requests involved men seeking a second or third wife (though not yet a fourth).\u201cWe want to spread joy and connections between people\u201d and help them with \u201cfinding love and peace after going through a lot of suffering,\u201d he said.\u201cWomen who lost their men during the last three wars have difficult lives and few options,\u201d said Reham Owda, a Gaza-based writer and analyst of women\u2019s issues. \u201cIn most cases the husband\u2019s family pressures the woman to marry the brother in law to control her life and seize any financial aid she receives.\u201dMs. Owda added that if the widow\u2019s husband is affiliated with a political party, it might intervene and pressure the woman to marry a man from the same group, and she will often agree because she is struggling financially and the group will pay her a salary.\u201cThis matchmaking service is positive because it encourages these women to choose the potential husband without fear and pressure in this religious and patriarchal society,\u201d Ms. Owda said.Wesal not only facilitates marriages for widows, but also for the divorced and those who have never married.Part of Wesal\u2019s immediate success appears to be how closely it hews to Gazan tradition, despite the digital medium. When completing an application, people must address several questions important to those looking for a spouse here: place of residence, occupation, salary, marital status, number of children. And there are some traditional terms that users must accept: \u201cI swear by Allah the Great that all my information is accurate, and that I won\u2019t use this website for entertainment.\u201dWhat Wesal does not have is profile photos or any online chatting functionality, to protect the privacy of women and because both would be considered \u201charam,\u201d or forbidden under Islamic law, Mr. Sheikha said.\u201cWe are the halal version of American dating websites,\u201d he said, using the word that connotes what is acceptable under Islamic tradition.Wesal is ad-supported, plus a man and a woman who get married after meeting on the site are supposed to pay $100 each.Though popular, with some 100,000 visitors in a population of two million people in Gaza, the website is not universally liked.\u201cThis website is disgusting. Women are not a sack of onions,\u201d said Lina Zein, 25, a single woman from Gaza City, explaining that Wesal felt too transactional in its approach to arranging weddings. \u201cIt limits my ambitions in marriage to someone\u2019s income.\u201d .Amal Seyam, the head of the nongovernmental Gaza\u2019s Women Affairs Association, said the service appeared to have come at an opportune time to take advantage of changes in Gazan society.\u201cPolygamy has hit high rates in Gaza over the few past years, seemingly due to an increase in people\u2019s religious inclination, especially after Hamas took power in 2007,\u201d Ms. Seyam said, referring to the militant group that rules over Gaza.Marriage rates over all have been on the decline in Gaza, and divorce is on the rise because of high poverty and unemployment rates, said the head of the Supreme Sharia Judicial Council in Gaza, Sheikh Hassan al-Jojo. Hamas itself has been trying to encourage marriage by paying the equivalent of $1,500 to any male who memorizes the Quran, a bit of cash to help finance the next step in life.Sheikh Abdul Khaleq Buhaisi, another official with the Sharia Council, which has authority over weddings, said he preferred more traditionally arranged marriages, often through a khattaba \u2014 a woman who pays home visits in the company of the groom\u2019s mother to search for brides.The khattaba inspects the prospective bride: body shape, skin color, teeth, hair and other physical features. Traditionally, the polite way for a groom\u2019s family to signal a proposal request is to ask to go to the bride\u2019s family\u2019s house for a cup of coffee.With the Wesal service, a prospective groom receives a woman\u2019s address when the two have exchanged \u201clikes\u201d online. The man then has 48 hours to propose, something still typically done over the traditional coffee at her home.Kholoud Sobouh, 27, said she got tired of being shown to men who knocked on her door with their mothers to propose. Through Wesal, she and her fianc\u00e9 met in less than 24 hours. She requested an educated man who didn\u2019t smoke and who could secure a home in Gaza. Her fianc\u00e9, Tareq \u2014 Ms. Sobouh did not want to give his surname, for fear of being criticized for meeting her spouse online \u2014 said he wanted a tall, light-skinned woman with religious manners. It will be the first marriage for both.\u201cWesal service is the best discovery of my life,\u201d Ms. Sobouh said. \u201cI am the one who will get married, not my family or the society.\u201dIn some cases, Wesal\u2019s founder acts something like a traditional khattaba.Nour Ahmad, 25, left Gaza after her family finally agreed to let her marry a Palestinian man living in Saudi Arabia.\u201cThe founder of Wesal came to my family and convinced them that the man is honest and wants to marry me,\u201d Ms. Ahmad said. \u201cI said yes because I wanted a man who is not jobless, who has a good life and works on his future.\u201dMr. Sheikha, Wesal\u2019s founder, says he wants the site to challenge longstanding customs surrounding matchmaking in Gaza, and to give women more agency in the process. \u201cOur website encourages them to search for husbands by themselves, to truly choose and say what they like in the man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also fight old traditions that say divorced women should not get married.\u201dBut while Mr. Sheikha is in favor of more options for women in the selection of a spouse, he is not a strong supporter of the choice to remain single. In addition to helping widows and the divorced find husbands, he said he hoped the site would also address \u201can increase in the number of spinsters in their 20s and 30s. The Arabic proverb says living in the shadow of a man is better than living in the shadow of a wall, which means that having a husband is better than staying unmarried.\u201dMr. Sheikha said he was currently looking for a second wife himself and that he preferred she be a widow.The site has also found favor among divorced men.Rami Shatali, 38, works in a biscuit factory, earns less than 1,000 shekels a month, or not quite $300, and has four daughters living with him in the Al Maghazi refugee camp from an earlier marriage that ended in divorce.His new wife, Majd Shatali, 26, also divorced and with a son, found him on Wesal in March.About 400 hundred people attended their wedding. The first dance was the couple\u2019s slow one.The groom\u2019s daughters, along with the son of the bride, danced happily. From time to time, relatives of the groom sprayed glitter and wedding snow in the air.\u201cI felt like I was the happiest man in the world on my wedding day,\u201d Mr. Shatali said, \u201cbecause I found a woman who madly fell in love with me, the one who could make me forget all about my pain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia Grapples With Campus Assaults, and Reprisals Against Victims", "Date": "2017-06-21", "News": "Supported byCANBERRA, Australia \u2014 Female students who have spoken out about sexual assault and harassment on Australian university campuses have returned to their dorm rooms to find them flooded with water.Others came home to defaced dorm doors or mattresses that had been urinated on.When Emily Jones, a third-year student, asked a group of men to stop encircling women during a barroom tradition \u2014 in which men drop their pants and sing when the Australian song \u201cEagle Rock\u201d is played \u2014 she was ostracized by friends and condemned by the news media for joining the \u201cfun police.\u201d\u201cRather than being happy to make a compromise because so many women were feeling unsafe, they\u2019d rather just keep having a good time,\u201d Ms. Jones, 22, said in an interview on campus here. \u201cI was very disheartened.\u201d\u201cIt is standard, in fact, that when a student exposes sexism or misogyny in their own university they are almost always met with horrendous backlash and ostracism, including reprisals,\u201d said Nina Funnell, a victims\u2019 advocate and writer. \u201cThat\u2019s incredibly common in Australia.\u201dAustralian university officials \u2014 especially at the two elite universities facing the most criticism, Australian National and Sydney \u2014 insist that they are tackling the problem head on.Sydney University recently set up a rape hotline and improved training for staff, said Tyrone Carlin, deputy vice chancellor. A.N.U. introduced a sexual consent training course for all first-year students this year, said Richard Baker, pro vice chancellor of the university.How are public institutions in Australia responding to sexual assault and sexual harassment? To inform our coverage, we\u2019re asking readers to contribute their stories.The Australian Human Rights Commission is also conducting a survey of 39,000 students at 39 Australian universities to map the full extent of the problem.But many students question the universities\u2019 commitment. They say that it is still common for complaints to linger without a university response; for men accused of, say, rating women\u2019s bodies on social media to receive little punishment; and for there to be little coordination at a national level.The activists say their demands are reasonable: a university hotline that offers help from a trained trauma professional, required sexual consent training and a clear and transparent system for adjudicating complaints.At Sydney University, for example, the Safer Communities Working Group set up more than a year ago in part to deal with sexual assault is seen by some students as window dressing.\u201cI was pretty hopeful, maybe na\u00efvely, coming into it, thinking we could bring students\u2019 concerns there and they would be addressed,\u201d said Anna Hush, 23, a philosophy student who was part of the group last year. \u201cBut it was much more them telling us what they were doing rather than us contributing to decisions being made.\u201dKatie Thorburn, 22, the student government co-women\u2019s officer at Sydney University, said that school officials initially resisted a pilot program for sexual consent education, then bristled at questions about why they ended up choosing a voluntary quiz in which students could skip questions to reach the end.\u201cThey\u2019re tougher on plagiarism,\u201d Ms. Thorburn said.A Sydney University spokeswoman said they would review that concern as the program was used more widely.Some men on campus acknowledged a wider problem \u2014 \u201cthe treatment of women as sex objects first,\u201d as Harry Licence, 20, a second-year media and communications student, put it.In the most recent scandal, a student at St. Paul\u2019s, an elite residential college, posted a screed on Facebook comparing sex with large women to \u201charpooning a whale\u201d and offering advice on how to \u201cget rid of some chick\u201d after \u201crooting\u201d her.Mr. Licence, who has friends at St. Paul\u2019s, said that wherever privileged students from all-boys schools are concentrated, there is a lack of experience with treating women as equals.\u201cI think there are significant issues that come from living within that bubble,\u201d he said.In Canberra, Ms. Jones is still dealing with the consequences of that insularity.The \u201cEagle Rock\u201d incident happened on the dance floor of a bar in her former residential college, Burton and Garran, during a mixer last August. Ever since she wrote in April about the criticism she received after speaking out about it, she has not felt welcome there.Residents of her dorm started blasting \u201cEagle Rock,\u201d a 1971 Australian rock song often played at rugby games and bars, down the hallways. Some of her friends stopped talking to her and ignored her in the dining hall, common tactics, experts say.At A.N.U., officials have been grappling for more than a year with sexist incidents, especially in its residential colleges, most of which are independently governed living quarters, similar to American fraternities and sororities.Last year, university officials discovered a secret online group started by students at John XXIII, a prestigious Catholic residential college, who were sharing pictures of students\u2019 breasts and rating them on Facebook.In March, four male students there were caught chanting graphic sexual rhymes about \u201cnailing\u201d women.In both cases, the students were disciplined, and some suspended. Burton and Garran Hall has also officially prohibited the encircling of women when \u201cEagle Rock\u201d is played.Jane O\u2019Dwyer, an Australian National spokeswoman, said the university was working to address a nationwide problem. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural issue in Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a hypermasculine society.\u201dThat culture, advocates say, means serious cases still go unpunished.\u201cWe all know women who have been raped,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cWhat ends up usually happening to the perpetrator is they just either do nothing or move them to another college. It reminds me of the way the Catholic Church moved the priests along.\u201dThe End Rape on Campus report, based on public records at 27 of the country\u2019s universities, found that 575 complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault made to Australian universities in the last five years resulted in only six expulsions.Australian National officials say they are still trying to improve their response to the problem.\u201cThe university is reviewing all of its policies and procedures to see if we can further enhance their transparency and fairness,\u201d Professor Baker said.But the universities have a long way to go if they want to cleanse the toxic atmosphere that drove a Sydney University student to the brink last fall.Then the personal photos that decorated her dorm door started disappearing, one a day.\u201cWhat hurt so much was the fact that people I lived with, whom I had come to think of as my family, would purposely try to make me feel like scum,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were trying, albeit in a pretty pathetic and cowardly way, to run me out of my home.\u201dFinally, when there was only one picture left, Ms. Landis-Hanley took it down herself.As she wrote on Facebook, \u201cI was taken to hospital that night for being suicidal.\u201dJacqueline Williams reported from Canberra, and Damien Cave from Sydney.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No, Your Phone Didn\u2019t Ring. So Why Voice Mail From a Telemarketer?", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAt first, I thought I was crazy,\u201d said Mr. Kemp, a video editor in Dover, Del. \u201cWhen I checked my voice mail, it made me really angry. It was literally a telemarketing voice mail to try to sell telemarketing systems.\u201dMr. Kemp had just experienced a technology gaining traction called ringless voice mail, the latest attempt by telemarketers and debt collectors to reach the masses. The calls are quietly deposited through a back door, directly into a voice mail box \u2014 to the surprise and (presumably) irritation of the recipient, who cannot do anything to block them.Regulators are considering whether to ban these messages. They have been hearing from ringless voice mail providers and pro-business groups, which argue that these messages should not qualify as calls and, therefore, should be exempt from consumer protection laws that ban similar types of telephone marketing.But consumer advocates, technology experts, people who have been inundated with these calls and the lawyers representing them say such an exemption would open the floodgates. Consumers\u2019 voice mail boxes would be clogged with automated messages, they say, making it challenging to unearth important calls, whether they are from an elderly mother\u2019s nursing home or a child\u2019s school.More specifically, All About the Message wants the F.C.C. to rule that its voice mail messages are not calls, and therefore can be delivered by automatic telephone dialing systems using an artificial or prerecorded voice. In its petition, the company argued that the law \u201cdoes not impose liability for voice mail messages\u201d when they are delivered directly to a voice mail service provider and subscribers are not charged for a call.\u201cThe act of depositing a voice mail on a voice mail service without dialing a consumers\u2019 cellular telephone line does not result in the kind of disruptions to a consumer\u2019s life \u2014 dead air calls, calls interrupting consumers at inconvenient times or delivery charges to consumers,\u201d All About the Message wrote. The company\u2019s lawyer declined to comment.If the commission rules against it, All About the Message said, it wants a retroactive waiver to relieve the company and its customers of any liability and \u201cpotentially substantial damages\u201d for voice mail already delivered.The company has reason to ask. Even though it started business just last year, one of All About the Message\u2019s customers \u2014 an auto dealer \u2014 is already facing a lawsuit involving a consumer who received repeated messages. Tom Mahoney, who said he received four voice mail messages from Naples Nissan in 2016, is the lead plaintiff in a suit filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.According to the suit, the parties in the case have reached a tentative agreement to settle all claims. Lawyers for both Mr. Mahoney and Naples Nissan declined to comment.The suit said that Mr. Mahoney\u2019s daughter had received similar messages \u2014 advertising zero-interest auto financing \u2014 and that neither he nor she had given the company consent.Josh Justice, chief executive of Stratics Networks, said its technology \u2014 which can send out 100 ringless voice mail messages a minute \u2014 had existed for 10 years and had not caused a widespread nuisance. It was intended for businesses like hospitals, dentist\u2019s and doctor's offices, banks, and shipping companies to reach customers, for example, and for \u201cresponsible marketing.\u201d\u201cThe concept of ringless voice mail was to develop a nonnuisance form of messaging or a nonintrusive alternative to robocalls,\u201d Mr. Justice said.He contends that telemarketers should be able to use ringless voice mail messages as long as they do so responsibly \u2014 that is, skipping over consumers on the \u201cDo Not Call\u201d list, identifying who is leaving the message and giving people a way to opt out. But he said he did not believe that ringless voice mail needed to be subject to the same regulations as other calls \u2014 unless regulators find that the messages are generating complaints or being used inappropriately.Consumer advocates and other experts argue that the courts and the F.C.C. have already established that technology similar to ringless voice mail \u2014 which delivered mass automated texts to cellphones \u2014 was deemed the same as calls and was covered by the consumer protection law.\u201cThese companies are only spinning an incorrect interpretation of the regulations and the definition of the word \u2018call,\u2019\u201d said Randall Snyder, a telecommunications engineering consultant and expert witness in more than 100 cases involving related regulations.\u201cDefinitions of words in regulations and statutes are legal issues,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there is certainly lots of common sense here.\u201d\u201cPolitical organizations like the R.N.C. use all manner of communications to discuss political and governmental issues and to solicit donations \u2014 including direct-to-voice-mail messages,\u201d the committee said in its letter to the commission.Justin T. Holcombe, a consumer lawyer and partner at Skaar & Feagle in Woodstock, Ga., said the commission\u2019s ruling would have implications for just about everyone. If ringless voice mail could avoid consumer protection rules, \u201cit would be a free-for-all,\u201d he said.Mr. Kemp, the video editor in Delaware who received the ringless voice mail message, said in recent weeks that he had been targeted by robocallers advertising vehicle financing, even though he owns his truck outright. His strategy? He goes through the menu prompts, acting as if he were interested; when he finally reaches a live person, he angrily demands that his number be removed from the caller\u2019s list.\u201cHasn\u2019t worked yet,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a good stress reliever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Takes Credit for Saudi Move Against Qatar, a U.S. Military Partner", "Date": "2017-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump thrust himself into a bitter Persian Gulf dispute on Tuesday, taking credit for Saudi Arabia\u2019s move to isolate its smaller neighbor, Qatar, and rattling his national security staff by upending a critical American strategic relationship.Those contradictory roles may explain the mixed signals the administration sent after Saudi Arabia\u2019s unexpected move. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis initially tried on Monday to smooth over the rift, with Mr. Tillerson offering to play peacemaker and Mr. Mattis insisting it would have no effect on the campaign against the Islamic State.Less than 12 hours later, however, Mr. Trump discarded that approach by putting his thumb on the scale firmly in Saudi Arabia\u2019s favor. His tweets, which a senior White House official said were not a result of any policy deliberation, sowed confusion about America\u2019s strategy and its intentions toward a key military partner.Additionally, officials in Jordan said on Tuesday that the country would downgrade its diplomatic relations with Qatar and revoke the license of the Doha-based television channel Al Jazeera, Reuters reported.On Tuesday evening, the president appeared to be trying to ease tensions. In a call with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump said that unity among gulf nations was \u201ccritical to defeating terrorism and promoting regional stability,\u201d according to a White House statement.\u201cThe U.S. still wants to see this issue de-escalated and resolved immediately, keeping with the principles that the president laid out in terms of defeating terror financing,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.Mr. Spicer denied that the president was taking sides. He said Mr. Trump had had a \u201cvery productive\u201d discussion with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the 37-year-old emir of Qatar, during his visit to Riyadh. But another person briefed on the conversation said it had been noticeably colder than the president\u2019s meetings with other gulf leaders.There was little immediate threat to American military facilities in Qatar, administration officials and outside analysts said, not least because Qatar views America\u2019s military presence as an insurance policy against the aggressive moves of its neighbors.But the mood there was jittery. Government officials and news outlets described the cutoff of diplomatic relations, travel and trade as a \u201csiege\u201d and even as an attempt at a coup.Those jitters have been intensified by suspicions that Russia was behind a cyberattack that published fake information on Qatar\u2019s state news agency \u2014 a claim the United States is investigating, according to an official briefed on the inquiry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official said it was unclear whether the hackers were state-sponsored.An American diplomat warned that there was a temptation to blame malicious acts on the Russian government before the evidence had been weighed. But the same diplomat noted that Russia had much to gain from divisions among Iran\u2019s rivals in the region, particularly if they made it more difficult for the United States to use Qatar as a major base.\u201cFor sure, this is an attempt at regime change,\u201d said Jamal Elshayyal, a senior producer for Al Jazeera, the Qatari-owned news channel that many in the region accuse of spreading extremist ideas.Pentagon officials said they, too, were taken aback by Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, particularly given the American military\u2019s deep ties to Qatar. The military has been eager to avoid political quarrels with the Qataris, a goal reflected in statements by its spokesmen.\u201cThe United States and the coalition are grateful to the Qataris for their longstanding support of our presence and their enduring commitment to regional security,\u201d Lt. Col. Damien Pickart, spokesman for the Air Force component of the Central Command, said on Monday.Al Udeid Air Base, outside the Qatari capital, Doha, is home to more than 11,000 American and coalition service members. Mr. Mattis made a point of visiting in April, spending three nights in Doha, where he met with the emir.On Tuesday, an American diplomat in Doha said that Qatar\u2019s relationship with the United States was \u201cstrong\u201d and that it had made strides: prosecuting people suspected of funding terrorist groups, freezing assets and putting stringent controls on its banks.Not for the first time, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments differed sharply from those of his top national security aides.\u201cWe certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told reporters in Sydney, Australia, where he and Mr. Mattis were meeting with officials on Monday.Mr. Mattis added, \u201cI am positive there will be no implications coming out of this dramatic situation at all.\u201dIn addition to hosting the air command center, Qatar is the home of the forward headquarters of the United States Central Command and an American intelligence hub in the Middle East.It also has deep ties to American academia, providing funding and property to build Middle Eastern campuses for six major universities, including Cornell, Georgetown and Northwestern.Qatar\u2019s financing of radical groups has long been a source of tension with Washington. But the United States has generally avoided taking sides in the regional feuds in the Persian Gulf, because it has strategic partnerships with several countries and most of them, including Saudi Arabia, have a record of financing extremist groups.\u201cClearly, the Saudis and the Emiratis felt they had someone in the White House who would take their side,\u201d said Robert Malley, who coordinated Middle East policy in the Obama administration. \u201cThis puts Qatar in a tough position: Either make a dramatic policy shift or face deeper isolation.\u201dOthers analysts were more critical, saying the Saudis had exploited Mr. Trump by seizing on the good will generated during his visit to carry out a long-planned move against a smaller neighbor.\u201cThe Saudis played Donald Trump like a fiddle,\u201d said Bruce O. Riedel, a former intelligence analyst who advised Mr. Obama and now works at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe unwittingly encouraged their worst instincts toward their neighbors.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Spicer described persistent questions about the episode as \u201ca bit silly,\u201d saying Mr. Trump\u2019s mere presence at the NATO ceremony was evidence of the American commitment to mutual defense.Reporting was contributed by David D. Kirkpatrick from Doha, Qatar; Michael R. Gordon, Helene Cooper and David E. Sanger from Washington; Patrick Kingsley from Istanbul; and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dorm Troopers: Life as a College Security Guard", "Date": "2017-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusCanterbury, England \u2014 A wallet soaked in urine with nothing inside except a driver\u2019s license from Bermuda. That\u2019s probably the weirdest thing I\u2019ve had to file in the lost and found, the handling of which I help oversee as a security guard at Canterbury Christ Church University in England.I\u2019ve had the job for over 10 years, and I still enjoy it as much as the night I started, when the manager handed me a Maglite torch and a set of keys so heavy they made my trousers sound like wind chimes.The spring term is ending. After a few more weeks of exams, parties and paralyzing hangovers, the students will attend an annual summer ball and leave campus. Once everything has been swept up, it will be security\u2019s job to help look after the summer conference guests. University staff and Ph.D. students will also still be here, working through the break.If someone asked me to describe my job in a sentence, I\u2019d say it\u2019s to keep students, staff and visitors safe. Patching up students who\u2019ve hurt themselves, or who are lonely and want to talk, is always my top priority. Other routine duties include stopping fire alarms, locking doors and watching CCTV. And very occasionally, taking calls from a parent who\u2019s convinced a ghost has stolen her son\u2019s crockery.On the day shift, my 12 hours of duty begin early \u2014 I\u2019m up when most students are just falling out of the taxi. I check on my sleeping daughter, then after squats and porridge, it\u2019s off to unlock all the buildings on campus so the teaching staff can start early.Unlike some campus security guards I\u2019ve seen on YouTube, my colleagues and I don\u2019t get to fly around on Segways or golf buggies. Every assignment, barring emergencies at remote sites, is completed on foot. The latest recruit to our shift says her Fitbit recorded almost 14 miles in one day. If you\u2019re running to provide first aid or chasing escaped ducklings out of the coffee shop, the mileage can be even more impressive. The longest I\u2019ve ever run in one go was the half mile from campus into the town center to find two winos passed out in both entrances to our finance building. It was rush hour, so the roads were clogged: I ran because driving would have been pointless. All the while, I kept praying that both intruders weren\u2019t violent or train wreck drunks.Throughout the day we\u2019re on call for everything from newly arrived freshmen \u2014 they often need directions, keys and reassurance \u2014 to royal visits and pizza deliveries. Our rule of thumb is to treat everyone on campus, and in the immediate surroundings, the same: I\u2019ll never forget the call we got about an \u201cunconscious tramp\u201d in a toilet cubicle who turned out to be a tutor overindulging in Candy Crush on his lunch hour.We don\u2019t carry weapons, and we don\u2019t have the right to search students unless they agree to it. Luckily, it seems most drug users are smart enough to feed their habit outside of smell range. Still, there\u2019s always one student who thinks he can indulge in something illicit and still appear normal. To the ravers out there: Rest assured, our teen years and twenties were spent as recklessly as yours. When you come to us for help with pupils like tunnels and a gleaming forehead, we know it\u2019s not because you\u2019re carsick.Inspiration, of course, can take many forms. Some of the drinking games these students come up with should be televised sports. I only hope those who invent them go into events management.Every once in a while, we security guards are called to help out with the problems of nonstudents who live near campus. For example, we helped a local bloke locate his girlfriend after a night of unanswered text messages, and once rehoused several families whose apartment complex caught fire. We\u2019ve also acted as go-betweens when students get into turf wars, like when a group of second-years confronted a 60-year-old neighbor armed with an ongoing noise complaint and a frying pan.The security team has a wide range of background skills to bring to the table however trouble may strike. On my shift alone there\u2019s an ex-dockworker, a business graduate with a master\u2019s degree, a nurse, soldiers and two no-nonsense bikers. I pity any hoodlums who fall afoul of one member of our night crew, an Italian former armed guard who\u2019s had a short fuse ever since Brexit.Before I started in the job, I had the same image of the campus guard in my head as you did: a bloke too fat for the cops, or a mixed martial-arts nerd. Guards like that exist, but they don\u2019t tend to last. Once they realize you do more talking in this job than throwing punches, and take one look at the salary, they check out. It\u2019s true, the money\u2019s not fantastic, but I wouldn\u2019t want to do anything else. The buzz I get from helping people is up there with scoring a football goal, or perhaps, remembering a password I thought I\u2019d forgotten. Plus, I get to see people shaping their futures every day. Who\u2019d want to swap that for breathing office air?George Bass is a security guard at Canterbury Christ Church University in England.Advertisement"}

Eliot Spitzer, wrote a formula for financing schools, called Foundation Aid.The case was allowed to go forward focused only on New York City and Syracuse, where Nyser\u2019s lawyers had made detailed arguments. That part may now go to trial.\u201cWe were hoping for a streamlined resolution of these issues, and the court didn\u2019t give us that,\u201d said Douglas T. Schwarz, one of the lawyers representing the Nyser coalition. \u201cThey said our claims are viable, we just need to establish them in a way that is going to take some more time and some more work.\u201dJudge Wilson also threw out a related suit on Tuesday, Miriam Aristy-Farer v. State of New York, which had been consolidated with the Nyser case on appeal. That case claimed that the state\u2019s one-time withholding of $290 million from New York City, because it had failed to comply with teacher performance legislation, violated the state Constitution.In a separate opinion, Judge Jenny Rivera disagreed with much of the majority\u2019s ruling. She cited how long the Campaign for Fiscal Equality litigation took \u2014 more than 20 years \u2014 and said that \u201cin the interim, generations of children were denied the education guaranteed by our state Constitution.\u201d\u201cAgainst the tide of this court\u2019s prior decisions, the majority\u2019s holding makes it all but impossible to address constitutional violations other than through burdensome piecemeal litigation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe result will be that meritorious claims will go unfiled, due in part to a lack of litigation resources and the inability of parents and children to wait decades for a possible victory from which they will never benefit directly.\u201dThe governor\u2019s office released a statement praising the dismissal of several major claims against the state.\u201cThe truth is that New York dedicates more money per pupil to education than any other state \u2014 including over $25.8 billion in this year\u2019s budget,\u201d Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said in a statement, \u201cand we\u2019ll continue to work to strengthen our public schools and provide New York children with the education they deserve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Comedy, the Voice of a Polite Nation, Rises in the Trump Era", "Date": "2017-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterTORONTO \u2014 Canadians have a lot to process these days. Immigration is changing society. The Trump presidency is altering Canada\u2019s place in the world and filling its airwaves with the neighbor\u2019s issues.Canadians are turning, as they long have in times of uncertainty, to comedy.\u201cCanadians really do identify themselves a great deal through comedy,\u201d said Cory Gibson, the field producer of \u201cThis Hour Has 22 Minutes,\u201d a long-running Canadian satirical news show.\u201cIt\u2019s one of our national pastimes,\u201d Mr. Gibson added. \u201cPolitical comedy and hockey.\u201dAll societies deal with major issues through humor. But that is especially true of Canada, which exports comedians the way France exports wine: Samantha Bee, Seth Rogen, Jim Carrey and many early stars on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d whose impresario, Lorne Michaels, is Canadian as well.In Canada, humor has become a way of pushing back against America\u2019s cultural and political dominance, like a class clown subtly undermining the teacher. Its changing comedy offers a lens into how the nation is changing, too.President Trump\u2019s election has been a boon to Canadian comedians, and not just for the quirks and the missteps that have made him a focus of American comedy. Here, Trump jokes often come with the punch line that his election proves Canada\u2019s superiority.\u201cIt gave Canadians a great excuse to do our favorite fallback, which is, \u2018Well, it\u2019s better than America,\u2019\u201d said Susan Kent, a cast member on \u201c22 Minutes.\u201d\u201cMrs. Trump, this is the third time this week,\u201d the officer tells her. After next catching Hillary Clinton, he tells the camera, \u201cI feel bad sending them back there.\u201d\u201cThe Beaverton,\u201d a satirical news show, had its first episode on Nov. 10.Luke Gordon Field, a producer, said pleasing Canadian audiences with jokes about the United States could feel too easy \u2014 sometimes for uncomfortable reasons.\u201cIn Canada, we will always default to superiority.\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our go-to move. But it\u2019s an interesting form of superiority, where it\u2019s coupled with a desire for recognition from Americans. The only thing audiences love more than a comic who mocks the United States is one who finds success there.\u201dMuch as American comedy often wrestles with issues of race, Canada\u2019s focuses on a different question of coexistence: life next to the larger, louder United States.Ann Pornel, a cast member at Second City Toronto, a sketch and improvisational comedy theater, offered the metaphor of something \u201cthat everybody can smell and nobody likes it, but we\u2019re all too polite to say, \u2018What is that?\u2019\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the Canadian identity: We\u2019re the ones in a room full of farts who don\u2019t say anything,\u201d Ms. Pornel continued. \u201cI\u2019m O.K. with that. Because we\u2019re the ones who smelt it, not the ones who dealt it.\u201dThe current main stage show, \u201cEverything Is Great Again,\u201d repeatedly lampoons Mr. Trump and his supporters but never mentions him by name.Meant as a jab, it underscores the omnipresence of American politics and culture that so rankles Canadians. Even when mocked and supposedly ignored, the United States is the center of attention.In the opening joke, a family welcomes refugees whose \u201ccountry has been torn apart.\u201d They are revealed to be from Michigan. Subsequent skits turn on an Ohio autoworker whose politics are challenged by schoolchildren and a man who frets that \u201cCanada\u2019s going to end up like the States.\u201dThe show\u2019s full-cast song name-checks Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.Try to imagine an American audience laughing at a passing reference to, say, Canada\u2019s finance minister. (It\u2019s Bill Morneau, by the way, and he manages the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.) That Canadians go for this is a sign of just how overwhelmed they are by all things American \u2014 a source of endless irritation, alleviated by taking the culprits down a peg.Several comedians said that they tried to push Canadians to see problems in their own country, but that American portrayals of Canada as a paradise made this more difficult.\u201cOur identity is smug complacency,\u201d Brandon Hackett, another cast member, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the Ontario license plate slogan: \u2018Smugly Complacent.\u2019\u201dThe pinnacle of this resistance came with the 2001 TV special \u201cTalking to Americans,\u201d in which the comedian Rick Mercer asked Americans ever more ridiculous questions about Canada to expose their ignorance.A Columbia professor eagerly signs a petition to discourage Canadians from putting their elders on ice floes. Mike Huckabee, then the governor of Arkansas, congratulates Canada on its national igloo.Asked whether \u201cAmerica should be bombing Saskatchewan,\u201d New Yorkers respond, \u201cAbsolutely\u201d and \u201cIf that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to have to do, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to have to do.\u201dThe show attracted 2.7 million viewers, a record. Mr. Mercer, in an interview, attributed its success to something subtler than a love of teasing the national older brother.\u201cI think Canadians have always been a little envious of the Americans, that they have \u2018Mom, the flag and apple pie,\u2019\u201d he said. But whenever Canadians try to define themselves, he added, they \u201cimmediately start talking about how we\u2019re different from the United States.\u201dThat is part of why Mr. Mercer now focuses his humor on Canada.He is sometimes called Canada\u2019s Jon Stewart for his sharp-edged political commentary. Another comparison might be Garrison Keillor, the road-touring radio host and purveyor of Americana.\u201cThe question of what it means to be Canadian, what the Canadian identity is, has confused Canadians for about 150 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe population is so spread out. The maple leaf doesn\u2019t even grow all over Canada.\u201dSome comedians, rather than breaking free of their nation\u2019s junior status, embrace it.She highlighted a series of skits from the early-1990s sketch comedy show \u201cThe Kids in the Hall,\u201d in which Scott Thompson plays Buddy Cole, a gay Canadian actor who delivers wry monologues, often about his identity.\u201cAmericans know as much about Canada as straight people do about gays,\u201d the character said in one of the skits. \u201cWhen I\u2019m overseas and people mistake me for an American, I\u2019m as outraged as when they mistake me for straight.\u201dBut Buddy is undeterred: \u201cOn my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, my agent replaced the word \u2018gay\u2019 with \u2018blond\u2019 and \u2018Canadian\u2019 with \u2018outdoorsy.\u2019 So I replaced \u2018outdoorsy\u2019 with \u2018blousy,\u2019 which makes me a blousy blond.\u201dSuch portrayals of Canadianness, Ms. Deveau wrote, were \u201cboth critical and optimistic, a paradox that works its way through much of Canadian popular culture.\u201dMany comic portrayals of Canadian identity revel in some form of second-class status. Main characters are typically lovable outsiders, often rural and working-class.The TV mockumentary \u201cTrailer Park Boys,\u201d for instance, follows the down-on-their-luck residents of a Nova Scotia trailer park. Since the show\u2019s 2001 premiere, its troublemaking characters have become something like national mascots. And \u201cLetterkenny,\u201d a new show based in small-town Ontario, is drawing critical praise.Mr. Gibson of \u201c22 Minutes\u201d called this \u201cCanadiana,\u201d a form of heartland-cherishing, proudly weird humor that has had a resurgence in recent years.As Canada becomes an increasingly urban and immigrant nation, that identity is being explored through a new strain of Canadiana outsider comedy. \u201cKim\u2019s Convenience,\u201d based on a play of the same name by the South Korean-born Ins Choi, follows immigrant families in Toronto\u2019s diverse suburbs.\u201cWhat I love about the last few years of working in Canadian comedy is that there\u2019s more interest in our country, and not defining ourselves by what Americans think about us,\u201d said Mr. Field, producer of \u201cThe Beaverton.\u201d As a nation, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a little more self-confidence in what we do.\u201dAsked when Canadians found their pride, Ms. Kent joked, \u201cWhen Trudeau made it into Vogue.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the job title of Cory Gibson on the satirical news show \u201cThis Hour Has 22 Minutes.\u201d He is the field producer, not the show runner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is North Carolina the Future of American Politics?", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "FeatureThe state is narrowly split between Democratic and Republican Parties that agree on virtually nothing. Are its scorched-earth politics what the rest of us have to look forward to?Supported byReaction to the bill was swift and brutal. The National Basketball Association pulled its All-Star game from Charlotte, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association canceled its championship events in the state, where the church of college basketball rivals the Southern Baptist Convention. PayPal and Deutsche Bank, among other corporations, scuttled multimillion-dollar plans to expand their North Carolina operations. An analysis estimated that the bathroom bill, as H.B. 2 came to be known, would cost North Carolina $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years.The mood at what was supposed to be the Air Horn Orchestra\u2019s final official performance, the Wednesday before November\u2019s election, was joyous, and not just because the group believed it had set a Guinness world record that evening for the most people (347) to simultaneously blow air horns. Cooper was ahead of McCrory in the polls, and when he was later declared the winner by 10,000 votes \u2014 providing national Democrats one of their only bright spots in 2016 \u2014 some of the Air Horn Orchestra\u2019s members reunited for an impromptu victory march through downtown Raleigh. \u201cWe thought our jobs were done,\u201d says Grayson Haver Currin, who founded the group with his wife, Tina. They threw away their instruments or sold them on Craigslist, none of them expecting that they would need them again less than five months later, to antagonize the very man they had just helped install in the governor\u2019s mansion.Cooper, after all, owed his election to H.B. 2. The law, his campaign\u2019s chief strategist, Morgan Jackson, told me, \u201ccrystallized every argument against McCrory that we had.\u201d As soon as Cooper was elected, he made getting rid of H.B. 2 his top priority. But negotiations with the Republican leaders of the General Assembly proved frustrating. \u201cIt seems that the goal posts keep moving,\u201d Cooper complained to me in March. Later that month, he finally reached a deal: In exchange for the General Assembly\u2019s repealing the law, which would bring back business and basketball, the governor would sign legislation that prohibited North Carolina cities from passing local ordinances relating to public accommodations or employment practices until 2020. (It was Charlotte\u2019s passage of a nondiscrimination ordinance in early 2016 that prompted the General Assembly to pass H.B. 2 in the first place.) \u201cI had a choice between some progress,\u201d Cooper later told me, \u201cor no progress.\u201dUnfortunately for Cooper, many of his allies disagreed with his choice. More than a third of the Democrats in the General Assembly voted against his compromise. It passed anyway, and on the day in late March that Cooper signed it into law, the Haver Currins sprang into action. They printed T-shirts that read \u201cCAN YOU HEAR US NOW, ROY?\u201d and a friend hit every Walmart superstore within 30 miles of Raleigh to buy up their air-horn inventories. That evening the Air Horn Orchestra reassembled at the governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cWith all the other performances there was a real sense of hope,\u201d recalls Tina Haver Currin, \u201cbut this time there was just despair.\u201d Or, as one orchestra member\u2019s sign plaintively put it, \u201cWTF ROY?\u201dWelcome to North Carolina circa 2017, where all the passions and pathologies of American politics writ large are played out writ small \u2014 and with even more intensity. Ever since 2010, when Republicans seized control of the General Assembly for the first time in a century, and especially since 2012, when they took the governor\u2019s mansion, the state\u2019s politics have been haywire. \u201cThere\u2019s been a bigger and quicker shift to the right here than in any other state in the country,\u201d says Rob Christensen, a longtime political writer for The News and Observer newspaper in Raleigh.In just a few years, North Carolina Republicans have not just run quickly through the conservative policy checklist; they\u2019ve tried to permanently skew the balance of power in the state in their favor, passing some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country and drawing some of the most egregiously gerrymandered congressional and state legislative districts in modern American politics (though their moves have repeatedly failed to pass muster with the courts). Cooper\u2019s victory, and the blowback to H.B. 2 that preceded it, seemed to suggest a chastening of the party \u2014 until Republicans contested the election results with a series of baseless allegations of voter fraud and legal challenges that left the state in limbo for four weeks before McCrory finally conceded.Then, before Cooper was even sworn in, the General Assembly \u2014 in which Republicans had retained their decisive majority in November \u2014 tried to strip him of many of his executive powers. Cooper, in turn, sued the Republican leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives to gain back those powers. What began as a grudge match now looks more like a free-for-all \u2014 and nobody\u2019s partisans, as the Air Horn Orchestra informed Cooper in March, are in the mood for compromise. \u201cIt\u2019s more polarized and more acrimonious than I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Carter Wrenn, a veteran North Carolina Republican political consultant, told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen some pretty acrimonious politics,\u201d he hastened to add. \u201cI worked for Jesse Helms.\u201dIn the last seven years, however, North Carolina has fallen four spots in the Social Science Research Council\u2019s Measure of America report ranking states on health, income and education \u2014 a decline that coincides with the state\u2019s turn toward Republican hegemony. In one sense, North Carolina\u2019s current politics and policies are of a piece with the rightward lurch of state governments across the United States in the past decade, as Republicans have consolidated power in two-thirds of the country\u2019s statehouses and inculcated a climate of partisan impunity. In Texas, Republican legislators recently approved sweeping new abortion restrictions that seem to resurrect some of the very same laws the United States Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional last year; in Kansas, an experiment in extreme supply-side economics has left the state with a $300 million budget shortfall. In North Carolina, the General Assembly has similarly green-lit the largest tax cuts in state history, blocked Medicaid expansion, slashed state unemployment benefits, relaxed gun laws and created new school-voucher programs.But then there are the things that send Raleigh political reporters scrambling for the \u201cFUBAR meter,\u201d a rulerlike piece of wood that hangs in the North Carolina legislative building\u2019s press room to quantify the political craziness of the day. For instance, Republicans\u2019 passage in 2013 of a voter-ID law that also eliminated same-day voter registration, severely curtailed early voting and ended out-of-precinct voting \u2014 restrictions, a federal court later ruled, that \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d Or last year\u2019s H.B. 2, which Republicans passed with such haste in an \u201cemergency\u201d special session that Democratic lawmakers walked out of the Senate in protest. Or the surprise special session Republicans called last December, with only two hours notice, to curb the newly elected Democratic governor\u2019s executive powers. That one rated a 9.46 on the FUBAR meter, which now rarely dips below 7.What really distinguishes North Carolina is that, unlike deep red Kansas or Texas, it is a quintessentially purple state. Its voters are almost evenly split between Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliateds. (This fall, unaffiliateds are actually expected to surpass Republicans as the state\u2019s second-biggest voting group.) The schisms within its electorate, like the national divisions they broadly resemble, fall between its cities and its rural areas, between a reverence for its past and a plan for its future. \u201cThat\u2019s what contributes to the meanness and paralysis of North Carolina politics,\u201d says Mac McCorkle, a former Democratic political consultant who\u2019s now a public-policy professor at Duke. \u201cIf it was clear it was an overwhelmingly Republican state, Republicans would be more relaxed. You might even see more progressive policies happen, like they do sometimes in more clear-cut red states like South Carolina or Tennessee. But we\u2019re so closely pitted, everything\u2019s a battle.\u201dThat battle, in recent years, has been a lopsided one. After Democrats\u2019 high-water mark in 2008 \u2014 when Barack Obama won the state and his coattails carried Democrats into the governor\u2019s office and a United States Senate seat \u2014 Republicans have steadily consolidated power. In 2011, they took advantage of the redistricting process to draw maps that turned their new state-legislative majorities into supermajorities and transformed the state\u2019s United States House delegation from one that had seven Democrats and six Republicans into one that had nine Republicans and four Democrats. In 2012, McCrory captured the governor\u2019s mansion, while Mitt Romney narrowly beat Obama in the state; in 2014, Republicans took back that Senate seat and picked up another seat in the House.Cooper\u2019s narrow victory last year might have boosted Democratic morale, but it didn\u2019t fundamentally alter the balance of power. Even the governor confesses to feeling beleaguered. \u201cFor decades, you could go across the country, and you\u2019d start talking to somebody and say you\u2019re from North Carolina, they\u2019d immediately talk about our universities or our Research Triangle Park,\u201d Cooper told me one morning this spring as we rode in the back seat of an S.U.V. ferrying him between photo ops. \u201cAnd now today it\u2019s often, \u2018What in the world is going on in North Carolina?\u2019 Because they don\u2019t understand why these things are happening in a state that they have known traditionally as a forward-thinking Southern state, a beacon in the South.\u201dCooper is a preternaturally cautious politician. When he was first elected to the State Legislature in 1986, as a 29-year-old county-seat lawyer, he was immediately hailed as a comer \u2014 a future governor or senator \u201cstraight from central casting,\u201d as the North Carolina representative David Price recalls. But his subsequent climb up the political ladder has been painstakingly slow. \u201cThe joke about Roy,\u201d says Gary Pearce, a veteran North Carolina Democratic strategist who first promoted Cooper as gubernatorial material some 30 years ago, \u201cis that he\u2019s been a rising star in four different decades.\u201d It is Cooper\u2019s misfortune to have finally arrived at his apparent destiny \u2014 his once-youthful face now wizened, his Lego-like helmet of hair streaked with gray \u2014 in a political climate that does not have much use for the sort of cautious, consensus-seeking governor he has spent his life preparing to be. Speaking to me in his office in the State Capitol later that day, he lamented this state of affairs. \u201cThey got hold of the maps in 2010,\u201d Cooper said, \u201cand it results in a polarized legislature where it\u2019s very difficult to get people elected to these offices who are truly interested in trying to achieve consensus.\u201dHise and the nearly three dozen other new Republican legislators who were swept into office seven years ago fundamentally changed the character of the General Assembly. For more than a century, Republicans weren\u2019t just in the minority in Raleigh; they were also, by and large, moderate. But the 2010 elections, in addition to giving Republicans control of both chambers, also tipped the G.O.P. caucus\u2019s balance of power away from the genteel old guard and toward a more aggressive, more ideological cadre of politicians. Suddenly, Republicans like Phil Berger \u2014 a stridently conservative lawyer from the struggling mill town of Eden, who became Senate president \u2014 were in charge. And with their newfound power, these Republicans immediately went to work trying \u201cto recover from 100 years of disaster,\u201d as one G.O.P. legislator put it at the time, and remaking the state in their image.As Hise sees things, the fight over the bathroom bill, like so many of the state\u2019s political battles, is really a proxy war in a larger, more existential struggle between the two North Carolinas. The state\u2019s metropolitan areas continue to prosper, with an influx of white-collar workers drawn to their thriving finance and technology sectors. But in North Carolina\u2019s rural communities, the tobacco, textile and manufacturing industries have collapsed, with little taking their place. The economic impact from the loss of sporting events and corporate expansions resulting from H.B. 2 wasn\u2019t felt in Hise\u2019s district. For him and his rural Republican colleagues, the bathroom bill was about something else. \u201cFaith is a much stronger component to the people in my district than I see here or in Charlotte or in the other urban areas,\u201d Hise said when we spoke in Raleigh. \u201cAnd when they see things that are forcing the state to move away from the deeply held religious beliefs that they have, they\u2019re not willing to accept that.\u201dWhen Hise moved back to his hometown, Spruce Pine, for family reasons in 2004, after spending several years in Maryland and Georgia working for the census and teaching at a university, he had to take a job packing furniture for two years before he was finally hired as an administrator at the local community college. Today he sees that practically every young person in his district with any education and ambition leaves to work in Charlotte or Raleigh or out of state \u2014 and unlike him, they don\u2019t come back. It rankles him when state officials celebrate the arrival of new tech firms or financial-services companies in those metro areas. \u201cIt\u2019s fish in a barrel,\u201d he complained. \u201cThe likelihood of those coming here is high without a lot of government involvement. But where it\u2019s really going to take work-force development and recruiting and economic incentives is to tag those industries that can come into this state and serve in one of the rural areas.\u201dThe ill will generated by this urban-rural imbalance is intense, and it finds many expressions. During a recent budget debate in the state Senate, for instance, Hise and his Republican colleagues grew so frustrated with Democratic delay tactics that at 3 a.m. they passed an amendment stripping $1 million in education funding from the districts of some of the Democratic senators who stood in their way. \u201cCompared to the overall budget,\u201d Hise assured me, \u201cit\u2019s a very small movement of money.\u201dOne reason Republican legislators can so unapologetically punish their Democratic colleagues is that, with G.O.P. supermajorities, the Democrats are essentially superfluous. But it may also be because Republican legislators don\u2019t have more pressing matters to worry about these days. Six years after taking control of the General Assembly, there simply aren\u2019t many big-ticket items left on their agenda. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the pent-up demand of a lot of members of the majority party who worked on legislation for a lot of years and could never get it to move,\u201d Hise told me. \u201cI think most of that legislation is done.\u201dBarber is a giant man with sleepy eyes and a permanent hunch \u2014 a result of a debilitating arthritic spinal condition. He is sufficiently infirm that he\u2019s uncomfortable sitting or standing, so most of the time he can be found propped up on a stool or leaning on a cane. But when Barber speaks in his rolling baritone, not just at the pulpit or on the Capitol steps but even in casual conversation, his back seems to straighten and his eyes come alive. \u201cOne of the great gifts of Pentecost was not that they spoke but that they heard,\u201d Barber said to his advisers, asking them to tell him what he should talk about the next day. \u201cI think about that other text in Isaiah that says, \u2018Oh Lord, open my ears every morning that I might hear and that I might have the tongue of the learned.\u2019\u2009\u201dFor many years Barber, who is 53, was a familiar but fringe figure in North Carolina politics, a frequent protester with little following or impact. \u201cHe was the resident wackadoodle,\u201d says Jonathan Felts, a North Carolina Republican political operative. \u201cEveryone knew who he was, and no one listened to him.\u201d Then on the last Monday of April in 2013, shortly after Republican lawmakers introduced an avalanche of conservative legislation that Barber deemed unusually \u201cextremist,\u201d he staged one of his protests in Raleigh. \u201cThis was the Easter season,\u201d Barber recalls, \u201cand we decided if they were going to crucify the poor, crucify the sick, crucify minorities, crucify public education, then every political crucifixion deserves a witness. So we had a service of self-purification.\u201dAfter an hour of prayer and protest inside the General Assembly building, Barber and seven fellow clergy members and nine activists \u2014 one of whom was in a wheelchair \u2014 were handcuffed and led away by the police. When Barber returned the next Monday to the General Assembly, he was joined by 100 protesters. The Monday after that it was 200. Within a few months, there were thousands. After a year of protests, more than 900 people had been arrested for civil disobedience. \u201cIt was almost as if folks were glad to have been shown a way,\u201d Barber says. \u201cIt became a gathering place for resistance.\u201d The Moral Monday movement, as it came to be known, was born.It\u2019s difficult to overstate the impact that the Moral Monday movement has had on North Carolina. In a narrow sense, it revived the state\u2019s Democratic Party. Although Barber emphasized that he was spearheading a moral rather than a partisan movement, the party was such a mess that he became its de facto leader. \u201cBarber really stepped in to fill the void of progressive leadership for Democrats here when they\u2019d been put out completely in the wilderness,\u201d says Tom Jensen, the director of the North Carolina-based Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling. McCrory won by 12 points in 2012, but thanks in no small part to Barber, he had a negative public-approval rating by the end of the summer of 2013, and his numbers stayed underwater until he lost to Cooper. \u201cYou could paint a piece of cardboard beige and watch it dry and that would be more interesting to Democratic-base voters than Roy Cooper,\u201d says the G.O.P. consultant Felts. \u201cBarber and the Moral Monday crowd gave them a reason to be excited, to be active and to vote.\u201dBarber\u2019s influence transcended electoral politics, reaching business leaders as well. Unlike in other Southern states, North Carolina\u2019s business leaders were generally a moderating influence, until the 2010 Republican takeover. \u201cA lot of people in the North Carolina business community over the last few years have spent a lot of time lobbying the legislature on corporate tax, unemployment and workers\u2019 compensation,\u201d Cooper complained to me, \u201cand we\u2019ve gotten away from the business community truly using political capital to have the legislature invest in education.\u201d Even H.B. 2 was initially greeted with conspicuous silence by North Carolina\u2019s Chamber of Commerce \u2014 most likely because, in addition to preventing city and county governments from enacting nondiscrimination ordinances, the legislation also prohibited municipalities from setting minimum-wage standards for private employers and limited how people could sue for discrimination in state court.But Barber and his movement changed the political norms in North Carolina, to the point that business leaders started to feel sheepish about their rumspringa of deregulation and tax cuts and began distancing themselves from G.O.P. policies. The H.B. 2 debacle, in particular, brought the business community and North Carolina Democrats more into alignment, so much so that Cooper outraised McCrory by almost $8 million during the 2016 campaign. Some Republicans now accuse Cooper of underhandedly fighting to keep the H.B. 2 issue alive during the campaign by privately encouraging Democrats in the General Assembly to thwart any attempts to fix the law. \u201cThere were efforts by the then-attorney general and his campaign to sabotage any potential compromises throughout the process,\u201d McCrory told me, \u201cbecause it was working to their political advantage in both fund-raising and surveys.\u201d (Cooper\u2019s office denies this.)In the meantime, Cooper, hamstrung as he is by the General Assembly, has managed to maneuver his way to a handful of quiet victories. In April, he successfully thwarted a Republican attempt to shrink the state\u2019s Court of Appeals, and thus tip its partisan balance in the G.O.P.\u2019s favor. And the United States Supreme Court decided in May, on a technicality engineered by Cooper, to refuse to hear an appeal of a lower-court ruling that struck down North Carolina\u2019s restrictive voting law. He\u2019s spearheading the Democrats\u2019 efforts to win enough legislative seats in the 2018 election to end the G.O.P.\u2019s supermajorities so that, as he puts it, his vetoes won\u2019t be automatically overridden and he will have \u201cleverage to negotiate.\u201d But Cooper knows that eventually he\u2019s going to need bigger accomplishments to satisfy the grass-roots crusaders who helped put him in office. His H.B. 2 compromise has made that task even more urgent. \u201cCooper did the right thing as governor,\u201d Paul Shumaker, a veteran North Carolina Republican strategist, says. \u201cHe did not do the right thing as a politician.\u201dThe bet that North Carolina Democrats are making \u2014 one that national Democrats will undoubtedly be paying attention to before the 2020 presidential race \u2014 is that, rather than fight Republican extremism with the Democratic equivalent, the surest way to nudge North Carolina from purple to blue is to make a low-key politician like Cooper, a consensus-seeker even where there\u2019s no consensus to be had, their party\u2019s standard-bearer.But it\u2019s hard to see how he could persuade his antagonists on either the right or the left to stand down, convinced as they both are that they represent their hotly contested state\u2019s future. \u201cI think North Carolina is a red state,\u201d Hise told me, \u201cand I think we\u2019re on trend to have an even more conservative party.\u201d Barber and the movement he has built, meanwhile, won\u2019t be satisfied if the same old Democratic Party simply takes the G.O.P.\u2019s place. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Well, movements need to learn how to compromise,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cThe problem with compromise, if you look at the three-fifths compromise and a whole lot of compromises down through history, is that compromise has been bad.\u201d Cooper longs to return North Carolina to its status as \u201ca beacon in the South.\u201d But, for now, his \u2014 and his state\u2019s \u2014 most pressing challenge may be simply finding a way to make it less of a cautionary tale.Jason Zengerle is a contributing writer for the magazine and the political correspondent for GQ.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secrecy Surrounding Senate Health Bill Raises Alarms in Both Parties", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As they draft legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senate Republican leaders are aiming to transform large sections of the American health care system without a single hearing on their bill and without a formal, open drafting session.That has created an air of distrust and concern \u2014 on and off Capitol Hill, with Democrats but also with Republicans.\u201cI\u2019ve said from Day 1, and I\u2019ll say it again,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cThe process is better if you do it in public, and that people get buy-in along the way and understand what\u2019s going on. Obviously, that\u2019s not the route that is being taken.\u201dThe secrecy surrounding the Senate measure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is remarkable \u2014 at least for a health care measure this consequential.In 1993, President Bill Clinton empowered the first lady, Hillary Clinton, to assemble health care legislation in private, with input from a group of more than 500 experts. That approach won scathing reviews from Republican lawmakers and others shut out of the deliberations. But it took place at the White House, not in Congress. Once the Clintons\u2019 health plan reached Capitol Hill, it died in the public spotlight.Republican leaders this week defended their actions.\u201cLook, we\u2019ve been dealing with this issue for seven years,\u201d said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing.\u201dMr. McConnell said there had been \u201cgazillions of hearings on this subject\u201d over the years \u2014 a less-than-precise tabulation that offered little comfort to Democrats who want hearings held now, in this particular year, on the contents of this particular bill.Now Democrats say they would love to read the Republicans\u2019 repeal bill, but cannot do so because Republicans have not exposed their handiwork to public inspection.\u201cThey\u2019re ashamed of the bill,\u201d the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said. \u201cIf they liked the bill, they\u2019d have brass bands marching down the middle of small-town America saying what a great bill it is. But they know it isn\u2019t.\u201dThe Senate\u2019s decisions could have huge implications: Health care represents about one-sixth of the American economy, and about 20 million people have gained insurance under the 2010 health law, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement.In theory, the bill-writing process is open to any of the 52 Republican senators, but few seem to have a clear, coherent picture of what will be in the legislation.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, offered a hint of the same frustration felt by Democrats seeking more information about the bill.\u201cI come from a manufacturing background,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019ve solved a lot of problems. It starts with information. Seems like around here, the last step is getting information, which doesn\u2019t seem to be necessarily the most effective process.\u201dAt a Senate hearing on Thursday, Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, said that he also had not seen the Senate bill.The Senate bill is likely to phase out the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion more slowly than the House version. It is also expected to include larger tax credits to help older Americans buy health insurance.The legislation will be considered in the Senate under an expedited procedure that precludes a Democratic filibuster and allows passage by a simple majority. But, Republicans say, Democrats will still be able to offer numerous amendments once the bill is on the Senate floor.Senate Republican leaders evidently think their back-room approach gives them the best chance to devise a health care bill that can squeak through the Senate, given their narrow majority and the policy differences in their conference.However Republicans feel about their coming bill \u2014 and they are far more comfortable criticizing the Affordable Care Act than talking up the virtues of their still-incomplete replacement \u2014 the process playing out in the Senate is quite different from the way Democrats went about passing the Affordable Care Act.The Senate health committee approved its version in July 2009 after considering hundreds of amendments over 13 days. The Senate Finance Committee cleared its version in October 2009, after more than a year of hearings, round-table discussions and other spadework. A group of Democrats and Republicans from the Finance Committee had met for months behind closed doors, trying \u2014 but ultimately failing \u2014 to draft bipartisan legislation.The full Senate passed the Affordable Care Act on Dec. 24, 2009, on the 25th consecutive day of floor debate.While much of the Affordable Care Act was written in the open, some important provisions were hashed out in private, just before the Senate vote, by Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was then the majority leader.Republicans complained bitterly at the time, and Democrats threw those complaints back at them this week.\u201cThis massive piece of legislation that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy is being written behind closed doors, without input from anyone, in an effort to jam it past not only the Senate but the American people,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in December 2009, using words that could be spoken by any Democrat today.The repeal efforts this year have moved much faster, though not as quickly as Mr. Trump or Republican leaders might have hoped.Asked this week about the Senate bill, Mr. Paul replied, \u201cHave you seen it?\u201dMr. Paul said he had no plans to bring out the copy machine again, but he suggested that the Senate\u2019s current course left something to be desired. \u201cMy preference would be a more open process in committees,\u201d he said, \u201cwith hearings and people on both sides.\u201dIn February, the Senate health committee held a hearing on stabilizing the individual insurance market. But since the House passed its repeal bill and the focus shifted to the other side of the Capitol, Senate Republicans have done their work out of public view.Since then, Republican senators have shared bits and pieces of the ideas being mulled in their private lunches and meetings.Asked his level of comfort with the process, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, cut off a reporter before he could finish his sentence. \u201cNone,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a divided caucus,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cI listen avidly at lunch as we go over the same arguments over and over and over again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With M.T.A. in Need of a Boss, Cuomo May Finally Pick One. Or Two.", "Date": "2017-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs New York City\u2019s subway system descends toward crisis, raising concerns that it is regressing to its grim past, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is without a permanent leader.The governor appeared poised to elevate Veronique Hakim, the authority\u2019s interim executive director, to the top job, but now there is a new political wrinkle: He may push to separate the chairman and chief executive positions into two jobs during the final weeks of the legislative session in Albany.The possibility has prompted concerns that Mr. Cuomo is trying to exert even more control over the agency and weaken its board\u2019s independence. It has also reignited a long-running rumor that he might appoint his combative former top aide, Lawrence S. Schwartz, as chairman.Transit advocates agree on one thing: The authority needs a permanent leader as soon as possible.\u201cThe governor has serious work to do on the transit system, and he needs a strong, credible leader in that role who can enact a vision for how to fix public transit and bring the public along with it,\u201d said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, said all options should be on the table as the authority determined how to confront its mounting problems.\u201cOur goal is to have the best leadership at the M.T.A. as possible,\u201d Ms. Lever said. \u201cThat process is ongoing, and you shouldn\u2019t believe every rumor you hear.\u201dMs. Hakim was one of two people who interviewed for the job last month. The other person, Patrick J. Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, recently withdrew his name from consideration because of concerns about the role\u2019s being split, according to a person who is familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss it publicly.\u201cThere\u2019s a level of outside control being exerted over the M.T.A. that is unprecedented, and it seems likely that splitting the roles is intended to strengthen that outside control,\u201d said James E. Vitiello, a board member from Dutchess County. \u201cThe problem with that is that it focuses efforts on short-term, high-visibility work over the less-visible, more difficult and lengthy work that is required to keep the various systems viable long term.\u201dOthers argue that because Mr. Cuomo, who has come under attack from angry subway riders, has recently taken responsibility for fixing the system, he should be able to form the leadership team he wants.\u201cNothing is more important than the governor putting his personal commitment and energy into the M.T.A. and the related infrastructure issues facing the region,\u201d said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group. \u201cWhatever management structure works to keep him engaged and makes him feel like he has the talent and leadership he needs to achieve the objectives we all have for a great system \u2014 it\u2019s basically his decision.\u201dStill, Mr. Schwartz could be a contentious choice. When he served as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s secretary, Mr. Schwartz was known as an aggressive enforcer. Splitting the jobs would require legislative approval, though it\u2019s unclear how the new positions would be structured or who would be responsible for naming the leaders.The last two chairmen, Mr. Prendergast and Joseph J. Lhota, have praised Ms. Hakim, who spent more than two decades at the authority before serving as New Jersey Transit\u2019s executive director for a year and a half.\u201cIn light of everything that\u2019s going on at the M.T.A., I think it\u2019s important that it get a permanent leader,\u201d Mr. Lhota said. \u201cI think Ronnie is a great choice to run the operations day to day.\u201dIn 2008, Mr. Ravitch ran a commission that recommended the authority return to having a full-time chairman who also ran the agency. Mr. Cuomo is exerting influence over the agency, but the governor has said little about how he would pay for expensive plans to upgrade the systems, Mr. Ravitch said.\u201cIf he wants to control the M.T.A., then he has to take responsibility for it,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said. \u201cAnd he has to tell us how he\u2019s going to finance it in detail.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Cardinal and Aide to Pope Is Charged With Sexual Assault", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Australia\u2019s senior Roman Catholic prelate, and one of Pope Francis\u2019 top advisers, has been charged with sexual assault, the police in the Australian state of Victoria said on Thursday.The prelate, Cardinal George Pell, became the highest-ranking Vatican official in recent years to face criminal charges involving accusations of sexual offenses. The case will test the credibility of Francis\u2019 initiatives to foster greater accountability after abuse scandals that have shaken the church around the world.\u201cCardinal Pell has been charged on summons, and he is required to appear at the Melbourne Magistrates\u2019 Court\u201d on July 18, Shane Patton, the deputy police commissioner, said at a news conference.The charges were served on the cardinal\u2019s legal representatives in Melbourne. Commissioner Patton said there were multiple complainants but refused to provide further details about them, including their ages.\u201cThe process and procedures that are being followed in the charging of Cardinal Pell have been the same that have been applied in a whole range of historical sex offenses, whenever we investigate them,\u201d Commissioner Patton added. \u201cCardinal Pell has been treated the same as anyone else.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d just like to restate my innocence,\u201d the cardinal, 76, said in Rome last month after the police in Australia confirmed that they were considering charges against him. \u201cI stand by everything I\u2019ve said at the Royal Commission and in other places.\u201dIn a statement Thursday morning, the Archdiocese of Sydney said that the cardinal had been informed of the charges and that \u201che has again strenuously denied all allegations.\u201d\u201cCardinal Pell will return to Australia, as soon as possible, to clear his name following advice and approval by his doctors who will also advise on his travel arrangements,\u201d the statement said, adding, \u201cHe said he is looking forward to his day in court and will defend the charges vigorously.\u201dIt is rare for a cardinal, a prince of the church, to be accused of sexual abuse, though one of the most notorious cases involved Cardinal Hans Hermann Gro\u00ebr of Vienna, who resigned in 1995 over accusations that were deemed credible by his successor.The detectives were part of a task force charged with investigating allegations of abuse that arose from a parliamentary inquiry in Victoria into the abuse of children, as well as the Royal Commission\u2019s hearings.Vivian Waller, a lawyer who has represented abuse victims, said her firm had been approached by a small number of people who had made allegations involving Cardinal Pell. \u201cEither those people have already gone to police, or we\u2019ve referred them to police,\u201d Ms. Waller said.Cardinal Pell testified via video from a Rome hotel in 2016 to the commission about the church\u2019s handling of the sexual abuse cases. \u201cI\u2019m not here to defend the indefensible,\u201d he said, calling the abuses a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the church.News reports that the Australian police were weighing abuse charges against the cardinal came on May 17, days after the release of a book, \u201cCardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell,\u201d by Louise Milligan.Ms. Milligan, a reporter for Australia\u2019s ABC network, spent more than two years covering the Royal Commission.Ms. Milligan said that she had interviewed the cardinal\u2019s accusers for more than a year and that the accusations covered several decades. Some episodes were said to have occurred at a pool in Ballarat, a city in Victoria where the cardinal was born and where he returned after being ordained as a priest in Rome.Laurie Goodstein contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Staples to Sell for $6.9 Billion, and Its New Owner Has an Uphill Battle", "Date": "2017-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs online shopping claims ever more casualties, Staples, a mainstay of office supplies, has agreed to sell itself to a private equity firm.The deal is the latest instance of a once-prominent name in retailing being laid low by the powerful forces reshaping how people shop (in other words: Amazon).Yet Sycamore is acquiring a company that is squarely in decline. Sales and gross profits at Staples have fallen for each of the last four full years. At the same time, the company has been shrinking the number of stores it operates.\u201cWe also compete with online retailers such as Amazon.com, mass merchants such as Walmart and Target, warehouse clubs such as Costco, computer and electronics retail stores such as Best Buy,\u201d the company said.Nor did it offer up an especially rosy outlook.\u201cWe are focused on maximizing profitability and reducing risk in our underperforming North American retail and international businesses,\u201d the company said in its annual report, noting that it planned to close about 70 stores in North America this year.Staples\u2019s board and management decided to sell the company after shareholders had essentially lost faith in the business. Shares of the company were trading near $7 earlier this year, having fallen sharply from about $18 a share just two and a half years ago.Investors can take some measure of solace from this deal. Sycamore\u2019s offer of $10.25 a share represents a 20 percent premium over the company\u2019s stock price in early April, before initial reports of a deal to sell the company lifted shares.\u201cStaples\u2019 board believes that this process has led to a transaction which is in the best interests of our stockholders, as well as Staples and its employees,\u201d Robert Sulentic, the company\u2019s chairman, said in a statement.Staples and Sycamore declined to make executives available for interviews on Wednesday.For a business on the wane, Staples still sells huge volumes of paper, printer cartridges and electronics. It reported $18.2 billion in revenue last year, down from $21.1 billion five years ago.And for a company that is closely associated with big-box stores, Staples sells a minority of its goods at bricks-and-mortar locations. Some $10.6 billion of its sales are delivered, compared with about $6.6 billion sold in stores. That suggests that even as stores close and consumers shop online, Staples has a large and potentially profitable opportunity.For those reasons, the company was an ideal target for a leveraged buyout.What\u2019s more, Staples has very little debt, just about $1 billion in total. That healthy balance sheet will mean Sycamore \u2014 which will borrow much of the money it needs to fund its buyout \u2014 will not have to overload the company with a crushing debt burden.A consortium of banks including UBS, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Canada, Jefferies, Wells Fargo Bank and Fifth Third Bank are providing financing. The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, is expected to close by the end of the year.Ultimately, however, Sycamore will have to figure out what to do with Staples.\u201cDeclining traffic, escalating leases and sluggish consumer spending have made it very difficult to support the debt load that often comes with private equity acquisitions,\u201d Liz Dunn, chief executive of Pro4ma, a retail analytics software company, said in an email. \u201cStaples\u2019 position as an industry leader provides some cover from retail\u2019s meltdown, but there remains too many stores in almost every sector of retail, and office products are hardly immune from disruptive trends.\u201dIf Sycamore follows a traditional private equity playbook, it is expected to have an easy time squeezing out costs, streamlining operations and issuing special dividends that enrich the firm and its limited partners.And there are other potential deals that could help strengthen Staples.One option could be to try to revive a merger with Office Depot. That deal was among a number of prominent mergers that were met with opposition in the last years of the Obama administration.Executives and bankers are betting that the Trump administration will take a more business-friendly approach to antitrust review. But with a dearth of big mergers and acquisitions so far in President Trump\u2019s tenure, that belief has not been tested. This deal is the largest buyout of the year in the United States.Whatever it does with Staples, Sycamore may have a hard time returning the company to the public markets. Investors who have lost faith in Staples today would need a drastic change in perspective to buy shares in the same company a few years from now. Instead, Sycamore may try to sell Staples to a different private equity firm, or a strategic buyer like Walmart.For Staples\u2019s chief executive, Shira Goodman, the sale to Sycamore caps a short tenure in charge. She was installed as interim chief executive last year after her longtime boss, Ron Sargent, stepped down after failing to complete the Office Depot deal, and her position was later made permanent.Barclays and Morgan Stanley advised Staples, and WilmerHale provided legal advice. Sycamore was advised by Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, and received legal advice from Kirkland & Ellis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California\u2019s \u2018Green Rush\u2019 Takes Hmong Back to Their Opium-Growing Roots", "Date": "2017-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAYFORK, Calif. \u2014 The red and purple opium poppies that his family grew on a mountainside half a world away were filled with an intoxicating, sticky sap that his mother traded for silver coins to feed her children and pay for their escape.Adam Lee smiles at the memory of a childhood in war-torn Laos and voyage to America, where he spent decades adapting to life in big cities.Now 47 years old, Mr. Lee has returned to the mountains \u2014 the Trinity Alps of Northern California \u2014 and to a career farming a different mind-altering crop for his livelihood: marijuana.\u201cWe\u2019ve got big dreams,\u201d Mr. Lee said from a hilltop overlooking his marijuana farm.Mr. Lee is part of a diaspora of about 1,000 ethnic Hmong families who have come to this remote and relatively poor corner of California to grow marijuana.California is home to the largest population of Hmong in the United States, with nearly 100,000, and most initially settled in the Central Valley. Over the last decade, many have moved north, and others from around the country are migrating to this part of California to take advantage of the growing marijuana trade.They are a small slice of what has become a huge industry across the state. In Trinity County, they are reinvigorating a struggling, rural area that was losing population.The legalization of recreational marijuana in November set off a so-called green rush in California, which has been a center for cannabis-growing for decades. Like the gold miners who scoured the same Northern California hills 150 years ago, marijuana entrepreneurs have come hoping to gain great fortunes.Many in the state see marijuana farming as a commercial opportunity, but for the Hmong, many of whom struggled to assimilate in California in the early years, it is also a chance to return to their farming roots and rural lifestyle.For some of the older Hmong, who worked as janitors and factory workers when they arrived in America, the bucolic surroundings help soothe the lingering trauma of war and allow them to be among kin and long-lost friends.\u201cIt\u2019s the independence of living free \u2014 you can live off the land,\u201d said You Ping Vang, an ethnic Hmong who was born in the United States and is the founder of Lonestar Trade, a company that sells the marijuana grown here. \u201cThis is the life that they left. They love it.\u201dIn a county that is more than 85 percent white, the Hmong are conspicuous. Their assimilation is still a work in progress, residents say.\u201cWe\u2019ve scrambled to figure out how we can incorporate their traditions,\u201d said Debbie Miller, the superintendent of the Mountain Valley Unified School District, where 30 of the 280 students are Hmong.\u201cWe\u2019ve had declining enrollment for a while, and they\u2019ve brought children to us,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cI hope more of them come.\u201dMai Vue, the founder of Conscious Cannabis Resources, a nonprofit organization that helps Hmong farmers navigate the growing thicket of regulations applied to marijuana growing, estimates that more than 1,500 Hmong live in Trinity County, which has a population of about 13,000.\u201cWhen they first came here eight years ago, they were scared to even go to the grocery store,\u201d Ms. Vue said. \u201cI would go, because my husband was white. It was just fear, I think, on both sides. It was: \u2018This is a small town. Maybe they don\u2019t accept us.\u2019\u201dBut in Trinity, Hmong are gaining acceptance. Last year, a Hmong team won a prize in a prestigious local barbecue competition. At the school holiday pageant, the students put on a Hmong fashion show.In November, Bobbi Chadwick, a farmer, was elected to a seat on the Board of Supervisors under the slogan Unite Trinity, which was understood as a sign of uniting the Hmong and the white population. Ms. Chadwick has befriended her Hmong neighbors, organized a banquet and compared slaughtering techniques.\u201cSix men came to the ranch, and we harvested two hogs and a goat,\u201d Ms. Chadwick said.From the jungles and refugee camps of Southeast Asia, the Hmong came to America starting in 1975, during the Communist takeover of Laos and the fall of Saigon. They arrived impoverished, disoriented by the industrialized society they met and, for the most part, undereducated. They scattered around the country in climates that were foreign to tropical hill dwellers, enduring subzero winters in Minnesota and Wisconsin and the baking heat of California\u2019s Central Valley summers.Mark E. Pfeifer, a scholar of Southeast Asia and the editor of the Hmong Studies Journal, describes the Hmong as a late-blooming immigrant success story, shedding reliance on government assistance and finding niches in the American economy, like Asian restaurants in Michigan and the flower business in Washington State.In 2015, the Census Bureau estimated that 285,000 Hmong were in the United States.In an area here called the Trinity Pines, three mountains connected by a network of uneven dirt roads, the older Hmong have regained a lifestyle familiar to them, farming small plots on steep hillsides.Driving his pickup truck through the Pines, Mr. Vang called out the states where his Hmong neighbors migrated from.\u201cThese guys are from Alaska, and they\u2019re from Arkansas,\u201d Mr. Vang said. \u201cTexas. \u2026 Minnesota. \u2026 He\u2019s from Wisconsin.\u201d\u201cWe were scattered around the United States, north, south, east, west,\u201d the elder Mr. Vang said.Now, at age 61, he is jarred and delighted by random, tearful reunions.

Officials said his home had been under surveillance for the last two weeks.Mr. Martinelli, who was president from 2009 to 2014, is accused of using public funds to spy on about 150 prominent Panamanians, including politicians, union activists and even doctors. The government of his successor, Juan Carlos Varela, began the investigation and in late 2015 ordered Mr. Martinelli\u2019s arrest.But days before the nation\u2019s Supreme Court had issued the arrest warrant, Mr. Martinelli fled the country and responded to the charges against him on Twitter, calling them baseless and part of a political vendetta by Mr. Varela, his former vice president.This month, Mr. Martinelli wrote: \u201cThey wanted to blame everything on me and my family.

{"Headline": "Anbang\u2019s Sales Dry Up in New Challenge for Chinese Insurers", "Date": "2017-06-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Anbang Insurance Group, whose chairman has been detained by the police, has seen its growth come to a screeching halt as Chinese investors who helped fund its meteoric rise prove skittish about a politically connected company that is no longer in Beijing\u2019s good graces.Anbang\u2019s sales of life insurance policies and investment products, an important source of cash, stopped almost completely in April after tumbling sharply in March, according to Chinese government data released on Thursday. Across the insurance industry, sales slowed in April compared with earlier in the year.The weakness follows the government\u2019s crackdown on a sector that is supposed to help families and companies cut their financial risks, but has recently become a hub for rampant financial speculation.Anbang has been the archetype of the industry\u2019s changing favor.Anbang\u2019s rise had been \u201cjust another example of the Wild West capitalism in Chinese finance, where people can go off and do whatever, no matter what their sectors are supposed to be doing,\u201d said David Zweig, the director of the Center on China\u2019s Transnational Relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. \u201cIt starts out by providing a needed service in the economy, but these guys end up just going out of control.\u201dAnbang is now under acute pressure. Its revenue from existing life insurance policies and certain wealth management products was down 88 percent in April compared with the same month the previous year. The rest of the industry was up 4.5 percent in the same period.Yet Anbang also has a big cushion to help sustain the company through tough times.From January through March of this year, Anbang raised three-fifths as much money as it raised all of last year, government data shows. It has maintained a large stockpile of cash after a series of big investments fell apart, including a $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels and Resorts and a deal for a Manhattan office tower with Kushner Companies, the family real estate firm partly owned by Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump and an administration adviser.But Anbang\u2019s latest figures are eye-catching for the opposite reason. Including new kinds of policies and wealth management products, it took in only $218 million in April this year, down from $5.92 billion in the same month last year, the government data on Thursday showed.Earlier investors are also getting nervous now. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t save us, the impact will be no less than the U.S. financial crisis, and those enterprises driven by debt will be involved,\u201d wrote one investor on Chinese social media. \u201cNow, we are betting whether the government will help Anbang or not.\u201dInvestors\u2019 worries \u2014 a major source of Anbang\u2019s troubles \u2014 center on wealth management products, a potentially explosive risk in the country\u2019s financial system.But companies rarely disclose how that money is invested, raising concerns about what could happen to the financial system if they sour. Fearing a source of instability among the masses, Beijing has moved to limit growth in the products.By that point, Anbang was already in trouble. Questions about Anbang\u2019s financial strength had begun circulating on social media in China in March and April, as Chinese officials publicly raised questions about sales of wealth management products by some insurers.If the drop in revenue is steep enough, Anbang could eventually be forced to liquidate some assets. A big factor will be what happens with its existing policies and investment products.Anbang\u2019s annual report provides little information on the monthly tempo at which its previously issued investments are maturing. The company might need to pay them out if they are not rolled over into further investments with the company. The company\u2019s policies do have very stiff penalties on early redemption to discourage holders from turning them in early for cash.Anbang could raise money by selling some of its investments, but that could take time.It has been an active investor in Western hedge funds, in addition to making outright acquisitions of overseas companies. And those terms tend to impose severe limits on Anbang\u2019s ability to ask for its money back quickly.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherSui-lee Wee contributed reporting from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Democrats and the Losing Politics of Contempt", "Date": "2017-06-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAron Nimzowitsch, among the chess greats of his day, didn\u2019t take well to losing badly. Knowing that he was about to be beaten by an inferior opponent in a 1925 tournament, he jumped on the table and yelled, \u201cAgainst this idiot I have to lose?\u201dDemocrats must know the feeling.There are many ways to interpret \u2014 and overinterpret \u2014 Democrat Jon Ossoff\u2019s not-so-narrow loss on Tuesday to Republican Karen Handel in the race for Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. It\u2019s been in Republican hands nearly 40 years. Tom Price, who vacated the seat to become secretary of Health and Human Services, won last November by more than 20 points. The district is nearly 70 percent white and relatively affluent. This was always going to be an uphill climb for any Democrat, even one as fresh and ideologically moderate as Ossoff.Then again, this election was supposed to be for Democrats approximately what Scott Brown\u2019s 2010 Senate victory in Massachusetts was for Republicans: the first ripple of a midterm wave, in a state dominated by the other party, prompted by an overreaching incumbent president bent on radical health care reform.Whatever else might be said about the race, Democrats didn\u2019t lose for lack of political talent, campaign financing and organization or enthusiasm among their base. They lost because of their brand.That contempt may be justified. But in politics, contempt had better not be visible. Voters notice.Whatever their misgivings about Trump, those Republicans weren\u2019t about to give Nancy Pelosi the satisfaction of a national victory. Contemporary liberalism now expresses itself chiefly in the language of self-affirmation and moral censure: of being the party of the higher-minded; of affixing the suffix \u201cphobe\u201d to millions of people who don\u2019t appreciate being described as bigots.It\u2019s intolerable. It\u2019s why so many well-educated Republicans who find nothing to admire in the president\u2019s dyspeptic boorishness find even less to like in his opponents\u2019 snickering censoriousness. It\u2019s why a political strategy by Democrats that seeks to turn every local race into a referendum on Trump is likely to fail.One temptation Democrats would be smart to avoid is to see Ossoff\u2019s loss as evidence that the party needs to move further left, on the theory that not enough of the base showed up to vote. In fact, turnout for Ossoff was extraordinary for a special election. And nominating more progressive candidates isn\u2019t likely to solve the contempt problem, at least with voters not yet in sync with progressive orthodoxies on coal, guns or gender-neutral bathrooms.Democrats may also want to reconsider the wisdom of pursuing, and hyping, the investigation into Russia\u2019s election meddling as a means of re-litigating last year\u2019s election. Maybe Robert Mueller will uncover evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, or otherwise catch the president in a lie under oath.But the longer the investigation proceeds without finding convincing evidence of malfeasance, the likelier Americans will draw the conclusion that Trump is right to call the investigation a witch hunt and begin to sympathize with him. Nobody likes a Javert. It happened for Bill Clinton in 1998 in his duel with Ken Starr.Speaking of the 42nd president, many are the charges that can be laid at his feet, but contempt for half of all Americans was never one of them. Whatever happened to the party of the president who was centrist, cheerful, liked Americans just as they are \u2014 and left the party in far better shape than Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama?The Georgia election will quickly sink down the memory hole. But the lessons to Democrats for how not to run against Trump and an America that, like it or not, he represents, are there for all to see.Advertisement"}

It challenges the mostly negative depictions of Nero relayed by Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio \u2014 ancient fake news, as it were \u2014 with the portrait of a more nuanced antihero, who was thwarted from pursuing what his heart really desired: a life declaiming poetry and song.\u201cHe\u2019s a bipolar Nero,\u201d Giorgio Adamo, who plays the athletic and tuneful protagonist of the musical, explained at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cThis Nero is very fresh, modern, he filters a pop-rock personality that anyone can understand.\u201dThe performances are mostly sung in English, except on Saturdays, when they are sung in Italian.Ernesto Migliacci, the production\u2019s artistic director, suggested that Nero himself would have loved the idea of the musical on the Palatine. \u201cIn this case, pop means popular, for the people, and Nero was for the people,\u201d he said. So the controversy over using the Palatine falls flat \u201cwhen it comes to his mentality,\u201d he added.Despite the criticisms, Francesco Prosperetti, the superintendent of Rome\u2019s archaeological sites, explained in the show\u2019s program that events like the musical \u201cenhanced the archaeological site,\u201d and in this case drew people to an often neglected area of the Palatine, \u201cmaking it attractive for visitors again.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to hear,\u201d said Sister Rosalba, the mother superior here, who confessed, nonetheless, that she found some tunes catchy.Musical considerations aside, Sister Rosalba said that she was concerned that the loud music might be having an impact on the ancient convent. \u201cThe windows certainly vibrate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not our style to fight back, but I wish there had been some dialogue,\u201d she added, noting that she had not been informed that the musical would be staged in the Palatine. \u201cThis is a beautiful space, and we need to conserve it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Endurance Racers, It\u2019s a Long and Winding Career", "Date": "2017-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJack Gerber of South Africa is the oldest man to start the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. On June 22, 2013, he was 68 years and 110 days old, racing for the AF Corse team. When he came in third in his class, he also became Le Mans\u2019s oldest podium finisher.Gerber is an outlier, of course; few people that age achieve international racing success. But drivers in endurance racing, of which the Le Mans 24-hour race is the crown jewel, have far longer careers than in series like Formula One.Endurance racing is no less physically demanding than Formula One, and drivers in both categories experience high G-forces while cornering because of the downforce generated by each type of car. The flagship LMP1 category (Le Mans Prototype 1) sees cars reaching speeds over 220 miles an hour, about 10 percent slower than a Formula One car.Where Formula One is a sprint event, with about 20 two-hour races per year, the World Endurance Championship (W.E.C.) is a series of marathons, with a season of eight six-hour races and the 24 hour Le Mans showpiece.Both categories demand stamina, aerobic fitness, core strength and mental acuity, but drivers traditionally retire in their mid-30s from Formula One, while the other series embraces age as fundamental to experience.At Le Mans, age and experience are key for cars and drivers, and are used to help categorize man and machine. While a Grand Prix will see similar cars built to the same formula of regulations and with comparable power and speeds, endurance racing embraces a variety of classes of car, with members of each category competing among themselves \u2014 races within the race.The headline fight is in the LMP1 class, a big-budget battle of varying power philosophies and design between Toyota and Porsche, while in LMP2 the mandated engine type reduces costs and opens the field to a range of entrants not affiliated with a manufacturer. The GT, or Grand Tourer, categories are divided into pro- and am classes, and it is here that the likes of Ford, Aston Martin and Ferrari enter their sports cars.Drivers are similarly classified, with professionals and amateurs sharing track time in the same car. Endurance races typically see several drivers sharing driving duties, each responsible for a stint or stints behind the wheel. Amateur drivers, often called gentlemen drivers, will often finance smaller teams, working alongside a professional racer and improving their skills.To ensure that these gentlemen drivers were given seat time in the teams they funded, rules were introduced limiting the number of professional drivers allowed in certain classes. This has created an environment in which it is in the interests of teams to open up their cars to wealthy and passionate amateurs, and has had the side effect of increasing the age range of Le Mans entrants.But the career longevity of endurance racing, which takes a long-term view of its drivers not found in Formula One, is not restricted to the amateur racers. Mark Webber had a long career driving for the Red Bull Racing grand prix team, and then drove for Porsche in the W.E.C. after his Formula One career was over.\u201cFormula One\u2019s a bit more cutthroat,\u201d Webber said. \u201cIf you\u2019re two-tenths off for a few years, then it\u2019s all over. In sports cars you can drive for a lot longer. It\u2019s more team-orientated. It\u2019s less individual than Formula One.\u201cThe manufacturers believe that when you invest in someone in sports car racing, that investment, sometimes it\u2019s a bit of a slow burn to get the investment back as an individual, as a driver, culturally, how they settle in the team; all of these things. It\u2019s an investment you have to lay down. There is no patience for that in F1. Zero.\u201dThat lack of patience has seen the W.E.C. field find room for many former Formula One drivers, those who have retired in their mid-30s and those who lost their seats.One driver who went the other way is Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, a three-time Le Mans winner who briefly raced for the Caterham F1 team in 2014, 12 years after an unsuccessful test with the Jaguar Formula One team.\u201cYou have to be a big team player, put your ego on the side,\u201d Lotterer said of the W.E.C. \u201cIn F1, it\u2019s like war against everyone. Here you have to be mates with your three drivers. You don\u2019t have to try to beat them. You work together and develop the car. You have to be a brand ambassador as well. There are a lot of boxes to tick, and I don\u2019t think you find them so easily. It takes time to develop them.\u201cI think it\u2019s not easy for top manufacturers to find drivers that tick off all the boxes. Endurance, at the moment, you have to do sprint with zero mistakes. Le Mans is one race. It\u2019s not like a Formula One championship where you have 20 races.\u201dAndreas Seidl, team principal of the Porsche LMP1 team, is aware that for some drivers, the W.E.C. is a Plan B when Formula One is out of reach.\u201cIt depends on the options the drivers have,\u201d Seidl said. \u201cFormula One, it\u2019s the pinnacle for drivers, no question. But once \u2014 or depending on how \u2014 their careers go, the business we are doing is obviously coming straight after F1 for these guys. It\u2019s a very attractive championship, very attractive cars, highly complex cars, a very competitive grid. That makes it attractive for them.\u201dJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez, a former star of the World Touring Car Championship and a current Toyota LMP1 driver, looked beyond the Formula One dream.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about having a longer career,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about knowing that there is life after Formula One. Everything for a driver is Formula One, and it was for me. At one time it was an objective and a dream.\u201d But he said he is sure he enjoys the W.E.C. much more now than he probably would have enjoyed being in Formula One.\u201cThere is always an option,\u201d he said. \u201cLife is not finished when Formula One is finished. There are still many series, many very nice cars to drive.\u201dGraeme Lowdon, former sporting director of the Manor Racing Formula One team and now head of the CEFC Manor TRS Racing team in LMP2, says the two disciplines require different skills.\u201cInside the cockpit in endurance racing, experience is really quite important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is such a challenge, in particular the long endurance races \u2014 Le Mans, for example \u2014 it really is something else. It is the greatest challenge going for teams and drivers as a one-off race. There\u2019s nothing else quite like it.\u201cFrom a team point of view, what we try and do is put together a positive mix of experience and speed. We have tried to do things a little bit differently and have brought a lot of ex-F1 drivers\u201d into the W.E.C. in the last season and a half.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re used to dealing with those sort of drivers, and we\u2019re used to dealing with the strengths and the weaknesses,\u201d Lowdon said. \u201cIt\u2019s so different from single-seaters and requires a different skill set altogether.\u201dKarun Chandhok, a former Formula One driver, has some experience of endurance racing. For him, career longevity in sports-car racing is simple: It\u2019s a numbers game.\u201cThe turnover rate in Formula One is so high, and there\u2019s an excess of supply rather than demand,\u201d Chandhok said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got so many drivers coming through from GP2, from GP3 and F3. There are only 20 seats. There are less and less seats available.\u201dHe said there were more seats available in endurance racing, so drivers are able to prolong their careers.\u201cIn sports car racing, there\u2019s a much bigger pool and opportunity, and therefore you can prolong your career,\u201d Chandhok said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite simple: There\u2019s just more availability of seats.\u201dThis year, the youngest driver on the Le Mans grid will be 17-year-old Phillip Hanson, who will share driving duties with Chandhok and Nigel Moore for Tockwith Motorsports\u2019 Ligier JSP217 in the LMP2 class.The oldest driver this year is 65-year-old Mark Patterson.

{"Headline": "A Kenyan Pursuit: Perfecting the Chicken Dish Kuku Paka", "Date": "2017-06-20", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The downpour stopped, so Kirti Patel decided to hold the dinner party on her balcony, with its views of colossal flowering trees and construction that had stalled for the rainy season. Pink vines of bougainvillea were in bloom, and the raw scent of ginger and garlic was in the air.The centerpiece of the meal was Ms. Patel\u2019s labor-intensive rendition of kuku paka, a coconut-chicken dish with roots about 300 miles east of her home, in the city of Mombasa.For centuries, that port on the Indian Ocean was a hub for immigrants, many from other parts of East Africa, the Middle East and India. Kuku paka is a product of the diverse influences that shaped Kenya\u2019s coastal cuisine, and today it is craved and recreated in home kitchens and restaurants all over the country, and beyond.The dish seems simple: chicken on the bone, in a sauce of spiced coconut milk.But you\u2019ll find the chicken cooked in a number of ways \u2014 grilled over charcoal, or steamed with aromatics, or braised. That sauce can be pale and soupy, or dark and glossy. It can be mild and easygoing, or it can prickle with chiles so your eyes fill with tears.Some cooks will add corn on the cob, potatoes or halved hard-boiled eggs to the mix. Others crowd the sauce with meat and nothing else.It\u2019s a dish that welcomes tinkering, but every kuku paka is a love letter to coconut, its fat and its sweetness, the way it can make so many other flavors shine without losing its own. And everything in that coconut sauce seems a bit more glamorous than it did before, even a chicken leg.Ms. Patel and her husband, Anil Patel, raised their two children in Nairobi, driving to Mombasa for family vacations by the beach, bringing home the flavors of the coast like a keepsake. Kuku paka, which has been part of her culinary repertoire for decades, is both celebratory and nostalgic.She found what she needed at Fruity Fruits, a produce market that almost seemed to be showing off the city\u2019s vast range of excellent, year-round ingredients. Back in her kitchen, Ms. Patel split open a few coconuts. She grated the white flesh and pressed the mass to make coconut milk, setting aside the sweet, cloudy water to braise the chicken.Once the milk reduced a little, Ms. Patel added the braised meat and let it all bubble together. When the sauce was creamy, thick with finely ground cashews, and the leanest pieces of meat were tender, she threw cilantro and fried onions over the top and set the dish out beside a basket of mandazi, deep-fried yeasted buns still warm from the fryer.As a dozen guests ate, a pile of clean chicken bones grew at the center of Ms. Patel\u2019s table.\u201cFor Kenyans who are more inland, this dish is an occasion,\u201d she said, noting its richness. \u201cWe make it only from time to time.\u201dWhen Ms. Adagala does make it, she braises the chicken in coconut, tinted with turmeric, and serves it over hot rice, or with a stack of supple chapati. She also likes it with ugali, the plainly delicious boiled cornmeal that, unlike kuku paka, is an everyday pleasure.She adapted it from a Kenyan-Indian immigrant who ran a restaurant in England. He slashed the meat as if preparing it for the tandoor, Ms. Jaffrey said, and roasted it in a hot oven to order.Kuku paka isn\u2019t constrained by hard rules, but there are patterns in its variations. \u201cThere should always be a touch of sourness,\u201d Ms. Jaffrey said, \u201cand the heat of green chiles.\u201dThis sourness often comes from a squeeze of lemon, but Agnes Kalyonge, a caterer and recipe developer in Nairobi, slips in a spoonful of tamarind pulp instead.She said she wanted to replicate the flavors of a kuku paka she had tried on the coast, but improve on it.So she added the step of brining the meat in apple cider vinegar, to season it right through. While many sauces begin with frying onion, and a paste of ginger, garlic and green chiles, Ms. Kalyonge simmered the aromatics raw in the coconut milk, and let them mellow slowly in the fatty, reducing milk, stirring the pan almost constantly.The name kuku paka is an abbreviation for kuku wa kupaka, Swahili that translates roughly as chicken in sauce. But Ms. Kalyonge said original versions of kuku paka always called for that chicken to be grilled.You can\u2019t argue with the smoky flavors that come from browning chicken slowly, over charcoal. It lends the finished dish the umami-rich notes of barbecue, and evokes the grills that were fired up on the coast a century ago, as kuku paka hopped from kitchen to kitchen, edited and revised in each.Ms. Kalyonge first cooks the chicken gently, wrapped in foil on the charcoal grill. Then she takes out the meat and sets it back on the grate, uncovered, to crisp the skin and to stripe each piece in so many shades of dark brown.\u201cThat extra step that we take, before finishing it off in coconut sauce,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is what makes it Kenyan.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

But Mr. Sears also said that this cutback is usually temporary, and once an election is over, consumers return to their usual spending patterns.On the flip side, some data indicates that inbound tourism to the United States is down: For example, the app Foursquare, which analyzes the locations of more than 50 million global users a month, found that international tourism to leisure locations in the United States decreased 11 percent between October 2016 and March 2017, compared with the same period the year before.More Americans may be traveling come summer, but where exactly are they going?Here, five popular vacation destinations for summer 2017.Indagare has a 30 percent increase in trip bookings to Croatia for travel this summer, compared with summer 2016, and Expedia.com has seen air ticket demand to the country double from last summer.
